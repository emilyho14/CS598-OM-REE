16wkv9h,Should I go work for TikTok in Bay Area?,"Advices for TikTok design offer!

I have a critical decision to make in terms of my career.

I recently get an offer from TikTok of Senior level designer. I have 4 years experience work in a big US hardware company in design. And the background is fit that team in TikTok. The offer will raise 100% of my current salary and promises fill my green card from day 1.

But,
I have lots of concerns:
First, I will be the only designer in team, and will wear multiple hats of product and program manager, researcher, and visual / feature designer’s work content.
I will have 0 work life balance in my imaginations…
The culture in team can be rough. My team is all Chinese engineers (majority male) and my manager would be Tech lead… basically no design manager at all, I will manage myself. 
The green card process can be slow, and company can be banned… due to political issues.
I felt like it’s a good opportunity to practice work in a startup format fast pace company. But I also can fail. 

Could someone can help me with that? What should I do? Should I accept the offer or should I choose other options, like other big companies or stay in current.

Hello. I need some urgent advice. I’m a compsci bachelor currently doing my masters in comp sci as well. I’ll be graduating in May 2024. I have just started doing leet code. Not good with data structures. Did one full stack project in my undergrad and that’s it. I’m genuinely worried what’s next for me in the future. I know the job market right now sucks. I’m thinking of switching to networking. I do love programming but I’m an international masters student. And I feel like i can’t afford to lose time in job search. I have a lot of people for referrals in the networking sphere. So I’m thinking if I should stick to programming or just go with networking.

16wjpld,I don’t know what I should study.,"I F (18) have been wondering about my job for a while. I have always had an interest in clinical medicine, criminology, theatre, dance choreography (I have done dance since I was 4), law in general, cosmetology (nails, hair etc.) and teaching. 

I was an A student in everything except Sport (I did participate but it was very obvious of the blatant favouritism) and I was in the highest classes I could be in for each subject. I took electives such as Japanese, STEM and art.

I am really not sure what path I should pursue as I know I could go for a medical or law pathway, but the arts have always interested me (I play Piano, Violin and I sing).

16wewt3,Feeling trapped due to past experience. How can I pivot?,"Hi there! I'm in a bit of a pickle and not sure where to go from here. Any advice is greatly appreciated. 

I cross-posted this with /r/marketing, but thought there might be some more broad career advice from here.   
Alright, so first, context:   
I've been in the same social media coordiantor role for about 3 years now - it is my first corporate job. I was promoted out of the call center from an internship which I pushed for to be created. My role did not exist before me - my original boss advocated for it to be instated. In total, I've been with this company for 7 years. 

&#x200B;

When I started, my job was firmly under Public Relations then we transitioned to being under a Creative manager and now this year, we've been moved under a Growth Marketing manager. While I was under a Creative manager, there was little to no emphasis on tracking or stats. The primary focus of my job was supporting our social media manager in creating quality organic content and ensuring our brand voice was carried through in all content. I also had some copywriting, customer care management, and influencer/ambassador management responsibilities.   


Now, with this new transition to being firmly in marketing, my job has switched to being almost entirely focused on tracking, stats, and ""defining the value"" of organic social media. I've found this frustrating, as has our social media manager who's made these transitions with me, and my new manager hasn't provided any resources to get us up to speed with what they're asking of us. My new boss also manages paid social media and digital display - so our organic objectives often feel like an afterthought or an irritation to her. My team also doesn't really receive positive feedback anymore - only criticism.   
With all of that in mind, I really want to expand my skillset and not feel so trapped in the PR/Creative experience I've gained from the past 2 years. When I started this position I was in school for Journalism, then pivoted to Public Relations, because that was what I was already doing at work. Now that I'm firmly in marketing, I feel woefully unprepared with my education.   


I know I've shot myself in the foot by staying at the same company for so long - I should've been job hopping like everyone else does - but there were certain benefits with this company that I really didn't want to give up. I still don't, but I'm realizing the error I've made by sticking around so long and if I need to leave to grow then it is what it is.   
Should I just completely pivot and start applying to entry-level positions at another company? Is there certification or courses that would be helpful? Is all of my past experience moot if I'm interested in developing as a marketer? Have I totally ruined my job prospects by staying at a company for so long?  


Again, any advice would be greatly appreciated.  


TL;DR: I've been in a role for 3 years that has rapidly changed this year and my previous experience has left me unprepared for my new objectives. I feel trapped due to my previous experience not preparing me to be a marketer - but I've found it more interesting than what I was doing before and want to continue developing in this direction. What are some paths forward that I might not be seeing?",Expensive-Garbage,3,1.0,0,1696100573,2023-09-30 19:02:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16wewt3/feeling_trapped_due_to_past_experience_how_can_i/,9,2023

16wdmyc,How to deal with someone reporting me for something petty?,"I don’t know how to better word the title. I’m a level 1 researcher leading an entire lab- beyond my job role but I have a lot of experience in that space. My manager had a meeting with my on Friday and said she received feedback from a female that I called her “stupid” or something along the lines of “I can’t believe she doesn’t know how to XYZ”. I was genuinely shocked because I don’t talk like that at work to anyone directly. I also don’t really look down on anyone I work with. It’s a very good company with a very good talent pool. My manager could have just been paraphrasing but the person said she wanted to go to HR for harassment. This is the first time I’ve ever received feedback on this issue, nobody has ever really told me to discontinue bad behavior like she mentioned, and I don’t think I continuously talk like that for it to be harassment. My manager very clearly did not seem to believe it was a me issue and more of a her issue but she told me to just be careful with what I say. I was very distraught and I was in tears because I really don’t want anyone to feel that they are stupid but more importantly, I don’t think I did what my manager described in any sense. My manager told me to not stop being myself and she sort of hinted at a promotion by saying “Please don’t let this ruin your Friday. [Colleague Level 4] thinks very very highly of you. [Another Colleague Level 4] thinks very very highly of you. And I think very highly of you. I have very good news for you at the end of the year but I cannot say anything I have to keep my mouth shut.” 

I thanked my manager for giving me the feedback and I told her that I was shocked to hear this and please let her know that I’m sorry and I don’t know what I said but please tell her that I’m sorry she felt she couldn’t come to me and talk to me about it. My manager indicated that the person said she didn’t come to talk to me about it and decided to escalate right away so it was a very weird case. I was just very confused by the whole thing but that was the end of the conversation with my manager.  

I was trying to figure out who it was. I genuinely had no idea. The only person I can think of is this Level 2 researcher, Z, who just transferred into my lab. There were major disagreements between her and one of my Level 3 colleagues who just do things in the lab differently. After I finished crying, I went to the lab to work. Z is in the lab. I was curious to see how she would react to me. Since I was taking care of the lab and training her, I figured I would check up with her to see how things are going for the upcoming experiment. From my interaction, I immediately knew it was her. She looked uncomfortable talking to me, was not open to learning how to properly shut down the system after I offered to show her, and she left abruptly without saying bye. I figure now I should probably be more careful around her because I really don’t know what she interprets and misconstrues. I know that she had some issues with other women and sort of jealousy but I didn’t think it would be me. I don’t have any problem with her and quite honestly I just want to do my job and go home because I am an executor of my late fathers estate and dealing with so much right now. 

How do I move forward? Do I not talk to her? The system was literally releasing CO2 in the room and I want to teach her how to properly shut off the system but she wasn’t open to learning. It makes me not want to teach or talk to her but just do things myself.",OrganizationOk6572,0,0.5,6,1696097419,2023-09-30 18:10:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16wdmyc/how_to_deal_with_someone_reporting_me_for/,9,2023
16wdhd2,How do I network to get an Executive Assistant position where I work?,"I recently started working for a large healthcare chain, and I will have the freedom to apply internally for a different position in July 2024. (This is because they have a one year rule for allowing new hires to move departments. I find this reasonable.)

I am only interested in pursuing a career in administration. I have zero interest in ever doing anything clinical because I'd never be able to complete the degree/coursework required. I'm in my mid 30's and I can only understand business math. My current role involves patient Check-in and Check-out. I do have HR experience and I've been an Administrative Assistant in the past for different companies. My short term goal is to wait a year and then apply for an Executive Assistant position internally (this position opens up pretty often because the company is still growing). I have a BA in English. 

Since I'm getting older and I can't really afford to keep wasting time being rejected even though I have experience and a degree, I need to know how I can network ahead of time to get this role. I'm unable to naturally meet and connect with the right people because I'm working in one of the company's specialty practices. I would need a reason to reach out to someone through email or Teams to express my interest in joining their department. I'm worried that if I do this it will seem weird or awkward to them since it would be coming out of nowhere. 

For anyone who has been in my position, what was your approach? I don't even know where to start. I have talked to my direct supervisor about my interest in moving into administration, but they didn't have a lot to say and it wasn't really helpful for me.

16wcx5c,Resources for Navigating Career Transition,"**I am gathering resources to help me navigate a career transition. Some of my background and things I'm thinking about:**

I've been working in the niche fields of ministry (hospital chaplain) and higher education, which had me engaged in content areas I'm interested in, but did not put me into workflows or work environments that were particularly life-giving. These jobs also did not compensate me well.

**I'm not drawn to any industry in particular; rather, I just want to use my analytical, problem-solving mind, as well as interpersonal skills to effectively work as part of a team. I want to use my skills, have a good work environment, and get compensated well (I'm used to making sub-40k, so really, my expectations are modest).**

My sense is that this is still fairly broad, and so I feel like I need to narrow in and learn what sorts of jobs would be a good fit. I'd be willing to follow-through on some STEM-professional track (e.g. data analyst), but I know that that would likely require more education, or more experience, anyhow. **I have a B.A. in Mathematics, Philosophy; and a Master of Divinity.**

I believe there are kinds of jobs that are emerging in the info-technocratic economy, in overtly 'tech' industries (which are often newer, and seem to have slightly different corporate structures), but also in plenty of other fields, that don't so neatly follow the standard taxonomy of professionalization, and so they're jobs I've never heard of, or don't know how to search for. I don't know this for sure, and because I've been in such niche fields and positions, I haven't had much contact with these other worlds of work. 

Which brings me to **My Main Ask:** **Does anyone here know of any online resources that could inform me about possible career paths, and help me connect my own skills/experience with them? Even to just gain a greater understanding of what's out there?**

I know I have to start getting into the weeds, reaching out to professionals in fields that look remotely interesting, but I also want to work efficiently, and not follow every thread in this vast ocean.

But I don't even understand what I want out of life. I see so many people everyday from working on the road doing construction or people wearing formal clothes like suits going to big cooperate business for their job while some chill at home doing remote work. It seems like everybody sorta figured out what kind of work they like to do. Some people work at retail despite they may hate it but have a roadmap on what to do. Some didn't get education and just stayed at one company eventually climbed that ladder of opportunities all the way to management. Some have completely switched their career paths after COVID or if they felt burned out. Those who worked labor jobs switched their path to office based jobs. While others did the opposite. Life feels so confusing, there are endless careers to look into and so many ways to make money. But I feel like I'm just wasting time and can't up with a decision. Already 3 years passed, haven't taken any classes for 1 years now. Don't feel internally passionate about current studying because I'm always doubting whether I'll make good money or will this career path give me more opportunities down the road.

16wag9o,Maximizing my earning potential for 5-10 years in the future,"I'm currently a solo parent of two teenagers, and my work is fairly flexible and just about covers our expenses. I want to maximize my time with the kids, make sure the younger one does his homework, etc., and be available for them until they leave for college... at which point I hope to be able to ramp up by career, if my elder care obligations will allow it. I'm currently working as an office manager/admin, and can work some more technical stuff into my office manager role.

I've taken several online classes through EdX. I'm interested in working in something technical, possibly data analytics/science, supply chain, or something in IT. Project Management is another possibility I'm thinking about. 

I figure I can do the equivalent of 2-3 substantial university courses a year, let's say a total of 10-12. With the goal of gaining skills to maximize earning potential, given that I'm an older woman who will probably have to work mostly remotely, which of these would you prioritize? 

* Basic undergraduate math: Calculus, Statistics, Linear Algebra, maybe more.
* Computer science: Python programming, SQL and database stuff, etc.
* More technical office skills: Excel (advanced stuff), website design, etc.
* Project Management: Six Sigma, Google project management certificate, something else? 
* Supply chain
* general knowledge in renewable energy transition (an area I would like to work in)

Anything else? What's likely to be reasonably in-demand in 5-10 years, and get me into a career with an above-average salary? There's just so much out there and I'm always chasing the latest squirrel to cross my path.

16w97en,I feel disappointed in manager’s leadership. How should I handle myself moving forward?,"I am a graphic designer (F 24) and a couple months ago we hired a new studio manager. Because he has no background in graphic design, most of his duties revolve around project management. We work in a very fast paced environment, so it’s important that our task management software is utilized correctly. I have had to go over “Due Dates” with my manager multiple times because he will forget to update a project’s due date after certain project stages. When I try to give him feedback, he gets defensive and makes up excuses, or invalidates what I’ve said to him. My other coworker agrees with me that it’s necessary to point these things out to him, but because of my coworker’s more laid back personality, it’s usually me who speaks up.

Yesterday I had my quarterly review with my manager, and I started the review by saying “I don’t feel like my voice is getting heard” and he asked “Really?” And I responded “yes” and he was silent for a beat and then continues going over the rest of my review, glossing over what I had just told him. Completely illustrated the point. Besides feeling uterly disappointed, I feel like I have no one to turn to. My manager’s supervisor, the general manager, doesn’t interact with our team very much, and has probably been hearing harsh assessments of me based off of what my manager has told him. 

In my review, one of the reasons I was only given a partial raise instead of a full raise was because I show signs of “pushback.” I was surprised to hear this because all of my last reviews have said that Im always willing to help. I asked my manager what “pushback” meant and he said he didn’t know, it was something the general manager had mentioned to him. I am shocked because the general manager has no involvement with our day to day tasks. I’m also shocked that when asked, my manager had no clue what it meant. If it’s that big of a reason to effect my pay, I would think it would be his responsibility to know. I asked to set up a meeting with both of these supervisors to see if I can gain clarity on my pushback. That will be on Tuesday. 

How do I move forward? Should I voice my disappointment in leadership, or do I stop advocating for myself as to not risk getting labeled “problematic”?",AccomplishedBear8472,5,0.7300000190734863,7,1696086338,2023-09-30 15:05:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16w97en/i_feel_disappointed_in_managers_leadership_how/,9,2023
16w8uf1,Is it normal to not feel enthusiastic about college and “skilled” jobs.,"I (22M) left my warehouse job that I enjoyed to go to college full-time for an electronics engineering tech degree (2 year degree). I just felt pressured by my parents and by society to get a degree and do “skilled” labor. It felt like a loser for not going to college if I had the opportunity to. 

The warehouse job suited my personality I feel like. I’m probably autistic, have social anxiety, and like to be active. I didn’t really have to talk to anyone, not even managers. I worked hard and did a good job. I was never tired of the job and during our busy season I had no problem working 60 hour work weeks. It was a fast paced and physical job that had high turn-over, but I enjoyed it.

So far in college, I’m not that motivated and interested in class or during labs. This career path is not traditional engineering, rather it’s the people who assist them and who build / test their products. So it’s more hands on. But still, I find it hard to sit still and it takes a lot of energy to do mental work. It’s not the major or field of study that is making me feel like this, it’s due to my personality. Ironically, in high school I was a pretty good student. I’ve already done my research to find out that I wouldn’t want to go into the trades either.

16w1cag,Having a side gig that makes good money but that you viscerally hate,"hey guys

I have a side gig which is teaching a foreign language, I have student and classes online. Been doing it for 10 years and it takes my whole Sunday generally. 

I have a 9 to 5 that is going ok as well, getting a new certification and a lot more responsibilities.

The side gig allowed me to make money that always was helpful for travels, buying stuff for the home, for the kids etc. a standard of living I couldn't have had without.

But I came to hate it. Hate teaching. Not that interested in the language and it's culture anymore. Tired of students being lazy and missing classes. 

I want to stop and try something in the fitness industry instead but it would mean being a bit short on money this year.

It's taking a risk vs not taking it

what would you do in my stead ? Thanks

16w1c58,I started a new job but I don't think it suits me. Can you guide me ?,"I'm a 18F and started to work with babies and toddlers. It's a condition in my country to work one year in those places to access an educator school. I basically just take care of the food, cleaning (of spaces and kids) and I play with them sometimes.

They are cute, I truly like children but it feels boring and repetitive. Even looking at the educator, I don't want to be in her place. The yelling because you aren't constantly with them, the horrible parents who try to turn their son into a robot (the dad said ""he's a good little chinese"" implying that he doesn't want his son to be emotional and only the mom is Chinese by the way). The environment is stressful and I don't use my brain.

I don't like authority but I understand that you are never really in the top of the hierarchy and I don't need to, I just don't want to be in the bottom. I'm clever than most people (I'm not Einstein but I understand things faster than the norm) but I don't like to study too much because it DRAINS me very fast. I don't like repetitive things, if the tasks are the same but the element are not, it's fine.

It's easy in my country to evoluate in a job and I thought about working in a laboratory in biology or chemistry. But I'm bit scared that I won't understand important things. I'm a very literal person and I like clear and simple task. Using big words just to say:""observe this thing in the microscope"" is just so annoying.

I'm an introvert but don't mind working with a small group. I don't want to be in a constant rush because I prefer to take time to be sure my job is perfectly made. If I don't work in weekends or at night it's better but in my country it's uncommon and we already work 40h a week.

I currently work at a great company which is allowing me to partner directly with a PM to gain a mentor, experience and hopefully transition into this role officially in the future. The job is hybrid, I need to be in the office 1 day a week.

The only issue is that I really want to move back to my home city (100% remote not possible). I'm over the town I'm in, been here for 10 years. A lot of close friends have since left. Feeling bummed out.

If I were to move, I would end up applying to jobs aligned with my experience (marketing) since I don't have enough experience yet in my dream PM role. 

I feel trapped. I wish I had the freedom to move anywhere without losing my career momentum.

Is it all just a matter of what I value more, career opportunity or my life outside work?

She briefly worked in a different job she thought she could make into a career, but she ended up hating it after a couple months and went back to her old retail job.

I KNOW she wants to get out of retail, but she seems to think she’s stuck because she’s getting older and has basically not done any other work. I don’t think she knows what she is capable of, and I think her experience trying another job has made her anxious about trying anything else and “failing” again.

I was doing alright in the beginning, but I am now constantly struggling to deliver things on time, seem to miss lots of details that affect delivery. All of these things require high conscientiousness and although I do believe you can learn to be like that, it doesn't come naturally as I've never been a type A person and my big 5 test said I have moderate to low conscientiousness. I have even considered getting tested for ADHD as I'm not even great at using management tools to keep on top of everything.

16vpa2s,Need advice on what career to go into. Not sure what to do with my degree.,"Currently pursuing an undergrad degree in neurophysiology and am concerned that I'll have a difficult time finding a career with it. In my early days of college I didn't do much research on what I wanted to so with my life and picked a major on a subject that I was interested in rather than one that will provide a decent career with good pay. 

The program I'm doing is specifically to train students for medical school and because of this I just assumed that working in medicine would be the only thing I would be able to do. However, after looking into it and talking to several people I have come to the harsh truth that medicine is really screwed up and according to a lot of people, not worth going into. Because of this, I'm reluctant to work in medicine. (To clarify, I was considering mid-level practitioner positions rather than MD.)  
Keep in mind that I would have no problem at all with going to grad school. At this point I think I would prefer a master's program due the financial burden of a PhD/doctorate but I'm very open to any ideas. 

Although my degree is specifically focused on physiology, it's still a bio degree and thus I would imagine that it would be difficult to find something that would pay well and yield a stable career.   
In looking for a career I'm trying to prioritize income. A six-figure salary is what I really want, but obviously job satisfaction is a huge factor as well. No amount of money would be worth sitting at a desk for 40 hours a week.  

If anybody has any good ideas on what career I can/should go into, I would really appreciate any advice. 

Additionally, I would be willing to work in a field unrelated to my degree, but I would imagine that would be quite difficult. I've heard of people getting great jobs in industries completely different from the subject of their education, which is pretty inspiring to me. Any advice on this would be great as well. 

Feel free to ask me any questions. Thank you in advance to any responses.

16vp6bz,"Got hired for my graphic design experience, now company wants me to hide that's what I'm here for. Is this job going to hurt my career or is the situation salvageable?","Hi everyone! I could really use some advice, as I seriously don't know how to deal with this situation.

**TLDR:** Job posting said ""Jr Graphic Designer"", now company wants me to call myself a ""Jr Growth Analyst who will be providing support with the communication-related tasks within the Sales department"" and avoid letting the rest of the company know what my activities/skills actually are. The pay and work conditions are good, but I'm scared this job will hurt my future because it seems like there's no room for promotion or development as a designer, and wondering if there's a way to make this work, a positive side that I'm not seeing, or if I should look for another job already...

**Expanded explanation:** After a few years of freelance work and paid internships in graphic design, I recently applied to a ""Jr Graphic Designer"" job posting. During the interview process, they let me know this position would be within the Sales department, I would be the only designer on the team, and I would be responsible for creating new material as well as editing the ones developed by the marketing department as needed. It was a 40 day interview process, and the job title in every post, email and Google Meet title was always ""Jr Graphic Designer"". 

When the documentation started to come in after I got hired, I noticed my official title was suddenly  ""Jr Growth Analyst"" and during the first 2 weeks I was always getting introduced as ""Jr Growth Analyst"". Today my boss told me that there was some friction between our department and marketing when they came up with the idea of hiring someone for this position, so now I should be careful and always introduce myself as ""an analyst who will be providing support with the communication-related tasks"". I should also avoid letting other teams and specially marketing know I'm creating new material, and instead should always say that I'm ""just looking for some preexisting files to tweak a little bit"".

As someone who was really excited at the prospect of moving forward a little professionally, I'm VERY worried this job might end up hurting my career. If I can't be open about my activities and skills, can't seek out or rely on senior designers for guidance, can't really network and have to limit the scope of my job to low-complexity tasks lest marketing sniffs out my real purpose, I feel like this job may end up being a stifling dead end with no chance of getting promoted OR developing the skills needed to advance in my field and career.

I've been feeling so frustrated I honestly can't tell if my fears are right and I should exit stage left ASAP or if there's a way to salvage this situation somehow.

Anyone have any advice or have gone through a similar experience? 😕",KobolDownUnder,1,1.0,6,1696025741,2023-09-29 22:15:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16vp6bz/got_hired_for_my_graphic_design_experience_now/,9,2023
16vospy,Quit job due to problems with substance abuse - any chance of getting it back?,"I (25F) have been struggling with a pretty gnarly substance abuse problem for the past 3 years. During this time I was able to graduate from college & find a pretty awesome WFH job with good benefits in May of 2022. Unfortunately, shit hit the fan in January of this year. I could no longer function & maintain my double-life. I started messing up more frequently at work & received 2 verbal warnings. I realized how serious things were, & decided to quit the job to focus on my sobriety. The day I quit I was feeling very overwhelmed. I tried looking into FMLA but knew I didn’t qualify, since I hadn’t worked for the company long enough. I called SAMHSA & tried my best to find a solution that would allow me to keep my job & also get clean. In the end, I was so frustrated & at my wit’s end. I was sitting there sobbing uncontrollably, feeling absolutely exasperated. I went ahead and shot out a quick email to both my higher ups essentially telling them I was struggling with some personal issues & needed to resign. I told them my plans of going to an institution to get the help I need, but didn’t specify exactly what I needed help with. Only one of my bosses replied, and he said: “I have received your resignation and understand the lack of advanced notice. I hope you get the help you are seeking and wish you nothing but the best.”

I did end up going to rehab (for the 2nd time lol), but this time I stayed for the full 2 months instead of leaving early. It was a great experience & I’m very glad I went. However, I am still torn up about the job I lost. I absolutely loved the company I worked for. From the way they treated their employees to the chill work environment, everything was perfect. 

So my question is: Would it be weird if I reached out to my higher ups to let them know I’m doing better & looking for a similar job to the one I previously held? How would I even go about phrasing such a thing? I was very good at what I did, the only thing really messing me up (messing my whole life up lbr), was the drugs.

So I've been unemployed for a few months now. A few weeks ago I was contacted from company A, about a remote contract position, went through two interviews and got rejected. So I continued to look for something else and recently got offered an on-site job with company B, that I think has a lot of possible opportunities, and it's full time. 

Today company A called me back asking me if I'd still be interested as the guy they chose didn't work out, but I start at company B next week. Company A pays a little more than company B and is remote but it's only a contract position where as company B is full time. 

I'm thinking about trying to work both as they only overlap by 1 hour but that would leave me with less than 5 hours of sleep. 

Would it be better to go with company A for more money, remote but contract, or company B for less money, on-site, but full time?",HatRevolutionary5365,2,1.0,5,1696023724,2023-09-29 21:42:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16voajn/help/,9,2023

16vmuhq,Boss Shady Dealings -Advice,"Writing this for a friend who doesn't have reddit. I am on mobile so please excuse atrocious formatting and mild errors.

TL;DR at bottom.

Friend, we'll call Bob (not real name) was out of work for 5 weeks and got asked to come work for this guy we'll call DB.  (This story takes place in western North Carolina).

Friend is a fabricator and specialty painter (UV, gel, industrial, etc) and is very good at his job.  Last job was making 19.50/hr working insane hours every week.  His specialty is only used in 4 places on the east coast so it is a very niche field of work.

So DB wanted Bob to come work for him, he had seen  Bob's work and desperately needed someone with his skillset.  He offered him $20/hr starting and $25 after first 2 weeks if he is as good as he seems.  DB job offer consisted of:  PTO, travel commute bonuses,  increase pay opportunities, 8 hour shifts, and guaranteed 40 hours per week. 

Bob was obviously thrilled because he has a fiance and 2 children and is the breadwinner for the household, and he definitely needs the money.  I did warn him this seemed alil too good to be true.

Monday last week (9/18/23) Bob went in and started working.  He was praised numerous times throughout the week by DB on his level of work including ""you are definitely worth the money and im very impressed by your knowledge"".  Come the end of the week DB tells Bob he will be writing him a check at the end of week 2 since they hadn't done payroll paperwork yet.  Bob asks if they could do a check for each week as his bills were due and he did not have anymore savings left, DB agreed to this and cut him a check for the base hours he worked.  (NOTE: this check did not have OT or the time it took for Bob to go to the parts store and return with items that DB requested he go pick up for the business in Bob's personal vehicle).


This week:
Bob worked everyday same as last week and come today, when he showed DB that he had finished a time critical product DB said ""while it is on my mind, it looks great but I will not be pursuing a need for you any further"" followed by offering to pay Bob under the table if Bob wants to lie to the unemployment office to make some extra money, and DB would call Bob if he wanted/needed him to come paint items in the next couple weeks.  Then asking if Bob wanted to come in Tuesday to help DB pack up the job items Bob had just finished and said he could pay Bob Tuesday after he shipped off the stuff.

Bob told him he kinda needed the money today because his bills were due and they had agreed that he would get paid today.  After Bob told him this DB got a little more defensive and made it seem like Bob was being an inconvenience to him and told him he would write him a check now, and he was only going to pay Bob for 30 hours because that's ""how long I think the Job should have taken you"". (However Bob worked well over 40 hours this week).


So to the advice/help:
What options does Bob have? I thought I had read stories on reddit about people going to state department of labor but unsure if it would work inthis situation.

He is missing (approximately) $450 from check(s) and does not have the ability to pay for a lawyer, so I'm turning to reddit for advice of any sort.


TL;DR
Boss makes promises, underpass person, fires employee but offers to do illegal work under the table if employee lies to Unemployment office.

16vmpr1,What do I ask for? Labor to salary position,"I’m trying not to get my hopes up, but I have an interview Monday for an “operation support” role for the manufacturing company I currently work for. Sounds like it’s a mix of efficiency and process development that works directly with both labor and management, six sigma/lean. I’ve been with this employer for 8 years total and another 2 years in between with a different company. I also only have 10 college credits but a 4.0 GPA. They want someone with actual shop experience that can communicate with other Neanderthals instead of a bunch of office-types. There are 5 “levels” and my years of shop experience qualifies me for a level 3 with a salary range of 56-100k. Literally the qualifications are “9 year’s manufacturing experience, active listener with willingness to learn.” But imposter syndrome is hitting HARD already. At the other company I worked for, a LOT of what I did was running efficiency reports and working with programmers and machinists to improve machine times, reduce scrap and get accurate production numbers, but I also did a lot of program editing myself since we didn’t have support on 2nd shift. At this current job, under our current labor contract, my base pay will be 70-75k by 2026 (currently 56k). But never having been in such an official corporate setting has me terrified and worried that I will lowball myself just from lack of confidence.

It's gotten to the point where even when the day ends all I can think about is work and the anxiety of what I probably messed up on.

16vjkvj,Advice on leaving my current job to join a profitable family business.,"I was recently offered a job joining my FIL small business for a significant salary increase + ownership in the business. He is getting older and no longer wants to put in the hours to run 2 shops. Additionally, another reason to get me to join is to keep the profitable business in the family rather than sell it. He has been able to provide a very comfortable living for his family because of his business and something I would also like to do.

However, his business is very niche and nothing I ever saw myself doing. I have no previos knowledge or experience in it and does not align with my current job. I am 29 yo and currently work in marketing remotely for a tech company with great PTO and benefits. Becoming essentially a part owner of the business would require me to relocate, go into work with minimal days off/pto and take on other responsibilities of an owner I probably haven’t thought of. Relocating is not the biggest concern because my wife and I are planning to start a family soon and would most likely move closer to family at some point. But the change in work life balance does scare me.

Lastly, I have a great relationship with my FIL and realize that working together can go one of two ways. It can be great OR cause friction if we ever disagree, or worst case scenario doesn’t work out and I decide to leave. 

There is no timeline on this offer, however, the earlier I commit and the more time I have to learn the business.

16vj95e,Insurance professionals - Should I accept this offer?,"Hi all, 

I am looking for some insurance career advice. I am a 26 year old male living in NYC. I went to a semi-decent undergrad institution (top 60 US News) and made the poor decision of majoring in Political Science (a mentor told me to study what I am passionate about instead of what will lead to a high paying career. If I could go back in time I would shoot him).   I did decently well graduating with a 3.75 gpa, but the job search during my final semester was ROUGH. I ended up accepting a job as a real estate paralegal for big law firm in NYC (making about $75k OTE) thinking that I might want to go to law school. I HATED it and almost everyone I worked with (a lot of lawyers are elitist snobs, go figure). I didn't mind the grind culture, but the work was unbelievably tedious and boring and I found it hard to justify our ridiculously high billing rates.  I guess I am glad I had the experience because I almost made the decision to go straight through to law school without knowing what being a lawyer is really like, which would have been the most expensive mistake I ever made. 

If you are curious, I know $75k is relatively low for NYC, but I live with roommates and generally am pretty frugal so I have made it work so far. I even managed to pay off all of my loans. 

Anyway, I've been at the firm for about a year and a half and then started looking for new job. I wanted to make the shift into a more business oriented role so I applied to a ton of consulting positions, mostly because the job descriptions usually said they were open to social science and humanities majors, I know consultants make a lot of money, and I know that consulting opens a lot of doors in the future. I had almost no luck. I had a few interviews, but they led nowhere. The only consulting job that gave me an offer was extremely small, seemed a little shady, and only offered me a salary of $50k ($60k ote). Given the high cost of living in NYC, I couldn't afford to take a pay cut like that.  I was beginning to give up hope and was considering quitting my job and moving back home with my parents in defeat with no plan (maybe to eventually apply to grad school or something). Then I accidently applied to a job at a transactional insurance brokerage company. I had some really great interviews and liked all of the people I interviewed with. They gave me an offer of 78k base with OTE 100k.  I am debating on whether or not to accept. 

On one hand it seems like a great opportunity, gives me a way to stay in NYC (I love it here), and appears to offer a decent income trajectory over the next 2-3 years. Working with M&A transactions seems interesting and could give me exposure to some of the hard skills that currently don't reflect in my professional profile given my political science/legal background (think finance, sales, business strategy). 

On the other hand, it seems like the work is in tandem with law (I would be working with a lot of attorneys/former attorneys) and is generally a pretty niche industry. I have no idea how experience in insurance is perceived by other industries and DON'T want to trap myself in the insurance energy for the rest of my career.

To be honest, I am not exactly sure what I want to do with my life but as of now my eventual goal is to work in operations in an industry I find interesting (clean energy, management consulting, finance, or geopolitical consulting/risk) . I don't want to trap myself in the insurance industry for the rest of my career. No shade to insurance - I have the utmost respect for brokers/underwriters/claims reps etc., I just don't see that as a permanent path for myself personally.

Should I accept? What are the exit opportunities like? Will it position me well to get into finance/consulting/clean energy should I decide to leave in 3 or so years? Do you know of anyone who has successfully made a transition like that?

If not, do you think going back to business school after working there for a few years would be a good move?

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

I got an offer from a transactional insurance company and am debating whether or not to accept since I don't want to be trapped in insurance industry.

It just always felt like I was trying something new and it just didn’t fit my passions.

I’ve always prided myself on my ability to make meaningful relationships with the customers of the various places I’ve worked, I am able to juggle a high volume of tasks at a time, and it’s hard to get me rattled when I’m moving. I just crave more…
I’m hoping someone here has maybe been in my predicament of being stuck in the “service industry cyclone” and not seeing a career path outside of that that you could excel in.

Do you think it’s legal and doable that I mention the 2 years I spent in the host university on my CV and LinkedIn as a simple exchange program without precising that it was a double degree ? Before leaving the host university, I got an enrollment certificate where it s mentioned that I spent 2 years there and I earned 60 credits as a double degree and I withdrawed from this program

16vgxp6,Response to question about relocation,"I had a first round phone screen yesterday for a post-grad job in a different city. HR asked me if I had ""connections"" in the area, and I said no. After the fact, I realized I do, and it was emphasized to me to know why I want to move there because the hiring managers will be asking at the next interview.

&#x200B;

Would it be okay to say to the hiring manager(s) that I want to relocate because I have family in the area and my sorority has a strong alumni network? Honestly, if I was asked, I would say that I thought the recruiter meant the city itself, not the suburbs because I really did think they meant the city itself.

16vgawi,"Employer has been us for a ride, what can I do?","34F, I work at a small-ish company with very well known (also rich and famous) promoters. This is a small fish in their kitty but it's a brand design agency that gets a number of great leads and has strong credentials over 2 decades. 

I've been here since about 15 months. The first 3 months we had a stable and wonderful CEO who had been there through the pandemic. She quit because of personal reasons. The pandemic had caused great stress and she lost her parent during the time. Yet she worked too hard to pull the company together.

Now she left and the promoters hire the worst possible CEO to run the ship with a freehand. He was here for 6 months. In 6 months he burnt through funds, fired a bunch of effective people, forced some to quit, made false promises on paper, hired horrible resources who further did the deed of driving the company to the ground, treated people badly, made people feel like absolute crud. And this is not even going to the depths of it.

A few of us banded together and asked my manager who had worked with the promoters in a previous role to table the issues while requesting action. Their action was putting him on gardening leave. Which means paying him, not marring his reputation and not reassuring anyone internally.

The brought in an MIA interim CEO who is available only when he wants to be. They make reckless decisions like ""honoring"" appraisal without paying us the arrears - effectively reducing our earnings on paper, reducing notice periods of senior employees to 1 month where the norm is 2 or 3 to offer some security, they now are not paying us this month's salary until what they say is the 6th of the coming month (only shared via another helpless employee today not the CEO, nor promoters). Then I get to know that the 6th is not even the real date of payout, it's going to be the 15th.

I have worked very hard to ensure the company converts business in the last few months. Two businesses have come in thanks to my boss and my efforts.

We are both doubling down and going beyond our role (strategy) to now doing strategy, project management and some new business support.

I really want to quit but I don't have a job in hand and I need the money. What do I do?",Front_Bodybuilder_14,1,1.0,0,1696005048,2023-09-29 16:30:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16vgawi/employer_has_been_us_for_a_ride_what_can_i_do/,9,2023

16vegnk,"My Fiancée got her masters, started her residency and realized she hates it, what other career options are available?","I hope I'm in the right subreddit for this situation; apologies if not. I'll dive straight into the issue. My fiancée recently completed her master's program in prosthetics and orthotics, and we moved back to our home state in the Pacific Northwest for her residency. However, she's been increasingly unhappy with her job.  
  
To start, she's not working with the patients she expected, and she's earning only $20 per hour, which is low for our area. What's worse, her company's CEO has been an issue for everyone in the office, to say the least. Recently, they've also piled on more responsibilities, making her handle all the advertising, possibly because she's the only woman on the team.  
  
Recently when some people in the field presented a product to their office that could reduce exposure to toxic materials. The CEO showed no interest and later went on a rant about how he doesn't care if this product saves them more time, because he already has to pay their 8 hours regardless, and it's not his problem if the material they use causes cancer or infertility.  
  
The combination of all this has drained her passion for her career, and she's required to stay in this residency for nearly two years. She's unsure if she can endure it and doubts her ability to get the necessary certifications in such a stressful workplace.  
  
Additionally, I'm the primary earner, and we've just bought a house. While we can manage the mortgage, it'll be challenging if she loses her job. Also, recently she discovered that the clinic previously fired its last female resident for confronting the CEO's disrespectful behavior, and that's introduced a whole new worry into the shitty amalgamation of worries we now have..  
  
Adding to the issue, my workplace is the opposite of her's. My colleagues are supportive, my boss is great, I have the flexibility to work from home, I'm part of a union, and I often have a very light workload. Although my workload may increase over time, I'm only two months into my job.  
  
Lately, she's been considering government jobs, like what I work, as an alternative. Unfortunately, her master's program was very specialized, and most government positions involve office work. I'm unsure how to help her in this situation.  
  
Our current situation requires she keeps working, so I've told her it's probably best she just powers through her residency and hopefully finds a better job in a healthier environment later on. She's skeptical about finding a better job and understandably reluctant to keep going through with this one. I'm hoping someone might have suggestions or ideas to help or offer guidance on what to do here.",Ornsteiner,8,0.8999999761581421,10,1696000771,2023-09-29 15:19:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16vegnk/my_fiancée_got_her_masters_started_her_residency/,9,2023

16v4ac4,Am I overreacting by feeling like I’m being passed over for a promotion?,"I have been at my company for nearly 2 years now and am beginning to feel a bit stagnant in my position. I work in a small department where I have pushed to take on projects and tasks outside the scope of my assigned duties. I find little joy in the main aspect of my position and have come to love the projects I work on. They allow me the freedom to work without supervision and break up what is typically a monotonous day. 

I have voiced many times to leadership that I would love to move towards solely working on projects for our department, and just assumed it was not something they were willing to entertain since nothing ever came of these discussions. Until this week, when in an unrelated conversation, my boss mentioned they posted a job for a project coordinator position in our department. This was the first I had heard of them considering anything like this, and I was honestly a bit upset that it seemed like she has no intention of telling me about this role outside the fact that it happened to come up in conversation in an unrelated meeting. I left the meeting and found the job posting and was shocked to see it had been posted over a week ago and matched to a tee the work I to this day am doing when working on these projects.

For some context, all of my team members and I were hired at the same time. Our non-project work is metrics based and I consistently have been the top performer on our team. I’ve already been feeling over worked and underpaid for what I have been doing for our team. I found out about a year in that I was hired at a lower pay than all of my other coworkers, though I have since received pay increases that puts me slightly above a few of them. 

I’m at somewhat of a loss. I applied to the position, but I feel baffled that I wasn’t offered a promotion as I am already doing this work. Regardless of a promotion though, I still feel confused as to why they didn’t tell me about this role sooner. At this point I feel like I’m better off trying to find a new job. My fear is I’ve done what I always tell myself I won’t which is I’ve made myself too valuable that they won’t promote me out of my current position.

16v2ns4,Choosing between Two Offers,"Context: I am 25 years old. Currently unemployed. I have 3 years of experience in a Finance Rotation Program at a F15 (Exposure to FPA and Material Cost), and 1 year of experience in a Fintech startup (Finance and Treasury). I currently live at home so I have no expenses. Live in a low cost of living area in the EAST COAST (This is important in context of the two offers). Currently studying for GMAT, and plan on attending weekend MBA in the next two years. Made some poor decisions financially where I just don't see myself attending full time program. I received two offers, and I'm absolutely torn between deciding between the two. I'm so grateful to be in this opportunity, especially with the macroeconomic environment that is going on.

* Offer 1 is a High Growth Smaller Semiconductor Company. Sr Finance Analyst Position doing FP&A work.
   * $90K base with 10% annual bonus
   * $40,000 RSU. One-quarter of the RSU will be vested annually over 4 years
   * Fully Remote - based in California
   * Great benefits (Great PTO, healthcare is completely covered by employer, tuition reimbursement, 401k Match 4%)
   * High growth environment, constant acquisitions, means little structure in the day 2 day work.
   * Work long hours, and also being West Coast means I will be working until 8PM-9PM some days.
   * Great company culture, I can tell there will be a lot of guidance and mentorship, well respected team overall and access to a lot of departments.
   * Although the hours are long, the growth path is more stable. I won't be necessarily biting more then I can chew.
   * I would enjoy the work in tech and semiconductors. I have followed this industry since I was in highschooler and it always amazes me.
   * Skills I will develop: Stronger FP&A Skills, Project Management, Communication Skills

&#x200B;

* Offer 2 is EV Startup from a spinoff of a well known Auto company. Product Line Owner (Material Cost technically)
   * $95,000 base with 10% annual bonus
   * Remote to start - Hybrid when they have their office
   * Great benefits
   * Higher risk role. Job responsibilities are borderline management level. Dealing with the P&L of the product, tons of presentations and making investment decisions, tons of exposure to different parts of the organization. Great exposure to the profit center and life line of the business (working on cost).
   * Startup environment so there is little to no direction. Director fully expects me to be able to pick up work. Talking to my family members they believe that to succeed in the role it would require a lot of hours because I will be drinking from the firehose.  I have full faith in my abilities and work ethic, it's because of this level of confidence that I have that I know it will be a lot of work. But the opportunities might be greater with the responsibilities.
   * Working with EV and Startup sounds so exciting and fun, challenging but I feel like I would enjoy the work.
   * Skills I will develop: Presentation skills, Business Case Planning, Strategy, Investment Analysis

The only concerns I have with the 2nd Option is economic implication of working in a ""startup"" environment without a product releasing at all. Could they potentially eliminate department if the economy is bad? Versus working at a Semiconductor company where the industry is a lot more stable and in demand. The other major concern is the responsibilities seem pretty intense. In no way am I subject matter expert in product development / material cost. I am great communicator and great analyst, and it's what got me this far, but the responsibilities do seem pretty daunting and much higher risk. If I continue to struggle for 6-12 months, I am afraid I would have a target on my back or even potentially be fired. But at least I ""failed"" and got great exposure, versus the steady growth at Option 1 which can potentially set me up for more success by laying the foundations.

16v2e3f,Overworked and underappreciated - stay or go?,"Resisting the urge to turn this into a venting session, I'm in a complicated employment situation and will try to split this into bullet points. In short, I was the first person hired on a new initiative at a reputable 1k-2k seat global firm - I got my foot in the door through a family friend, my superior's superior, made significant contributions to the product we were developing and have been there for around 16 months.   
Reasons to leave:  
1 - Since product launch, management has been increasingly out of touch with production and has started ramping up the demands of the job without consideration for the additional strain.   
2 - Production is target based, and relies on allocation of a certain resource that varies in quality. From month to month, it can be several times harder and more labor intensive to meet target, and little is being done to fix this in the systemic way it calls for. My attempts to broach the subject have fallen on deaf ears, and in the last two months the team in two months, our team in 2/3 offices has gone from 14 to 4 as people jump ship. The third office is offshore and people there seem to be more willing to tolerate the working conditions. Management has expressed that targets will increase once we are given access to a new software allegedly meant to help us, despite nobody in production contributing to features or design.   
3 - I previously had much more clout and say on how things were run, but as we expanded and involved more teams my role and input has diminished significantly while the volume of redundant, unproductive paperpushing and bullshit has swollen exponentially.  
4 - I am a contractor, working remotely in a country where the company doesn't have an office. I have no benefits, and as the workload increases I am basically in a prison of sitting in my house alone for 12 hours a day just to meet target, without any office or overtime perks or amenities.  
5 - In July, I experienced an extremely disruptive series of personal events that threw me off balance significantly. I should have probably taken unpaid time off, but I missed my target by 3 units. There was only token sympathy, and I still received outright an outright condescending talking to about what went wrong and how I plan to fix things.   
6 - Because I missed my target that one month (3 units versus the 145 I have produced YTD) I was passed over for a promotion by somebody I trained. He certainly deserves a promotion and I have no hard feelings towards him, but when including the target reductions I had throughout the year to put out fires, he produced 3% more than I did total. I also spent the first 5 months of the year doing everything technically entailed by the promotion (before the position existed) such that, when combined with increased hours, it feels like a demotion - it is humiliating given that I trained most of the team and developed a lot of the earliest practices we do.  
7 - Because of the geographic difference, my 'salary' is about half as much as anyone else on the continent working for the company. Even with a promotion, I wouldn't be making as much as the entry level for my team. I am making okay money in absolute terms, but not relative to the hours Im working.   
8 - I would have only stayed until June of next year at the latest, even with a promotion. Waiting until February for a re-evaluation makes me want to blow my brains out.   
9 - I have applied to 2 jobs I am underqualified for. The first one came with a a very encouraging and thoughtful rejection note, and I had a first interview for the second on Monday and may or may not hear anything. This is encouraging as to my prospects of finding something else.   
10 - My health is deteriorating and I don't have time to do my usual fitness routine (martial arts classes). I am sleep deprived, thinner, and my blood pressure is about 15-20 points too high around the clock. 

Reasons to stay:   
1 - I absolutely do not want to burn the bridge with my family friend. On the one hand, he is a ruthless business man and is liable to understand a calculated departure, but on the other he's made it clear that 'It's a bad look to leave a job before 2 years are up'. He himself was promoted and stepped up to a higher level of oversight, explaining how a lot fell to shit, but he has extremely high expectations. He was a real mentor to me and I'm grateful, but it also feels like he was betting against me when I didn't get this promotion (another reason cited was that I was behind runrate when the decision was made, although I will exceed target this month). It's a coinflip as to whether he would think I'm a quitter or admire the backbone of seeking fortunes elsewhere. He is also a very high ranking exec now and would be a tremendous reference for me  
2 - I don't have a job lined up, and have a pretty unemployable degree. I am worried that the early 'success' I've had in the job search would be nullified by applying as an unemployed individual. On the flipside, I think I'd rather eat a bag of nails than stay around in a 100% corporate setting.   
3 - Bills to pay. Just got a bigger apartment, burned a bunch of cash on my personal crisis. Not a lot of jobs for my level in my area pay that much, except ones I am loath to do.

  
I know there are a lot more points to leave, but maybe the reasons to stay hit harder. Meeting with my manager on Tuesday and thinking of handing in my 2 weeks then, but want to think it through.

16v0x1r,My boss asked me to be an independent contractor. Is the company tanking?,"Long story short, without giving out too much personal info, I don’t think the company I work for is doing well. Budget cuts everywhere in every department. We outsource 60% of our work now. We’re extremely understaffed as is and everyone is overworked to exhaustion.

Last week, my boss asked if I would be willing to stay on board at the same salary but go back to being an independent contractor (I started as an independent contractor and was brought on full time for just about a year now). My company has a strict 5 days a week in office culture, they never allow anyone to WFH. But my boss supposedly is offering me this option because he knows I’m productive while working remote, I strongly prefer working remote, and that it would “benefit the both of us”. 

I’ve been praying for a remote job that pays well for months, and it seems to have fallen in my lap. But I can’t help but think that maybe they’re pushing me out as a contractor to make it easier to fire me when it’s time for serious budget cuts?

16v0bxe,"27-year-old German professional in the music industry, seeking advice on how to advance my career in NYC. What should be my next professional steps?","Hey Everyone!  
I'm looking inspiration and advice from fellow professionals in the music industry we all love so dearly. I'm a German who relocated to NYC in 2021 while I was still pursuing my studies. I won a green card lottery and had to make the move immediately during the pandemic. During my studies, I completed internships at a recording studio here in NYC and a government-owned cultural management agency in Berlin, where I primarily handled musical artists.  
I graduated in September 2022 and, in collaboration with a friend, established a record label. I've been overseeing operations in the US and Canada for a year now. Currently, I'm exploring opportunities to either join a larger label or shift my career trajectory towards becoming a Talent Agent at an agency. I made the decision because my business partner has smaller ambitions and prefers to keep things on a smaller scale.  
Unfortunately, my job applications haven't yielded positive results so far. I suspect it might be due to my perceived risk factor, as I did not graduate from a US university and only have one semester of experience at an US university. Another huge factor that may influence this is the fact that HR may assume my English proficiency isn't at a professional level. However, this isn't the case, as I attended an international school, and all my Bachelor's classes were conducted in English. Do you think these are valid concerns?  
Now, I'd like to seek your advice and professional insights on the best course of action for advancing my career. Which positions do you believe I should target in my job applications? Moreover, do you think it would be worthwhile to return to graduate school and pursue a full degree from a US institution? While I'm open to taking extension classes or pursuing a master's degree, I'm hesitant because the consensus is mostly that experience outweighs education in our business and the return on investment appears minimal given the huge costs.  
I'm looking forward to our responses and genuinely appreciate your guidance and effort.  
Also: I'm always eager to connect and chat with people in the same business or who just share similar interests. Feel free to send me a DM; I'm always up for a chat over a beer or sitting down for a drink or two! ;-)",nezpercezz,0,0.5,0,1695956894,2023-09-29 03:08:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16v0bxe/27yearold_german_professional_in_the_music/,9,2023
16v01g7,"As a politician how can I serve everyone with the same intent, regardless of if they are good or bad people?","As a politician there are many areas that I want to work on. In this specific area I want to help victims of crimes get the proper justice that they deserve. Sometimes if a crime is so awful the proper justice would be to make sure that the criminal receives the death penalty and not in life in prison for their crime.

I find advocating that a criminal receives the death penalty very meaningful and I feel passionate about it when it comes to good victims. However when it comes to bad victims or a situations when there is a large amount of people and there potentially might be bad victims I feel like I can't fully trust my judgment because I fear there might be bad people in the situation.

I feel like right now instead of just looking at certain crimes and figuring out the proper punishment I am using some sort of ""moral authority"" superpower to judge others. I want to figure out how to stop doing this as well.

I find advocating that a criminal receive the death penalty is something that I find meaningful and am passionate about when it comes to good victims. However when it comes to bad victims I am finding it hard to have the same meaning and passion.

Also, I think the issue to is that since I don't know any of the victims I have a fear that some of them might have been bad people so my passion and meaning are going to the wrong people. However even if they are bad how can I serve them like everyone else. I am wondering though how can I stop thinking of victims as good and bad to just be able to help everyone?

Also, how can I stop using my ""moral authority"" superpower to judge others. How can I serve everyone with the same intent regardless of if they are good or bad? How can I stop judging people as good or bad and just help all victims the same way?",SignPaths,0,0.20000000298023224,5,1695956033,2023-09-29 02:53:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16v01g7/as_a_politician_how_can_i_serve_everyone_with_the/,9,2023

16uxuw6,Feeling like a fish out of water in my first job out of college,"Ugh. I don't know if I need advice or if I just need to voice my frustrations anonymously online. 

Basically- I hate my first job out of college. I had graduated without something lined up and this was definitley a choice out of desperation, not because I thought it was the best opportunity for me or because I was super interested in the role. I've been a GIS technician for four months now, but I studied urban planning and had no prior experience with GIS or computer science (I was very upfront about my inexperience in the interview). On paper and in the interview, it seemed like a highly collaborative role with lots of opportunities for reasearch. It also seemed like a good opportunity for me to learn a new skill that might be a useful tool for other jobs later in my career that actually aligned with my interests (housing, policy, transportation design, etc.). the pay was in my desired range so I thought it wouldn't be that bad- I can do something I wasn't planning on doing for a couple years to get started. 

 However, now that I'm in the thick of it- I'm really depressed, and wanting more.  I didn't think I would hate the corporate office environment this much. So much insincerity, so many fake interactions pretending to care how your day is, and I also don't fit in with my team very well (or is it just the phony coworker relations?). It's not that we don't get along- it just seems that its a tight-knit /cliquey group and they don't really make an effort to let the new girl in, even though I really am trying. On top of how sad and drab corporate life is- my job is very very tedious. The bulk of my job is editing polygons and data entry, and no meetings or collaboration. I sit alone in my cubicle (I hate cubicle pens so much too- I cannot focus!), waiting for another email to tell me what to do. This job takes 0 critical thinking and I think they just needed a warm body. Occasionally, I am tasked with more demanding projects involving database management, but I know so little about SQL and coding that I need a lot of handholding, and I feel like a burden to my team.  I'm also not very interested in GIS or continuing my career in GIS, so it makes it that much harder to try and learn the harder stuff.

 Don't get me wrong- I am grateful to have a job at all straight out of college and I would never just up and quit without having something better lined up, but I'm super indecisive about starting my job search before I've hit a year here, and I'm not even sure I'll be getting much valuable experience here or any good resume boosters for the field I actually want to be in. I miss using my brain, I miss expressing my ideas, or having my ideas be heard and valued by my peers. I'm feeling depressed and don't do my hobbies anymore, I just melt into bed after work. I'm agitated and sad more days than not. I can count on one hand how many days I've left work thinking ""That was a good day- I really knocked it out of the ballpark!"". This is my first job and I feel like that makes leaving before a year more understandable- but I also don't know if it'll make an ugly mark on my resume for a while that'll be hard for employers to ignore. 

Whether it's now or later- I want to pivot to housing or policy- and I want to be REMOTE!!!

so- I wanna know, what would you do if you were me? TIA.",ch0ccy_cow,2,1.0,0,1695950033,2023-09-29 01:13:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16uxuw6/feeling_like_a_fish_out_of_water_in_my_first_job/,9,2023
16ux513,I can't use my skills at my current employer or at my past employer,"Good day

I'm a senior full-stacked developer, and my tools are [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core, C#, Blazor, and [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) WebAPI, I left my 3rd employer to move to another employer, they hired me because of my skills but what they aimed for is my experience in [VB.NET](https://VB.NET), which I used during my early years as a software developer, and they want me to maintain and add modules for that project, which the coding of the project is totally messed up, hard to read, hard to maintain, it always took me a long time to debug and fix the project, other developer don't want to touch it because of the complication of reading it. I tried to pitch it to revamp the project, but the management told me that it would take 1 to 2 months before the higher-ups approved it, so I stuck on developing and maintaining this project. fast forward, I was offered by another company to work with them, so I resigned and moved to them.

When I moved to my current employer, I was the only software developer, and the projects were made in [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) MVC 5 and C#, but with AngularJS, a tool that I have no experience with, It is also not indicated in their job description. I have experience using javascript, but still, a pain in the @$$ for a whole 9 months, what I do is update these old projects, with no proper documentation, and most of the projects are lacking features so everything should be done on the back end, which for me is not a good practice, projects are not flexible so we have to adjust it on the back end, process and computation are changing every 6 months or less, so they want me to update system, that causes another problem because it has effects to another process. I'm using OOP, Repository Service Pattern, Dependency Injection, and SOLID Principles on the project that I created, but the old projects that I inherited are using none, and also no unit testing and we don't have a QA for this. I tried to pitch to revamp the projects but my manager told me that we should fix the current systems, we hired a developer who also had no experience in AngularJS, but the projects that they gave to him were for new applications as there were pending new application requests. I tried to pitch to hire a QA, but they told me that we don't have budgets for that. I was also 

Now I'm stuck on using this, and I can't use the skills and practices that I'm now good with. In my free time, I always try to create new project and revamp the old project. but that will eat my time and cannot do my task.

16uqqss,Torn between a job opportunity and my dream career,"Hey all, I (24m) am having a really tough time with this decision and I really need some unbiased advice

Okay so right now i’m quitting my current job that i’ve been at for the last 3 years, custom art framer and store manager @ $17/hr) due to stagnant wages, verbally abusive owners, and poor work/life balance. I accepted a full time position at a tire and alignment shop for $18.75/hr. I was hired as a brake and alignment technician however during the interview, I was kinda just talked at for half an hour before being hired on the spot. I was promised all kinds of performance based raises & bonuses and all of this stuff but i’ll be part time for my first month or two while i’m still in training. I’m supposed to start on the 9th. 

For my entire life, i’ve wanted to be an aircraft mechanic and test pilot. It’s always been my dream job but there are no schools near me and finding a job in the field without experience would be next to impossible, especially when applying for jobs on indeed and seeing that 400 other people also applied for the entry level airport job you want. 

Well, about a week ago, I reached out to a small classic aircraft restoration company and explained my situation and asked if they needed any help around the shop such as cleaning and putting away tools. They said they would love to talk to me and show me around and see what I’m after.

Yesterday, I went and while there, discovered that the owners of the company are actually close family friends and i’ve actually known the company owner my whole life. The founder of the company used to take me flying in a restored p-51 when I was little. Sadly the family friend had passed away a few years ago. After catching up with his wife and being passed onto talk to the head a&p mechanic/shop manager, I was offered a full time job as an A&P apprentice mechanic at $18/hr (i’d be considered as an independent contractor though so i’d pay my own taxes) and my hours worked would count toward my training to test to get my A&P cert. In addition to this, The manager told me that they own a company plane and he is also a CFI and that if I’m serious about this role, he would be more than happy to teach me to fly so long as I’m an employee of his. He knows I got hired at the tire place and told me to take a week to think it over and whatever I decide, if I want to just be a shop hand, or if I want to make a career out of this, to just let him know and he’ll be happy with whatever I choose.

I left completely shocked. Here I was thinking I’d be an extra hand around the shop on my days off, and I left being offered a full time job for just over what I currently make with the opportunity to get my mechanics certificate down the road and could even get my private pilots license. I explained this to my girlfriend (we live together) and she’s very skeptical and thinks I should just work the tire job instead as she thinks it will be more reliable money.

So here I am, going back and forth with taking the opportunity to get trained to work in my dream career field for $18/hr and having to pay my own taxes, or work a job changing tires, something i’m not passionate about, for $18.75 and take no risk.

16uqm3b,What would a career path/progression for an Automotive Project Engineer look like?,"
Im 24 years old with a BEng in Mechanical Engineering and I recently passed the 6 Month mark (probation time) at my current job as a junior project engineer for a major automotive company in Germany. Plan is to move to the US (SF Bay Area) sometime in the next two years with my girlfriend (US citizen).

I really love what I am currently doing and I have a lot of responsibilities as well as a lot of leadership tasks which positions me well for a management position later on (which is what I would prefer). However I am kind of unfamiliar with the timeline I should expect and the roles I can apply to. Moreover, I work mainly in battery systems testing; does that mean all my future roles will have to do with that? How much can I pivot or be flexible when applying to different jobs? Like there are positions where I would fulfil most of the requirements (running large scale projects basically) except the technical knowledge part (like 3 years experience needed in aerospace industry/aerodynamics/ADAS etc.). Am I basically pigeonholed in the Automotive industry now and specifically in Battery System Testing and Validation?

I also eventually want to move into consulting but I dont know when I would be able to do that or how. Eventually i will also be pursuing an MBA but I dont know exactly when. 

Its very annoying because I had always thought finding the first job is the hardest part and then you can just move up the ranks but that doesnt reflect well on your salary since its much better to change jobs if money is important to you and tbh it is important to me.

Any thoughts here from you guys? I know its a very open ended and vague topic and you’d probably need way more info to accurately give me career guidance here but Id be glad to answer any questions here.",thyexorcist,3,1.0,0,1695932845,2023-09-28 20:27:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16uqm3b/what_would_a_career_pathprogression_for_an/,9,2023

16up2m8,pls hlp,"Hello,
This is my first ever Reddit post. Can I cuss on here? Lol anyway..
I (25F) work with a small group of people. I work for a small business so the number of employees is around 4, counting the owners of the business. Additional 2 part timers but they are truly part time. 

Understandably, the owners have been taking a lot of time off. What is not understood though, is the lack of staffing support or preparation for this. 
I recently got a raise. I am equally experienced as my coworkers but NOW that I have added more responsibilities to my plate than my coworkers, I get to make the same amount as them. I am the only girl, just sayin. Not to toot my horn or whatever either but I’m also very good at my job. Our tasks were all equal before that and I’d still say Im making just enough to live off of but not enough to enjoy my life by making plans with this income.

I deal with a debilitating chronic pain issue that I’m currently trying to find answers for. Two of my coworkers recently got hurt. This being said, our coverage sometimes relies on the owners. 

Well they decided to leave town without any notice to us staff and I ended up having to work through my pain, as well as my coworker. We were both willing but it would’ve helped us out if they would’ve at least assisted us more in some way or gave us notice. They even knew my coworker was hurt beforehand and said they’d stick around but dipped out instead. That resulted in me having to do all of the heavy lifting for him for the whole week they were gone and left me with extra tasks that he couldn’t do. Get this though, it was either that or they said we’d be closed for the entire week and again that was with absolutely zero notice. Talk about a heart attack surrounding my bills in that moment. I spoke up and we worked through it so we could still pay our rents, ya know. 

This coworker is very condescending toward me and very bossy. Not to mention just two tads younger. I understand ego in the workplace but I find myself having to completely sacrifice my ego lately. I am the type to speak up but I also like to be methodical about my approach to things. I feel incredibly nervous just writing this and thinking about my anonymity but these are all truths and I have said a lot of this to the people I’m writing about. This is what concerns me, it isn’t making a difference. I go unheard on a regular basis no matter how assertive or sweet I am. 

I called out today because I was sick, giving them a heads up before the sun rose. My boss then proceeds to ask me if I can “tough it out “ because t’s only us 2 scheduled again. I said I was not well and my boss proceeds to ask me if I’m coming in or not. I don’t know what to do, they also see this coworker as someone who does no wrong. I find myself to be the scapegoat or the one people lash out on quite often even though all I want to do is make my money and mind my business.

One day I was scheduled from open to 10 pm. That’s when we close up shop, luckily since I had been there all day the two part time employees came to clean/close. As I’m getting my things ready and getting a couple more tasks done before I leave, my boss shows up out of nowhere to relieve my other two coworkers ???? And told them not to worry, that I will be closing/cleaning instead. I told my boss that I was not pleased with the late notice or lack of respect for my time. This was all just to make the guys feel good so they could leave early which I would support if A. I hadn’t been there all day already and B. If I just had notice or if they would’ve consulted me first. 

I want to leave this job and start something on my own. I feel so undervalued. I could tell you guys stories all day on why I have burnt out here. I’m feeling fear though, I really want to start something of my own or find something that pays as well but I’m struggling with doubt.

16uofhu,Found out my male coworker got a bigger raise,"I work at a vape shop. Family owned and still pretty new. I have two male bosses, one male and one female coworker. 
My male coworker is not the best worker. Comes in on drugs, messes up the register, try’s to “sell” while he’s on the clock, etc
We’re not allowed to smoke delta and I’ve gotten in trouble, but he always has his. 
(all by his own admission. I only know this because he told me)

Don’t get me wrong, I do mess up from time to time but I also pick up extra shifts, show up early, stay late, help the store when I’m off the clock. I’ve brought in shelves to organize the back room and created/organized our workbook, I’m also the reason why everyone makes tips now. 

But the owner loves my male coworker. He wants to invest with him, take him to dinner to meet other business owners and so on. The boss has given him free expensive products just because. 

This is when the problem started:
I recently decorated the store for Halloween. Which means I went to work in the morning,(9 am) then got off work and picked out decorations. 

I had to make sure I stayed within a budget, took hours of my time checking the prices and driving to different stores. When I got back to the store at night, I stayed until 12 am decorating while my male coworker just sat on his phone. 


I went to work and while I was on the clock I was still decorating for my entire shift. I was on my feet for the ENTIRE making sure everything looked nice while also taking care of customers.  


They called me and told me I needed to fix everything so I went BACK to work and stayed to 12 am again after working a morning shift.
 
The boss was there and pulled me into the office and gave me my check and told me from this pay period forward I’m gonna be making 9.50 and hour.(50 cent raise) which I was grateful for. Then he says “don’t tell anyone about what you’re making” which is always a red flag

Well last night me and male coworker were hanging out when we bring up raises, we both lied to each other at first because the boss told both of us not to say anything and then we decided that was bullshit and told each other our new pay rates. 

Im making 9.50$ (50cent raise)
He’s making 10.00$(1 dollar raise)

And I’m upset. I understand that it might be my fault for working above my pay grade. 
But I genuinely like working. I like being busy, and I was hoping that they saw my work ethic and would give me a good raise because of how much I contribute. They’re also a small family owned business so I don’t mind helping them 
 I wasn’t doing this for a raise in the first place but it would’ve been nice to be properly compensated for the work and effort I put into the store. 

And they gave a bigger raise to my male coworker even though he puts in a quarter of my work. He was only working 2 days of the week for the first 2/3months as well. 

How do I go about this? I love this job and they are good bosses, the kind you’d never find again. 
But how do I bring this up without them knowing we’ve talked about our pay. 
Is it appropriate to call this misogyny or work place discrimination?",F_ckingmurked,10,0.6000000238418579,50,1695927767,2023-09-28 19:02:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16uofhu/found_out_my_male_coworker_got_a_bigger_raise/,9,2023
16uocmf,I was misled on commission structure at a new job. What should I do?,"I was just hired at a new company which gives me a base salary plus commission. In the offer, it was my understanding that I would get 10% of products and labor that I sold as long as the gross margin was above 20%. I thought that's cutting it very close for a company to be profitable. After talking to the owner, he said sales usually run a 40% to 55% margin, so it made sense how he can pay me 10%. However I just sold my first job find out that my 10% is based on the margin, not the total sale amount. This is how my offer reads:

> Commission: Direct Sales - 10% of Products/Labor with Gross Profit Margin over 20%. 5% of Products/Labor with Gross Profit Margin <20%. Gross Profit Margin amount means the amount received by the Company from the transaction minus cost of goods sold, labor, deductions and chargebacks as determined by (Company Name Censored) under its standard accounting practices. Items that will not affect gross profit margin are but not limited to damage to customer premises at the negligence of others. No bonus or commission is earned, due or payable under this Agreement unless the Company receives payment during your employment on projects you are responsible for overseeing and has been received prior to final date of work.  


The offer doesn't say ""based on GPM"" or ""of GPM"" it says with. This is either poorly written or intentionally misleading. I'm now realizing I made a decision to go with this company and my commission is essentially going to be half of what I thought it was going to be.

I informed the owner we have an issue and he said we will talk about it tomorrow morning in his office.

The worst part is I declined another offer from another company 3 weeks ago. They were offering a little less pay but far safer choice in terms of lead potential, their establishment in the industry, larger company, etc.

I would love to continue to work for the company I am at but not at this commission rate. I'm thinking about calling the other company to see if the offer is still on the table. On the other hand perhaps I can negotiate with the owner tomorrow morning. I need a job I can't go without one again for any amount of time due to my financial situation.

I don’t get PTO so the company wouldn’t have to pay for my absence, and like I said before, all these trips (minus Thanksgiving weekend) were planned and booked before I started working here and when I wasn’t really sure if I wanted to go back to school, which would have allowed me a more flexible schedule anyways.

16unb79,At a Crossroads,"Last September 2022, I expressed my desire to grow into a Level 5 role on my team. I am an IC4, and an IC5 is considered a senior in my position. At the time, I had been in my role for one year, I'd been an IC4 for 3 years, and with the company for 9 years. I literally started at the bottom and worked up to this point over 9 years.

The promotion periods are March and October. So beginning last September 2022, I began taking on stretch responsibilities both as a result of a growth plan, and even more so due to TMs on my team leaving (IC6, IC5, and IC3).

When the March 2023 promo came around, I asked my TL if I was going to be put up for promo. She said no, I'm not ready, even though I'm already doing more than half of the bullet points of an IC5. Because we were so busy with the short-staff, we didn't have time for the formality of my growth plan and my TL wanted more hands-on coaching with me in certain areas that we didn't achieve.

I was upset at first because I had been taking on stretch responsibilities even though we didn't declare, ""This is a growth opportunity."" I have been growing, I'm a strong worker and very capable, and already going above my IC4 responsibilities.

Despite being upset, I sucked up my pride, restarted the growth plan, and ensured we would have formal meetings, declare growth opportunities, and follow it as closely as possible.

Fast forward, I continue to take on more opportunities and go above and beyond. I execute growth opportunities as given to me by my TL. We continue with a hiring freeze, extremely short-staffed, and I'm doing everything I can to help this team succeed and prove I am ready for an IC5 role. During this time, our only IC5 was promoted to an IC6 in July 2023.

My team finally got approval to hire 4 NEW TMs to help our team this past July 2023. I'm informed by my TL that we are getting 3 new IC4s and one new IC5. I'm a little shocked since she and her leader know I'm on a plan to become IC5. I asked her if I should just apply for that role, and she said I was not ready. I disagreed, silently this time, and trusted the plan and process. At multiple times she assured me I was on the right path for promo and I'd be considered in October 2023.

Now we are fully staffed, I am helping train our IC5 and all our IC4s.

I was put up for promo by my TL, backed by her TL. My promo was denied. ""The company is tightening its belt."" or ""The new org may not allow for two IC5s on this team.""

This is the first time I'm aware of a promo being denied when establishing a personal growth plan (in Workday no less). It seems like every quarterly org meeting my skip-level shares who was promoted and that if anyone wanted to advance their career, leadership would help establish the growth plan and get you there.

Here I am a year later, an IC4 without any assurance that there is any room for growth for me.

I've already decided to leave the company. I just don't know when. I've already begun applying to other jobs. My problem is that I no longer want to give them my time or talent. I've done so much work for them, and I feel this sense of betrayal considering everything that's occurred over the last year, the hard work I've put in, and the assurances I've had along the way.

""It's out of their hands...the eTeam...blah, blah, blah.""

I want to quit, now. But I know it's good to have a job while applying for other jobs. I just can't wrap my head around the idea of continuing to give a part of myself to this company after all this. I know they don't deserve me. 

I know Quiet Quit is an option, but it's somewhat tough on my team because we are a support team. I've also been slotted into a bunch of IC5 responsibilities, under the impression I'd be an IC5, and there is no easy way to back out of them. My TL may begin to stop asking me for some things, but because I am the most tenured person on my team, my peers will ALWAYS rely on me. Also, this isn't my peer's fault. My leadership failed me. And to be fair, I failed myself, because there were so many red flags along the way that I ignored.

I just feel my integrity is at stake here if I continue to give them my time.

16umxob,Career/Studies/Financial advice,"South African looking for some advice form Reddit.
I (23) have a degree in genetics and biochemistry and honours in bioinformatics (data science mixed with bio basically). I paid for my honours with a loan.
I currently work for a software company with an entry level position earning about R20k per month. I live at home so expenses are low but I pay my mom towards the household as she doesn't earn a lot.
I want to work in the biotech/drug discovery industry (possibly overseas) but those positions usually look for a masters in a more coding/stats background. I want to do my masters in data science, specialising in bioinformatics at UCT. I can get a bursary for it.
I think the degree would accelerate my career growth and it's an industry I am passionate about.
So the question I have is how to go about paying off the loan and then studying further. The minimum period for paying off my loan is 2 years. I want to start my masters beginning of 2025 but would have to leave my job and probably wouldn't be able to keep up with the loan repayments. 
The loan is set up where until you start earning and make the switch, yor repayments only pay off the interest and my mom has been covering those until now (I just recently started working).
If I made the switch to paying off the actual loan amount the premiums would go up to about R3600. I could pay it over a longer period (eg 3 years at R2500 per month). 
Should I save up until I start my masters and then pay a lump sum to the loan to lower the repayments? Or maybe try and pay it off over 3 years and save up to pay a lump sum to lower repayments further once I start my masters?
I don't really know anyone who's taken out a student loan and is in a similar situation to ask for advice.",Pielbek420,1,1.0,0,1695924241,2023-09-28 18:04:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16umxob/careerstudiesfinancial_advice/,9,2023
16ulxj2,An honest review of findmyprofession.com,"I wanted to write a quick review to help other people decide whether or not they should sign up with [findmyprofession.com](https://findmyprofession.com).  Please remember this was my own experience yours might be completely different.   


I originally went to [findmyprofession.com](https://findmyprofession.com) for their resume writing and reverse recruiting services,  from the start it was a mess.  The person working on my resume was very nice but  the resume I received was subpar at best, with multiple errors.  Something I was not expecting after spending 2k on this service.  After I requested a re-write and someone else to do my LinkedIn profile I was starting to get hopeful that maybe this was just a one off.  Instead what I got was someone who changed one thing and then vanished.  After two or three weeks,   I can't remember I was finally able to get hold of someone who said she was OOF for a family emergency, by which point I was pretty pissed that no one informed me or took up my case, especially having dealt with the bad resume. When I spoke with the manager Lindsey (recent correspondence below) I was met with a defensive HR response and as I remember no apology, then refunded for the reverse recruitment service without asking me first.  The screenshots referenced below that she sent back was me kindly asking her to play a game with me,  I would post my original resume and the new one, whereby we would see which one received more responses on career-builder and indeed.  

&#x200B;

 Now it's been a few months and again, being hopefull I decided to try once more, hoping things would have changed , and spent $3,999 on their reverse recruiting service only to receive a quick response which you can read below.

Hi Austin,  
How are you? Thanks for sending your information. After reviewing your previous experience with Find My Profession, we have decided that we will not be able to work with you for Reverse Recruiting. As you may remember, there were multiple threats from you regarding damaging our business and we also found that at times, you became verbally abusive. At the time, I decided that it was not in our best interest to continue working with you on the Reverse Recruiting side and refunding you for the service. Once we make that decision, it is for all future orders as well. So, after consulting with the Director of Reverse Recruiting, we will not be moving forward with you as a client. I will process a refund immediately and since you just purchased, it likely won't even hit your account, but it could take up to 10 business days to reflect in your account depending on your bank's policies. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly.  
Thank you,

I am now trying to get a job again. In the past month 30 applications have been sent, and again only a few have replied, and Ive been able to have a couple interviews, but not heard back from any of those yet.

I have severance for the next few months but have been offered an opportunity by my former employer to take a temporary remote position (coordinated through a temp agency) with the partner/client I’d been most recently working with at the company to basically use my expertise a little longer. It sounds like the opportunity is mine if I want it, and they assure me it would not impact severance in any way, so I’d be double-dipping. 

While that does seem like an appealing offer, and could essentially double my pay, it would be only be hourly and likely short term. No guarantee on the terms or number of hours just yet. 

I’m just wondering if there are any clear downsides to this. The only things I can think of is the amount of time it would take away from a job search and potentially losing the ability to utilize unemployed benefits if I need them once my severance runs out.

16uiq16,Is it worth finishing my degree to advance my career?," For some background,  I went to college for three years- two for a general arts & sciences degree at my local community college, and one year for biology. My family decided they would no longer support me when I only had one year left before graduation, and tuition was impossible to cover without a co-sign. was supposed to get my Bachelor's degree in May 2020.

Since I graduated high school in 2016, I've found that I have a real talent for leadership roles, specifically in a retail management environment (I have also done teaching, non profit management, and tour managing, and DEI consulting, but retail is the thing that always hires me). A few weeks ago, I started a keyholder position at my current company since all manager positions were filled, and they offered me a promotion assistant department manager role as soon as one opened and they noticed I was excelling in my role. Now I'll be making $19 an hour, which is decent pay for retail in my state, as well as more than I've ever earned before.

I've already decided that biology is not something I'd like to revisit, and leadership/management feels like a no-brainer at this point. I feel like if I save up, I'll be able to afford taking a few classes here and there and eventually get my degree in Organizational Leadership or something similar. 

I guess what I'm trying to ask is, would it be worth it to get a degree like this? I feel like it would open up more opportunities for management and leadership positions, and possibly even consulting. Are there any types of degrees or certificate programs I should look into that will help me on my career path? I acknowledge that I'm young and I still have a lot to learn, and would love to hear.

I'd specifically like to also have some focus in the DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) area as well, since I have a background in it.

Two years ago I took a job that positioned me in a very good position to make that transition, especially with the education benefit that my company offered shortly after I started (they pay for the schooling rather than reimbursement). In addition to this, moving out of the region I currently live in (North Carolina) has been somewhat of a goal for the last few years.

I have an internal interview tomorrow for a position that would be management in the specific maintenance field I came up in which would also be experience that goes with my B.S that I am months away from finishing.

16ue5dk,"I rage applied to an internal position, got the offer, but now not sure if I want it..","I guess this is where I can say rage applying kinda bit me in the butt here.

I'm currently a Data Engineer. I rage applied to a data management analyst position. At the time, even though I was enraged, I was very curious about this role. Although it seemed less technical, it seemed like something new and exciting. I recently started seeing my current position as I put data from place A to place B and that's about it. Every project is the same, but with some twists. I am never involved in meetings about the work I do..I'm honestly just a code monkey.

So some backstory on why I rage applied. I had my mid-year review with my manager where I was basically told I don't do anything for the greater good of the company and that I have to work past my 9-5... (however, what was written on my mid-year was like whiplash. Nothing but nice things, but the call was all negative...) After that call I was so enraged I saw the position as a Data Management Analyst, thought it was interesting and applied.. I had to tell my current manager that I received an interview..where I was then told if they were to hire me again, they wouldn't because I'm not loyal, and because I don't know what I want to do with my career I wouldn't make a good leader.

This was the turning point for me where I just needed the job I applied to. I didn't want to work for this person anymore.

Now, I was just told I would be getting a new manager on this team and I would no longer be reporting to them soon...which is fantastic news, but they will be my new bosses' boss. However..I now just got this job offer yesterday evening. I figured it was okay to take a day or two to sit on it.. but now I just don't know what to do. I don't even know if this is what I want. I also don't even know if I want to stay..

What's the worst that could happen...hate my job? I feel like I'm already there.  I'm just afraid I'm not qualified for this position. I've never done this type of role before (which I was very open about).

Would appreciate anyones feedback. Either this rage apply was the best or worst thing to have happen to me that was self inflicted.",n00dlem0nster,25,0.8399999737739563,21,1695902550,2023-09-28 12:02:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16ue5dk/i_rage_applied_to_an_internal_position_got_the/,9,2023

16udk6d,Deciding between electrician or software engineer,"Hey everyone,
I know the two aren’t all that similar so it may seem odd but for the past year I have been trying to choose between the two and am no closer to an answer than I was at the start. Some backstory; upon finishing school I had no interest in getting a career but knew I’d need one and wanted to choose a trade that had smart people in it as my perception was that all trades were for dropouts, (I know that isn’t the case now). After 3 years of struggling to get an electrical apprenticeship I finally got one after doing a 10 week course at tafe for a cert 2 in electrotechnology a few weeks later I began my apprenticeship and while I was dealing with a difficult breakup it lead to the worst 6 months of my life. 

I was already depressed and riddled with anxiety from my breakup despite landing a job I had been chasing for years only to be met with a very vile tradesman I would have to work with almost everyday that would abuse me and treat me worse than dirt while seemingly being nice to everyone else and yet I was still kind and hard working. After enduring 6 months I decided to move and had the sudden urge to change career paths after quitting my job I think it may have been due to that sour experience with that company and it may have been because of the breakup. 

I began looking for something that interests me, that has smarter coworkers and could lead to higher income and decided upon software engineering. I have been at uni for 6 months now and my course will end up being around 4 years longer a little more than what my apprenticeship would take. The reason I am so hung up and can’t decide is because there is aspects I love about being an electrician which is: the pride of doing hard work(dumb I know 😅), earning decent money earlier, being handy and able to do my own electrical work and cashies for others and working at different places and outdoors aswell. However, there are aspects to software engineering that also excite me: much higher earning potential, pride of doing a degree in something I never thought I’d do, won’t have a broken back when I’m 50 and will most likely work with less miserable and crude people. Currently I am 6 months into my uni course but still feel unsure. 

If anyone could give some insight into both careers and maybe help me decide on one properly it would be greatly appreciated :)",SadAd9729,1,0.9900000095367432,1,1695900873,2023-09-28 11:34:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16udk6d/deciding_between_electrician_or_software_engineer/,9,2023
16uddz7,Feeling Lost in My Career Choice - Seeking Advice,"I hope you're all doing well. I'm reaching out because I'm in a bit of a pickle with my career, and I could really use some guidance from those who've navigated life's twists and turns.  
I am currently doing software engineering at uni which I regret doing over architecture. I will be starting year 2 out of 4 ( I did foundation year ) and I really dont want to continue but also dont really see other options except to continue.  
back in 2021 October, I was going to do architecture as it was a passion and something I had planned to do for a long time, but after doing my further research I came to find how time intensive the course if + the pay is not as great once you do become an architect which is also a long 7 year journey. I also do day trading hence I needed a course which would help me manage both but with my research it seemed that it will be hard with architecture. with more last minute research I came to find out how well software engineers are paid and that the course is not as time intensive as architecture leading me to making the last minute change. ever since then I regretted this and wish I could just do architecture. now I simply dont want to continue, but the thing is I dont see other way, I have already done 2 years out of 4, me changing back to architecture would mean doing 3 years again, which is a total waste of 2 years of SE.  
my passion has always been design and now I feel completely unhappy and empty as I know I will not use SE degree in the future, one thing I do see as possible is transitioning into UI UX design after graduating but I always feel sense of regret by not choosing architecture. also to make it even more complicated, even if I did do architecture, I would likely do ui ux design after the 3 year degree as I won't want to do the full 7 years but just having the architecture degree is what I really wanted and that would allow me to easily transition into ui ux design anyways.  
I would genuinely appreciate any stories, advice, or insights you could throw my way.

16u6s7u,I’ve been at my job for 3 months. I hate it. I’m going to grad school for a career change in January anyways. Is it stupid to quit with nothing lined up?,"I (25F) started this graphic design job 3 months ago. I came from a much better design agency in a much bigger city, so I’m confident in my skills/ideas. This agency is a bit dysfunctional and their design is outdated, but I can deal with that.

Everyone else at this agency is on a team and has clear objectives, but I’m completely on my own, don’t really know anybody, and don’t get assignments. I work directly and almost exclusively with the founder, who is not a designer, loves being rude, and makes weird comments about/towards women (and I’m a woman). I’m expected to come up with ideas on my own, but I don’t know what the founder wants and he won’t clearly tell me what he expects of me. He either hates everything I pitch for reasons that truly don’t make sense or ignores it until it’s too late and it’s a moot point. When he does give me feedback, he looks for opportunities to be rude instead of constructive/understanding. He blames me in public channels for not making enough social posts, although I am pitching social posts, he just either hates it or doesn’t respond or pulls me onto another internal project so I have no time to make social posts.

Additionally, he misrepresented this job in the interview. I thought it would be brand expansion - aspirational projects like starting a magazine or a podcast, or working with local businesses to enrich the community. Instead, it’s just social posts and whatever internal graphics they need. I don’t like making social posts and would not have taken this job had I known that was such a large part of it.

I’ve been prowling job sites for a few weeks, but the market in my industry is not great at this time. I’ve applied to a few places but don’t have high hopes. Additionally, I’m planning to go back to grad school in January to change my career to counseling, so it doesn’t really benefit me to get more experience in the design/marketing field. I’m currently planning to find a barista job to support me through school, but haven’t been hired yet.

My question is - would I be shooting myself in the foot by quitting with nothing lined up? I hate this job and don’t think things will get better. I have ~3-4 months of savings, and my parents are in a position to support me/give me a loan if I need one, so I won’t be in dire straits if I do quit. I’m fairly confident I could find a service industry job, it’d just leave me with bigger debt after grad school than I’d have if I stayed in my industry at a higher paying job. Ugh.

16u4ubw,Considering Software Development or Dental Hygiene - Seeking Career Guidance,"Hello Reddit community,

I'm currently a high school senior on the brink of making a significant decision about my future career path. I'm torn between two options: software development and dental hygiene. I'm hoping to get some valuable insights from those experienced in these fields.

I've always been intrigued by technology and enjoy problem-solving and coding as a hobby. On the other hand, I have a fascination with healthcare and helping people maintain their oral health. These interests have led me to consider software development and dental hygiene as potential career paths.

I have a few questions and concerns:
What does a typical day in the life look like for a software developer and a dental hygienist?
What are the educational requirements for both fields, and how competitive are the admissions?
Are there specific challenges or advantages in these careers I should be aware of?
In terms of job stability and income potential, how do these two fields compare or differ?

While I don't have concrete long-term career goals yet, I'm interested in a career that offers a balance between personal satisfaction, financial stability, and opportunities for growth.

I haven't had any formal coding courses, and I'm yet to complete the prerequisites for dental hygiene programs. However, I'm eager to start gaining relevant experience or skills.

I'm looking for advice, experiences, and insights from those who have pursued careers in software development or dental hygiene, as well as anyone who has faced a similar career decision. Any information that can help me make an informed choice would be greatly appreciated.

I'm posting this in the r/careeradvice subreddit, but if there are more specialized subreddits for software development or dental hygiene advice, please let me know.

I'll be actively checking for responses and am open to engaging in discussions and asking follow-up questions.

From conversations between my colleagues, I know that the differences in *starting* salary for new hires between A and B is ~ 25%: $62,000 and $77,500, respectively. 

I currently make $64,170 after a 3.5% raise this year. **Is asking for $80,600 too much? It is 30% greater than my starting salary, and 25.6% more from my current salary.** Obviously, I have valid justifications that I can—and will—communicate to management to “advocate” for the promotion.

I nonetheless have this *feeling* that I am overestimating the “weight” that my 18-month tenure brings to the promotion. **When does an internal promotion have more leverage in salary negotiations compared to an external hire?**",tjcc99,1,1.0,0,1695869005,2023-09-28 02:43:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16u49wf/compared_to_external_hires_is_there_ever_a_time/,9,2023

I asked my boss about mileage reimbursement and he said I will be on the clock during my drive times, but he cannot additionally offer mileage reimbursement.

I work for a small beverage company that’s available nationwide in legacy of the owners son passing away 5-6 years ago. When I first started, I was under the assumption that they want to focus on the products, the juices. But as I got into working for them, their social media brands off their child. His face is the logo, and they want me to market off his story, his values and his religious beliefs. They expect me to market their juice and expand their audience to others, but as someone who’s been in marketing for 3 years, this idea is only good in a short term than long term.

I don’t know if this is normal but to get their story out or if this even pertains to marketing but they expect me to reach out to celebrities ranging from Taylor Swift to Mark Wahlberg to Adam Sandler to Paris Hilton at the hopes they will shout them out without compensation and post them on social media. All being either celebrities that either he liked before he passed or celebrities that simply align with their faith. at the same time they are shipping out their products to Tesla and to Imagine dragons via Instacart because it’s too expensive to ship drinks. I have explained that they don’t always respond but no matter how much I explain that they won’t respond that I have to be more hopeful and optimistic.

Along with this, i’m expected to post on social media with limited content that they expect me to make content outside of work hours and won’t allow me to do content in my job.

16u145v,Am I wrong for being jealous for a coworkers promotion?,"I’m dealing with a bit of jealousy over a work situation that I can’t decide if I’m justified in or not. I work on an engineering team at the headquarters of a large company. I interned for about a year for them in college in an industrial environment then was hired on to the team post grad and have been there two years. I gained a lot of technical experience in my internship that I’ve been able to apply, I got my degree in mechanical engineering, and I’m currently getting my masters in ops management online. A girl joined my team about a year to take on more of an administrative role. 95% of the people on the team of about 100 have engineering degrees and a lot of experience so we needed someone willing to help schedule meetings, organize lunches, plan travel, etc. She has a degree in education and had been a teacher for 4 years and was looking to get out of it. She was a high school friend of another person on the team. A couple months in she let her reporting manager know she wanted to get more into project management. I was told she’d be taking the lead on a project I’d just started working on. I was okay with it at first then began to get a bit frustrated as it created more issues with her going into stakeholder meetings to get requirements, not asking the right questions, and creating a lot of back and forth that could’ve been avoided if I was in the meeting. She didn’t have the technical knowledge to know what questions to ask. After seeing those issues, her manager gave her a project to take the technical lead on. I ended up holding her hand through the entire process and basically doing it for her while she watched. I was annoyed again for doing a majority of the work without receiving credit but moved on. My main issue came about a couple weeks ago. I knew she previously made just under what i make (86k, she made around 75k). She was promoted out of the admin role and into more of a project engineer role, the same level I’m at. This is where I want to know if I’m justified. I have an engineering degree, several years of engineering experience, have been with the company several years, and she does not have an engineering degree and has only been w the company a year. Yet she moved up faster and I assume received a pay bump and now makes more than I do. She is a couple years older than me and is about to get married and complains a lot about money, so I can’t help but wonder if this played into her “promotion.” I’ve also discussed moving up with my manager and we have a plan to move to the next level in a couple months, so I felt extra slighted that I have to jump through more hoops and hit other milestones when she didn’t even have the necessary experience to begin with.

16u0sdr,Some generic success advice from a relatively high earner,"I sometimes see people asking about how to get to the high paying jobs, what to do differently in their work. I have a high paying job ($275k) which I definitely got in part due to privilege, but I can tell you 1) what I know managers like about me/promote me for and 2) what I like in people I look to hire or promote. 

1. Be reliable. Be on time every day, and to every meeting. Get your work done on time. Be someone your manager never has to worry about. If you realize something won’t get done on time, immediately get ahead of it by telling the people who care and suggest or make a contingency plan. 

2. Be selectively perfectionist. Whatever the most important part of your job is, do it the best you possibly can. Ideally you’re able to enjoy this work and take pride in it.

In addition to the main part of my job, I am always a perfectionist in any type of communication - I spend 15 min on 3 sentence emails to make sure they say exactly what I want them to say. These communications are the times your colleagues see you/pay attention to you, so make a good impression every time. 

For the parts of my job that just “need to get done” but the quality doesn’t actually have much impact, I just do them quickly and move on, spending as little energy on them as possible. 

3. Pay attention to the bigger picture and care about the company/department’s success. This should translate into taking initiative to improve whatever things that may not be exactly in your job description, and potentially get you noticed (any individual occasion may not get you noticed, but consistently taking impactful initiative will).

4. Take care of yourself. Figure out how you get your best work done and set yourself up that way. You probably need sleep, a reasonable diet, maybe some exercise, and plenty of relaxation time. I rarely work outside of 9-5 and I have become very effective at getting a lot done in the workday and then recharging. I do very occasionally (once every month or two) work extra hours, when it’s needed for the business or my projects - I care about them so I want to deliver. If it became more often then I would ask for help or find another job if it was expected. 

5. If you know you’re very valuable and not being promoted/getting a raise, then move on to another place of work where you will be valued.",blondemathslut,7,0.7400000095367432,3,1695859861,2023-09-28 00:11:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16u0sdr/some_generic_success_advice_from_a_relatively/,9,2023

He speaks Spanish and broken English so I’m able to communicate with him. First he asks where I’m from and says where he’s from, then asks if we can exchange phone numbers. I say “Do you mean as coworkers or in a date way? I want to clarify because I don’t know your intentions and I’m not interested if you mean as a date.” He says he meant it romantically, and I say that I’m not interested, sorry. He keeps asking me why, and if I’m married or have a boyfriend. And he keeps telling me I’m very beautiful, I just say thank you. Asks me how old I am, I say 19. Asks me again to exchange numbers, I go ehhhhh… no… and asks me if I find him attractive. I just say it has nothing to do with that and that I’m just not interested in dating. He keeps pressuring me for the number so I give in (hoping he’ll stop) and let him put his contact in my phone (my thought was that just because I have his number doesn’t mean I have to text him, I can just delete it later.) Then he asks me to text him on it so he has mine too, so now I’m trapped. I was so nervous and uncomfortable so I went with it (incredibly stupid I know… I was just shocked and didn’t realize what I was doing exactly). Also asks me if he can text me at night (eww…??) and I just didn’t respond. I have no idea if I’m supposed to be nice or rude. I’ve dealt with plenty of stuff like that from customers, but never so directly from another employee.

Then he says he is 53, divorved, and looking for someone 24-25. He says he wants to find a woman who’s “tall and beautiful like you.” Also says he came to the US to start a new family. I tell him my lunch break is over so I can gtfo of the break room and away from hi

I immediately go to my manager and tell him what happened, and he and another coworker say I need to report it. Went to another manager higher up, she tells me he tried the same thing on another employee before. Also, my coworker says he saw this guy asking another girl her name, where she’s from, if she wants to be “friends,” etc. not even 2 hours after he did it to me.

This manager tells the head store manager, and a safety (??) manager. Safety manager gives me a report to fill out. Head store manager says he’ll talk to the guy and tell him he can’t be so unprofessional with other employees.

16u087n,How to go about quitting?,"Hi all! I currently do social media marketing for a small beverage company I can’t name in legacy of the parent companies child who passed away 5-6 years ago.

Arriving, I was told the marketing was solely on their products, but their logo is the child’s face. In the job description, they do not fully show the brand name that’s on shelves but use their incorporation name. I did not know the child but as I got to know the company, they market the child on everything. His values, his religious beliefs, his face, because the owners audience was those in their church and people that solely believe in the same thing. My manager is having me reach beyond that audience because they had been stagnant for 5 years but to me, their marketing strategy from the start is not good in a long term. I have a hard time strategizing content that incorporates him but focus on the beverages themselves. 

To get the message out on their story and foundation, i’m being assigned to message or to reach out to celebrities along the lines of taylor swift, adam sandler, with letters in the hopes they will give a shoutout without asking for compensation and they send their products to companies such as Tesla and bands like Imagine Dragons via Instacart because shipping drinks is expensive. Some were things he liked before he passed but some are things that he nor the owners even know anything. I don’t know if this is normal to do in my role to be reaching out to celebrities when even I know for a fact they won’t respond, along with sending their products to companies who would not post it on social media. 

I found further information about their child who passed and their values I strongly disagree with. Everyday i’m being assigned to look up celebrities they suggest and to find their emails or their home addresses and to tell the story, while my manager also is getting upset that i’m not posting enough or doing enough brand awareness when they give me limited photos, they expect me to do and to make content outside of work and won’t let me make reels or photos when I am there.

16tznyw,How can I be more patient in my career?,"  
I (25M) currently work for a tech startup and manage my small department. I got an undergraduate degree in audio and now do AI integrated telecommunications. I make about 70K and I’ve been in this role for 4 months now. I was self employed the first two years out of school and after that worked a terrible paying sales job for a bit less than a year. After spending that whole year job searching I landed this one.   
For the last three years I’ve just been agonizing as I see some of my peers from college getting ahead (making 6 figures, saving to imminently buy homes, going on vacations, etc.) and I really do feel so far behind. I want to go back to school part time to get my MBA and eventually utilize that and my current experience to get a higher paying job.   
I know eventually my current path will yield higher earnings but I feel so stressed every day that I’m falling behind. In an ideal world I would be able to marry my long time partner and have a nice wedding in the next few years. And owning any sort of asset like a house feels years and years away.  
If it wasn’t already apparent I was a very high achiever in school and my parents are extremely high motivated, high income individuals. Honestly, they talk down to me quite a bit for being at the place in my career that I am.   
All of this adding up causes me some serious duress day to day because nothing in my career seems like it can change fast enough to get me to where I want to be, ultimately the solution probably is just to be more patient and keep working hard, but that answer feels so hollow when I spend all day stressing. I have no problem working long hours, studying into the night etc… it just seems like there’s nothing I can actively do here.

16tz1t7,German M27 working in the Music Industry and looking for advice on how to make the next professional step (NYC),"Hi Everyone! I am looking for inspiration and advice from other professionals working in the beautiful industry we all love so much. I am a German who moved to NYC in 2021 when I was still studying. I won a green card and had to move during the pandemic. While I was studying I did an internship in a recording studio here in NYC and an internship in Berlin at a government owned cultural management agency in which I was mostly responsible for handling musical artists. I graduated in September 2022 and started a label with a friend and have been running operations in the US & Canada for a year now.  
Now I am looking to make a move to a bigger label or change trajectories and become a Talent Agent at an agency because my business partner doesn't have the same ambitions for the label as I do and wants to keep things smaller. Unfortunately, I'm not having any luck with applications, I guess it's because I'm too much of a risk factor since I didn't graduate from a US university and only studied in NYC for one semester and HR might also assume that my English skills might not be professional enough which is not the case though, since I went to an international school and completed my undergraduates in English too.  
Now I would like to ask for your advice and professional opinion on how I should proceed in order to take the next step in my career. What positions do you guys think I should apply for? Also, do you think it would make sense to go to back to graduate school and get a full degree from an US school? I have no objection in principle to taking some extension classes or do a master's degree, but I wasn't sure because the consensus was mostly that experience > education and the ROI seemed super small considering the cost.  
Looking forward to your responses and seriously appreciate the help & effort. Also would love to chat and link up with everyone whose interest I aroused.

16txkql,College Student Wondering What To Major In,"Hi all, 

Like the title says, I have no idea what to major in, or what career path I'd like to pursue. I'm in my third year of school, but I'm technically still a sophomore because I took a semester off last year. My heart is really in the medical field, as I grew up with several chronic illnesses and have always felt a ""calling"" to medicine, but I am a bit immunocompromised and worry that by working in the medical field in the US, I'm contributing to the unethical nature of the US healthcare system. 

My main requirements are job stability, good salary (I have so so many medical bills that, even with insurance, are a LOT), and relatively low-ish stress. I'm taking a computer science class this semester to see if that's something I'd be interested in, and it's...not going well. And I've also heard some really scary things about how AI is going to replace all the entry-level CS jobs? 

I'm also interested in becoming a mental health therapist, but I've gotten mixed information regarding salaries, job satisfaction, etc. 

I know I have time to figure my life out, but as my college career progresses, I'd like to learn towards making a decision sooner rather than later.

16txeju,Advice on deciding to leave at critical point for the company.,"I work as a software developer at a small town manufacturing company. They are working to be able to shift their production and are wanting to build tools to be able to automate that shift.

It sounds like interesting work, and at first it was, but I simply don't care about manufacturing. I really don't care about automating engineering drawings and generating CNC paths.

I really want to leave the company. There are other problems other than my interest. I don't like the culture, they have more technical debt than the nation has financially, and I don't believe that the leadership understand technology enough. They are working to learn, but the president is too focused on AI (specifically GPT) enabled solutions. He is constantly asking for projects that take focus away from the production shift and have no benefit to the company other than the president thinks they are cool and maybe impress the reps. Leadership isn't trying to stop him from requesting these things and simply instead ""put it on the backburner"".

The last issue I have that makes me want to get out now, is that I am the only ""modern"" developer. We use the .NET framework. Out of the four developers (including me) I am the only one that knows >.NET 4.8. Even for new projects the use Framework, which has been deprecated. Just recently I had to upgrade a project from .NET 3 just so that it could be hosted on Azure... and this was a public facing site built within the last couple years. The also use VB instead of C# but to be truthful that doesn't really matter to me, but I use C# which leaves even a bigger gap of understanding for when I leave.

I've worked here for just under a year, but I want to get out before I get too entrenched in this production shift. There are a few things blocking me from walking out now. First is that I need another job lined up. The second is that I have family ties to the company. My dad works here, and he is the engineer in charge of this production shift. I've been his connection on the inside and have been developing tools for him. The last reason is because I have an issue with putting down work halfway done. This probably seems like the weakest reason, but it's to the point where I almost couldn't leave my last job for a $10k/year pay raise just because my software hadn't made it to production.

Anybody that has been in the same situation and has some advice I would be happy to hear it. As I see it, I have a few paths. First is to line up a job and give the cold shoulder, sorry dad I'll see you at Thanksgiving. The second is to get the new job and have them contract me out to build one tool at a time. Almost like a side hustle but would take up a lot of my time outside of work.

Thanks for any advice.",Fluff3rNutt3r,1,1.0,2,1695851800,2023-09-27 21:56:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16txeju/advice_on_deciding_to_leave_at_critical_point_for/,9,2023

16to3fq,How do I get back into writing professionally?,"I recently got laid off at my day job, and am struggling to find other employment. I live in Washington DC, and have prior experience covering entertainment news in Asia (largely, Korea and China). I've applied to several jobs at major news orgs like CNN, Fox, Vox, and I think there was an application to Protocol in there somewhere. 

The 30,000 ft view is as follows:

I am blind, and I graduated with a degree in Political Science during the pandemic in 2020, I had few options so I started a Youtube channel to show my creative/research abilities. In 2021/22, I got brought on to an internship with a media company based in East Asia, where I researched and produced several articles, including a feature piece. Six months ago, I moved to DC to start my first big corporate job, and I get laid off.. I have about 2 months' of rent saved up, and Youtube is nowhere near paying the bills. 

Are there volunteering opportunities I should be taking advantage of? There isn't a particular beat I'd prefer to cover right now, as much as just getting my feet back in the door on this profession.  I'm hungry to chase down leads and speak to people, and not have to worry about rent payments (as much)... Most of my expertise lies in China, Korea, and Central Europe (broadly).. I am not sure how to sell this to an American media outlet. My beat, if you could call it that, was entertainment journalism and tech. There are a few stories I have rattling around in my brain I want to interview people about, but A)I don't know if others would find them compelling and B) Freelancing, especially in/around Washington DC, feels like a fools' errand unless you have a rich family. I can write, I can research, I can produce audio content.. but I need to figure out some way to sell that to people. Would non-major outlets even take on a half blind writer **and** pay me enough to put food on the table?

I am only asking half-jokingly - is this why people become grifters for one cause or another? They need to pay rent, or they fall down some rabbit hole?..",blindjournothrowaway,1,1.0,0,1695829700,2023-09-27 15:48:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16to3fq/how_do_i_get_back_into_writing_professionally/,9,2023
16tntwu,"Should I talk to my boss about my dissatisfaction with the job, even tho I’m planning on leaving?","I’ve worked as a legal assistant for a small-ish law firm for about a year now (8 attorneys) and have discovered I really don’t like this line of work. I also don’t get paid much at all here. Like I could probably make more working as a waitress or even at a grocery store. They chronically underpay all the office staff, which I believe is the main reason for the high staff turnover here. To be fair, i didn’t go to school for paralegal work, but I still have a bachelors degree in English and previous office experience.


Anyway, I’m now starting to look for higher-paying jobs that I would enjoy more. But my question is, should I tell my direct boss, one of the partners, what I’ve been thinking? (about low pay, wanting to work in a new field, etc.) There are obvious reasons for not doing this, but here are some reasons I’m considering it: 
1. I could improve things for my co workers. I’m leaving whether I get paid more or not, but I have coworkers who genuinely enjoy working here and are very good at it. But they’re undervalued and I think they know it, even if they don’t admit it to themselves or talk to our bosses about it. I bet some of them leave soon, and the vicious turnover cycle will continue. 
2. I genuinely like my bosses. They’re honest people and good attorneys, so I’d like to help them out. But I think they’re somewhat clueless as to why people don’t stay. I think some things will get better when the oldest partner retires, as he’s very set in his ways (pays like it’s 15 years ago, internalized misogyny with office staff), but I’d like to help things improve before then. 
3. I particularly like and trust my direct boss and want to give him a heads up that I won’t be around for much longer bc it’s going to suck for him to train a new assistant. I also think he’ll listen and not treat me different if I tell him my concerns. But he’ll probably tell the other partners—I’m more worried about them! 
4. It would be cool if I could get a raise. Idk how long this job search is going to take, and I do think I deserve to be paid more.

At the time of my hire I was super excited for this role. I have previously founded two successful businesses (both of which I sold when I was ready to move on), have worked as a sessional instructor at a different post secondary, have my graduate certificate in the executive coaching and am an associate professional coach with the ICF, and have worked previously as a leadership coach and consultant and product portfolio manager (this last role was what I left to start my new job). The job description was focused on program development/management, leadership of a small team and volunteers, advising and coaching students on their new business ventures, strategic development for the centre, event management, stake holder relations, budgeting, and marketing. 

The reality of my job has been I spend 70% of my time doing administrative work and the other 30% if divided up between budgets, reporting, marketing, and event planning. There is no time for strategic planning, team development, program development, or student coaching/advising (the rest of my small team of entrepreneur consultants are doing this).

More and more gets added to my plate daily, so I can never catch up and I’ve received little training. There was a 3 month gap between the coordinator they had in this role for 5 years and myself coming on. They changed the role to manager but did not add any staff so I am expected to do all the work the full time coordinator did plus additional management (that my boss who is the associate Dean used to do). I’m 6 weeks in and already burnt out. 

Here’s the thing. I do not enjoy the work and dread going to work everyday. But I really like my boss, the team I get to work with and the overall culture of the post secondary institution. The organization feels like a right fit, but not the role. My boss thinks I’m doing a great job and have potential for leadership opportunities. They have said they like people in a role for two years before they move them elsewhere. But I know I cannot do this role for 2 years without it impacting my mental health negatively (I’m taking a mental health day off today as I have been having panicked attacks the last few days). I feel like I know this job is not the right fit. I’m in my mid-forties and have the life experience to know waiting isn’t going to make this better for me. 

I have a bit of savings I can lean on, but not a lot as my spouse had to close his business this past summer and there is a small amount of debt we have to pay off there. We also have two teenage daughters, so I really can’t be unemployed for long. But I do have the ability to get some contract work coaching and consulting to tide me over and an a Pilates instructor with a home studio so I could take more private clients. 

I hesitate to stay in this role as I spent the year before this in a job that was not the right fit and it was exhausting and not good for my mental health or family. 

TL;DR I’m trying to decided if I should tell my boss this isn’t going to work for me and stay for a few more weeks while they find someone new (although it took 3 rounds of recruiting over 4 months for them to find me), find a new job first and then give my notice, or just give my two weeks notice so I can focus on finding something new and move on.",Greedy-Possibility87,2,1.0,1,1695828624,2023-09-27 15:30:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16tnmvx/leave_job_now_or_wait_until_i_have_a_new_job/,9,2023

16tn28q,I made a bad decision and now I’m an outcast. Where do I go from here?,"I made a bad decision early in a job and now I’m an outcast. How should I proceed?

I want to start out by saying I understand what I did was wrong.

So for context I’m working this job as a temporary thing outside of my normal industry because I got laid off because my boss left the company I was working at and no one replaced him so my position vanished overnight. An older friend of mine offered me a job at their company which of course is extremely nice. I had a great time my first couple weeks and my position includes taking people out to happy hours and purchasing their drinks on the company credit card. 

The most recent Happy Hour was at this public bar and since my birthday was that weekend and I had a friend staying in town I invited her and another friend out to meet me at that bar after the happy hour was over and we could continue the night celebrating after my work people left. 

The work happy hour went on and over our 3 hour time slot so when my friend showed up it was still going strong. She had her own tab and everything but I floated her a couple drinks. I felt bad but I justified it as the rest of the work people ordered a little over 5k in food and drinks and I probably spent $20 on her and my drunk brain was like “I would be normally having that to drink so it’s like I’m ordering it myself”

Obviously someone witnessed me giving them a drink and my boss found out. She was very forgiving and said we never have to mention it again provided nothing like this happens. Which I would never do. I’m definitely in the doghouse and I feel like word spread around at my company and people don’t trust me or want to talk to me anymore. All of that pales in comparison to my friendship with the person who got me the job. Idk how to reach out to them and explain/apologize. My reputation is fine bc I won’t be using this job as a reference or anything but I feel like I tainted her reputation bc she fully got me hired. 

I’m also feeling super burnt out bc I don’t feel at home in this company anymore.

16tlura,Pivot from SDR to analyst position?,"I graduated from college in December ‘22 with a degree in business management. I started my college career as an engineering major, since I’ve always been a very analytical person, and just a stat nerd in general. I switched, however, to business for a variety of reasons. 

I had a difficult time getting a job, as the insurance agency I had worked at went out of business, but landed as an SDR at a large company. Truth be told, I hate it. The product and the people we target do not interact, and the cold calling is demeaning and tiresome. On top of this, the pay is about 20% lower than market average. I‘ve been here about 6 months, and while I get my work done efficiently, I feel I’m still about a year away from a promotion. 

So I’ve decided to look elsewhere. Analyst positions caught my eye. Many big box stores want a background in retail, which is great because I worked retail for 5+ years. Outside of that, I’m decently qualified for many analyst roles.

My questions are, is this sort of jump possible? Will companies see me as a viable applicant? Are there any positions, outside of an AE/AM/SDR role that I’d be qualified for?

16tjspl,"My farm job is severely understaffed but the managers are helping out less and less, what to do?","I'm working on a small farm with about 18 goats, 3 cats, 7 horses and 18 pigs. For the past 3 months, my 2 managers have been helping out with the chores. My one coworker quit because she said it was too much work and we only get paid minimum wage, and now it's just me left and I took up full time. My managers have completely stopped helping out except for with 2/3 tasks, mainly with the pigs because I'm afraid of them.

 And they actually don't help that much because I noticed my managers will not do the task properly (for example cleaning the room with our cats) until it's the day we have public tours coming through then they assign me to clean the room and it has a weeks worth of litter scattered on the floor and their blankets are covered in crusty old wet food. It's like they let the place go to shit until we have tours coming in and then they assign me to give it a deep clean. They also frequently leave a mess everywhere and if I don't clean it up it's left there for days. 

I don't understand why they have been helping out with regular chores for the past 3 months and now that we're super understaffed (it's just me left do care for the animals) they're helping the least. I feel very taken advantage of and confused because it's not like I was still in my training period or anything so I feel a bit conned. They made it seem like it was a team effort and now it's just me doing most of the work for shit pay. 

 There mucking system is ridiculous too and I have to fill muck tubs, stack them 3 high on a Kubota, and get them into an 8ft high dumpster by either standing on the Kubota bed and tossing them, or hopping into the dumpster where we also toss cat litter and pig poop.

16tissb,Should I stay in current startup role or switch back to consulting?,"Need help making a decision

31M with about 10 YOE in Enterprise application consulting (ERP, CRM, WMS, etc). I have a lot of experience within the Oracle (Netsuite, E1) & Salesforce applications in that domain and had been a successful consultant for about 8 years at a large national professional services firm (#12 of top 20). During my time there I led many large $1MM+ engagements and helped with a ton of BD which brought in a lot of won opportunities for the firm. I was definitely on the track for partner, but partner never really appealed to me.

TC at exit: $150k + 20% cash bonus 

Wanting to get more experience in industry/client side in 2022 I joined a series D unicorn as an Enterprise architect and quickly gained a lot of traction in the business. Within a year I had grown my team from 0 people to 3 FTEs, and 4 full time contractors. I created the enterprise applications/systems group for the organization but constantly found myself hating being in a back office/cost center type role. This is a pretty cushy WFH job and my career prospects are good here. I could continue working a the org as they to go public and settle into a VP role or leverage my experience at another startup and repeat for another exit. Even with a public event, I would expect my equity to be worth exactly what it is, or be worthless if the company never goes public.   

TC Year 1: 180K + 10% Bonus + $30k equity a year
TC year 2: 192K + 10% Bonus + $30k equity a year

Recently I got a job offer from a smaller consulting firm I used to partner with during my consulting days. They’re trying to build up a new service line for applications consulting that I have a lot of experience doing. They’re offering me a pretty solid comp plan that has a high base plus I would earn a commission on all the business I bring in. I wouldn’t be responsible for delivery but I would be focused mostly on sales and solution consulting. There is light travel (maybe 4-5 days a month which I don’t mind) and the job is WFH the rest of the time with a ton of flexibility. WLB would be pretty similar between both roles in the short term but may be better at my current job in the long term. 

Offer: $250k Base + a % of revenue I generate or sell which scales up based on the revenue $
- the first year my TC would be between $280k - $290k
- if most things go according to plan my second year comp should be $330k -  $350k
- by the third year my revenue % should be doubling my base comp with TC around $500k+

Clearly this is a riskier endeavor and would also be very dependent on my performance. But worse comes to worse I just pocket my extra comp of $50k a year and then go back to another start up or open my own services firm which has always been a dream of mine.

16tetzy,How to subtly deal with unspoken accusations of incompetence?,"First some context. I’ve been working in my current role for just over six months now and have just passed my probation period (yay). All feedback given so far from my team lead and exec manager has been that I’m performing above standard and no issues to speak of. This is also my second corporate role, so I’m unsure if I may be missing some unspoken communication here.
Last week we had a new starter join the team in the same capacity as myself, who is still going through onboarding and hasn’t really touched on many of the more hands-on aspects of the role yet. I’ve also been pushing the last few weeks for more opportunities/responsibilities as I’m keen to advance my role and career.
Now to my concern: this week I’ve been approached by my team lead several times asking for clarification on how I prioritise and complete daily tasks, and it’s been subtly implied that I’m either not working hard enough or lying about completing work. I don’t understand where these are coming from, as my productivity hasn’t changed and I am proveably completing tasks (which I have showed her upon request). I definitely don’t want to make a big scene out of this, but how do I back myself out of this assumption? Why would this have started up now given no drop in performance and an active interest in improvement? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

16teitm,How can I approach my supervisor if my coworker is not being effective at work?,"She's been with the team for nine months now and she still works like a newbie. For context, we only have like 8 tasks and only 3 of them were difficult. The tasks were repetitive to the point even the difficult tasks becomes easy, just more time consuming compared to the easier ones. Workload is too light for now that each member only does 3-4 tasks per day (end of the year is when we get 3-5hrs OT everyday due to heavy workload tho). 

We also work from home and the higher ups weren't that strict as long as we finish our workload then we can log out early. During her 5th month, our supervisor asked me how the newbie is doing. I told her that 1. she takes about an hour or two to get started on the next task (which probably means she's gone somewhere). Since she's taking a long time to finish, we often redistribute her workload to the other team members just so we can finish. It happens 2-3x a week. Even up until now. It's like she's doing it on purpose. 2. Her finished work were full of errors. 3. She replies after 1-2 hours. With our workload during November-January that kind of work ethic is bad for the team.

I don't know what happened but of course she was regularized. Fast forward to 9 months and she's still asking questions to easy tasks (ones she learned during training and since this is a repetitive tasks so she should've memorized it by now). She refuses to ask our senior since she's aware she's been asking the same question over and over. It's as if she's going backwards. She doesn't backread our conversations to find the answers, she doesn't take notes. Normally you do your own research first before asking for help. But her, if she didn't understand something then she'll just chat you immediately. Often times you can't even understand her questions since it lacks the necesarry information to be able to help her. 

She's not new to the account. She has experience and even proudly stated that she's been with two companies and the work is more complex. You can even see that since it only takes her 10-15 mins to finish a certain task. That's why I pointed out problem number 1.

Two of my coworkers notices that she's gone most of the time. She's older than me so I'm afraid I might come off as direspectful if I tell her what to do. I've been with the team/company for only a year and this is the first time I've encountered someone like this (all through out my career). I get it if you just got hired/finished training, you're bound to take time and make too many errors. But isn't this too long for an adjustment? 

If we work during the whole 8 hours then I don't really care what she does during working hours as long as she finishes her work. But this is different, her unfinished work goes to everyone atop from our own. It always ends up to her only doing 2-3 tasks whether we have an easy or harsh day. Once November hits, it'll be unfair if she also files for 3-5hrs of OT but only does about half of what we do. Aside from that, every one will be busy that no one will notice her mistakes. I'm really concerned since the one who'll be affected will be the owner of the accounts were handling. Not her. 

I don't know how to approach my supervisor and tell them that they need to do something (re-train, transfer, IR, anything) because the whole team will suffer if this goes on.

16tdgqi,Medicine vs Engineering,"I'm aware of the time commitment of being a doctor, and the steps to be a physician, which is what I plan to do if I go down this route.   However, I've not taken a lot of biology related courses(mostly engineering) and this has only recently become an option I considered. 

I'll be frank and say the pay and prospect of early financial freedom seems pretty sweet. But does it take a toll on mental health? Is it worth the years? 

Also my parents said they want me to be a doctor. If I take this path they want me to major in molecular biology since engineering is harder on the GPA. 

My extracurriculars were largely engineering/robotics/plane building, with a summer of lab volunteering and Science Olympiad at the end, because of the sudden option to be a doctor. So, I thought about Biomedical Engineering.

 However, I heard that BME doesn't offer as great job opportunities, and it's kind of niche and that a mechanical E guy could do just as well on a hospital device. Is this true?

 Also, physics problems make my blood boil before I am able to feel the gratification upon solving them.  

Patience is perhaps not my virtue. 

That said, I don't hate it, in that I don't hate medicine either. I don't have strong passion for either, but I just don't want to decide the rest of my life on a whim. I did engineering for four years in high school because I thought it would impress my parents. I think building stuff is cool but I don't like math. 

My passion lies with art, but I don't have a character artist type portfolio and applications are due soon. Also I like financial stability and money(not to say you can't be financially independent in art, just that my parents also disapprove).

Still, this has been driving me crazy for months. Is engineer worth my time or is medicine worth it more? If you are in either, what made you pick it?",dairyfood,1,1.0,0,1695797635,2023-09-27 06:53:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16tdgqi/medicine_vs_engineering/,9,2023

16tcc7l,"College Final-year, career advice, how to proceed ahead?","
I am a final year student pursuing Integrated Msc in Mathematics and Computing at Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi. Currently I am placed(on-campus) in a North-America based IT/solutions/manufacturing based company Fastenal. It is providing a decent package(above average) and I am about to join for 6 months intern onsite from Bangalore next year start onwards. 
I have good DSA/problem solving skills. I Have been able to clear multiple OA rounds including Media.net, cisco and others. I have a average knowledge base in web-development. I was focused on my academics from the start and have a good knowledge base particularly in Mathematics (UG/PG level) along with a very good academic record altogether. I also have a paper accepted in ISI kolkata conference this year related to Satellite image processing. 
Currently I am working on two papers, one on differential equations and another on the extension of the work I did for the conference. I am positive ( also hopeful) that both will be published. 

I wanted to pursue research as a career, but during lockdown, due to uncertaintity and other personal problems I choose to prepare seriously for placements. I dont't know if pursuing academic research as a career in mathematics would be suitable or a good option to proceed with hereon. 

Talking to a senior and revaluating my personal goals, I found that working in R&D of any good company would help me achieve my goals. Searching for such positions I found that R&D of good companies either requires Phds or an indeth knowledge in a relevant domain. Few R&D positions I found worth a shot require very good coding/DSA. 

Currently, I am doing the two papers that I mentioned. Along with that I am focusing on improving in coding/Problem solving. 

I was also thinking of giving GATE mathematics. Not decided yet. I have good knowledge in mathematics(UG/PG), but I am skeptical that even a good rank would help me in securing R&D position in any company or give me any edge in securing it.


Any advice on what I should focus on or proceed. Any suggestion/advice is highly welcome!

I do have a partially completed archaeology degree and I got good grades, but it felt like a very competitive field with some ethical dilemmas I wasn't comfortable with, hence why I stopped.

Any suggestions for what viable/realistic careers some of these interests might translate into would be helpful.

I'm blessed with the fact that I've been spoiled enough by people to not deal with these responsibilities. Instead, through high-school and after as a live-in, I've been caring for an ailing friend of my family, with a laundry list of medical issues including cancer. They are unable to drive and slowly needed more and more help day to day. It was always intended for me to get a job or start school but it never seemed like the right time or life was just being an emotional rollercoaster or they especially needed more help. They have been nothing but generous to me throughout this for being there for them but recently have had their family willing to share the responsibility with me. This is the perfect opportunity I'm not going to give up. The last time I even had to think about a resume was Home Economics class in high-school and that really humbles me and reminds me how fortunate and spoiled I've been in the opportunities I've had.

Annual merit raises are between 3.5-4.5(5)% ish. I’m in a pretty niche field in a very small team (3-4 of us primarily, we can grab others to help but they don’t know half as much as the main team) and boring as hell position and I just got my 2nd kid (don’t think it matters).

I’m not super smart nor do I work crazy hours nor am I an expert in the position nor do I bring crazy new ideas or innovations.

However I am WAY better than some people who are my level or higher than me in my department. I have the super niche knowledge that will get 85% of the work done on my own and I’m not on anyones’s shit list. This year I have setup some processes and infrastructure that the team uses today that have served team members in other groups well and will be used in other programs later on in the future. I have built up contacts inside and outside the company to get the task done and I can count maybe 3 times I got stonewalled on a task and couldn’t finish it on time. We have more big program projects coming up and sustainment of the program me and my small team are working on now. I got “good words” given to my manager by senior engineers and other managers.

93k+12% will be 104k+. I don’t expect them give me 12 but compromise and give me 8%. One manager told me the budget is “tight” but they can try to make some back room handshakes. I know I’m not up for promotion nor have I really contributed something so big I deserve a promotion.

So my question is 12% outrageous to request given the circumstances? I got a meeting with my manager Thursday.

16t6rvj,I have a previous arrest record which had the charges dropped due to me taking diversion. Should I mention this during the interview process?,"Hi all, I need some advice for the job search. In the past I was in a heavily abusive relationship where I was physically/sexually abused for years. When I broke up with her, that was the first time I ever slapped her back during a fight (one of the biggest mistakes of my life). The police got involved due to her trying to kill herself to manipulate me into staying with her, and she mentioned me slapping her back to them as a ""gotcha"" for me breaking up with her. I was arrested for slapping her back since I'm a man and she's a woman, while she got off scott free for years of abuse.

  
Anyway, due to some other trauma/grief at the time, I opted to take diversion to simply get the charges dropped, rather than going through the emotional turmoil of fighting it in court. I succeeded in getting the charges dropped through diversion, but what I didn't realize was that it would still show up as a ""Domestic Battery"" charge in background checks, and even though the charges were dropped, it simply lists it as ""Diversion"" with no other explanation. I've had jobs since then that seemed to be fine with it, but lost at least one potential job due to the background check. I definitely plan on getting it fully expunged from my record in the future when I have the funds to do so.

16t6n11,"29, I just dropped out of engineering grad school and I feel so lost and dumb, what should I do?","For context, I graduated in 2017 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and went almost straight into the workforce with the first job that would take me, that of a Quality Engineer in the aerospace industry for a defense contractor. It wasn't what I wanted to do (I really liked doing modeling and 3D design in undergrad), but I was desperate for a job, and I wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth. I rapidly realized that it wasn't for me, but I was also dealing with some health issues at the time, so I was just happy to have a fairly low-stress and decently paying job that could let me go to PT and get my health figured out. Around late 2019, I was starting to make noise to friends and family about how two years was a good amount of time for a resume blurb, and that I was ready to move on in 2020, that it would be like ""new year, new me!""... well, we all know what happened 2020, and over the course of 2020-2022, I was just happy to have a stable job that would let me work remotely during the pandemic.  
  
Come last year, I kinda just woke up and realized that 5 years had passed since undergrad, and I was still in the same spot. I was promoted from a level 1 to a level 2, but other than that, I wasn't going anywhere at my job. Small office, small team, so not a lot of growth room, and other than mastering my basic routines of inspecting product hardware, organizing some databases, attending meetings, and doing some very basic root cause analysis, I didn't pick up any technical skills that would transfer to other engineering roles (or so I thought, to myself). I became deeply convinced that I had nothing to other another role or job, and I sort of just refused to apply to other jobs out of embarrassment. Instead, I had this idea lodged in my brain that if I just ""went back to school,"" I could refresh/enhance my skillset, and as a recent grad with some new practical skills, as opposed to a 5 year quality engineer, I would have easier time transitioning into ""some kind of"" other job, although I didn't know what that I was. People tried to convince me to actually just apply to other jobs and shoot my shot, but I had this weird combo of insecurity and pride that convinced me I was right.  
  
I have some major confidence issues (can you tell?), so I was also nervous about applying to grad schools, thinking that an average undergrad GPA would keep me out, but lo and behold, I not only got into some schools, I got into some pretty good graduate mechanical engineering programs! Major confidence booster. I told myself that this was the new plan, that I would go to grad school and come out of it a ""real"" engineer. I had no funding source lined up (my company said that they couldn't let me go part time in my current role), but that's ok, I would just take out loans and make it work (I am lucky enough that I don't have any loans from undergrad, so I have always been sheltered from the reality of debt... this comes into play later). I lined everything up for the move across the country, went out there, and started my semester as a full time engineering grad student, after being out of school for 6 years.  
  
It started off ok, but even very early on, I realized that there a ton of issues. Right off the bat, it hit me extremely hard: engineering graduate school has no room for refresher material or ramp up time. I know, I know, extremely naive of me. You pick up right where undergrad leaves off with very high level math and theoretical science, and I realized immediately I was in big trouble. I also got some pretty bad advice from my advisor and had picked up a full course load, instead of part time, so I was swamped basically immediately, with no breathing room to try and relearn old material to shore up for my courses. It was also from being confronted with this material that made me realize that I just didn't want to do it.... I came back to school because I wanted to be a different kind of engineer than I was, but I didn't want to be a nitty-gritty subject matter expert on advanced phenomena (or if some part of me did want to, I didn't want to do it when I wasn't ready for it, which I definitely wasn't). I also felt very isolated in my program... everyone else was either right out of undergrad, much younger than me, and very fresh in their knowledge, or if they were older (I was still the oldest) they were doing some kind of funded research program and taking classes part time, and were much less stressed than me. I also was living pretty far from campus, in a fairly small town, so I didn't get a chance to really meet or bond with anyone, and I started to feel really isolated really fast. And I sat down finally, to look at the numbers with my finances, really look, and I realized for the first time that it just wasn't going to work.... the money from the financial aid was barely going to keep me afloat in my already stretched living conditions, and that the loan afterwards was going to be far more gigantic than I realized. Whatever pay bump I would get in an engineering role because of a masters would not be that much higher than a role with a bachelors degree, this isn't doctor or lawyer money.  
  
I tried to fight through it as long as I could, to be an adult and be organized and be stoic, but as I tried to juggle too much from too many sides (the new coursework, the old material review, the loneliness, the looming financial stress), it kind of just hit me all at once, and I either cracked or felt myself right on the verge of cracking. I didn't sleep for 5 days (I still have trouble sleeping), I have lost 10 lbs in a month, I don't do anything fun at all... and all for something that I realized I didn't even want to do. If this was something hard, but I wanted it and I could do it, I'd push, but it was so hard for me, and I realized that I didn't want it, and I was spending so much money to do it, so I just sank further and further. So yesterday, right before the deadline passed for partial tuition refunds, I went to the registrar and student financial services and I dropped everything. Withdrew totally, and applied for a two-year leave of absence while I figure out what to do next.  
  
I feel so stupid. I thought that this would be an opportunity to reskill myself and ""find out what I wanted,"" but I realized too late that taking out a big-ass loan and not doing my due diligence on what engineering graduate work actually entailed is not the way to discover what I really want to do in life. Do I want to just lick my wounds and beg for my old job back? Should I apply for similar jobs at other companies? Do I swallow my pride and try to apply for entry-level mechanical/design engineering jobs as a 29 yr old with 5 yrs of experience in a non-transferable field? Do I even want to be an engineer anymore??  
  
I feel so lost and embarrassed and weak, and the worst part is that now I have a loan for a semester of grad school that I didn't even complete. I still have money from living costs that I never spent, and I should be getting a partial tuition reimbursement, so I managed to salvage something before I got too financially dinged, but in 6 months the payments start, so I need to get my shit together and find something well before then so I don't have to worry about that. I don't have a ton of savings, so I've been stressing about this for a while.  
  
What should I do with my life?... is the question that I can finally ask, after all this preamble and setup. In summary, I am 29 (turning 30 very soon), I have a 2017 bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering (with an aerospace concentration), I have 5+ years of fairly non-technical experience in quality engineering in the aerospace industry, I am a Certified Quality Engineer (CQE), I have an active US Secret security clearance for two more years, and all of my skills in other areas of STEM (math, science, CAD, coding) are either very rusty of non-existent (my coding is especially non-existent). I technically am now on a leave of absence from my grad school program for two years, so if I can pull my shit together, maybe brush up on old math and get a company to pay for it and do it part time, I can maybe give it another shot, but that's not my main focus right now. Scariest of all, I don't know what I want to actually do anymore, I was never that great at math, and I'm kind of afraid that I've always been faking it as identifying as an engineer, and I'm not cut-out for it. I need to come up with something within a few months so I can start paying off a loan I never should have taken out, and I'm now terrified that having a multi-month gap on my resume is gonna sink me in interviews.  
  
I know this has rambled for long enough, and I'm sure there's stuff I'm leaving out, and I can anser more questions as needed, but what should I do? Any thoughts, advice, admonishment, ridicule, support, ideas? Am I overreacting, just pumped up on adrenaline from what I just did?

16t5hr0,Doing a standard 90-day check in with my boss and my boss's boss. How to approach it when my boss has poor communication skills and keeps dropping balls?,"The 90-day check with my boss and boss's boss is standard with my company. My boss's boss wants to know (1) how onboarding is going (2) what does the company need to work on (3) what the company does well.

I'm trying to frame it in as a team we need better effective communication, and ***\[to boss\]:*** *what communication method do you prefer?* ***what he'll likely say:*** *talking and through the task management system,* ***what I need to say:*** *but you don't remember things talked about (examples A, B, C) and there isn't a task management board for this month, and last month when there was, you missed X and Y.*

However, with my boss dropping so many balls lately, my boss's boss has been stepping in more, thankfully. We've had a few work meetings and he's been providing me the clarification and insight I need, while my boss just sits there during these meetings and doesn't say anything.

**My boss doesn't communicate with me**: We have daily standups, and today he just didn't show and didn't tell me anything (which has happened several times before), so I wrote to him and another teammate: *hey can you please let me know if you can't make it or cancel the meeting so I'm not waiting on the call?* He didn't respond...

There's a lot of other examples but I'm not confident he is relaying important information to me. 

**He doesn't listen to me:** It doesn't matter if I tell him over email, chat or verbally - he doesn't remember what I tell him. It's caused a few fires in the past (which is why his boss has been more involved). I've been emailing him to cover my butt, but he doesn't read them.

I cannot do my job because of this man. Thankfully with his boss stepping in it's helping, but what happens if his boss stops stepping in?

&#x200B;

It doesn't seem like my boss is on a PIP, but I hope he leaves. Realistically I don't think they'd fire him, but I'm hoping he finds a new job.

16t5gdi,"Took on Boss's Responsibilities, No Promotion/Increase","Hi All,  

Bear with me, this will be slightly long for context details, and ultimately I know what my gut feels but would like to get some outside perspective.  I also apologize for the generalities in some things, trying to not be specific as I might be identifiable otherwise.

Approximately 6 months ago my boss moved to a different company and suggested I be their replacement for running our team.  We're one of three teams (and perform in a specialized capacity) in a department and I now have direct reports as part of this transition.  Previous to this I was their right hand person and handled much of the day to day while they handled the strategy (although I led enacting that strategy). 

At the exact same time this was happening, another management role opened up on another team (standard, not specialized) that someone at my peer level was promoted into (It should be noted that at our level my understanding is I was ranked at top performer rating per my boss).  While it was expected I'd be promoted as well, I instead was told that they were giving me this opportunity to prove myself. Announcement went out congratulating peer on promotion and me for my 'additional responsibilities'.   Additionally at this time, I was handling about 2-3x the projects of my peers and they fired another person, giving me yet another project to run as I was 'best choice' for it (although it was not something in my teams specialty but rather that of standard team's specialty).  Our team is also responsible for other special projects within the department that these other teams are not responsible for.   I am also the only person in the department who has ever been asked or has led a project for all three teams and crossed skill-sets.

I asked what it would take for that next level and was told they wanted to see A, B, and C.  A and B I was already doing, and C came with the addition of direct reports.  It was also implied to me that they wanted to see me take on the strategy side as well, but they verbalized I would not be held to the same standards as my old boss (who was two levels above me).  I'm not reporting to my boss's old boss directly (admin goes to someone else) but I do report to them strategically so it's an odd balance there where they both think the other is covering things and I have to tell them no, noone has told me things (including my performance review, I had to ask who was doing it).

Coming back to the six months later, I was expecting to receive the promotion (conversations in interim had said that I was on track for promotion but no actual date given), only to learn that I was not, and I am now on track for early next year for it.  When asked why, they said that 3 months (the time in which they did this initial assessment as part of our general scheduled process) was not enough time, even thought by the time we were having the conversation it had been twice that long.  I also received my merit increase at that time (nothing additional was given at point in time when I took over the team) and it was in line with what I likely would have received had my boss not left.  I asked for feedback, saying that I hit A,B,C with proof and also outlined my performance against our internal expectations for role (in which I was performing all those at the promotion level and a fair amount at the level two above).  I also compared myself to peers at my level and the level above and our responsibilities.

Again I was told that they just wanted to observe for more time.  That the internal expectations were just guidelines, and many factors else-wise were also considered, especially being that our team was specialized. The same reason, that specialty, was given as to why I can't compare myself with peers.   I also received some constructive feedback on my PPT presentations being too detailed for the audience level sometimes, but have never received this feedback in the moment and am unsure of how to apply it as they did not tell me instances in which it applied.  They again reiterated I was not expected to fully perform at old boss' level (again, two above what I am currently), even though all my new responsibilities are in line with what everyone at that level is responsible for on the other two teams.   They also want me more out of the detail, but I did not have anyone ready for the position I previously occupied (I'm getting them there!), so I'm performing these new responsibilities in addition to what I was already doing.

I have asked for written guidelines on what is expected for the promotion and for the performance at that level (which they said they would do but seems unlikely considering strategy plan I gave three months ago they still owe review despite me bringing up every 1:1).  I also asked for a larger increase and was denied blaming budget.

Some assorted theories that I and others have come up with on the whys are: that I was promoted last year (also late compared to the assessment expectations) so they didn't want to promote again too quickly because of optics.  They don't see me in a leadership role for some reason (but no-one really can theorize why).  My old boss heard it might be they want to see more strategy from me, but I'm often left off meetings where that could happen despite asking to be included (I honestly think they're not sure how to mentor me and so avoid it and hope I'll figure out on my own).   Noone has been able to point to anything in my performance being a detractor and while I was not ranked at the highest tier this time (which in itself is unusual because you're supposed to be ranked on current level, not expected, and hearkening back to the project load/other responsibilities I'm carrying I'm arguably performing far beyond my current role's duties), that often happens because they don't want to put people they aren't promoting immediately in that category.

Any suggestions on what I can do from here?  I love my job and the people I work with in general, but also don't like feeling taken advantage of, and the amount of stress/responsibility I have now is not commensurate with what I am being paid (we're known in our industry for being low paying but the culture making up for it).

16t0f53,Manager put me on a Personal Improvement Plan without any Notice,"So basically I have been working at this company and in this role for 2 years. For sometime my team didn't have a manager and they were looking for one. I was reporting into a manager on an adjacent team and she was wonderful and extremely helpful with coaching and development. After a few months, the company decided to promote one of my team members to be the manager of my team. At first I thought he was going to be great since he did a good job at helping me learn and showing me the ropes, but as time went on I noticed he wasn't a very involved manager in helping me develop and refine my skills. 

He would never give me any constructive feedback. Anytime he would pull me aside after a meeting he would tell me that I did a great job and sounded really confident. He also never brought up anything that I could work on in 1:1's and had them be strictly operational. There was never any call-outs or examples given to me on things I needed to work on. My manager is also located in the EU and I am located in the US. I understand there are cultural differences but I figured this is something that all managers work with their team on. 

Finally, my performance review comes and he tells me all these smaller interpersonal skills he wants me to work on. He mentioned going to HR for resources and to create a personal improvement plan. I pushed back on that idea and mentioned that it can lead to me being fired which is not ideal. I also mentioned that this should have been brought to my attention as time went on and he should have been calling this out. He admitted that was on him and he should have been working with me on these things. We discussed creating a plan to help me and to use HR as a resource. 

He then comes back a few weeks later with an entire Personal Improvement Plan and tells me that he worked so hard on this and that it is a good thing. This is NOT a good thing and the document basically says that if i do not improve in any of these areas then I will be fired. He then tells me the HR gave him the opportunity to fire me right then and there and he said that he sees potential in me to turn it around. The problem is... I don't know what exactly I need to focus on to turn it around. I am already looking for a new job in the meantime... the market is terrible and I'm having a tough time out there even trying to get an interview. 

I'm not even sure what to do in this situation. ",ProudLettuce,6,0.8700000047683716,18,1695763278,2023-09-26 21:21:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16t0f53/manager_put_me_on_a_personal_improvement_plan/,9,2023

16syokf,Advice for probation situation,"TLDR: Should he stay and hope to gain full time work or quit and take the pay ‘in-leau’?  


  
My brother has been working at a small company for 11 months. Originally he was on probation for the first 6 months. The manager said he was going to extend the probation for another 3 months as he feels my brother needed to improve. 2nd probation review came around and they said the same thing. So they extended his contract for a further three months. He is now two months through this three months.   
He has 20 days of holiday to use and has been told if he resigns then he will be paid these days ‘in-leau’ but if they terminate the contract he loses this cash.   
My advice to him was to have a direct conversation with the managers and ask if they will be extending him to a full time contract. They curved the question and he didnt push but in essence, they said they still think he has more to prove before they extend.  
In my opinion, this is corporate speak for ‘we are not hiring you’ and my brother also gets the feeling they won’t extend.   
I am aware they are a small company and supposedly are tight on cash (they have been trying to negotiate cheaper rates on their commercial rent, and on team socials, the managers have said they are tight on cashflow). So they could just be hedging there cash.  
My brother also has health issues (epilepsy) and has been having a few seizures which are potentially being affected by the stress of being still in probation. Potentially taking some time off could be good for him to focus on his health but equally he may be out of a role for a long time with the current job market.   
What would you advise my brother to do? Should he stay and hope to gain full time work or quit and take the pay ‘in-leau’?",geosmi1,1,1.0,0,1695759428,2023-09-26 20:17:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16syokf/advice_for_probation_situation/,9,2023

Before joining my current company i worked as an java spring boot developer for 3 months(internship) and then i got selected to my current company and am working as data analyst for 2 years now. Now i have almost don't have any recollections of my core and advanced java, spring etc. All i know i want to work in backend technology for a FinTech company. I have few things i cannot decide on. 
1. I wish to switch to software development preferred in java. But, should or should i not switch from data field to software field? Since, Most people say that much of software development will die out because of AI. Also, on the internet i always find articles and videos on ""how to switch from software development to data analyst/data science ""
2. I am absolutely clueless on where to start. Dsa? Java core? Spring boot? Microservice? Which of these should i focus on in order for the hiring person feel that i am bringing something of potential to the table. 
3. Should i remain in my current domain and build, i am absolutely not sure about the future scope of SAP ERP data analysis roles( how much relevant they can prove to be in my career). 

P.S. I need a mentor, if anyone of you feel that you can help me in anyway possible. I would be extremely grateful.

16swwev,Should I stay or should I go?,"I (24M) work in tech sales.  But not the fancy make over 250k a year tech sales you see online.  I make 52k base with 65k OTE, cleveland Ohio. Great company, great benefits, wfh or office, whatever I want.  But...I want to make more. 

My company is small, and have made it clear the room for growth is there...but will take a long time Unless someone leaves.

I have been in sales for going on 5 years but this is my first year in tech. Selling IT and cloud solutions.

On top of that, 3 people have been let go within the last 3 months, yet they also hired 2 others..basically theres a lot of turnover happenening out of no where. 

Highers ups assure us it's been the employees fault for ""character issues"" om why they were let go....but feels like they may be hiding something. 

There are alot of other companies I could work. Ive been eyeing some on LinkedIn, glassdoor, indeed and by a few people I know in other comoanies. Butagain, do I want to risk my position for a CHANCE at higher pay? 

I am not an exceptional sales man, I am your average seller. I always hit my KPIS, and I've hit quota 4 of the last 5 moths. No crazy numbers, basically right on par with what they want (last month went on vacation and then got covid on the way back so I was out for about 3 weeks, I can assume that's the reason I didn't hit quota)

I just bought a house, and have a 2 year old daughter and a fiancee that I take care of so a nice stable job is key you know. But I also have personal goals and I want to have more of a financial net in case anything where to happenthis oncome supporting 3 of us does not leave much wiggle room for anything. 

The grass is not always greener on the other side, right?

16swdis,I think my mom will abandon my family.," I dont even know how to start this.Its my first post ever.I'm writing this on my phone and English is not my first language so im sorry for any bad gammar, my hands are shaking so im trying to wrote and correctly as possible. 

So as the title said. My mom(43 F) was always the most communicating and just bright person in the family and i admit ive seen her cry and be mistreated by other people for her kindness, but I have never, and I mean never tought we will ever have and argument about something like this. I don't know how to explain this. My father (48 M) has not been at home often, and i don't mean he went out to bars or anything he is just very busy with work and work. He isn't the best at talking to us but he does make conversation and small talk. I must admit myself (13-14F) I suck at talking too i am really introverted and i can have a really nice conversation with someone close, but i guess me and my dad arent really close. So as I said my dad is very busy and my mom can't leave her trust in him. I have a younger sister (9F) and an older brother (almost 16 M). 

My brother has become a rebel, if i could say it like that, and he has been getting in arguments about the most stupid things with my mom.As example if she goes into his room and cleans up, puts his nasty clothes in the laundry or clean his desk, he makes a immense tantrum about it to the point he is screaming and she is trying to talk calmly to him, and so many more type of these. He has a computer he spends most of his time on daily and I mean first thing he does after he gets home from school is open it and use it until 2am or later. That has also made my mom start a talk about it which escalated into another argument.

My sister is young and she wants a lot of things and a lot of attention. She is in second grade and she needs someone to stay with her and help her with homework, otherwise she will take up to 6hours or more on homework. She is also a brat if i could say that. 

I don't get along with any of my siblings. I stopped talking to my brother years ago after he moved to another school and basically grew. He used to tell me to kill myself or just leave this house because no one will miss me. I never put too much toight to it i just refised tot alk to him so we became distant. That happened years ago, I'd say almost 5 years ago. My sister i just cannot stand, yes I am going through puberty and i cannot stand children in general but my sister is pretty stupid, no offense, I won't give examples to her because it doesn't really matter. 

About my father i can say he isnt the smartest person to be as the man of the house, he is good with constitutions but he breaks most of his and our aunts tools, but i wont get into that, its one of the reasons my mom can't put her trust into him. He is the type of person that only goes with his opinion and his choise and if you give him a better one he wont listen because he 'knows best'. Im not that close to my father for reasons.

My mother gathered us 3 tonight, my dad is at work he left 4 hours ago, and asked us each what we ate today. I got home at 5pm because of the train, and we each told her what we ate. (I should mention we live in the same yard as our grandmothers so we only have a concrete path between the houses.) My mother started first with my brother. They argued again about his room and the messu state it was in and so on. Our grandmother is aparently sick and none of us went otuside to help her do her chores and food. I had no ideea she even needed our help or that she was doing anything. I got home a little later so no one was out in their garden so i just went into my house and didnt pay much mind.  They 'finished' the argument  which was only my brother storming off and my mother faced me next, as the middle child. Then it just shocked me. She bursted out in tears, i almost never see her tear up. She explained to me how she doesnt feel like this is a family and how she feels like we're enemies living in the same home, how she feels lonely and how she is the only one that is doing everything in the house. She said that she will not return home and that she has her own salary and she has a place to stay and she could just not home, she said it all in tears. I just stared at her and couldn't say anything. I was shocked and speechless. I never wanted to see her like that. I never wated her to feel like that. I help her clean up after i come from school and I try to help her with food and a lot of stuff. Yes I do have my lazy days like today were i didn't do anything at all. But seeing my mother throw actual facts in my face just broke me. I dont know what to do. Im scared that she will actually leave us. I dont know who will she stay with but i hope sge just stays here with us and we can become again a happy family. But i dont know how i can do that. I don't know how i can take my father's role and do it better for the sake of our family. I love my mother and my father with all my heart and i know they're been through so much to be together and i know that Somewhere there they still love eachother. I just want to know how can I do better for her and us. I wish I can just go to my brother and slap him across the face and tell him to wake the fuck up and be grateful and just accept her and keep his words and srguments to himself and just be better but i don't have the courage to do that. 
I forgot to mention my mother is in some debts and she doesnt have taht much cash right now.

My mother sent me and my sister to bed and i could hear her crying after we left. It breaks ms and i dont know what to do. Im busy with school and im actually trying this year to study so i cam get a scholarship and to get into a good highschool but it will be so hard if she leaves and puts the burden of my siblings on me. I cant count on my father either, he works a lot and doesnt make that much either and when hes at home he soends his day in his garage/ work chamber doing whatever he's doing. Im scared to talk to them. Im crying in my bed right now writing this. I need to go to bed soon and i hope i can get some advices tomorrow. Thank you for listening to me🩷",2paisiderestulbobo,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1695754241,2023-09-26 18:50:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16swdis/i_think_my_mom_will_abandon_my_family/,9,2023

16sw0z6,Tale of two job offers,"
I have come to some of a cross roads. I have been blessed with 2 great opportunities for my career but I'm not sure what to take

Some background on me: I recently graduated 
With a degree in electrical engineering and am hoping to work in hardware as a career

The first job offer is where I am currently interning at Walt Disney Imagineering. The job is near my family in California (which is a good and bad thing, the relationship isn't the best with my family) and I love the team I'm working on. I also will be working in hardware which is the field I hope to stay in. However the pay is about 30k less than what my second job offer is paying (they are unwilling to match I have already asked) and I've heard from other engineers is that promotions and raises are hard to come by and that engineer get overworked and are really under appreciated at Disney (because well it's a media company not a engineering company). The job is not paying enough to live in the area (California is a high cost of living state) so I would have to commute over an hour everyday for work in order to live somewhere affordable. But the main worry here is being unable to promote and needing to leave in a year or two anyways because cost of living gets so out of hand

My second job opportunity is with Google ATL. The pay as I mentioned previous is 30k more in a much cheaper cost of living area. My fiancé currently lives in ATL so I would be close to him but he could also transfer to LA if I decided to go with Disney so that isn't a huge factor. However the role is in Cloud technologies which is rather different from what I want to do. I would be coming is as resident to learn the technology for 9 months before moving to a permanent role. The life style would much easier however because this job is hybrid so I get work from home days and promotions and raises at Google are much more common and I do feel I would be able to transfer internally to something more hardware focused after a year or two. My only worry is I would get stuck in something I don't want to do. 

Are there any engineers out there that can help me make the right choice?",abel_aa,1,1.0,0,1695753453,2023-09-26 18:37:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16sw0z6/tale_of_two_job_offers/,9,2023

16sty3r,How do I handle a higher paying job offer after I already accepted another job?,"Okay so this might be a little long so sorry in advance. I just graduated college and have been applying to many different jobs in my field (lab technician). After a long time of not getting many interviews and no offers, I received a job offer from a company I really liked. It was my first choice and still is and I just finished working my first week there. However, I just received another job offer from a company that I had interviewed with that is offering me 20% more salary than my current one.

I definitely plan on staying at my current job as it is a really good work environment, but I was wondering if there was any way that I can/should talk to my supervisor about this job offer that I received to see if they can match it somehow. My current plan was to first ask if they can match it. And if not, I was going to ask to see if they can give me a plan where if I complete certain tasks in the next 6 or so months they will then give me that raise.

Is this something that I should do or is it looked down upon to do this? 

Also I did want to mention that I did try to negotiate my current job's salary before accepting but was shot down. Despite this, I feel that if I was more persistent with negotiation they would've given me a higher wage. This is my first real job so I'm just not sure what to do here.

16stxzp,Scrum master - Not getting interviews,"I'm sorry to hear about your struggles in finding a new job despite your experience and certifications. Here are a few suggestions that might help you in your job search: 1. Networking: Connect with professionals in your field through LinkedIn, attend industry events, and join relevant Agile and Scrum communities. Networking can help you tap into hidden job opportunities and gain insights from others in similar roles. 2. Tailor your CV: Make sure your CV is well-organized, highlights your relevant experience, and clearly demonstrates your accomplishments as a Scrum Master. Customize your CV for each application, emphasizing the skills and responsibilities that match the job description. 3. Expand your search: Consider applying to a wider range of companies and industries. Look for organizations that are known for their strong Agile culture or those undergoing digital transformations where your skills as a Scrum Master would be highly valued. 4. Enhance your online presence: Build an online portfolio or a personal website showcasing your Scrum and Agile projects, case studies, and any thought leadership content you may have. This can help showcase your expertise to potential employers. 5. Improve your interview skills: Practice common interview questions related to Scrum and Agile methodologies, as well as behavioral questions that assess your leadership and problem-solving abilities. Seek feedback from previous interviews to identify areas of improvement. 6. Seek professional assistance: Consider reaching out to professional career coaches or resume writers who specialize in Agile roles. They can provide guidance on how to better present yourself and your skills to potential employers. 7. Stay motivated and persistent: The job market can be competitive, especially in larger cities like London. It's important to stay positive and persistent in your job search. Keep learning, stay up-to-date with the latest Agile practices, and continue refining your skills. Remember that finding the right opportunity takes time, particularly in today's job market.

16srm09,Been asked to be site HSE key contact during interim following redundancies at company (UK),"Hey everyone, how are we all doing today? 🙂  
  
Recently, our company has been acquired by new owners, with a large number of management being made redundant following the acquisition.  
  
I currently write procedures and work instructions, and have supported my manager with HSE-related things over the past year - implementing safety protocols (e.g. LOTO), reviewing and updating SOPs and other safety policies, creation, documentation and filing of various other documentation (particularly HSE related), Risk Assessments, Safety Walkarounds, reporting and recording Near Miss and Accident data, to name a few things. My former manager joked that I basically did his job for him - well, it definitely felt like a fair chunk!  
  
Anyway, now my former manager is going through the redundancy process, I don't currently have a manager as such. I've been asked by the directors to be the key contact for HSE on our site, with not really much guidance beyond ""When we know whats happening more, we'll let you know who you report to"" (paraphr.) - not very helpful really... I feel a bit stuck with the lack of direction, and training. I'm not IOSH/NEBOSH qualified or anything (I know they're not asking me to be a manager or anything, but still), and I'm worried that I genuinely dont know what to do with many things.  
  
Any advice on how to tackle this would be appreciated. Whether its things I can read up on to learn more to be able to essentially maintain the HSE dept. in the meantime, words I could have with managers, training to look for that wont break the bank, anything at all, I'd massively appreciate it as I'm overthinking it just a little bit!",deprecatedfreak,1,1.0,1,1695743351,2023-09-26 15:49:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16srm09/been_asked_to_be_site_hse_key_contact_during/,9,2023
16srm06,30 year old going back to school for engineering.,"(I asked this in r/engineering but figured I would ask here as well)

Hello, long time lurker first time poster.  


Due to a number of different circumstances I am going through a career change. I’ve spent the last 15 years(aka my entire work life) working for the family business which is light manufacturing. I’ve enjoyed my time but recently it's been obvious that it is time to move on to other things.   
Over the last 15 years I’ve taught myself welding, machining, some CNC programming, dabbled in 3d printing, become proficient at 3d CAD(which I really enjoy), implemented basic LEAN practices, designed, tested and helped market moderately complex mechanical devices used daily by thousands of customers. Handled scheduling, budgeting and managing a shop of around 4-8 employees. I’ve done sales, customer service, and on occasion scrubbed the toilets. All in all it's been a good run. I’ve also messed around with programming and I ‘m decently familiar with html, css, javascript, and a bit of C++(though nothing job ready)  
But as I said it's time to move on.  
After weighing my options and considering that I will have the financial means to, I've decided to go back to school. Which brings me to my main questions:  


Will a 35-36 year fresh engineering grad have a substantially more difficult time finding an entry level job then a 23 year old?  


Will my current experience and skill set be wasted by pursuing electrical engineering? My community college has an agreement with a decent 4 year school within commuting distance(still an hour away) but it is only a guarantee for the electrical engineering program. I can apply for other programs as well but the electrical is guaranteed if I maintain the required GPA. With that being said, would I be better off applying for mechanical or industrial, or heck civil ? Looking around the internet,  the consensus seems to be to go for electrical if you can, considering it has better job prospects. If I look at just the curriculum, industrial engineering looks like it's right up my alley (elec, mech, and some business) but that brings me to my next question.  


Of the major engineering disciplines, other than software do any of them lend themselves better to remote/hybrid work? I know it is the hot question of the year but me and my wife enjoy traveling and more importantly if given the option like to live in a more rural area.  


And last but not least do any of the disciplines tend to have better office/field work balance?

16sq8dk,"New manager ""hoards"" work, leaving me with not much to do. What should I do?","I (29M) work as a Finance Manager at a relatively large organization. We had a reorg about 4 months ago (the second one in a year lol). Prior to the reorg, I reported to the Director, who was really awesome. Now, I report to a VP. She's a genuinely nice person but she loves to hoard work.

I'm often left in the dark about a lot of things happening within our team and the deliverables our team is responsible for. I have not been involved with decision making tasks; that's something my new supervisor would work on. She would then put it together, show me, and then always say ""eventually I'd like you to take over this process"". As an example, we have many analyses to work on related to the budget and she's shared what needs to be done. But today, she basically created all the assumptions with numbers. Other times, I would submit an analysis, look at it a few days later only to see that it's been changed by my supervisor. Another time, I asked her if I could sit in on a meeting with some of the executives to understand what they're asking for so I can submit better reports/deliverables and she said no. At my previous company, I would sit with Presidents/SVPs/etc., and they soon learned my name and would trust me with certain tasks.

I've discussed this in our one-on-ones several times and her reasoning is that there's a lot of new deliverables being asked for and because it's very vague, she's taking it on with the hopes of passing it onto me in the future, especially when budget season comes around. 4 months in and I'm not sure what my role is. My previous supervisor was not like this at all. He was an advocate of explaining the end goal of the task (the audience/the why/the what) and challenging myself and his other direct reports on completing it, providing guidance when we'd get stuck. 

I've been actively looking for other roles but the job market seems tough at the moment.

16spfgg,"I, 20F, completed by bachelors this year (2023) in mathematics from a reputed university (India). Since then I have been very unsure about what to do next.","I completed my bachelors in mathematics this year in March and since then I have been very unsure what to do next. I know some popular options like - MBA, preparing for higher studies in mathematics or in CS, UPSC, data analysis, etc. But I am not interested in any one of these options.

I am that kind of person who can never really indulge into something unless I am really interested in it. Forcing myself to do something I don't like have really turned out to be very stressful for me. I experienced this in college when I was doing my bachelors. I never really wanted to study mathematics but did due to pressure from my family. And college ended up being really stressful for me, coupled with my other mental health problems - depression and anxiety, it was not a good experience.

At this point, having some job and planning for the future is both really crucial to me. To give you context - my family does not have any financial support from my father who lives separate from us. My mother is a housewife. I only have one elder sister. She has completed her bachelors and is currently employed. But her salary is not much. Plus, she has to work from a different city which only adds more expense. Currently, I am working as an virtual assistant. It does not pay much right now. I was hoping to look more into virtual assistant jobs but I have had no luck yet.

I would really appreciate other's people opinion and experiences in what to do in this situation. Whether there are some other good career options for me that I have missed or any other general suggestion you people have.

16so5k2,Rejecting a applicant for being abroad?,"I work in the travel industry. I have a graduate degree from a top university and have a wide range of experience in several different countries. I applied to few positions in June-July, and one of them just replied for an office-based position last day.

However, I recently left my office based position in UK to started a contracted tour guiding position abroad,as I am truly passionate about travel from organizing it in backstage to leading people on ground. It is good to let everyone know that reaching to me is hard unless it is a e-mail as I am on a jeep safari, hiking, cruising etc.

Long story short, this company reached out to me via e-mail and told me they have called me but couldn’t reach me, we exchanged couple of emails. They mentioned the position, and everything seemed good. They expressed a desire to call my given number, but since I am currently abroad, I cannot receive calls from the UK (I left my UK number at home and am using a local number instead).

 I told them about my current position as a guide and I suggested they can reach to my local number or my UK WhatsApp or Zoom to set a meeting basically any other online communication that except the number in my CV. 

However the moment, I informed them of this, they promptly rejected me via email out of blue within minutes.

Does this indicate that they might be a problematic company? I never seen such reaction from any firm before and I will move back to UK once my contract ends. How do you think I should feel about this turn of events?

16siffa,Transitioning to a new career,"I've been an English teacher for 4 years. I've got a license and on the process of completing my masters degree. I left my teaching position recently and pursued a career in the ESL industry, so I work from home now. I had a hard time leaving my previous job since it was my first and I was so attached to the students and school itself. I left so I can start anew and earn more. Now that I am in the freelance industry, I've realized that it's easier said than done. It's my 2nd week in this career and I can't help but think I made the wrong decision. I find working from home so boring, and now it feels like I'm stuck once more. I'm thinking of pursuing a job in the BPO industry, just to try something new. DO you think this would be a smart decision? or should I at least see this through?

16si4u6,Career change needed at 22!,"I’m currently working in Digital Marketing. I didn’t go study it, I started as an intern and grew from there, but I’m in an SEO position right now and I hate it. It sucks the life out of me. 

My partner and I have a goal that we want to live on a small piece of land in a few years, being self sustaining. 
And as time goes by I start seeing how sick this society is, capitalism and greed everywhere. 
And I feel I am contributing to that at my work, as we help companies (with no defined good cause) to make money. 

I physically cannot continue in this career anymore. 

My pay is good, I’d say. I can’t live on my own (splitting bills with partner), but we can’t really come by with less. 

So I’m scared no other entry level job will be able to make up my salary now. 

At the moment I’m really into gardening, vegetable gardening, recycling, etc. I want to do something nature related. 
I was thinking of growing my current photography skills and doing some sort of production for brands like wild life estates, gardening brands, etc. But it is something that will take time to grow. 

Any other ideas, please?

16shtap,"I was told I was being offered one job, turns out I’ll be offered a different job I can’t do and don’t want. Wtf do i do?","

This is gonna be a weird one. And a vague one? Sorry, identity protection stuff. 

Im mid 20sF btw. 

So, I’ve been working as a casual contract staff member in a small office of a big corporation. My role is pretty broad and I love the variety. I get to liaise with clients, do invoicing, some simple coding….I get to do a lot of problem solving and thinking on my feet. It’s a Jack of all trades support role for some client account managers - I can do half the work they do, and all the work they hate and I love. It’s in line with the career I want to pursue one day and the account managers I support are really cool and we’ve become pretty friendly. 

2 weeks ago, the regional manager for my office approached me and said he’d gotten a revised headcount and they were going to make my role full time on that account. I was friggin thrilled. I started coming in more to do paid training (at casual pay rates too which doesn’t hurt) while the regional manager sorted out the contract. They’d let the other casual staff know so they could put their names forward, but no one else was interested so it was essentially unofficially mine. 

Here’s the problem. 

The senior client account manager I work for/with approached me today and told me   She’d spoken to the regional manager and I wasn’t going to be offered the role I was told about. 

Turns out, on a different account, one of the client managers did a fuck up this week and it’s his last strike - he’s being let go and the regional manager is going to offer me his position instead.  Considering a lot of what I do now has crossover with the client account managers, it makes sense…..it’s an easy solve to a thorny problem. 

But (and this is gonna sound selfish) I don’t want to be a client account manager. Especially not on the account in question. 

Don’t get me wrong - it’s a friggin fascinating job. But the client account manager role has a lot of drawbacks. 

1: All the CAM’s are miserable. They aren’t paid enough for their work, they’re constantly overworked, they are insanely busy and always on call. 

2: The demanding nature of their role and the far more difficult technical work (and the fact they always have to deliver at that breakneck speed and perfectly because they’re chronically understaffed) is genuinely not something I’d be capable of. The role in training for now is difficult but not nearly as difficult as theirs. I do my best work when I have time to complete it….and the CAM’s never get time. I would absolutely bloody fail in an embarrassing fashion. 

3: (and most importantly) The client account managers have a super specific range of skills that are not easily transferable to other industries. Our industry is pretty small too, so once they’re burned out here they just end up in one of the other companies in the same industry….or back with the place they left. 
I don’t want to work in this industry forever, but the skills I’m learning in my current position are far more diverse and broadly applicable to the actual career I want to end up in. 

4: Less important, but back to the time point - my current role means I can continue my studies (part time online) and the CAM role wouldn’t let me do that. I don’t want to sacrifice my degree. The regional manager knows I’m studying (came up a month ago) but I don’t think they realistically considered that when they decided to bait and switch me. 

I have absolutely 0 clue how to work around this situation. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to get stuck in a career I don’t like, I want to finish my degree and move to what I want to do….

But my senior CAM has said (and she’s pissed off about this) that my role of client account coordinator is likely not going to be offered or advertised at all - the CAMs on my account are just gonna have to suck it up and work more. 

(Before anyone says anything - they don’t really fit into any of the unions they’ve talked to, and honestly they don’t have the time to even start one to try and change things.). 

Is there any way I can navigate this gracefully? I honestly feel a little like I’ve been bait-and-switched. I don’t know what to do. Im back in tomorrow and the regional manager is going to talk to me about it then….so I’m short on time and options. 

I know this is vague but any advice would be really friggin helpful im entirely lost. I would just apply for another job, and I will, but it’s a COL crisis where I am and due to how long it took me to work out what I wanted to do, my resume is mostly retail and some reception work.

16sg8ez,Safety Concern in the Workplace,"I work in the customer service industry. My place of work is unique in that we have a large population of regulars who spend hours there daily, as well as many people who visit multiple times a week. This is an outdoor establishment where dogs are allowed. 

Over the past few months, I've become increasingly concerned about several safety issues, including the condition of the wooden picnic tables that are not regularly maintained and have been sun bleached for years, the condition of propane fire pit tables used during winter months that are falling apart by the day, and certain first aid protocols that would be useful for staff to know. I had 3 meetings with my manager over the course of 3 months, and these concerns continued to go unresolved. I decided to take a break from holding these meetings because we were approaching a busy season and my manager was stressed. Over the past week, though, I have been feeling the need to revisit these concerns.

I was working on drafting up an email on my day off when I was made aware that a bench at my work place had broken while someone was sitting on it (they thankfully were unharmed). Now I'm definitely feeling the need to speak up again, but I also know I am dealing with a heightened emotional state, and I want to act rationally. 

I spent an entire day writing and revising an email that I finally felt good about. The email mainly addressed that I feel my concerns have not been acted upon, which resulted in someone almost getting hurt, and I would like another chance to express my concerns in a way I can be sure that they will be considered. I was planning on sending this email to my manager and the owner of the company (it's a small business, and that's the next level of hierarchy).

The next morning as I was about to send it, I decided to reach out to 2 coworkers to let them know what I was about to do. They immediately responded letting me know I shouldn't send the email and I should drop the issue. They didn't bother to ask about the content of the email.

Now I'm just extremely conflicted. My gut is telling me the right thing to do is to continue pushing for change. But I seem to be the only one in the workplace feeling this strongly about it. I will only be at this workplace for about 1 more year, and I'm honestly not confident I can instill long-lasting change. I'm questioning how worthwhile this is. I'm also extremely anxious at the idea of sending the email because I don't know what kind of response to expect. It has been eating away at me, and there has been a pit in my stomach for days. At this point, it would feel easier just to drop the issue like my coworkers suggested. But is that the right thing to do?

I think the main thing I'm looking for from this post is advice on how to figure out how to move forward. Not necessarily looking for someone to tell me what they would do in this situation, although I'm also open to that, but moreso how can I go about finding what direction I should move forward in?",Father_Rick,1,0.6000000238418579,0,1695710311,2023-09-26 06:38:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16sg8ez/safety_concern_in_the_workplace/,9,2023

I got to do a lot of cool stuff that typically someone so early into their career wouldn’t do. Salary was pretty good too (58K, 4 weeks vacation, and flexibility to travel and work remotely especially since my partner lives in the US and I live in Canada I get to spend long periods there). Shits hit the roof the last couple of months, we unionized but 65% of the people that work here quit (small team) I’ve basically lost everyone on my team and it’s just my boss and I. Nothings changed in the working environment and no one knows what to do but I think the few coworkers I have left are also gonna quit soon. We’re also running out of money but they keep saying we have enough to sustain ourselves just no plan on how and no plans to rehire the folks that quit. We’ve asked about severance packages but it doesn’t look like they’re laying people off anytime soon but the union is working on seeing if we qualify for employment assistance programs if we all quit. I’ve been causally looking at other places and found an organization that does similar work just not in the field I really like being in. I’ve been interviewing with them and it seems like a good offer (same salary though but it’s unionized and 4 days a week). I feel like it’s not a “move up” and I wouldn’t be advancing in the field I want on the other hand I could stay until the ship sinks and get employment assistance for a couple of months but an opportunity like this might not come up again in this job market especially one that gives me the freedom to hop countries.

16sbe41,What's a normal amount of time before they put you on the phone?,"Hi all, I (23F) worked through one week \*trial\* (paid) at this family business as a front house customer service. And it was going quite well, I was receiving compliments for my excellent memory of products  and common sense until the last 2 days of the week where they put me on the phone to talk to customers and I completely panicked. 

I didn't know what to say aside from basic greetings, they did not give me a script. And their system makes it really hard to search up products or even clients' company names so i struggled very hard to do help anyone out. and I don't know nearly enough about the products in just one week so I can advice people in what product they'll need. At the end of the week, they told me I wasn't the right fit for the job mostly because of my poor communication skills.

Can I ask is this something to be expected in sales/ customer services jobs? I admit I didn't try all too hard to fully memorize all the precise product codes, since I had thought it's only the first week. Surely they will let me answered emails at least before picking up the phone right? No, no emails, straight to phone. 

I've never had this type of job before, so my question is: is this just a bad family-run business with no real training process, or should I have tried harder during my first week and taking phone calls in first week is to be expected in admin/ customer service roles?

16s9k3b,Frustrated,"I am completely at a loss. After many years of working and dealing with the corporate world, I have come to see one common theme repeated over and over. 

The people that do the work, take the risks and make things happen tend to get left behind, while the guys that take a sideline role, limit personal accountability or risk, and actually accomplish little, get the promotion. It makes no sense, but is aggravatingly common. 

Case in point, three VPs I work with are each pretty good at what they do. A big project was kicked off that had broad impacts, with a material upside if it went well and all kinds of risk if things didn’t. 

One of the VPs took on a semi-advisory role. He played the sponsor, attended the meetings, gave advice, but took on no accountability for the work or the result. When problems arose, he was quick to escalate and blame, but took no corrective action. He was the master of crying wolf.

The second VP played completely hands off, would present an update now and again, but essentially did nothing. He played the part of being in charge when things were going well, and “helped” by aligning a few of his employees to the work when issues came up. The help was always a distraction, or worse an impediment and had to be worked around.  When he was presented an issue to solve, it was always “I will go talk to the team”, which meant go complain to the third VP.

The third VP dove in and drove the program. He was with the team shoulder to shoulder, dealing with issues, blocking and tackling and basically getting the work done. He took the risks, if things failed it was on him and he knew it. Long hours, hard days, crazy stress. At the end of the day, it all came together and the project was a success.

16s862e,"Same job, higher pay","Hi everyone,

So I recently started a new job (almost 1 month) but I was browsing and saw they have posted several  job openings in my role. WITH a bonus and a salary scale, which on the higher end is $2.88 more than what I was given (I got the highest amount at the time I was interviewed, negotiated). The lower end of the scale is what I get currently get paid. Granted, it is a different location (they’re all very saturated) and the scale is ambiguous but I still think it’s bull. 

I am on a 3 month probationary period so I’m not sure if I should bring it up to my manager or just count my loss and keep an eye out for other opportunities in the future. I know this job isn’t where I want to be and only see myself here as I get my hours to get my license, which is about 2 years.

I’m open to any advice.

16s7bbm,"Burnt out after two weeks, what now?","Currently I work as recruiter for blood bank and I am incredibly done with them after only 2 weeks. Their expectations for what I can realistically do are ridiculous and they're constantly belittling the people over me. I have an account manager I really like who they treat horribly because they can't reach their unrealistic expectations. I've been working nearly everyday because we are extremely understaffed due to high turnover. 

I was working in marketing as an assistant for a year in my last job which had the same problem of turnover. Maybe I just have extremely bad luck or I'm not built for marketing or sales...

The company itself is known for having people leave in droves and burning through people quickly.

I thought I could handle it but these extremely high expectations are incredibly annoying!

I like actually feeling like I'm good at my job rather than I'm trying to push a boulder up a mountain...

So what do I do now? I have one year of marketing, administrative experience, and 4 years of event coordination experience under my belt.

16s77a2,Too late to reply?,"I received an interview for an insurance company in NYC about a month ago, but the platform I applied to them on didn't ping me with the message they sent regarding scheduling an interview.

They both still have availabilities in the links, and I'm contemplating on whether or not I should just schedule, show up, and see what happens. I already emailed the recruiter back asking if the position is still available, apologizing for the late response, and whether I should still schedule on the links provided.

They only do interviews on a specific day of the week, with time slots open. The last interview I can sign up for is the last week of October, according to the scheduling software. Because of this, I want to think I'd be find scheduling the interview and showing up, but at the same time I feel like maybe those were just preset dates by the software, and that they may already be done with interviewing candidates.

16s6yiz,Unemployed for 3 months and starting to have serious concerns about my career future,"I'm a competent engineer with good connections in the medical device industry in an area that is a medical device hub of the United States and I've been unemployed for 3 months and I'm not landing any decent interviews, let alone any job offers. I don't have a bad history like getting fired and I only have a few enemies in the industry I worked with that were only probably only jealous of me for petty reasons (being a single guy, having a nice car *(that I saved up for and worked hard for)*, etc.). So after 3 months of getting super low balled by recruiters (I'm talking entry level engineer positions and half my previous salary rate) and getting multiple rejections from internal HR, I'm seriously starting to regret pursuing engineering and also getting my MBA. I've made some lifestyle changes for now to hold me through this rough patch but the stress is building as I burn through my savings. At the same time, it's challenging to stay positive and confident while I'm interviewing. With the extra free time that I have, I can't even enjoy my multiple hobbies that I've been neglecting for the past 10 years. I can't even think about getting back into the dating scene until I figure this situation out. I know things could be a lot worse... I'm lucky to have my health, my family supporting me, and good friends. I'm sure I'll get a job eventually and it may require me to take a step backwards in level and pay but I'm still holding out for the job I believe I deserve for now. The part that sucks is not knowing what's gonna happen next.

Career background:  
Worked in medical device industry for 18 years. Started with a biomedical engineering degree and recently graduated with MBA in a full time employed program (both from reputable universities). I've worked for 3 major companies. I left the 2nd company because of a highly toxic environment and because of a jealous manager who played favorites with his direct reports. I left company #2 to a contract position at company #3. My 2 year contract ended and they couldn't renew my contract because of some stupid employment law. I had no opportunity for a full-time conversion because of the current company acquisition; new headcount was frozen. My manager hired me back, on a 2 year contract again after 6 months had passed. 2 years later, I still couldn't get a full-time conversion because of multiple factors; team restructuring (they were hiring more junior engineers, more senior managers so I didn't fit anywhere in the team), and as a principal level engineer my manager came back to me and said that he can't convince the team to convert me because I'm not a specialist in any engineering area that they are looking for (statistics, FEA, Test Method Validation). He never brought this up in the first 3 years I worked for him and my coworker believes my manager failed to develop me. I was successful in completing the work and the project objectives while I was there, so again, no red flags or issues.

Conclusion:  
All I can do now is keep looking and applying to openings and stay positive... Easier said than done though for the ""positive"" part.

Some friends are suggesting that I expand my industries but from my experience, this will be a more difficult transition compared to other engineers. I've observed engineers from automotive and aerospace entering the med device industry no problem but I don't think it will work the other way around. It's difficult enough for me to get R&D and manufacturing positions in medical device as a medical device engineer. A lot of my rejections come back saying ""we are considering other applications with prior experience with similar products"".

16s6opa,"I am currently ""working towards"" a raise, but have also been saddled with additional work that I believe constitutes a raise (apart from the things I'm working on to earn aforementioned raise). How do I tactfully ask for a raise in this situation?","Basically, I was given a raise and title promotion 5 months ago. I was making $38k and was offered a raise that brought me up to $42k. 

I told them it was below my expectations/market value for the work I was doing, and that I was looking to get closer to the $50k mark. They came back with $45k and also wrote out a list of ""core competencies"" I need to reach to earn the $50k salary in their eyes. 

These ""core competencies"" were kind of vague and not tasks I can complete on my own without being given a specific opportunity to do these things by leadership. I was told we would outline an aggressive growth plan to get me to a $50k salary quickly, but 5 months later and that has not happened. I'm constantly praised for the work I am doing by many people in my organization. When I ask about my career development, I am told I am ""on the right track.""

One of my coworkers just put in her notice and her workload is being moved around to a variety of people, myself included. For context, this coworker is in a completely different department than me. In the time I've been at this company, I've helped take on a lot work from her department, and I'm good at it. But this work is not in my job description. I have already been told that I am taking on one of her largest accounts, on top of all that I already do. 

All of this is to say - I believe that I deserved to be paid $50k 5 months ago, and didn't get it. I have not yet achieved all my ""core competencies"" to earn that 50k, but now I'm being given new tasks outside my job description...

16s3pdk,Is trucking a bad career choice?,"I currently work as a bank teller. On paper it's a great job, steady hours, good pay and benefits, not too difficult of work to do. My problem is that I'm not the most sociable person and forcing myself to be social is exhausting. I've tried talking to my boss to see if there's other positions within the company that would have me dealing with fewer people, but that's gone nowhere.

Me and a buddy got talking the other day and we're both unhappy with our current work situation, so we came to the conclusion that we would like to try our hand at trucking. There's nothing really keeping us at home, we have a similar work ethic, and we can handle being around each other for long periods of time.

I've heard from a couple people that it doesn't make as good money as someone would expect it to make. As long as my take home is roughly 2k/month I'll still be able to have somewhere to come home to. Can I at least expect to make that much doing it?

What attracts me to trucking is that I get to see different places and get paid to do it. I also loved any job I've had where I get to drive, I'm comfortable behind the wheel of just about anything.

My plan is to do trucking for a few years until I find somewhere I want to settle down. Then either continue trucking or branch out and open a business that would allow me to be home more often.

I've got time before I make a decision, we're meeting up in December to come up with a plan.

About 6 months ago I applied to a position that was advertised as Azure Cloud Engineer. I got the job but once offered, they changed the title to infrastructure tech analyst. Not only that but also the function of the job is really entry level and goes more in hand with the analyst title. 

I definitely felt cheated but overall the pay actually is quite good so I decided to stick with it and see what it really was all about. 

Now I want to look for another job. I am not sure which title to put on my resume and job applications.

But I'm also afraid a background search would bring up the analyst title instead which frustrates me, as I said, the job postings from the company all said engineer, and all the other new jobs related about they post about also use the engineer title. 

Would it be disingenous and risky to use the engineer title on my new job search?

One day, I simply couldn't open my editor and write code... I had burned out entirely, and still face the same issue today.

I decided to try working in a casino. While the work is ""fun"" and I earned more than I did as a software developer, the hours were long.

16s1gku,What are good questions to ask in an interview to get an idea of the work/life balance and stress level?,"My current job is pretty chill with low stress, it's honestly the only job I've had since starting my career that doesn't feel like it's actively damaging my mental health. It has its problems though and I'm feeling bored (where's the happy medium???). 

I was reached out to by a recruiter about a job that sounds way more interesting to me and pays about 15k more. I would like to make the change but I'm terrified that I will lose the work/life balance I currently have. 

This new position would be much more similar to the last role position I had that caused stress and anxiety but I believe that stress was a result of the company and not my position. The company itself looks much more similar to my current company that I like. 

Things that caused me stress before include: 

* It was a small business that wouldn't hire enough employees for the work load so things way outside my job description got dumped on my plate constantly. This new position would be with a large consultant firm similar to the one I currently work for. 

* The business was having financial issues and wouldn't give me the resources I needed to perform well. I eventually left when I saw them struggle to make payroll each week. 

* I wasn't actually qualified for the position but they hired me because they figured they could get me on a discount because it was an exciting jump in my career. I was led to believe I would be working with another PM that was more qualified but they fired her after I got up to speed and I learned that was the plan all along.  

* I was also led to believe that I would be working much more closely with my boss but he rarely got involved. 

What are some good interview questions I can ask to avoid the terrible situation I left 2 years ago? 

What are other terrible job situations I should be aware of? 

When the business was falling apart my last boss would always say, ""there are small business problems and large business problems, you have to pick which ones you'd rather deal with."" I've pretty much determined that I'd rather deal with the large company problems.

16s13se,22 No idea on a career path.,"Hi everyone,

A little background on me, I graduated high school, attended just under two years of college and dropped out because I simply wasn’t interested in what I was going for anymore (criminal justice). I’ve been working at the same restaurant for 6 years now and before that 2 years at a grocery store. Currently a manager at the restaurant and pull in a less than reasonable wage, and in correspondence with that too much of a workload to warrant the pay. 
  I took a stab at IT studying frequently and thoroughly to achieve a base A+ certification but just with college I found myself surely lose that interest again. I feel as if I get really excited about certain paths and for a bit go after them, actually excited to go study for them and delve deeper. But almost on a routine schedule that interest suddenly *poof* disappears. 
   So I guess what I’m left with is a diploma, 8 years base work experience, 2 of which are in management and 6 in food. Only certification I have is a base( lvl 1) PIC certification for a restaurant manager. 

I feel so incredibly lost and I feel as if I’ll be stuck at this restaurant indefinitely. Not because I don’t have the drive to try something new , but that I fear I’ll delve into something new and end up losing interest again and I don’t want to waste any more time or money.

Any suggestions on career paths? I love helping people, solving issues, hands on is not an issue for me, I’d prefer to have a nice work life balance. Currently work 45 a week which is fine. I like technology(like to game sometimes in my free time), mechanics(work on my motorcycle and when I replace something or fix an issue it’s very rewarding, although can be stressful)

16s0uwi,Uninformed and Upset,"So I'm a 26 F lead Evs worker at a clinic. First off, my job switched companies back in October of 2022 so now we're just contracted workers at the clinic I work at.so, recently I had a little predicament with one of my supervisors. I had came into work early so I can pick up trash because a bear had got into our dumpster. So I did and I was texting her how should I fill out my time card so I can get my call back time (basically just OT) if I should fill it out as the time we worked or should I put down 2 hours. Now the 2 hours is because when we were interviewed (before the switch) we were told that we would get 2 hours OT no matter how much work we did. So if we only worked 30 min we would still get 2 hours of OT. So she was confused about that and I explained it like i did right above. And she proceeds to tell me it's only 1 hour. So obviously I'm taken aback because we were never informed of this update nor is it stated in our contract as far as I'm aware of. Mind you they did update us when they were taking away our shift differential pay. So I texted her back saying ""It's always been 2. Even when we did interviews we were told 2 hours."" ""If it is 1 hour we were never informed of that and I would need to see that in writing or where it is stated in our contract."" I still haven't gotten a response to that though. So I'm wondering what the next steps should be? Is this something I can take to HR?

16s0i9m,Are software dev bootcamps worth it?,"Hi everyone!

Thank you for the time to read/respond!

I'll add the question here and get into the weeds more below.

Is it viable to find a decent job on entry-level experience if I complete a few bootcamp courses? What kind of roadblocks might I expect? Is it worth it? Any suggestions on a direction I could get into with room for growth with a lower bar of entry and decent wage?

Just some background:
I have been working for the last two years for a small software company as a technical support agent. In fact I am the only tech support agent at this time and support a decently complex application as the first point of contact for clients and I handle 80% of the bug reports and feature requests for our dev team. I also handle most of the q/a manual. Im 35 and feel super late to the game. In my role, due to the size of the company I have found myself working on many aspects of the app.

All very entry level but, I have found myself tasked with many areas such as manual q/a, Autmated testing (Ghost Inspector/selenium), basic html and css, documentation review and article updating, bug/feature/user story ticket writing and review, jira and hubspot, Rest and Restful API on various integrations between payment processors, DocuSign, and other types of integrations. I have had a small introduction to Ruby on rails, React, SQL and Java/Javascript. I found that I am decent at learning in this arena and really enjoy most aspects of it. I want to grow.

The company is not feeling very secure at this time, we are pretty slow right now and I do not see any room for future growth. Our COO is an old friend. He does not have a degree and has been pretty successful here. He seems to be more of an outlier than typical, however. He suggested taking on a boot camp or two and pursuing this career further. Thus my question above!",WrongdoerImaginary66,1,0.6000000238418579,1,1695668004,2023-09-25 18:53:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16s0i9m/are_software_dev_bootcamps_worth_it/,9,2023
16s0i1t,Don't like my career choice: what are my options?,"I (22) have a degree in Information Systems Management. I liked several of my college courses, particularly those that were database oriented or dealt with ms excel and access. 

I had an virtual internship with a large company my sophomore year of college, in Data Analytics. I loved the work and the dynamics of the job, but the woman I worked with expected far too much out of me as a full-time student with another part time job - to the point that she would express disappointment in me if I did not continue working with her past my scheduled hours. I addressed this with my supervisor and little changed, so I decided to not renew the internship. 

My junior year, I reached out to a connection at a local tech company about a possible internship, because I knew their intern > employee turn around rate was good. He said they only had openings for software development interns. I only knew python and sql, and told him I didn't want to be a developer, so I wouldn't be a good fit. He assured me that the interns worked closely with current developers, and that it was not a difficult task. He also told me that if I completed the internship I was almost guaranteed a position at the company, development or not. 

I did the internship and was hired in May. I was told by the owner that for the first 6 months or so I would solely focus on getting certifications, and doing odd job tasks until we both knew where I would fit in (paid of course). I'm now about 5 months in, have gotten 2 certifications, and have been really struggling to get the third. It's incredibly difficult, and not something that interests me at all. I have a feeling they'll want me to be a system administrator or a product owner, upon completing certs and being placed. Thing is, I've done work in both areas for them, and I don't like either. In fact, I actually hate it. The thought of waking up and doing either for the rest of my life makes me physically sick. I'm not sure where to go from here. I ask people, and they just say ""oh, you're young, you'll figure it out"". But I don't feel like that's happening. 

What career options do I have without going back to school? I enjoy Data Analytics, and loved all of my marketing courses. However, my company's marketing department is full, and they don't seem to have a position in our directory related to data.

16ryeo2,Asking for a Raise / Retroactive Pay??,"Hello everyone,  
  
Question / advice needed. I graduated university in 2022 and have been working in my related field for just over a year now. I started a new job (moved cities) almost 6 months ago now. When I was hired, I was told via email that my wage could be reviewed after 90 days. I have requested my “3 month” check in 3 times now since, my boss didn’t even acknowledge my last request for the check in. I have taken it upon myself to book this into his calendar myself as it has nearly been 3 months past my 90 days (he typically books ALL appointments himself)  
  
My meeting with him is this Thursday. I have been wanting to request a raise of atleast 5%, and am wondering if its fair to ask for my raise retroactive since I have been requesting this meeting for nearly 3 months. Or atleast meet somewhere in the middle with retro (i.e. last two paycheques or something), I get paid Semi- Monthly so approximately 6 paycheques will have been missed since my 90 day mark.  
  
Please let me know your thoughts. For some additional background, I have a Bachelor’s Degree and Paralegal Certification, live in Canada, make $4,000 per month (pre tax) working at a law firm as a Paralegal. A 5% raise would take me to $4,200 (pre tax). Generally, I pay $200 a month for parking, and a raise would partially cover my parking.

Towards the last part of the boot camp I realized I liked back end engineering better and started focusing more on that. Because of this my front end skills have deterioated. But seeing the market and sentiment for tech jobs, I feel like if I decline this offer who knows when I would get an engineering position, could be a month, could be half a year, could be a whole year or longer. My worry primarily comes from the idea that if I accept the offer, move to the new state, and do not meet their expectations I will be fired and in unkown state without a job.

Pros: same pay, no on-call, less oversight, less regulation and longer deadlines.

I should mention that this other department doesn’t have the same turnover mine does.

Cons: no on-call means no overtime (I can get 15-20 hrs overtime when I’m on call which is one week every 1-2 months), less coworkers means less social interaction at work, I also would not be working with the same population (kids) which I do enjoy interacting with, and I kind of enjoy being busy (I might go a little crazy with nothing to do).

16rvatd,I [26M] have no clue what I want to do next?,"This is long but to avoid all of my background just jump to the last paragraph.

  
So a bit of history before I get into my dilemma. I left high school mid 2014 after 5 years there (could have done 6th year but decided it wasn't for me). I had the intention of working towards being an architect but lost interest in that fairly quickly after leaving high school.

  
What followed was just under 5 years of unemployment and no motivation to do anything with my life, I applied for basic admin jobs here and there and I will be the first person to admit I was lazy and wasn't properly trying (I had a lot going on with coming to terms I was gay etc., I know that's not a good excuse but it was part of it).

  
Eventually in March of 2019 I was interviewed for a basic admin position at a relatively local company which I accepted. The work I was doing wasn’t too complex but I enjoyed what I did and my co-workers were nice enough (I wouldn’t call any of them friends but they were okay to work with). I moved up in the company when someone else left and eventually became responsible for the company purchasing, it was essentially a more complex admin job so I didn’t mind. The couple issues I had while working there was the computer system and way of working was fairly outdated (too many manual processes etc.) Management was also an issue, they were fairly bigoted in their opinions and made the environment fairly toxic, it did take a toll mentally but I was able to get on with my work even though I did dislike my managers. I should also point out this lead to a lot of people leaving the company.

  
Just before covid the company I worked for was sold to a larger parent company, they didn’t get involved at first but once things started to get safer then the changes came. A lot of them were good, they removed the toxic management and made some systems easier (still not great though). However when they installed a new manager in our office which is when the real problems began, this person was incompetent, they were the very definition of rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic and if anyone spoke against them they would be reported to HR with no questions asked. It was at this point I stopped giving a fuck and made no attempted to pretend to like this person, eventually they picked up on it and I was took into a meeting with them where they did talk to me about my recent attitude change. I’ll be honest I made the decision to hand in my notice the moment I walked into that room. I sit and listened to how they spoke to HR about me and they were told to sort it in house, I admitted I did have an attitude issue with them and gave a faux apology just to end the meeting. I handed in my notice the very next day citing the manager as the exact reason I was leaving. I worked my four weeks notice and left.

  
Cut to last week where I after being interviewed started at a new larger company doing something similar to what I was doing before just with more responsibility. When I entered I immediately knew the place wasn’t for me, the people were nice enough even though nobody had worked there over 3 years (I thought that was strange for a long established company) and the management actually seemed really nice and supportive which I was not used to. My issue came when it came to looking at the work I was doing, unlike my previous work place where there was an old fashioned way of working this place was even worse. Every piece of paperwork had to be generated manually and something which could have taken 10 seconds in my old workplace would take this new place at least 30 minutes. I didn’t really feel like I fit in with the people who worked there even though it was only a day of knowing them (I’m not really a guys guy and these were all fairly typical guys guys). 

  
I felt my anxiety fire up the moment I was doing this work and interacting with anyone there (more than a usual first day working somewhere) and I know people are going to judge me for judging this place too quickly but after my first day I decided to inform management that the place wasn’t for me and I think I have jumped into something too quickly and I’d rather let someone else have the opportunity. Management was actually really understanding and accepted, I didn’t have to go back the next day and that was that.

  
So this is where I’m at one week later, I think I’ve been put off working in an office environment for life after my experiences at these workplaces and now have no clue what to do with myself, I should point out I don’t need to find a new job quickly as I have a lot of savings put by from my first job and not a lot of outgoings (still live with my parents etc.). I just don’t know what my next step should be, I have been looking at colleges and universities but I have no clue what course I would do. I feel like I'm at a crossroads where my next choice has to be the right one for me and I have no clue what that is.

I got masters at econ and an MBA(top 20-10% marks), but I only recently understood that it's not enough to just go and land a good job. I don't have any advanced/specialized technical skills as I always assumed you just learn enough while studying and specialise on the job, and you get one pretty easily having cool degrees.

Now I have a choice of hundreds of different entry level job titles, most of which feel like I won't be able to land because of lacking some tech skill. But also I can't really decide what to work towards since it will take me at least months to learn and nothing really grasps my attention. Plus the labour market is ducked now so I don't even know if I can land something even if I concentrate on it.

I succeeded getting a job as a PM/BA but it's extremely whacky and I don't even know if the experience I am getting here is of any relevance at all(my management can't seem to decide what to do with me and I just screw around trying to be useful).

Any advice on how to make a solid first step which can be grown into a career? I live in Toronto CA.",Far-Print7864,2,1.0,13,1695655337,2023-09-25 15:22:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16rv111/how_do_you_start_working_white_collar_jobs/,9,2023
16rugi3,About making a decision and not changing it,"Hey, I gave advice in a post in a similar subreddit before, because I really felt it was helpful but I feel more hesitant after the comments saying it was bad advice. I hope people with more experience maybe can help me.   
I don't know what I should get into...  
Just choose something for safty and think more about it later? CNA seemed good but because of the feedback I got, I feel like I maybe should put more thought into it.  


I had a very smart friend when I was a kid and she inspired me to want to go to university, so I've always aspired to that. Now, years later I finished one year. I liked it but made a mistake so now I don't know if it is the right path for me anymore, though I'm still thinking about trying again, but nursing this time. I feel like I might be a little dumb, some people look down on me, so probably. I try to improve.. I think I should accept I'm more fitted for something else, maybe that will be more helpful for me in the end. Less stressfull. I could always take courses on the side.  
I was sure about CNA because of the flexibility, and it feels rewardning as long as it's not too stressfull. But I end up thinking about the potential of what something could lead to in the future..I think I'm at least a little ambitious. Now I'm also considering baking, gardening or caretaker/property maintainance.   
What are the pros and cons about these jobs, which one of these would you recommend? I don't know  what to do and I feel lost, and I need to decide soon.  
Thinkning about baking even though I never bake, I like the idea of learning a handcraft, like art. And it seems fun. But I'm a little afraid of the hours. I am leaning towars gardening or property maintainance, is it a decent job? I like to be moving. I also like to work together with people.  I wish I could just choose and be done with it, I'm probably overthinking. Also, I'm 26.

16rucmx,Is an MBA from a no name school worth it?,"Considering getting one from a place down the street from my house. A few key selling points are that they don’t require letters of recommendation, it’s within walking distance, and really affordable. 

I would like to use the MBA for two main things. 

First, I want to do some side work teaching at the local community college and they require a masters degree. 

Second I’d like to leverage the MBA to get into a more strategic role. I’m currently an accountant looking to increase my earnings potential and take on more leadership responsibilities. I currently have about 6 years of experience and don’t foresee myself advancing much more on my current trajectory. 

I know how MBA’s normally work, especially with top programs. The real reason you do these is to get in with a consulting shop like MBB or another large firm. Then do a couple years there and you pivot to a high paying cushy executive role.

I have zero faith I could get into a prestigious program, and even if I could the price tag makes it very unappealing. I don’t necessarily want to be an executive at a F500 company anyway, I just want to have a leadership role and some decision making opportunities, and make more than $200k.

Anyone have thoughts? Would this be a worthwhile move? What could I do during and after the program to maximize my opportunities?

It's physically taxing and we're getting additional hours on random days during the week now because of Labor Day. I've had enough, my mental health is in shambles and I think I'm ready to quit right now and simply can't continue another day.   


I've paid rent for 1 month, I don't have enough saved up for a second month of rent but I may be able to ask my sister for help on that to just squeeze out 1 more month of rent. Am I giving myself enough time to secure a new job or am I being an idiot and should just stay here until I already have one confirmed and lined up. It's really draining on me so hard to continue working here but what would drain on me even worse is being jobless for 2 months and unable to pay rent or for food.

16rklhg,Moving Cities & Raise?,"I have a bit of a peculiar situation and any advice would be appreciated. 

Context: I (24, if that matters) was hired 4 months ago as a market research analyst for a private-capital-backed group that builds and buys businesses in a variety of sectors (legal, accounting, media, property etc). 12 months ago there were 10 employees, now there are 150. Although my title is market research analyst, given the nature of the group I end up doing a lot of other research, business strategy, business growth, and miscellaneous tasks (data analysis, lead generation, and so on) that don't normally fall under the traditional market research role. I am also the only market research analyst at the group, and my workload is about to pick up a lot as we transition into a new investment cycle for some big projects we have ongoing. We have an office in my current city, but about 1/3 of our employees don't live in my city, and for those that do, a lot choose to WFH or hybrid anyways. I go into the office 3-4 days a week, but I am one of the few that do this. 

Situation: My partner recently got a great job offer in a different city, and starts in late Feb. We don't have an office in this city. I want to bring it up to my boss and ask if they are okay with my moving there. I don't anticipate this being a big issue, as so much of the company works from other cities anyways, but I'd imagine that they ideally don't want me to move. This new city has higher costs of living by maybe 15-20%. 

Dilemma/advice: I want to tell my boss that I want to move to new city. Ideally, I'd also want my salary to be increased to match the higher COL. Although, I'm not sure how to ask for this, as they likely don't really want me to move in the first place. Secondly, I was already planning to ask for a raise at the end of the year. I'm doing a lot more than the job title suggests, and they seem to really like my work. Is it really possible to move, get a raise, then an additional 'raise' to match the higher COL of my the city? How would I go about asking for all this? Is it crazy, given that I'm the youngest employee and I've only been there for 4 months? I'm unsure how to go about this. 

Also, there is one other consideration. When I was interviewed I was told by HR that there is the possibility to receive a discretionary bonus of up to 20% at the end of the year. I have no idea if this ever happens, if it is commonplace, or if I should expect to receive a bonus. There's also no one to really ask because there were only a handful of employees at the end of 2022. But if I did receive a 15%+ bonus, I think my compensation would be pretty fair, and I wouldn't need to ask for a raise (but I would want my salary to match the higher COL). 

TLDR: I want to ask to move cities, get a higher salary to match the higher COL, and ideally achieve an additional raise (or bonus at the end of the year).

16rjn42,I think I'm a mess.....,"A bit of a backstory. I'm 24, I have a health science degree. I graduated in 2021, worked as a consultant for 2 years, went back to school to study computer science and now I'm lost.

I was pre med during my first degree. I actually got some interviews but nothing stuck. I also applied to a Pharmacy school in 2022 and got accepted but turned down the offer (tuition was insanely high, school was half way across the country, and the housing market alone in the area where the school was at would've made me go bankrupt, etc etc etc). Anyway.....

Now I'm studying computer science, just an undergrad degree. I don't necessarily love it, but it's fine. I'm just concerned about my future. I just want a job, anything professional and 50-60k starting would be amazing. I don't trust my comp sci knowledge to get me any sort of job (I feel incredibly dumb in this subject area) and my health science degree offers literally no career prospects that I can see (I've been trying).

All this to say, I've considered either applying to Pharmacy school again but at 2 schools closer to me, and a lot cheaper. OR getting an accounting degree then studying for CPA and whatnot. Whatever I end up studying next is it....its gonna be my last program I study.

16rj377,How to talk to my manager’s boss to explain myself and ask for internal transfer,"Hi all, I wrote a post here a few days ago (feel free to check it out for context)- basically my manager has me on a PIP and also given me a mutual separate offer to exit my role in ~2 weeks. I read all the comments and I get it, it was my bad that I wasn’t taking my manager’s warnings seriously, which has landed me where I am now. 

I really mean to address the work mistakes that I was making, but it doesn’t seem that my manager will give me another chance, since he and HR already gave me a separation agreement.

I really want my manager’s boss to know about my situation. I don’t want to be kicked out of my job like this, and I feel like I’m not being given a fair chance. My manager’s boss is an empathetic person and she was part of the hiring team when I was hired, so I want her to know and help make this a fair process for me. 

I don’t plan on bashing my manager to his boss or anything, but I want the big boss to know that i’m dedicated to staying at the company and to explain my side of how I felt this PIP process went.  Also, I believe I’m qualified for some currently open roles with other teams, so if this role is really done for me, I would also ask if there’s any possibility that she could talk to HR and allow me to do an internal transfer.

Round Table was my first job in high school and I fell in love with it. It taught me the value of working in a job. Working there felt like therapy in bad times. Also, I love pizza. But I was in a School program that only let me work there for 100 hours. So I move on to the next job at Raley's. It was slow and I was kind of bored. Round Table has a lot of things to do, so time moves faster. Now I have a job at Taco Bell, and it’s okay, the work is fine. But I found out I like Pizza more the Tacos. I want to work at Round Table Pizza again. I remembers the good times and bad times at Round Table, and I still miss it. So I asked to work there again. I gave them my resume and waited for an opening. But sadly they are full. I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE DOGHE ROLLER JOB! Now to put that on the list of life regrets. Do I just miss my high school days? I’m 20 and in junior college. But why don’t I get any other pizza job? The closest pizza places that I can ride my bike on are Marry Pizza and Little Caesars. Round Table is technically far away, and I would work until it gets dark, which is going to be harder if I bring a pizza home. But will working at Round Table Pizza be as good as I remember it?... probably it won’t. Memories can be unreliable. But do any of you have any story about wanting to work in a past job? Or did anyone get a past job back and love or hate it? Anyone?

I work for the county in a hospital. I think they are following me outside of work. When I am at work my coworkers bring up things nonchalantly into our conversations of certain things I did outside of work. Like not directly. For example, I went to mcdonalds when it was my day off. All of a sudden my coworkers would be talking about mcdonalds. I went to target and then all of a sudden they would be talking about target. Another thing that annoys me is that I think my iphone is being hacked. Anything I write down on my notes section about work like complaining or about other people. All of a sudden my coworkers would either be really cold towards me or they would mention certain words that I wrote on my notes. Like I called out someone that was being petty and wrote it in my notes. All of a sudden the supervisor kept saying the word petty for me to hear. I don't know if I am being paranoid, but I also notice when I am out driving to anywhere the same cars have been following me. Specifically white van cars and red cars. It's like I am being watched. I can't clock out at work either. They prevented me from clocking out the machine near the elevator when thats the only machine I can get to. When I ask my other co workers they say their badge works perfectly fine. Its just mine that is not working. We do have a union but the union stewardess treat me like crap. They all keep watching me. The cleaning people also have been following me around to everywhere I go. It's insane and I feel like I am going crazy. Does the county every do this? And why? Please let me know what to do?

My sup hasn’t really said much, just acted a bit surprised, I’m planning to stay, but I was wondering how to best approach the situation….and assure them I will stick around. 

Has anyone been through this? What can I say or do to gain my employer’s trust back? My sup said we will have a meeting before the end of September for the yearly performance evaluation.

16rclxg,New Job - Afraid to Use Sick Days,"I recently started a job in May and after working 3 months, I was allotted 10 days of paid sick time. I was diagnosed with sleep apnea and also low testosterone so I'm ALWAYS exhausted. I'm trying to get help for both of these issues, but it's taking a long time and a lot of hoops to resolve. Some weeks I truly don't feel like I'm going to make it. Anyways, I'm afraid to use the sick days given to me because I've only been working here for 4 months. My boss is very approachable, but I'm still nervous about bringing this up to him since I'm new. Should I just tough it out and only use the sick days when absolutely necessary? This is a fortune 500 company and I work at their HQ so I'm trying to make a good impression here. But I also really value my well-being and don't want to push myself too hard.

-What sparked your interest in your career field?

-What does a typical day entail in your line of work?

-What do you like most about your career field?

-What are some challenges you face in your career choice?

-How do you handle your work-life balance?

16rbcy9,I left my old job once and I don't know if I should leave again,"I left my first job back in January to start working at a major supermarket. The reasons were mostly down to pay and I had some issues with the manager (I got on great with the boss and other employees).

I absolutely loved my work at the supermarket but I was doing 70+ hours a week, barely seeing my wife and using my time off to basically recover. 
I wasn't doing anything around the house and I wasn't socialising outside of work.

About 3 months ago my previous employer contacted me asking me to come back for an increase in pay (slightly more than the supermarket) and promised to deal with the problem manager. I jumped at the idea; less hours, closer to home, better pay, barely any stress and I knew the role inside out.

However after returning I just feel empty. I'm having a much better life at home but work is boring, the manager hasn't changed and I've not the same job satisfaction that I had whilst working at the supermarket. 
I'm also losing my patience with customers who tend to be much more demanding/entitled at this current role.
There's potential where I work now for it to be a really fulfilling job, but it's probably another 12 months down the line as the business is still growing. I'd like to be there for that but I just don't have the passion. There's no room for me to progress unless the current manager quits, which she won't.
It won't take much for the manager to piss me off to the point that I just walk again. I won't be bullied a second time around.
My hours are also all over the place. I do 3 weekends in a row (I'm the only one) and then have to do 7 days without break to earn my weekend off. I've no regular rota, unlike everyone else, which makes it hard to plan things like appointments. I mentioned this to the manager that I wasn't happy about my schedule, but she shut me down and refused to speak to me about it.

Just two days ago I received a call from a colleague at the supermarket saying there's a new role waiting for me if I want it. It's less pay, unless I work overtime every week (which I can't do in my current role), but then my work life balance will start to slip. I'm also not guaranteed overtime, and money is tight. It'll also cost me £200 extra per month in travel expenses to get to the supermarket. However, I'll get the same scheduled days off each week.

I have no idea what to choose and I need to make a decision by tomorrow or the position is gone. I have such a good relationship with my current boss and I feel like if I left again I'd let him down. He mentions all these big ideas for me to take on regarding the business but I'm finding it hard to see past the poor management and frustrating customers.

16rb53e,will nursing get better?,"    I (22f) have one more year left of my bsn before I sit my boards. I find myself unsatisfied with aspects of nursing school. There are times that I ask for more information on a subject because I want to actually understand but I just get told "" you don't need to know that."" And because they don't give us all the information it's hard to actually get a full understanding of some of the concepts, I find myself having to go to outside sources to fill in the gaps.Based on the way people talk about the difficultly of nursing school I thought it would be immersive, but that hasn't been the case. I thought it would be hard because due to being academically rigorous, but in reality they just add so much fluff and busy work that it's hard to manage your time because you have to finish all the busy work before studying. 

    I love science and the human body and learning why and how diseases happen and what can be done to treat them, and I love when I get to talk to patients, but I'm unsatisfied with this level of education. I go go clinical and sometimes I hear the things that the doctors talk and sometimes the things they say go over my head. I wish I knew enough to actually fully understand what they're doing and why. I find myself wishing I was with them instead of with the nurses, but maybe that's how everyone feels? 

    I didn't realize this was the reality of nursing. I'm thinking of doing a post bacc and trying to go to medical school but the idea is so daunting. I considered being an NP but the NP programs I see don't exactly seem immersive either. My GPA isn't great (3.0, I did not take university seriously when I first started and it's really biting me in the ass),do I even have a chance to get into any medical school?

16rafk6,Getting an online degree in Finance - what are realistic jobs for me?,"Just started back at school at WGU for an online degree in Finance. In 2 years I should have a Bachelor's - what then? This is a career change for me so I have no experience in the field (I'm an insurance underwriter currently). Is there anything that would help me get a job as an accountant? Is it a good idea to just work all the way through to CPA or CFA? As a 38 year old, am I too old to pursue intense careers like being an Investment Banker or Stock Broker?  
  
Im not the typical student - 38 here so I have savings and discipline. I also have no spouse or kids, so if the only path to a decent job is a year of unpaid internships or 90 hour weeks or something equally grueling, I could handle it. I don't think spouse or kids are going to happen so I've decided to make my career my life's goal - it fascinates me how money and the economy works. But as a 38 year old, with no experience, what would be the most practical entry level job for me? What's a realistic career path for someone that's not young and isn't attending a target school, but will gladly throw his whole ass into his new career?

Or do I just stay in insurance and get a CPCU and try to climb the ladder there?",EddieSteel84,1,1.0,0,1695593461,2023-09-24 22:11:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16rafk6/getting_an_online_degree_in_finance_what_are/,9,2023
16r9xuq,College and credentials,"Hello! I am doing a little research project on the value of a college degree and how useful it is for candidates who are seeking a job. I'd really appreciate it if any hiring managers or recruiters could answer some questions for me! I'd also love it if you could DM me or message me with what company you work for (and name would be helpful too, but that's probably not very comfortable for most of you). Just so I have someone to attach a quote to, rather than just ""from a random Reddit person.""  
I'm formulating a design question: "" How might we define, develop, and present job-ready skills that employers will be able to validate instead of or in addition to a college degree""  
Here are some interview questions I came up with, I'd really appreciate it if y'all could answer some of these. Thanks for the help!  
\- How much value do you place on a college degree?  
\- Can you describe a specific instance where you hired a candidate with non-traditional qualifications (i.e., no college degree) for a role that typically requires one? What was the outcome of that hire?   
\- How do you assess a candidate's qualifications when they don't possess a college degree but have relevant certifications or extensive work experience?   
\- How do you ensure fairness and equity in your hiring process when evaluating candidates with different educational backgrounds?   
\- Have you ever encountered a situation where a highly educated candidate struggled to perform in their role despite their credentials? How did you address this?  
\- What skills would you like to see in addition to a college degree? What makes candidates stand out?  
\-  How do you stay open to alternative talent pipelines and consider candidates without traditional qualifications, such as those from coding boot camps, online courses, or apprenticeship programs?   
\- How do you test a candidate's skills, if at all? What are you looking for in a resume?  
You don't have to answer all of these, just pick anyone that you think is interesting! And again, if possible, I'd really appreciate it if some of you could share what company/position / any details I can use to put a person to the words.

16r9vwb,Offer from big 4 vs Startup,"So briefly about my current experience, I graduated 2 years ago with a bachelor in data science and I have 2-3 years of experience as a data scientist/ml engineer/software engineer.

So I’ve got competing offers, one from the big 4 as a software systems engineer - AI/ML (Big 4) and the other as a machine learning engineer. The startup salary is higher while big 4 is lower. Additionally the startup isn’t necessarily a unicorn it’s a relatively small startup with an interesting product but it doesn’t necessarily blow me away. The salary at the startup is 15 percent higher that that of the big 4 offer. For those wondering I did already negotiate the salary and they did increase it marginally. 

I am conflicted because I think that the big 4 jobs will have

1) more career growth 
2) more potential future opportunities and 
3) more networking potential

16r7yjc,"I'm trying to increase my income, but don't know what job to get next (and don't have enough money or time to put towards investments with any truly significant returns). I want to achieve financial independence in 6-7 years. What job do I take?","I work 32 hours a week as an office assistant being paid $13.50 an hour. My boss does not offer more hours. The company is very small, so I file my own taxes. There isn't anywhere to move up in-house -- it's just me and my boss. I don't want to leave before I have at least 2-3 years experience (I'm almost one year into this job). The rest of the time is spent studying and chores, but I spend a few hours a week having some relaxed fun. 

  
This job is perfect for me. I have the whole office to myself and complete control over my sensory environment, which is essential -- I have both ADHD and ASD. Needless to say, I'd be reluctant to leave this job anyways.   


  
I have \~$1,010 in savings and \~$1,500 in a 7-month, 5% APY CD (because that's about as involved as I can get in investing right now and high-risk investing is not an option for me). I can't put the rest of my savings into a CD because I need some of my money liquid for medical bills.   
My goal is to be able to buy a $65,000 tiny house cash in 6 years. 

once I get enough money, I plan to ladder my CDs. But this job can't give me enough money to do that as I have other expenses. The $250 a week that i would usually put towards saving for the house is being used to cover medical bills from the ER (and that will have to be the case for another 6 months).   


What job can I get with 2-3 years of office experience that will hopefully pay more?

16r7taa,Corporate vs State engineering,"Tl;dr: stressful corporate job in field of interest and wfh but mental/physical health consequences vs opportunity for state job with mostly similar pay/benefits +/- with a 30 min commute for 1 year and hybrid after but in a field that may be boring     
     
I (no kids/no live-in partner, own a small home, older car is paid off) have been working for my first job after graduation for 5 years. Well-respected mid-sized consulting engineering firm in the area of interest I went to school for. I like the people I work with. Work remote. Consistently promoted, decent enough raises and benefits. I make a living wage, although it doesn't go as far as you'd think. Pushed into managing too many projects due to staffing needs. Training is poor.     
     
I'm prone to perfectionism and anxiety which was never a major problem before project management. Made some big mistakes and work was understanding and supportive due to recognizing their part in lack of guidance. They say they're here for you but it's a corporation so never know how much you can be honest.     
      
Got some therapy/meds which maybe helps a little. Work really hard to manage anxiety levels. Still burned myself out big time on a big project this year. Trying like hell not to mess up again, but project management is just really hard. I like aspects of it, and hope I'll get more confidence with experience, but I'm worried maybe it's just not a good fit for my nature?    
     
A friend reached out recruiting me to work at the State in a different field that I did find interesting in school, but this role sounds ultimately kind of repetitive and boring. My friend sold it as a low-stress job.     
     
I'm very tempted to not have to worry about meeting profit goals, that is hands down my biggest anxiety. I want to do the work right, in the way it requires. Often in consulting the budget planned misses the reality of the work required. I work late regularly and don't log all my hours even though company policy ""requires"" us to do that...because at the end of the day it's me who is on the line for meeting profit goals.     
     
Other pros for state job:      
-after a certain time you get good health care for life, can't really beat that.     
-plus a small pension.     
-allegedly can switch into other areas relatively easily. If true be it makes me feel a little more comfortable if I find the work too boring.
-pslf eligibility for my student loans, will need to do the math on that. Currently plan to pay off in less than 10 years mostly just bc I want it off my mind and 1 less monthly payment so willing to throw extra on there when I can.
     
Cons:     
- have to work in the office full time for at least 1 year     
-then hybrid, 1-2 days in the office unless they change it. I know I'm so fucking spoiled from wfh but it feels crazy to willingly choose to commute..     
     
The pay is unclear. My friend claims I could get paid about the same as my expected raise this year...I am somewhat skeptical of that...     
     
Another friend at the State told me to expect take-home pay to be 2/3 of gross with all the deductions. Good to know, so I'll have to do some math to make sure I know my minimum. That second friend also said they've been getting frequent inflation adjustments, and I should get stepped promotions every year for the first 2 years but unclear what those look like. Not sure how it works after that. It sounds like it should be at least ok to start.     
     
Vacations and sick time looks like accrue 12 vacation/15 sick days per year, plus 3 ""personal days""       After 5 years: 15 vacation days.      
     
My current job gives us a starting balance of 40 hours PTO Jan 1 to cover any early year sick time, and I'm up to total accrual of 3 weeks plus 3 days PTO (vacation/sick combined). Overall has felt like not enough, especially feeling so burnt out all the time.     
     
The question I'll have is how hard is it to take time off and to use the sick time. My first friend said it was easy, the second said you get on a shit list if you take too much time off within a 6 month period or something. Maybe it depends on the leadership in your department.     
       
The ideal outcome of leaving would be a stable and secure job with good health benefits that I can leave the work at work and finally feel like I have the energy for my hobbies/exercise/socializing outside work. I'm convinced my physical health is endangered if I continue in this stress/burnout lifestyle.     
     
The ideal outcome of staying in my role would be that my stress is reduced and I leave work at work better as I gain experience and feel more confident. In this scenario I'm in a field that is interesting to me and intellectually engaging and I believe in the work I'm doing even though it's a corporation and I'm not really about that life. I'm not ambitious and I don't want to be a Vice President of Operations or business development shmoozer, or anything like that. I want to be an engineer.    
     
In the state job, I won't deal with clients or profit, but the work may not necessarily be engaging to me personally. But I likely won't know until I'm there. And maybe I'll be able to switch to an area that I am more interested in, which might be even better than my current role as I'll get the best of both worlds- work I believe in that's not tied to a profit-structure i find distasteful at best.     
     
Mostly I just want to be an engineer, not a business major and I'm sure all my friends are tired of me complaining about it lol

16r6d2h,Business and Technical Skills,"Hello everyone,  
  
I am currently a rising junior at a Big 10 university, pursuing a Business major while also completing a CMSE (Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering) minor. I've been enjoying learning entry-level Python, SQL, and RStudio as part of my minor. While my business classes have provided valuable soft skills, I'm interested in blending these with my technical skills.  
  
I've noticed that internship roles in areas like Database Administration, Business Analysis, and Data Analysis predominantly seek candidates with majors in Computer Science or Statistics, and less frequently consider Business majors. This has led me to a dilemma. Should I consider switching my major or proceed with my current path and graduate in three semesters?  
  
Here are my specific queries:  
  
Major Consideration:  
a. Should I switch majors or continue on my current trajectory and graduate in three semesters? I'm willing to invest in additional schooling if it leads to a more focused education.  
b. If considering a major change, what majors outside of business should I explore?  
  
Business Major Options:  
Given my interest in blending business with technical skills, which Business majors should I consider? Options include Marketing, Finance, Supply Chain Management, Accounting, and Management. Unfortunately, Business Analysis is not offered as a major in my school's business program.  
  
Career Opportunities with Business Major + CMSE Minor:  
What specific career paths would be accessible to me with a Business major and CMSE minor?

16r5qn3,Should I send a cover letter separately to a job application?,"Hi,  
I hope someone could adivse me, I applied for a job that I really really really want. However, it redirected me to their whebsite/ application portal , where you add your credentials, select login and password, and upload your CV. However, no option for cover letter.  
I also found a email on their careers page for the same job application but it's too late since I already submitted via their portal.  
I want to send a cover letter to that email I found, but I'm thinking if they think I'm too needy, since they asked all the info they needed via portal ?  
Or sending an extra email with cover letter supporting my resume is a good idea ?

16r5pk3,Stick or twist? Need advice about taking up a new role.,"Hi, I’m looking for some advice on my situation. I’m a former Associate Consultant. I quit to pursue my Masters. I want to get back into consulting and work on strategic projects. That’s what excites me. However, I am about to graduate and haven’t had a lot of luck applying for these roles over the past 2 months.

The job market has been down recently and a lot of companies have frozen their hiring processes. In the mean time, I’ve been diversifying the roles I’m applying for. I’ve now been offered a Business Analyst position at a small retail company. The role is mainly translating business requirements to technical deliverables. I can do the job but it doesn’t interest me in the same way.

My question is, should I take the job until I find something in consulting? Will the BA experience be of any use at all? I’m considering this because of the current situation in the job market. I’m also going broke so I’m not in a position to consider the moral aspect of this (taking up a role that can benefit someone who actually wants to be a BA). I can at max hold out for another 3 months. What would you guys do?

16r54y1,Update 3: Got thrown under the bus by my boss - now am meeting with boss and his boss for 90-day check-in,"The 90-day check-in is something my boss's boss (grandboss) does with all new hires, unfortunately my boss will be there as well (typical of these meetings). I am not looking forward to it. These check-ins are about (1) how the onboarding process is going (2) what the company does well (3) where they need to improve (4) what my grandboss can do to help

I want to address how (1) my boss doesn't step in a correct me if I doing something incorrectly or focusing on the wrong thing (2) he constantly pushes decision making onto me, every time I ask him a question or try to get direction, he talks in circles or pushes it back on me. He offers nothing on what information he needs to arrive at the decision. (3) he doesn't listen to me or read his emails, or remember what I tell him

I want to frame as how difficult it's been to establish effective communication with him because he doesn't remember what I tell him, and he doesn't read him. I need him to act like a Director (his job title) because I'm exhausted at this level of trying to manage him up. I'm out of ideas on what to do, and I don't think it's fair that this seems to be all on me with him offering no solutions or trying to improve anything.

**The good:** My grandboss is starting to be more involved in what I do. I met with him last week to get more clarity on department goals and metrics which really helped. Then on Friday, I met with him and my boss to go over some project stuff and got even *more* clarification from my grandboss on how to approach things, which also helped. Meanwhile, even though my boss was at this meeting, he offered nothing. He rarely spoke. We're now all meeting 2x for one of the main projects for the department, and my grandboss suggested all of us meet 1x/week to go over high level things for our projects, which I'm so glad about. He also told me (in front of my boss) to let *him* know if I had any questions about anything or if I needed anything

My boss was out ""sick"" last Wednesday, so I'm hoping he had an interview lol.

16r52vq,Career switch at 36?,"My current job is fine paying my bills and has good coworkers.

But I am seeing my limitation for growth perspective and feel being less competitive as time goes by.

I started learning totally different field which is animation and video editing. 

It's been a year since I started learning it an hour everyday as a hobby and still enjoy it a lot. But not a pro-level yet and I couldn't make more time to learn this after work for many reasons. 

I am not confident enough to jump into a new field yet but still worried where I am at now.

If you were me, would you just keep learning it as a hobby and see how things go and decide what to do in the future?
Or, would you take all your free time to focus on learning new things and jump into a new industry as soon as possible",Dependent_Western_63,2,1.0,1,1695580548,2023-09-24 18:35:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16r52vq/career_switch_at_36/,9,2023
16r4768,Considering a Career Change from a Poopy Job - Need Advice,"This is my first post on Reddit, so sorry if I sound silly.  
As the title says, I'm currently working in a job that I do not like whatsoever. It's in expert network services (basically just a sales job where we try to get knowledge out of people) like GLG, Guidepoint, Alphasights, and Alphasense. I've been in this position for just 2.5 months. 

The main reason I don't like the job is its extreme instability and stress. I'm working as hard as I can, often working 60-hour+ weeks, but I constantly feel like I could be let go at any moment. The hours themselves are grueling. Most days, my longest breaks are just going to the bathroom. Also, my manger sits right next to me constantly watching what I'm doing. If I'm not doing the most efficient thing possible, she'll tell me what I'm doing wrong. Everyday feels like such a struggle to make it to the end of the day. 

  
Everyone I talk to at the firm shares similar beliefs about their jobs and management. This has left me feeling perpetually stressed and exhausted due to the monotonous stressful nature of the work. Honestly, this is my first job out of college, and I feel like all jobs might just suck this bad? The reviews of my company on Glassdoor share the same opinion so maybe I'm not just lazy? Lots of people recommend quitting as soon as possible, but I know I need a job lined up before I can quit. 

A little background about me: I have a major in finance with a minor in economics and statistics from a reputable college, with a 3.5 GPA. Initially, I had planned to enter the consulting field, but by the time I made that decision, many companies had halted hiring due to the economy. I made it to a few boutique consulting firm final rounds but just missed the full-time offer. Consequently, I took this job intending to eventually transition into consulting. However, I wonder if this is a viable career change since many consulting firms may be aware of the realities of working in expert network services. Had an offer for a job in transfer pricing at a Big Four and rejected it, thinking this job would open up more doors. I'm feeling so dumb with that decision now. Given my short time at my current position, how likely is it for me to find a new job? Should I endure this job for as long as possible until I'm let go? I think I can tough it out for at least another six months to bolster my resume. I might even manage to last a year without losing my sanity. I don't think I'll make it much longer than that. I'm considering pursuing a master's degree or obtaining certifications to improve my chances of finding a more stable job.

16r029v,Help for a friend,"Good morning, burner account for various reasons:

&#x200B;

 I have a friend who is a public school teacher in NYS. They are tenured in a school district and high on the step ladder but since Covid the stress of the job and the general decay of student behavior (my view, not theirs) has really negatively effected their mental health. They want an exit plan but feel trapped due to tenure, family conditions, and other institutionalized thoughts. They are not in a good place but feel they cannot leave.

 They are certified in Literacy, with a wide range of grade levels (from birth to 12th, I'm not an expert on it but they currently work on increasing reading abilities in middle school.) They are passionate about the work, has tremendous patience and empathy with kids struggling, they are what you want an educator to be but the system seems to have pushed those qualities out of the profession where we live.

 Has anyone in this situation left a public school teaching job for greener pastures or even found acceptable work? Are their any career paths I could point my friend towards to give them hope? Retirement is a ways away but in being around the family and watching my friend struggle, there has to be options. I've watched this person tackle everything else they set out to do but this seems like something that the fear of the unknown is too much to leap out of the safety of the current position.

Thank you in advance for any help.

16qu5d7,should i change my career,"i’m 24 and i have been working in health & social care for nearly 2 years, i recently started a job as a mental health support worker, which is a role i’ve wanted for many years i worked in care previously and found it to be a job i really could stick to and enjoy. 

however the management at my new role are abysmal, issues with staffs pay, lack of communication, lack of compassion, letting you know things on short notice, sending rotas on the day of and just general disorganisation.

the role itself is enjoyable but stressful, i drive all day and i am supporting people emotionally, which is very rewarding however it does have a knock on affect on my mental well-being. i have moments in the role where i’m like wow i love this, this is exactly what i want to do and then just days i feel like i want to quit on the spot (usually because of management). 

however i’ve got a potential new opportunity with a company my friend works for, an office job mon-fri which would offer me more consistency and less stress (i’ve been burning out a lot and i’ve only just started this new job) but i’m kinda worried that that spark for work and rewarding aspect would disappear and it would maybe make me feel worse emotionally if i don’t have that aspect to my role, that i could feel bored etc.

i do believe mental health is my passion i just don’t know if i’m capable of it now or whether management in this role is the issue and maybe i need to find a different mental health role and stay in this one as long as possible. or whether to do a complete career change and find some consistency and peace in a office job.

16qrwfs,I hate my job bcs of my GM,"I’m soooo tired of this and the way I make a living. I’m sure some of u have waited tables and know what I’m talking about. I don’t even mind the difficult customers and will do anything to make sure they’re happy but my problem is the management and the way they treat the employees. It feels like slavery . A constant disrespect, unappreciative, and a third world treatment from especially the GM . I’ve been in this restaurant for 7 years but been doing this job since 1999. I consider myself an educated person with being able to speak 4 languages, have an associate degree in general education that is useless though but I learned a lot just taking a lot of classes when I was younger, I’m level one Sommelier and love wine, very hard worker. But the GM is just keeps on treating me like dirt. I’ve worked for a few other fine dining and the culture is still terrible but this has been the worst I have ever seen and treated like shit even though I have sooooooooo many ppl request me every night bcs of the way I present myself and take care of the guests. But when I’m constantly being disrespected and unfairly treated, I make mistakes. I don’t perform well when I’m not happy and talked down on bcs I don’t deserve to be talked to or treated like that. It’s also difficult to change jobs when a person has been doing the same thing 24 plus years. I’m soooo disappointed and don’t know what to do anymore. I get soooo much great reviews for the restaurant, I bring sooo many ppl back to spend money, my sales r 3k plus a night on average but the GM is always looking and searching for one mistake or something to use against me.

I worked at a small accounting firm for the last 10 years. One of those overworked underpaid careers. Over the past few year there has been friction with the partners and I had mental struggles but was very open with my employer and how I was getting help  any time I changed medication I let them know so they can highlight any dramatic changes in my personality. Unfortunately I got a little comfortable knowing I was the most qualified employee on staff but of the blue I was let go, but being paid severance through the end of the year. I have applied to 10 plus corporate jobs as the public field has had me burnt out.  

I don’t have my CPA license but have my masters in accounting. Without getting into details, I am comfortable with all types of tax returns and audits. 

Bottom line is it worth continuing to apply to jobs and wait out the process or is temp bookkeeping or even gig work. On a side note I have always struggled throughout my schooling and finally in my thirties got tested for ADHD.  Most of my communication struggles are relate to this and the majority of  applications ask to disclose disability and list it as one.

16qline,Should I leave ng Finance job and study Nursing?,"Hey everyone! I’m 26 years old female working as a financial analyst for one of the biggest corporations in Canada. 

In terms of compensation, I think I’m getting paid properly as someone who has only 2 years of experience. I’m getting paid $85,000 annually including bonus and benefits. My salary will increase to at least $110,000 when I complete my CFA designation as per my manager. I’m anticipating to have my CFA designation 2 years from now if I decide to continue my Finance career. 

In terms of the job itself, I feel like there’s a huge part of me missing. I love numbers and data ever since I was young which is why I took Engineering first then switched to Finance after I realized I’d enjoy Finance better. Now that I’m in the corporate world, I can’t accept the fact that I’ll have to work 9-5 everyday working on my computer, attending meetings, and solving problems for the corporation. I feel like I’m not making any difference which leads to lack of self-fulfillment. 

Right now, I am 75% convinced to get into the Nursing After Degree program offered in my local university. This will take me 2 years to complete as a full-time student. I like the idea of having the option to work anytime of the day, getting paid for overtime, and most importantly, I love helping people. The thing that’s holding me back is finances because going back to school means I have to apply for student loan again (I still have $30k I’m paying right now) and I won’t have any source of income for 2 years starting Fall of 2024.

16qgrox,Looking for Careers advice,"Hi, I'm not sure why I'm writing this here, but right now I'm struggling to choose between two options. I wanted to know what a stranger would do in my position. Note: I live in a country where it's really hard to find a job, especially as a fresh graduate. Unfortunately, many citizens here are unemployed. I mention this because it's important and to let you know that I don't have many options.

I had the chance to intern at a really good place, a bank, and I loved it so much that I worked hard, even though I didn't enjoy my work, just to prove myself and potentially get a job offer. I have been with them for 3 months, and they told me that they are going to enroll me in the fresh graduate program. I will stay as an intern for another 6 months to learn, and if there are any vacancies after 6 months, they will offer me a full-time job. The program will be in my department only.

Negative points:
1. I love to interact with people, but my current job doesn't allow me to do that. I mainly sit at my desk and do my work.
2. I work in the finance/payment department, and it's a really stressful job. I honestly don't understand many things, and it's risky. I'm constantly stressed about making mistakes or paying the wrong amount.

Positive points:
1. I loved the environment in the bank. It's a really good place to start my career and will open a lot of doors for me in the future.
2. I have the best manager; she's the sweetest and cares a lot.
3. If I get a full-time job later, the salary is really good.""


The second option:
I applied to a program for fresh graduates, and surprisingly, I passed the test and interview and got accepted. This program is also 6 months long, where they place us in one of their partner companies to work as interns and also contribute to a project. Around 70% of the people who join this program receive a full-time job offer afterward.
Negative points:
1. We will be starting next month with studying and attending lectures, and then they will assign us to the company where we will intern. I don't know where they will place me yet; it could be a better place than my current bank, or it may not be.
Positive points:
1. I might have the chance to work in a place where I can learn something new and actually enjoy it.
2. They provide a certificate upon completion of the 6-month program (PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE IN PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT PRACTICE), which could benefit me in the future.

I'm really not sure what to choose. I love the bank I'm currently in, but I don't want to work in the same department. My manager is the one who recommended me for the fresh graduates program because she wants me in her department, so I can't just tell them I want to start in another department.

Note: I will choose what's best for me, but I would like to know your opinion and what you would do.""

I got into BME because I wanted to help people and believe improvement in healthcare technology is the future to better healthcare for patients. I seriously considered becoming a psychiatrist because I’m passionate about mental health after personally struggling with depression. 

I’ve given up on going to medical school because I don’t want to be in huge debt and won’t get to practice until I’m in my 40s. Plus I have a dog to take care of by myself. 

But I really want to pivot to a career that incorporates engineering and maybe neuroscience to help the world of psychiatry. I want to feel like I’ve actually helped someone and make an impact. 

Does anybody know of a career trajectory for BMEs like me? Should I go into research? Or should I take a leap and apply to medical school?",Mundane_Account8380,1,1.0,5,1695489401,2023-09-23 17:16:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16q9x1q/unhappy_as_a_quality_engineer_at_a_large_med/,9,2023

16q9477,SAHM who failed the bar exam 5x,"Looking for advice on how to get back to work. Here’s a quick synopsis of my background: I graduated from law school in May ‘21. Found out I was pregnant 1 month before graduation. I took the bar once while pregnant and have taken it 4 additional times postpartum. I have failed all 5 attempts and am not even close to the required passing score. I’ve worked a couple of remote temp positions in the legal field since graduating but am ultimately living off of my fiancé since having the baby. He makes decent money, but also has 2 older kids and as of a few months ago, his parents moved into our house. We don’t have any wiggle room financially. I have almost no help with my child (including from my fiancé) and we cannot afford childcare right now. 

After getting my most recent failing results, I’ve decided to put the bar on hold for a bit. I’m burnt out, money is tight and I feel like I am trying to accomplish the impossible with studying and taking care of my toddler at the same time. In the meantime, I need to generate some income. 

How can I reintegrate myself into part-time work using my degree? I’m also trying to figure out what to do with my toddler until I have a couple of paychecks to be able to pay for childcare. Where I am, I’m looking at about $200/week in daycare expenses. My fiancé wants me to just be a SAHM until I pass the exam or until our toddler is in school, so he’s not very supportive about the shift in my career goals. 

At this point, I need to do this for my mental health and well being. I’ve had to close credit cards, my bills have fallen behind and I have a ton of student loan debt to repay. I need to rebuild myself financially.

16q8ura,Is it too early to leave?,"Hello guys! I’ve been working as an IT Product Owner / PM for the past few years (I’m currently 27).
My resume looks like:

- First job (product analyst) - 1y 2m (left fue to career growth)

- Second job (PO) - 1y 8m (left due to cutoff)

- Third job, actual (sr. Product analyst) - 1y 3m

I’m planning to quit in 3 months (so I would be at 1y 6m) and take a year off to study english abroad and do some volunteering.

- Do you think I should wait until I hit the 2y mark? Would it look bad when I try to find a new professional job? I would be 28 if I stay 6 more months and I think it might look “unprofessional” to take a gap year the older I get, also I don’t feel so confortable in my actual job.

- Do you think listing my studies abroad and volunteering program will help me in the future to get a job?

My idea is once I finish my “gap” year to look for a job in Spain (maybe this is useful context).

16q8s7f,"Dealing with grief, not wanting to work in an office ever again...","Please excuse the long-winded post. I am having a really difficult time and could use some words of wisdom or advice.

  
I have a degree in French - a language I no longer speak fluently - and am a former features reporter for the lifestyles section of my city's local newspaper. I have done freelance writing work ever since my mom passed away from brain cancer a number of years ago. My dad just passed away in June after having undergone treatment for blood cancer for the past year and a half, so I have two large gaps in my work history due to my parents' illnesses.

  
The loss of both of my parents has had a profound effect on me and my outlook on life in general. I am very sad and still trying to wrap my mind around losing my dad. I have not even wanted to think about going back to work. Just getting up each morning and getting through another day is about all I can do right now. I've also had difficulty in finding a grief counselor to help me work through things - the majority of counseling offices I have called either go straight to voicemail and never return calls or their practitioners only work limited hours/days of the week and aren't taking on new clients.

  
I have tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to land freelance writing assignments since my dad passed away and only have one on the horizon so far. Most of my attempts at obtaining assignments have gone unanswered. I also have been scouring job sites and ads for anything remotely related to my work experience - my degree is pretty much useless now - and have come up with little.

Many of the jobs require multiple skills/experience that I don't have, so I am hesitant to apply.  
One thing I do know is that I do not want to ever work in an office again. I work much better independently and in a quieter environment than in an office environment.

I may not be able to have that option, but given the choice, I would much prefer to find a work at home or remote position, preferably that ties into my experience and, if not that, something I could easily do or learn how to do in a reasonably short period of time.

  
I am facing a considerable amount of pressure from my older brother to return to work and take any old job, even if it is a terrible, low-paying office drudge sort of position and I don't want to do that. He's also badgered me to take a full-time teaching assistant position because I am ""great with kids"" and should do it for that reason alone. Never mind the fact that I don't ***want*** to do it, I have zero experience in that field and it does not pay a decent, livable wage. At this point in my life and after all that I have been through, I want something that brings me at least a shred of happiness and satisfaction - in addition to a paycheck, of course.

  
The caregiving for and helping of our parents fell mainly on me and my older sister. My brother was not responsible for helping our parents the way we were and never really had to disrupt his life in any way, give up anything or have most of his life consumed by that. He has a wife and three kids at home to lean on and help him take care of things while I have no one. He also has a successful, lucrative career for an energy company and is in a higher-up executive/management position, so has a lot more flexibility in his schedule and what he can/can't do work-wise. 

He doesn't understand the toll that's been taken on me mentally and physically, and being told by him what I need to be doing right now is very upsetting and just adding to an already difficult situation for me. My needs and wants are never taken into consideration. I'm never asked what I want to do or what will be fulfilling for me. 

  
Just needed some advice on where to look and how to best go about finding a work from home or remote position. I believe I would be much happier and more productive if I was able to work independently in a quieter environment and be able to remove at least some stressors from my life. As much as I loved writing for the newspaper, I hated the long daily commute, dealing with office politics and being stuck in a crowded, noisy cube farm. I just can't do that anymore.",Goldengirl1977,3,0.8100000023841858,1,1695486511,2023-09-23 16:28:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16q8s7f/dealing_with_grief_not_wanting_to_work_in_an/,9,2023

That doesn't mean that I am great at it but I feel like that would give me more confidence in my career in the future for some reason.

But I found pay scale is relatively low in average unless you are great at it. 

So I am leaning towards working hard where I am at now, keep learning what I love as a hobby and stop worrying about my future til it happens.

I worked a contract job for 4 months and they verbally offered me a position post contract. Its not in my field but its a decent job and I can get away with linking it to my degree on my resume. 

However in talks, they’ve mentioned they want someone to have a career here and know my priorities are to get a job in my field. They really want me and told me I was the #1 pick. Our initial meeting ended sort of negatively, both of us coming to the conclusion that I don’t want to be here for 5+ years (they said 10). However I mentioned that I’d consider the offers and let them know.

After discussing with others, I’ve decided to accept the offer and just lie about my intentions. I wouldn’t be actively searching for other jobs, especially if I like it, but I don’t intend to stay here for multiple years. I told the boss and we’re gonna discuss further soon.

I feel really bad for some reason. I don’t like lying and I feel like I owe the boss something even though I don’t. I feel like a dick for taking the job and maybe in a year deciding to move on. I used to be really selfish about stuff like this so its new feelings to me.

I'm reaching out today to share my recent career experiences and seek some advice and encouragement from this wonderful community. I'll keep it brief for those who want a TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) at the end.  
  
Over the past six months, I've been on a rollercoaster ride of job applications and interviews in various organizations. I've given my best in 7 to 8 interviews, even making it to the final rounds, but things haven't panned out as I'd hoped. Currently, I've accepted a low-paying job at a small studio on a freelance contract, just to make ends meet. This whole process has taken a toll on me, and I'm feeling overwhelmed by all the rejections.  
  
A bit about my background: I originally studied Mechanical Engineering in Pakistan, where I excelled and graduated with a Gold Medal. I worked in reputable organizations for about 3 years. However, I decided to change my career path to pursue Product Design, a passion of mine. I moved to Italy for better opportunities and completed my Master's in Design Engineering with distinction just 6 months ago. Unfortunately, the company I did my thesis with promised me a job but never followed through.  
  
I aspire to be a Design Engineer, a role I've admired at companies like Dyson. However, here in Italy, the job market often confuses Design Engineering with Industrial Design, requiring skills I'm still working to improve. I've also been working as a freelancer online, with satisfied clients.  
  
Now, I'm at a crossroads, feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about my career choices. Going back to Pakistan is not an option, so I'm committed to building my life here.

16pzqde,Worth it or am I being taken advantage of?,"Howdy there folks.

Currently having a hard time evaluating whether I have a genuine opportunity on my hands or if I'm being taken advantage of. To keep backstory to a minimum; I'm in my early 30's, due to various life circumstances I'm just cruising by doing various gigs, making under $30k/yr, no gf/wife or kids, some college but no degree. What started as a one-off gig has turned into helping someone with their startup business.

For simplicity sake, the individual I have been working for/with shall be referred to a J. J is pretty amicable to work with, is encouraging and is fairly transparent about their business dealings. They're older now but have verified history with several successful startups.

The current situation:I have done the majority of the hardware development, assembly, and some minor coding for a proof-of-concept prototype device aimed at the health/exercise market. To my knowledge, I am one of 4 people who have contributed to the prototype and J has been in conversations with several investment companies. Based on the documentation I have been provided, the product/business as it stands is valued at $5M but no funding has been secured as of yet.

Although materials and components have been provided or paid for, J has paid me the rate that I had quoted for the initial, unrelated, gig, which works out to a little over $30/hr, but only when I have met with them in person to demonstrate iterations and progress on the device. No compensation has been provided for development time outside of that, including researching the underlying technology and providing recommendations on promising developments. However, in a conversation between one investment company and this individual pertaining to myself, they discussed compensation in the $75-85k range, with equity and revenue share(no hard figures provided for either).

I understand that very early startups are cash strapped while trying to secure funding and I'm happy to have some work that I get satisfaction from but I can't help but feel this situation isn't exactly in my favor. This feeling has been exacerbated recently by J suggesting further progress be made on the device, which involves designing a custom PCB. On one hand I would like to see where this opportunity could go but on the other I hand I don't want to have done all this work(and more) only to get potentially get left high and dry.  


Any outside perspectives would be appreciated.

As an aside, this project has rekindled my interest in electronics and programming/coding and I'm highly considering going back to pursue a degree in Electrical/Computer Engineering or CS.",RadR25m114,2,1.0,1,1695460259,2023-09-23 09:10:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16pzqde/worth_it_or_am_i_being_taken_advantage_of/,9,2023
16pyxym,Should I leave my new role for another offer? Help!,"Need some advice....

I've been working at a job two weeks and have been offered another role elsewhere and I don't know what to do.

My new role is at a reputable place which will look good on my CV and a good stepping stone for my future. But there's a few problems:

1. the hours are bad - I have little kids and feel like I'm missing out on a lot of time with them due to my current hours. I leave the house by 7am every morning and aren't back until 6 at night. I'm having to rely on my husband to do the drop off and pickups for them and he has a demanding job in itself.  The company is not flexible with hours and I must be on site every day.
2. it's putting a lot of stress on my husband whose job brings in much more money for us and he's been working at his career for much longer than I have - I don't want him stressed and really appreciate him wanting to be the main earner
3. the job comes with a stressful workload - I know it's not one of those jobs you can leave at work, it'd be trickling over into my home life and time with my family. If I were to keep at it, I wouldn't see myself staying for longer than a year, gaining the experience and moving on
4. other employees I've talked to, who share the same role, have some pretty serious criticisms about it. Namely some of the cranky senior staff and run ins they've had with other colleagues. Some have even expressed that they aren't far from leaving and finding work elsewhere. This isn't everyone, some people I've talked to are really happy with their roles

Don't get me wrong, there are positives - namely the experience I'd be getting and the people on my team are all really lovely and supportive.  I think I'm also proud to have the job, its a highly regarded company and (as silly as it sounds) it's an ego boost.

This other role I've been offered is not as interesting and will come with it's own stress  but the hours are flexible. The money is only a little less than my current role but it is hybrid so I wouldn't have any commute (I'd be saving money on gas and I'd be able to help with my kids in the morning and afternoon). It is fixed term (one year) which is good as I wouldn't want to be doing it longer than that. 

I'm having a hard time making a decision - any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!",2Cees0,3,1.0,0,1695457489,2023-09-23 08:24:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16pyxym/should_i_leave_my_new_role_for_another_offer_help/,9,2023

16pvd9w,Doing the managers job - What % pay rise to cover extra workload,"Ok, so click bait…not all of the managers job but some of it! 

I’m new to company (4months) it’s global hospitality (private members club).

Took the position of ‘Host’ after my self employed business moved online post covid. Never worked hospitality before but I’m good with people, so it’s a natural fit. The job doesn’t stress me out and it’s a fabulous team.

Recently our managers requested we take on the task of ‘walkouts’ unpaid bills, source members contact info, contact them, request payment, log progress, offset the system. Sounds simple but there’s A LOT of walkouts, as members often assume it will automatically charge on their app. Also, takes some effort to make contact as these members are busy and work hard.

Turns out I’m really good at this and get great results, mainly as I’m organised and used to following up and good with people…all skills that made me successful being self-employed. If relevant, I have worked as a PA for a university principal so have admin experience.

Yesterday my manager says she wants to make this a permanent part of MY role (no other hosts). As such I’ll get pay rise to cover the additional workload. Currently it’s taking 2-3hrs per shift to do this extra work, I have to switch between roles of Host and Admin every shift…I don’t mind this it helps with keeping contact regular.

Manager suggested they would add more admin tasks like ordering supplies/orders, refunds, confirmation calls etc. They would only allocate one shift per week as an admin day. 

All of this admin/walkout tasks are actually part of managements job for which their salaries are 35-45k, currently I’m £13.50/Hr as a Host.

I’d appreciate advice on how you’d work out the value of the workload to know if I get offered a decent pay rise.

I have truly never felt so enriched in my entire life learning and the moment I sat down in those classes, I felt ""this is where I'm meant to be"". At the same time, I am really struggling because I don't think I want to make the sacrifice to do a PHD. I could do a masters but that would limit me to just talk therapy (which is not my line of interest). 

I am struggling because on one hand I truly disliked Corporate America but also am at a point in my life where I just want to focus on taking care of myself and have some semblance of a stable income. What can I do?! ",Low_Blueberry_1347,3,1.0,2,1695438334,2023-09-23 03:05:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16pteqh/guidance_on_where_to_go_with_psychology/,9,2023

16psijd,I'm getting mad a lot lately,"I work for this company and I like it very much. Learning and experience is good and I work very well with the team. Everyone is very nice and I love working with them. Maybe it's also because I came from a company with toxic executives and incompetent support teams, I came to really appreciate the team I work with in thus new company.

Everything was perfect.. my boss was very smart, organized, and is a very good mentor. My team, all very accommodating, smart, competent, and independent people as well. As a newbie, I learned a lot from everyone. So I made sure to do my work well so I don't burden anyone in the team. And I was able to adjust well.

So around 2022, the setup of our team was, I have a boss, and under her, there's 2 of us working for the same food category, but handling different brands. The other person under my boss, who I call my partner, is also very good at her job and given the higher position she holds, I also learn a lot from her.

May 2022 came and they announced that our director will be moving to a different team.. We won't feel the changes they say because as is, our immediate superiors will still stay with us. Then Nov 2022 came.... they announced that my boss whom I look up to, will also be moving to a different team... what's worse?? My partner will be moving to a different team at the same time..

I didn't accept it very well at first. I can't quite wrap my head around the fact that I was left with this new director who was rumored as a terror one. Then my 2 favorite people in the company who happens to be my boss and my partner, are leaving me behind. I was heartbroken. But we all didn't have a choice. It was a strategic move and we don't really have a say in it.

I accepted it as they reassured me that since we're all still in the same company, I could still count on them to give me guidance whenever I needed it. Then my boss told me it would be a good time for me to shine since everyone else is new to the team, and I'm not. But then she also warned me that I have to be prepared as everyone, including my partner, new boss and new director, will be heavily reliant on my knowledge about the category.

But this is just too much. I tried to be patient, but it's been 9 months already and I still feel the burden of carrying the entire team. The new director is actually very good and we get along well. I also am learning a lot of new things from her so I appreciate that very much. As for my boss and my partner, while they have nice personalities and we also do get along very well, work wise, I'm sorry but I have to say this, THEY'RE THE FUCKING WORST!! AND TO THINK THEY BOTH HOLD HIGHER POSITIONS THAN I DO, GET PAID HIGHER, AND HAVE BEEN WITH THE COMPANY LONGER THAN I HAVE, THEY'RE TOO DEPENDENT ON ME AND IM FUCKING TIRED.

Being dependent is one thing, but at this point in time, for them to ridicule me if I don't know or miss on 1 thing that THEY SHOULD know given their ranks is just fucking frustrating. I mean, how dare you accuse me of not doing my job and embarrassing me in front of everyone when they can't even do their job right???? The audacity.

I have a very long patience and I also don't get mad easily because I try as much as possible to separate my emotions with work. And tbh, I sometimes don't see the point of getting emotional at work, so I usually don't show any emotions. But this setup has been taking a toll on me. I now get easily mad and rant a lot. And I don't like this version of me... it's toxic and i hate feeling negative emotions.

But it's also not my personality to point fingers..so now i'm confused. Maybe it's my fault for missing those things? Maybe I am lacking also in some way especially now that there's just too much load that I'm carrying.. maybe i'm not mad at them. Maybe i'm mad at myself for missing out on my items...

Am I just taking it out on them when I'm really the problem? Or is thinking that this is my fault is just wrong?",Elephant21_,1,1.0,1,1695435696,2023-09-23 02:21:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16psijd/im_getting_mad_a_lot_lately/,9,2023
16prt4u,starting a career in nyc after extremely intense depression,"hello, throwaway account for privacy. please don't judge

here is my current situation: 

i graduated from an ivy league with an environmental studies degree in 2022, which in retrospect has been pretty useless. i guess i was naive and i thought that following my passions would work out but here i am. i couldn't find a job and moved back in with my parents. spent the past year working at a coffee shop in my hometown where i was too depressed to seriously look for jobs (i have a really shitty/abusive family situation). i finally saved up enough to make it out of there and i'm now subletting a room in nyc. i have been applying for lots of nonprofit/environmental research jobs here to no avail. i've been getting through some interview rounds but all ending in rejections. i have good resumes and cover letters, and i am actually very personable in an interview. in getting rejections i've been told that i'm a great candidate, but they just ended up going with someone more experienced. i also don't really know how to explain to interviewers why i spent a year working at a coffee shop without telling them about being suicidally depressed. 

i don't want to work in the service industry again but i will if i have to to survive. i really want to get my career started; it's so depressing to look around at all my other peers making progress towards more money and passions while i feel stuck. i know that nyc is super expensive so it's a big risk, but literally all of my friends live here and i have no other family so i don't know where else i would go. 

so, basically my questions are:

\- how do i spin my story in a more positive light in interviews?

\- does anyone has insights into the job market in nyc, specifically nonprofit sector? 

\- if i do have to stay the service industry, how does someone new to the city find a decent position?

\- also, i am down to go corporate but i literally don't know how. i never had an internship in college, just research positions. so would appreciate any advice on that route. 

and just any general advice or words of reassurance would be appreciated. thanks in advance. ",ChocolateResident552,4,0.8299999833106995,3,1695433662,2023-09-23 01:47:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16prt4u/starting_a_career_in_nyc_after_extremely_intense/,9,2023

The firm is small and the partners are all over the place/there’s a lack of organization so it affects me in ways like getting everything I need to complete my tasks very last minute. The job is very deadline oriented so this makes me anxious. 

I have to sometimes work outside of regular hours and was supposed to have Fridays remote after the first month but everything has been so busy so that just hasn’t been the focus but I’m going to make it a point to say I would like to start fridays remote this upcoming week…

I am making about 67k and I am 24 so I kind of feel this is a rite of passage?? The field is pretty cool but my role in it is mostly just  coordinator oriented with some marketing mixed in. 

I guess I just don’t know how worth the spuratic stress is… I could easily leave the role because the guy who I’m replacing is still working there for the time being. We’re both technically doing the same role, but I’m pretty much doing the majority of it… I guess this is fair given that the goal is that I learn the job to the point that he can leave.

16ppyac,Should I take a new intern position?,"I recently interned for a large automotive supplier for the summer and received an offer to work part time throughout the fall semester (commute an hour one way, 3x a week). Team and culture is great, more accounting based that I expected, focus on PPE and equipment investment on a plant level. Assist finance team functions. However, I was applying to other companies before my internship ended in case I didn't get a return offer for the fall semester. I ended up getting a call back for a very large oil and gas company (commute a little longer due to traffic 1hr 10). Decided to go in for the interview as chances were I would not get the job but ended up getting a call back later in the week. Biggest reason they wanted to interview me is experience with SAP and some working knowledge on writing my own scripts. Position is forecasting and within their Treasury department, deals more specifically with cash flows forecasting/budgeting/plant investments but on multiple refineries instead of the local level. Biggest reason I might switch is I think it might be a good opportunity for career development and my resume. Some guilt as plant is new and headcount based off production which they are ramping up as equipment is being brought in and set up. I essentially track and account for 85% of all AUC to depreciation of equipment as more and more lines and equipment are brought in. I was essentially hired to give some breathing room for the team as they were very busy at the time but the total team has since grown to 7 (5 based in the plant, 2 remote).

We are able to manage our expenses but would like to make more. I’m also able to work remote and the work load is very minimal. I have been applying to other jobs because I have come from high positions in fast paced startups for 10 years and this work isn’t satisfying me. After 6 months of no luck I received 2 really good offers in 2 days and am struggling to decide what to do. 

Offer 1: 95k Base
Pros: 
- Massive equity
- Well funded company that is very secure
- Can start sell back a portion of equity after 1 year
- After 5 years it’s an almost grantee of over $500k in cash 
- I get to work on really neat tech 
- I get to go into the office with people (don’t get that now)
- Lots of room to grow in company with yearly equity and salary increases
Cons:
- Much longer days 8-12 hours (5-7 days)
- $7k yearly pay cut
- Not at home as much with little kids (2 under 2) 
- Low ranking role (I have been CTO and COO at other startups)

Offer 2: $150-165k base
Pros: 
- Remote, flexible and get to be home 
- Insane salary and changes our entire day/day
- Room to grow in company
- Good title and in charge of large project
- Industry I enjoy 
Cons:
- I don’t get to work around people 
- Equity doesn’t mean anything unless company goes public
- Not as well funded as the other company but is healthy

There are so many pros and cons I’m struggling to see what is better. Financially the second is amazing day to day but no long term guarantee. The second is not as good day to day but insane upside. The opposite is daily I would be busier and less from family, where the other would be home as much as I want.

16pjygr,CEO made a poor joke. Do I speak with HR?,"I work for a (nearly) billion-dollar company in the corporate office. I work directly with c-suite executives, including the CEO. 
Today, in a poor attempt at a joke, the CEO approached me, said ""You've been working hard, young lady. Have a bonus!"" Before placing a quarter in my hand. Yep, $0.25. I honestly believe it wasn't meant to be malicious, I just think that the guy is so rich (multi-millionare), that he has no grasp of how offensive that was.

I'm barely paid a living wage for my area, and live paycheck to paycheck, often skipping meals to ensure my bills are paid. 

Some background: My fiance and I moved out here for a good career opportunity for him, but it pulled me out of my industry and I'm starting over in my career so I'm pretty low on the totem pole. Before people start saying ""get a new job"", just keep in mind my experience in my new industry is limited, so pay will be low no matter where I go if I stick with my current track. 

Anyway, I don't like the experience I had, but I'm also afraid if I speak to HR about it it's pretty obvious who made the report and it might make the work environment awkward. 

He's actually a nice guy overall and has sung high praises about me to others in the company, I just think he's so disconnected from the concept of poverty since his pockets are full.

16pjkyd,Advice needed! I'm not sure how to progress?,"Hi all! I live in the UK (if that helps). I'm at a crossroads with my career and I'm not really sure how to proceed - scratch that - I'm not even sure I have a valid concern here but I'll ask anyway. 

Background: I've progressed from the bottom up in the railway industry and in to a role that offers normal working hours (for the most part) which allows for a normal work/life balance after having worked physical jobs with a lot of nightshifts. I don't have any qualifications outside of the railway apart from a foundation-level qualification I funded and studied in my personal time in Project Management and a small collection of UI/UX Design certificates. My day job is absolutely boring as s*** but it is stable and the day routine itself is extremely valuable to me. I find myself falling asleep at work during meetings just out of sheer boredom (even though I get sufficient sleep) or my mind wanders and I lose track and even find it hard to just sit still at my desk. On top of that, the company I work for is very disorganised and is still in it's infancy so there are no processes or approved ways of doing things and next to no training, support or professional development. They even struggle to pay their own staff correctly. I was aware of all of this when I transitioned in to this role from my previous after having been with the company for nearly three years but at that time getting away from nightshifts was the priority for the sake of my family and mental and physical health but now I feel like I'm going mad at work with boredom, disinterest and low morale and this can only negatively impact me and the work that I do.

Options: I've always been creatively inclined and basing my next steps career-wise off of my natural skills seem's like a sound strategy and pursuing a career as a tattoo artist would be a dream come true but as we all know it can be either notoriously difficult to actually become one or a very unstable career (from what I've heard) and I'm not sure I can deal with the financial uncertainty that may bring. 

I tried to think of a role that is still creative but perhaps more stable and identified UI/UX Design a couple of years ago. I have studied in my own personal time and gained independant certificates but have had absolutely zero luck with it after having worked on my portfolio a lot and applying to lots of vacancies. I'm losing confidence on this idea as a result and I understand that the problem most likely lies with me and not the recruiters at all but even then, I'm unsure how to proceed.

I then also wanted to further future-proof myself by gaining a qualification in Project Management which I rationalised because it could assist with UI/UX Design due to the project nature of the roles advertised but it could also potentially help with my current role if the opportunity to progress developed or I figured it might allow me to break away completely from my current role but even that is proving difficult due to a lack of hands-on experience. 

TL:DR I guess the toss-up is - Do I stay in my current role and go insane from boredom but have a relatively stable job or do I pursue my passion for art and tattoos in my personal time and work on my portfolio if/until I can serve an apprenticeship part-time and then grow in to a full-time role or do I pursue Project Management and/or UI/UX Design which appears to be oversaturated at the moment?

Here's a bit about my background: I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from a Tier 2.5 college in India, and I started my career as a marketing analyst in a tier 2 city in India. When COVID hit, I landed a remote market research role with a US-based boutique firm, offering a very good hourly rate. I took the leap and went full-time with them.  
  
Now, after nearly 5 years, I find myself in a bit of a dilemma. My current company isn't keen on promoting me, but they're willing to increase my hourly rate and provide opportunities to develop my leadership skills by managing subordinates. The issue is, this firm lacks the vision for growth, which poses a significant risk to my long-term career prospects.  
  
The market research job market in India is quite limited, with better opportunities often requiring a move to the US or EU, along with a master's degree like an MBA or MiM. I'm also unsure about securing a visa-sponsored job without a strong tech background, though I do have some tech skills, having developed in-house tools using Python and worked on sales automation projects with CRM integration.  
  
I'd really appreciate your insights on my career choices:  
  
If I opt for an MBA, which country should I consider, given that I'm not confident in my GMAT scores and can't afford the high costs of some B-schools?  
  
I've also explored product marketing roles, which often require an MBA, bringing me back to question #1.  
  
If I want to pivot into tech roles, where should I start and how? Or is this a risky move that could harm my career prospects altogether?",brownboy5540,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1695411751,2023-09-22 19:42:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16pjekf/is_this_a_career_suicide/,9,2023
16pj9su,"Was offered a manager position. BUT, I wouldn’t get a raise until I can prove myself in 6 months. HELP!","I have been at my job for 2.5 years now working as a Marketing Specialist. I love my job, it’s fun, flexible and I love my team. My boss just offered me a manager position, where I would have one direct report (marketing coordinator) to ease into management and they’ll put me through management courses, which is great because we are a very lean team and as of right now, there is no other option to move up in the company. 

Here’s the caveat- the company has enforced a new rule for management positions that you take on the duties for 6 months and as long as you prove yourself, you would then receive the raise, with no retroactive pay. They offered 7%. Is this normal?! In full transparency, my boss told me she was promoted prior to HR enforcing this rule, so she didn’t go through this. I have a lot more questions and have set a meeting with her next week.

Couple things:
- I will be asking for a write up for the new procedure, it’s strange they didn’t provide me with this, right?
- I’d like to counter and receive at least 10%, what’s a percentage I can counter with that’s not out of bounds?
- Just as an aside, another marketer who is more junior than me started in April 2022 and was promoted to junior manager by December 2022 as their division had another marketer on that team. I am the only marketer in my division. But I am going to assume she did not go through this trial period and that’s completely not fair to me. 
- My boss has offered me the position and completely trusts me to do the job, so to wait 6 months for the payoff kind of seems insane to me.

16pim3v,24 & in my first real office job. How much of my personality should I bring to the office?,"24 & in my first real office job. How much of my personality should I bring to the office?


I work at a large company with a pretty relaxed culture, but I notice that through email and on Teams, the people use a lot of corporate lingo

When I first started here, I tried to learn the language & would speak v professionally in emails and messages, with perfect capitalisation/grammar and zero abbreviations. But that got so draining and I would obsess over how I was coming across to the point where I stopped responding to emails because I didn’t want to deal with the anxiety of putting together a reply 

So I pivoted into just being more myself and acting naturally. Like if my natural instinct was to send someone a smiley face emoji in my email I’d just do it instead of trying to find the words to convey the essence of the emoji. I sometimes use slang. Also abbreviations like brb, gtg, lol, omg, etc

When it comes to actual work related stuff like writing official reports, I obviously keep my tone/language very matter of fact. But when I’m just communicating with my coworkers, it takes a lot of stress off if I can just be myself 

No one else on my team really talks like I do but I think it’s ok? I’ve noticed that people will get less formal with me too when I don’t use the corporate lingo back at them, which is also a relief. That said I’m worried I’m shooting myself in the foot by not speaking all corporate. I don’t get any negative feedback and sometimes my coworkers will laugh at the way I say things (in a good way), but I wonder if that means they don’t take me seriously? Is this a bad thing?",Fun-Switch6299,1,1.0,3,1695409801,2023-09-22 19:10:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16pim3v/24_in_my_first_real_office_job_how_much_of_my/,9,2023
16piaj2,Am I wrong for saying no to more work because my wedding is in 3 weeks?,"Long story short, I work as a mid level copywriter (recently promoted from junior) in an advertising agency. I was previously on one of the biggest brands/ clients at the agency. 

Unfortunately, the client got a new CMO so they are leaving because of business restructuring. Even though this is such a huge loss, there were no layoffs (that I know of) and they promised there would be none in the future. My coworkers started quitting in flocks to avoid the chaos of handing our work over to the new agency. This meant WAY more work for me and work WAY above my level. But I was ok with it because i new once the client officially left, things would chill out…

Meanwhile, I decided to take on another brands pitch work to prove my value, working nights and weekends to do a good job and win. This paid off and my idea was the top pick for that client. I was so happy. 

But because of this, I fell behind on wedding planning and feel completely burnt out. 
Now with only 3 weeks to go until my wedding, I’m scrambling to get things done. And now the creative lead of our company took notice of my winning idea and put me on another (more intense) business pitch, on top of placing me onto a new team. 

This pitch is insane and requires people to work nights and weekends. I didn’t know how to get out of it because I don’t know who my supervisor is now…so I took a couple sick days to decompress. I ended up missing super important meetings and now feel like an asshole. I tried to meet with creative lead to explain, but he won’t meet with me because he’s super busy with the pitch too and he doesn’t really care about lower level employees tbh. He ignored my message when I asked to talk for 5 minutes lol.  I feel like people are mad at me.

16phyy4,"Off My Chest: Disability, Race, and more","Hey there, Reddit!  
  
This is a bit of a long message about a matter of personal concern, please be understanding:  
  
For the past year, I have tried to move on from my position as a SAAS BDR/SDR to another company, for work life balance and because a change in management in the company has translated into it falling over time (high layoffs).  
  
You would think that for me (a 2 year experienced BDR and winner of the 2022 employee of the year award) such a thing would be as easy as 1,2,3.  
  
…But it is not.  
  
As it seems, after having memorized the interviewing script, sounding professional, keeping things short, and generally improving everything, I can't pass that first phone interview.  
  
I know that, for about every time I send a job application to a company, I am selected for the first interview. But, it seems like after that I get ghosted.  
  
Knowing this, I installed a voice recorder to study my calls, and could only find one issue: my speed and seemingly monotone voice.  
  
It was never what I said, It was always how I sounded, something I have tried to change, but found to be just my natural way of speaking.  
  
I have Asperger's, and what that means is, while I may put that I have no disability on my applications, people seem to always have an uncanny way of realizing that I have a disability.  
  
I was really hurt and took several days off interviewing after seemingly acing an interview call, and being told I will hear back on Wednesday, only to be ghosted.   
  
I really wanted to ask a few questions:  
  
1) Should I mention having a disability on my job application?   
  
A) What would this do (does it show to the employers that they can get a tax credit in hiring me? What is the percentage of the tax credit (25% or 40%, if I earned 100k a year, would they get about 25k-40k in credit (is there a limit)?  
  
B) Would they be able to see that I have a disability (either by being allowed or via internal corruption, if so is the corruption common)? How about via an algorithm that favors or opposes saying yes or no on an application?   
  
C) Is there a 7% requirement for federal contractors (most 1k+ companies) to hire people with disabilities? If not, do they still take it seriously (I heard it isn’t a requirement, but, that if they fail to meet 7%, the need to reevaluate, whatever that implies to the company, is that important or something companies care or consider)?  
  
  
2) Does listing I am a racial minority help?  
  
A) Does this give a financial incentive to hire?  
  
B) Same with 1B,  Would they be able to see that I am a minority (either by being allowed or via internal corruption, if so is the corruption common)? How about via an algorithm that favors or opposes saying your race on an application?   
  
C) Same with 1C, Is there a requirement for federal contractors (most 1k+ companies) to hire people of a certain race/minorities? If not, do they still take it seriously?  
  
D) With that said, does fitting as many boxes help? Would this allow them to meet multiple quotas through me, get more tax and financial credits/incentives, and overall help make my case better? Is there a limit?   
  
3) How should, assuming I should, disclose disability during applying (application -> interviews -> offer)?  
  
A) Should I disclose disability on application, then assuming I get the interview, Along with following in with the traditional interview format, mention that I have ADHD and how it gives me “superpowers,” etc? Would this imply that I will give them a tax credit and help them meet their quota or justify me having a disability as a good thing?  
  
4) Could it be something else?  
  
A) I am 20, and began working at 18 via a family connection, and have no college degree. Do you think this would matter, even though I sell beyond my quota at this 1k+ well established company?  
  
  
5) Any tips or suggestions?  
  
A) You can use this for any other comments, tips, suggestions (like should I apply to bigger companies, giant corporations with 30k+ employees, etc).  
  
I just want help, to get this off of my chest, and to have a brighter outlook. It has been a year of failed attempts.  
  
Even just writing this (saying that I plan to disclose disability) is an admission of defeat and makes me feel less of myself (I thought I can just go in based on my talent, but, it seems that even if disability is suspected, you're on the hitting end of the stick).   
  
If it helps, I am in Tampa Florida.  
  
Thank you

16phusl,My manager does not understand my work but takes all the credit,"I've been working on a program for the past 6 months under a manager that is supposed to be the technical lead for our effort. We are working on a software system, and he only seems to have a very basic understanding of programming in general. He has me make his slides that he presents to the program manager and coach him on how the system works repeatedly so he can brief the leadership. When he's asked questions he doesn't know, he will make something up. 

I wouldn't have a problem with this normally, I know it's the status quo for a lot of organizations. However, our work has been picked up by some important people and is making our company a lot of money. The program manager and the company leadership are under the impression it was the brilliant guidance of my manager as the technical lead that made it all possible. Really, it was my and my colleagues' teamwork who have developed the system despite babysitting my manager. He was actually a huge road block to the effort. I'm actually unsure of what he does at work besides continually attending meetings. 

I have voiced my concerns to him directly. I told him that as a technical lead, he needs to understand and preferably contribute to the code so he can actually provide value to the team and the program. He was unrepentant, so I find any change in his behavior unlikely. 

So what do I do? Part of the problem is my organization's structure that allows this sort of thing. Should I speak to the program manager? Should I speak to his direct manager? Going above his head is not something I want to do unless I am totally justified. Am I? I just want the program to succeed and to receive proper credit for work I'm proud of.",AdditionalPizza4400,4,1.0,5,1695407915,2023-09-22 18:38:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16phusl/my_manager_does_not_understand_my_work_but_takes/,9,2023

\- Currently a Senior Sales Associate at a large CPG company, looking to move from job because I'm finding there's little to learn in my current position, the role is focused heavily on visiting clients in person, just for me to have a brief conversation and leave, there isn't much for me to do instead of advise them on any questions, which could have been completed over email

I'm applying to roles such as Account Executive, BDR, SDR, etc.   


My theory is that if I'm able to move into a hybrid / remote role, I'd be able to spend more time developing my skills in order to get a more technical job. I'm very passionate about software engineering, I've completed intro courses and I'm currently doing my 100daysofcode journey, so I'm not worried about having commitment issues.

16pfmr6,Impostor Syndrome,"I’ve been at my current position for over a year.  I’ve never felt qualified for it, but I’ve had confidence in my ability to learn and adapt.  There have been a ton of challenges unrelated to my inexperience that I’ve had to wade through: staffing shortages, antiquated software, systemic problems, aggravated customers, intra-office conflicts.  It’s also an hour commute each way and I’ve sunk a couple grand into car repairs and gas this past year.

I’m a poor manager of my own time and mis-prioritize constantly.  This causes me to finish essential tasks late or at the last minute.  My new boss is frustrated by this, and routinely shows his disrespect for me in our interactions.  I won’t say I haven’t earned this disrespect, but it’s felt like there is little room for improvement even if I do get better.

I’ve been committed to making this job work, but that has resulted in me pulling dozens and dozens of late nights and early mornings.  I feel like I’ve invested no time in myself or the things that make me happy.  I can’t create a healthy work/life balance because I’m always thinking I’m working hard so I can “get over the hill.”  But I just don’t know if I actually ever will.  I don’t know how much of this situation is a problem with who I am, how I work.  My impostor syndrome tells me that if I was just one of these type-A, scheduled-to-the-hilt high-achievers, I’d be cruising to happiness.  But I never have been one of them.  If you were to ask me who I honestly think I am, I’d tell you I’m a lazy slacker.

I’ve been job searching for weeks because I’m unhappy, and feel unsafe in my position, like I might be replaced any moment.  The company has terminated at least half a dozen people in my position for falling behind.  When people get on my back about getting stuff done, it makes the sense of doom worse, and I kind of shut down.  I can be really productive when I buckle down and focus, but bit by bit my motivation has been sapped away, like there’s no one who wants to help, or cares if I succeed.  I don’t know how much of that is me being weak and incompetent, and how much is legitimate.

I’ve been offered a new job, closer to home, with a former colleague who is excited to have me aboard.  It sounds good: lower key, happy team, and a 7 minute commute.  But it’s a step backward in title, a big cut in pay, and honestly, taking it feels like a defeat; like I’m giving up on the chance to be a better person and keep the higher salary.

My girlfriend tells me that I’ve faced so many challenges here, anyone would be struggling, and I deserve something that’s better for me.  That’s why she’s so wonderful, and I’m so lucky to have her.  The part of me that hates myself says not to trust her perspective because she’s biased (positively, of course, lol).  She gets upset when I can’t bring myself to prioritize what is good for me.

16pfhq2,I turned down a promotion 2 weeks ago but it might be a mistake should I tell management that I now want it?,"Ive been at my job for 4 years. I like my job, my company, my commute, my WLB, I remain active and engaged and I am good at what I do. My job has other EE's who are in similar staff accounting position like me and they have been there for 6-9 years. I dont feel my coworkers are as ""good as me"" but to their benefit management leaves them alone and lets them enjoy their nice WLB job. Since I do good work its both a blessing and a curse; Management thinks I have ""potential"" and wants me more involved. 

I use to watch a stressed coworker named Jim in the office and I was thankful I did not have his job. Unfortunately Jim changed roles and they offered me a promotion to Jim's old role since they think I would be a ""good fit"". They did not offer this to any of my other coworkers. This promotion means more work, commitment, time, less WLB and certainly much more stress. When they offered me the promotion I got sick to my stomach. I went with my initial gut and turned down the promotion 2 weeks ago. 

Thinking of my career as strictly in a bubble, accepting the promotion is a no brainer, it increases my skill set, adds job security, has a slight bump in pay, title change, has me more exposed to execs and higher ups in the company etc. But my career is not in a bubble, it exists in my real life and can take time away from my family and hobbies. The ONLY reason I worked so hard in life is so I can obtain a good job with a good WLB and pay. Unfortunately it starting to appear that that is fiction/short lived as employers are always going to want me to be more committed than before and take on that next big role every 5 years or so. 

&#x200B;

1. Should I stand by my decision and continue to enjoy my job but risk there might be an ""up or out"" attitude at my company (and possibly a target on my back for saying no) 
2. Should I weasel my way back into managements office and tell them I changed my mind and accept the offer (possibly risk that its no longer on the table for me and look stupid + the loss of leverage)?
3. Should I just do nothing and show my company I still like working there (as I do) but next time they offer a promotion basically accept it no matter what as i don't think I can turn them down forever (although id love to stay in my role forever) 
4. Should I just leave and get a beurocratic government job that allows you to stay in the same role forever?

I do not have anyone I am able to go to for this. I come from a small, broken family and I am the first one to really achieve more than scraping by. I have spent most of my time working my way up as a cook. From flipping burgers to fine dining, etc. I ended up moving from running a kitchen into a brewery position as a brewers assistant. Within a year, I was brewery manager. Within another year, I was the brewery operation manager. 

I was with the business for over 5 years. Unfortunately, the business was owned by a group of people with no experience in management or running a business. I had to confront them multiple times over illegal labor practices such as calling employees exempt when they weren’t for three years. Forcing employees to work events up to 4 hours away but refusing to pay for their travel time. If employees worked multiple roles and went into overtime, they would pay overtime on their cheapest role and not the one they were in overtime for.  It also slowly started to become less and less profitable. Each week we had a meeting where we went over numbers from the previous week. It got to a point where I was asked to not share my numbers as it was negative and not helpful.  Even with their accountant telling them we were losing money, they would refuse to listen to any departments feedback.

This ultimately lasted up until one day where a few of us were suddenly let go in the middle of a day, including myself. They refused to give a reason to anyone. They fought tooth and nail to deny unemployment, which they lost, as not only was it without reason, they failed to follow their own written procedure. (Escalating system. X points got you stuff like no raise, no bonus, a suspension then termination.) I had nothing. 

This obviously has effected my references from them as they get to own the narrative when a prospective recruiter reaches out to them. I feel at a loss of what to do. I started looking into things like reverse recruiters to lend me a hand but they are thousands of dollars from what I saw. 

TL;DR My last five years of work which is most of my real professional experience, is tainted by soured relationship. What can I do to high light my skills and have some control of the narrative? I have no one to turn to for this sort of advice. I understand that often in these situations, it usually is the employee not telling it all, so I’m unsure how to get pass that predisposition as well.  Any advice would be nice.

16pf2oz,Promotion opportunity - how best to handle competing interest,"I recently applied for a new job with the same employer, but a different department. I've received signals that I'm going to be offered the position very soon at the base pay for the job classification, which would be a salary bump of \~25%. The thing is, I applied for this position mostly to stay sharp and really didn't expect to get it. I like my current position, and my boss has been grooming me for the last few years to take over when he retires next year. If I was to get his position, it would be equivalent to this new position (maybe slightly higher starting pay). 

If I tell my current boss that I'm going to be taking this new position, I have a hunch that he's going to offer me at least a raise to stay, and maybe even promote me early. I could potentially use that offer as leverage to negotiate a higher starting salary in the new job (instead of the base for that position). I'm no Machiavelli though, and I don't want to play myself out of both positions.

16pdmmf,Current employer will be doing business with an ex-employer that I was let go from. How to approach?,"I’ve worked in pharmacy my whole career mainly as a pharm tech, starting from a filler tech with no formal education. The years went on and I hit the pay ceiling that many pharm techs hit in retail/LTC pharmacy settings, so I started pushing into the specialty pharmacy side. 

I was employed at a specialty pharmacy for one disease state (neurology) and thoroughly enjoyed it. After a year in this position, two positions opened in another disease state that I was more interested in (pulmonology). That said, the vacant positions (as reported by those who left) were vacant due to the most senior member of this disease state being absolutely dreadful to work with. She was described as rude, elitist, stubborn, and toxic. 

I was headstrong and felt I could navigate the challenges; but I was wrong. This woman was absolutely insufferable and could not take any carefully crafted feedback or requests whatsoever without flying off the handle. My other coworker (our team was 3 people) agreed that she was awful. After more than a year in this position, I decided enough was enough.   

I attempted going through the proper channels of making my complaints known to my manager, and then HR, which resulted in nothing. Unfortunately for me, my direct manager (unbeknownst to me) was close friends with this abusive person. Despite a sparkling annual review, I was let go three months later, using very minor infractions/mistakes as their rationale. 

Fast forward three years and I’m in a position that is in neither neurology nor pulmonology, with a company that will be working with this specialty pharmacy. I’ve made references to my current colleagues about my previous employment with this specialty pharmacy and they’re hoping to use my past experience as an “in”, but obviously I’ve not mentioned “I was sacked from there.” 

The chances of my bumping into my previous manager is fairly low, but not zero. Should I explain the situation to my current employer/colleagues to avoid any potential uncomfortable situations? Or is that super unnecessary?",drinkspitspez,3,0.7200000286102295,2,1695397417,2023-09-22 15:43:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16pdmmf/current_employer_will_be_doing_business_with_an/,9,2023
16pdk54,Am I in a toxic work environment or just being dramatic?,"This is my first job out of college at a small marketing agency. I enjoy the work itself, but my company makes it miserable. 

Every single second of my time has to be manually tracked in real time with a record on what was completed. Even reading an email vs writing an email is tracked separately. I got in trouble once for making an internal call that was <1 min and not noting who it was to and the reason. If you run into an issue and something takes longer than expected, you will be questioned if you don’t make note of that too. They say this is to be able to identify pain points in our processes, but it really just feels like a micromanagement tool. Management has to be CC’d on all emails, external and internal. And often, emails to clients must be proofread by them. 

We are a team of < 15 people, and everyone talks about how they have “negative time” to get things done. Even so, management spends several hours a day “managing” us which includes daily time tracking checks and double checking the work that was completed. When we get feedback on work done, it’s not usually about the quality of work but more so on how we noted it in our system for them to see or how we word our emails. I know managers are supposed to manage, but in a team this small it’s hard to justify that being the bulk of their time. It’s extremely disheartening to have been here over a year, consistently doing excellent work, and still being treated like a child. 

A lot of work is passed off to lower level employees, even in instances in which writing the direction for that work takes longer than just doing it themselves. On several occasions, one of my managers replied to an email I sent them telling me to tell someone else something instead of just CC’ing them in their reply? It makes no sense to me. My team’s workload is overwhelming, but management doesn’t seem to notice that the excessive nitpicking and micromanagement is time wasted when they could be helping out with the actual work. 

There seems to be no trust here. Our director has acknowledged that they’re trying to take a step back and let us manage ourselves, but still, there is just so much nitpicking that has trickled down. I feel like I have whiplash because they will tell us that they trust us to do things and we don’t need their permission to make decisions, but then will interrogate us about what we did, why we did it, and why we thought it was a good use of time. All wrapped in a smile because “they just want more information and want to know how we can all do better” :)

16pdjpt,Former Navy SEAL looking to break into VC,"Hello everyone,  
  
I'm a 36-year-old former Navy SEAL, medically retired and living in the Dallas, Texas area. I have been out of the workforce for about 8 years, but am now excited to pivot into venture capital. Over the past 8 years I played poker at a high level, bought and sold multiple homes and dabbled in real estate finance (primarily refi's). I have what I believe are strong negotiation skills, leadership and charisma, as well as an ability to quickly assess value and risk.  
  
I'm more than willing to start at any level to get my foot in the door and am open to internships, project-based work, or any other entry-level positions. I think I could excel in real estate, tech / entertainment (I'm a gamer), healthcare, and aero & defense; but I'm open to all industries.  
  
I would deeply appreciate any guidance on the following:  
  
Networking: How would you suggest someone like me, without a traditional financial background or existing network in VC, go about making connections in the industry? Will my time lapse without a formal career be viewed as a negative / how should I best pitch this resume gap?  
  
Skill Development: What skills should I focus on cultivating that would make me a valuable asset to a VC firm? Any course or certification recommendations would be greatly appreciated.  
  
Job Hunting: Are there particular VC firms that are more open to non-traditional backgrounds, especially those related to military service?  
  
Insider Tips: Anything you wish you knew when you were trying to break into VC?

16pd1lo,Joined a recently acquired company,"I joined a new company in September and have enjoyed working here. The company was acquired by another company last year. The former company had serious problems that caused it to fail. My manager is an expert engineer and oversees a significant part of the product being developed. But in the past this part of the project was managed by other people (who actually aren't qualified to manage it). There is a lot of resistance from the older employees and they don't want to hand over the work. In addition a new employee joined recently and his  work overlaps with ours and he seems to feel a little threatened too. I guess everyone is worried about their job security. I don't want to jeopardize anyone's job but I have to do the tasks I am assigned, like ask for information about this part of the product, so it can be re-designed and improved in the new version of the product. Of course I support my manager but he works remotely and I am onsite so I have to see the other employees everyday. Our team is also only 2 people.

16pbwlq,Business development question: opinions on switching jobs early into new employment,"Hi Everyone, I was hoping to get some advice on a potential upcoming career decision. To note, I work in biotech doing mostly new business development and sales. I have a BS in molecular biology, but no graduate level degrees.

In April of this year, I accepted a new BD role with a small (\~10 people at the time) contract research org (CRO) providing analysis services to biotech and pharma. The science is incredibly interesting, and I really enjoy getting to learn on the job. The company is quite new, and most of my job is prospecting for potential clients and cold outreach, which has been really draining. I'm not landing the number of accounts I'd like to be (I promise I'm putting in the effort) because our technology is relatively new and potential clients see it as untested - in therapeutics development, few companies are willing to ""be the first"" in terms of paying for and using new types of assays which they view as unproven. I do believe the service I'm selling is very useful, and I think in a couple years time it'll be very common, potentially with my current company at the forefront of the industry. Right now though, I feel like I'm doing a lot of work with little return interest, and I'm increasingly anxious all the time about money as commission is supposed to make up a good chunk of my earnings. I find myself also constantly worried about my performance being evaluated as less than satisfactory, to the point where I lose full nights of sleep.

Recently, we had a sales training where I met one of our new hires, someone similar to my age with a lot of the same interests. The two of us really hit it off and I am happy to have a friend in the company - everyone I work with is incredibly nice and welcoming, but all of them are between 10-20 years older than me, so we had little to talk and relate about. Company culture wise, I have incredible respect for everyone I work with and have, in general, been happy at the company aside from the issues I note above. I haven't been applying to other jobs and was just hoping once I got a firmer grasp on the technology, I'd be better able to approach it from a sales angle.

This week, I got an email from a contact from my last job. This person had routinely been involved in sales to my last company and was emailing to see if I'd be interested in a position on his business development team. The company he works for is extremely large, you absolutely would be familiar with it if I said the name. I previously interviewed with them (for a role in another division) in April but since they're so large, it was taking a while to get through the process. I was relatively sure I'd be offered the job, but I needed to take a job sooner as bills were piling up as I'd left my previous job in December due to burnout and I live in an expensive city, so I accepted my current position instead.

This potential new role offers some great perks, not the least of which is brand recognition. While there would still be prospecting and cold outreach involved, they have lots of internal sales relationships and established sales support networks. The product is also much easier to sell - it's a well known suite of instrumentation that nearly all biotech and pharma labs need access to rather than a service they're not yet using in the first place. Finally, the compensation base rate is \~20k-30k better than I make now, and the commission package is more generous (I'm currently on 3% commission, this new role offers 60k for hitting KPIs, and this is multipliable. This is something I know less about, so if you have some input, please share.) They even offer a $500 stipend for me using my own car.

At the end of the day, the new position sounds hard to pass up - I haven't had the official interview yet, but I'm confident in my skills and since the hiring manager is something of a friend, it adds to my confidence I'd be offered the job over other candidates. They do want to hire as soon as possible for the new role. However, I feel bad leaving my current job. I've put a lot of time into training, money has been spent to get me up to speed with less than great ROI from my client accounts. I also really like the people I work with, and just made a great new friend who we even joked ""they hired just for me.""

I suppose I need some advice on which direction to take, if i should stay where I am and keep grinding at it, or if I should (if offered) take this new role. I'd also like some advice on how to breach that conversation with my boss, who is someone I respect a lot and who I do want to maintain a good relationship with. 

TLDR: I'm potentially being offered a better paying, easier role but I'm having doubt, perhaps guilt, about leaving my current company as I've only been there 5 months.",h_sch,1,1.0,0,1695393206,2023-09-22 14:33:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16pbwlq/business_development_question_opinions_on/,9,2023
16paviq,I am getting confused.,"20M here. Pre final year CSE student. I am specialising in cybersecurity. Back when I got admitted to this university, I was really excited, interested to know more about CS and cybersecurity, and what not. 
1st year. 2 semesters, got no subjects related to CS. Made me hella mad. Just ordinary physics chem maths, fricking digital literacy course. But I made myself calm down by thinking that every other CS student would be getting these subs only in the first year. I moved on.
2nd year. 3 semesters, only 1-2 courses related to CS. This is where my interest started to fall down. Meanwhile I used the internet to study the subjects I love but my interest was falling. I saw it.
(Note- My college was online for a whole year. I went offline in the second year, that too only for a semester. I came back home after 2nd year's 1st semester).
3rd year(current) - Finally some subjects started to show up but now I have no fricking interest in CS.

In my second year I explored the investment banking sector, financial markets, because that seemed something new to me. Since then I like it and my interest in it seems to be consistent in it. I like opening charts every day and analysing them. 
My current CGPA is 6.82, I fail in at least one subject every offline semester (every match subject in particular). I have that tickle of interest remaining in CS. I don't know how many options I am left with. I can pursue an MBA in finance, but it requires a hell lot of money. I can apply for an M.Tech degree but that too requires money and some interest otherwise it's of no use. I think I have already wasted my dad's money on this BTech degree and I don't wanna waste more. I sure can't get a placement because I have some college backs and the competition at my college for placement is so high that...you know... I can't even imagine entering it.

Im currently a junior (20F) in college majoring in Accounting. 

I attended my school’s internship/career fair looking for an accounting internship. I think overall, everything went well (in terms of speaking with acct. firms and some banks) and I’ve been in contact with several companies. I also had the opportunity to interview at a car dealership yesterday. 

The interview was for a Cashier position (basically  taking payments from customers, scheduling service appointments, etc.) and I know this probably has nothing to do with accounting at all, but it has a nice pay and part time hours. They even said there’s opportunity to advance into the accounting department and they have other locations I would consider moving to once I graduate. 

I was really looking for an actually accounting internship when I was at the fair, but after the interview yesterday I am kind of considering this option. Especially since I could move up and eventually get into the accounting department.

16p8nwj,Culture of inactivity,"Inactive company culture

I started working at the corporate offices of a successful regional pizza chain. I really like everyone here and am finding my niche as the data guy. However, it seems like no one is in a rush to take action. My direct boss is absent three out of five days a week and has more of a 'good old boy' approach. I've reached out to a few companies that could greatly benefit us in many ways, had a demo, and sent my notes on Tuesday. Unfortunately, I haven't heard or seen any response.

We're facing major issues with our phone tree, and I brought it up to another person who I was directed to as the point of contact, but I received no reply.

How should I navigate this situation? The CEO is active, but it appears he's not very focused. However, he has a huge workload, and I only get snippets of his day, so I'm not entirely sure.

Like I said I also had an interview with DLR and they said they would come back to me at the end of next week. Which could very well be later than Thursday.

So now I have to decide wether I take the Job at IBM and say goodbye to the DLR or I dont sign it, lose IBM and hope that I get a Job at DLR.

I’m starting to have second thoughts. I originally thought about doing a PhD, as I enjoyed my final year research project and also wanted to use it as a way to move abroad. My boyfriend lives in a different country and I would like to move there if possible. However, I’m not sure if I want a career in academia anymore, and I’m also a little burnt out from undergrad. 

However, I also have this fear of stagnation. I didn’t have anything lined up for work after undergrad. I had many interviews this summer that went nowhere. I’m currently working some crappy retail job, but was offered a full time role at my University just doing admin work. My plan was to do this job on a gap year and save money - but I worry this is not the best use of my time. Part of me feels like I should push through.

Throwaway account for anonymity. 

Two days ago, I got a Teams messages from someone that was on an interview panel for a job I had applied for exactly a year ago. I didn't get the job but I did feel like I left a good impression. He reached out to let me know that there was a spot opening up on the team and was asking if I still had interest. I responded saying that, of course, I still had interest. He then told me that the job I would be applying for is his job. He has a new job starting in October and was reaching out to recommend me to fill his spot. Other than the interview I got with the team, I have not spoken to him. He seemed like a cool guy, and I thought the interview had gone very well. 

I guess I have two questions:

1.) I have never had someone recommend me for a position, never mind their position that they are leaving (on good terms). How much weight does that carry in terms of applying/interviewing?

2.) Despite the maybe 3 hours I spent talking with him, is it odd that he felt he could recommend me for his postion?

I ‘m 28 yo and I’ve been at my company for 2 years now.  
This is my first technical job, and it was pretty tough at the beginning as my background only became technical at the end of my academic trajectory.  
During this time I’ve experience many ups and downs, from believing I was going to get fired at the very beginning, to the exact opposite. Particular circumstances can affect me widely.  
After all this time, I have still mixed feelings. On the one side, I can see people appreciate me, for example when I come back after long holidays; on the other side I often do not feel as integrated as others.  
Since I arrived, I was told they saw some innate qualities in me to be a manager/leader position. Right now, I’m managing a two guys team (besides me) on a project, and one of them is a very challenging person (not only with me but also with the boss, so natural behavior). I don’t like been bossy, I would rather suggest/provoke than order, I prefer listening and guiding than talking. However, he interrupts, believes his opinion/view is the best, and constantly take decisions and give commands to the other member of the team.

Probably what has gotten under my skin the most is how my department is basically being destroyed by a senior sales accociate (Susan) because our supervisors don't want to make her mad.

It's a department I'm not familiar with and she is known for her get it done attitude.

I am looking to start a fresh career next year, leaving my current career behind. I am currently 27 years old (male), I started in my industry at 15, which would make 13 years next year. I got into it through my father and went on to work for 3 different companies and rise through the ranks, so to speak. Since around 19 I have almost always made pretty good money and been comfortable financially. I'm now looking to start over with a fresh career in a new state. I'm okay taking a pay decrease, in fact I know that is likely at least for a while, but I'm looking for something that I will find some sense of fulfillment, satisfaction and dare I say joy in? I do not have college degree or certification of any kind, just my high school diploma. I'm open to taking a certification course or something along those lines, but not really a 2-4 year university degree. Here are some of my job skills, experience and hobbies. Let me know your thoughts, and thank you for your time!

* 1 year of welding and metal fabrication
* construction (framing, electrical, carpentry, roofing, decking, drywall, flooring, etc)
* Installation (Awnings, motorized screens, screened in porches, security shutters, interior shades, blinds, louvered roof structures, doors etc)
* Project management
* Training
* Administrative (Excel, email, order placement, communicating with suppliers and clients, scheduling, etc)
* Sales

Now here some things that I enjoy and have some experience with:  


* Nature/outdoors (camping, hiking, hunting, skiing, national parks, animals, ect)
* Weightlifting
* Landscape photography
* Videography (film, editing, special effects, camera work, ect)
* Motorcycles, dirt bikes, atvs

I'm willing and almost looking for a 180 degree turn in terms of career path. Anyways let me know if you have any suggestions!

16p0xxp,"Stuck at a toxic workplace, how do i cope?","My boss, who's also the company head (small company), gave me a task with unclear instructions. After completing it and asking for feedback, there was no response. Then, a few days later, he brought up the task in a meeting and criticized me publicly for the incorrect work. I didn't know it was wrong until then. Later on, he started making indirect, passive-aggressive comments in our work group chat about the mistake and my supposed lack of care. He also made references to an old employee he dislikes, blaming them for ongoing company issues.   
Before this incident, I'd been enduring snappy and indirect comments from the boss for a while. This was the tipping point for me, so I messaged him directly, addressing the issue and requesting private feedback or concerns. He responded politely but still subtly tried to blame me. I understand he's under stress, but it's no excuse for being unkind and demotivating.  
I'm feeling disappointed and trapped. Most of the time, I'm unsure if what I'm doing is right because I lack clear directions. I haven't had a performance discussion in over a year, no raise, and only indirect hints about career growth during company meetings. Meanwhile, others around me are getting promotions and pay raises. Many times, I've been close to quitting, but I have bills to pay.

16oz49p,Administrative leave but why…,"For some context, I work with a Colleague who is very authoritarian and pretty much has rejected every recommendation and always undermined my work. No matter how much data and evidence I bring it’s is always shot down. Where it gets more fuzzy is the fact that this colleague is a Director and always approves the work oh the friend that is also part of the team. This is creating a lot of favoritism and conflict.  So for more than a year I kept my mouth shut to the constant undervalue and abuse I have been enduring. As a senior PD with over 20 years of expertise this is the first time in my career ai find myself in such a situation.

Now I called this person out last week because the nepotism showed its ugly face again and I simply stated this person need to trust everyone and not just one person because of their out of office history.

16oz2j0,Administrative leave but why,"For some context, I work with a Colleague who is very authoritarian and pretty much has rejected every recommendation and always undermined my work. No matter how much data and evidence I bring it’s is always shot down. Where it gets more fuzzy is the fact that this colleague is a Director and always approves the work oh the friend that is also part of the team. This is creating a lot of favoritism and conflict.  So for more than a year I kept my mouth shut to the constant undervalue and abuse I have been enduring. As a senior PD with over 20 years of expertise this is the first time in my career ai find myself in such a situation.

Now I called this person out last week because the nepotism showed its ugly face again and I simply stated this person need to trust everyone and not just one person because of their out of office history.  I’ve never felt so undervalued and under appreciated in my entire career. This person is a bully.

16oyqkm,My first corporate role. Start up. Rejected from 3 proposals.,"I had my own business, finished my bachelors, have always been involved with sales and marketing. Wanted to finally apply to a 9-5 and luckily got one making 6 figures right off the bat for an account executive role with my previous experience and ability to sell myself to my manager.

There’s less than 10 of us that work there because we are an engineering firm that uses subcontractors. I’m the only woman in the office (And no, nobody makes me feel uncomfortable because of this, but it does make it hard to connect because I am MUCH younger than everyone else). My manager is really awesome, but I could tell he was hiding how mean the boss actually is. They both own the company, but the other owner is more strict and condescending. 

My job involves me bringing RFQs to my boss to look over and approve or disapprove. I then take it to the head engineer who explains how our company will approach this task/project and picks out subs himself for the job, and I’m supposed to collect this info from him. He also is supposed to tell his team to provide me with the budgets, timelines and whatever else information that could only come from their expertise. 

Problem is… I didn’t know about this process being this way until my second proposal. Towards the very end of it, I realized the team was coming to me only the day before the proposal was due. It disheartened me and made me look like a fool because I’ve been misled and feel taken advantage of because of the lack of information and pushback I’ve received while asking information from coworkers… I’ve been straightforward and assigned a task or two, and received pushback. 

My manager said he feels bad when he puts things on the teams plate so he understands, but now the other owner who is scary and passive aggressive af is pissed because we are 2/2 proposals rejected. And now I learned of a third that’s been rejected this week and I’m scared for next weeks meeting to come where he will grill me for this too. 

Strict/scary owner basically blended the truth and said we have never ever lost a proposal ever and basically said “wtf are we spending on our money on if account executive isn’t able to generate new deals? Why are we submitting proposals to things we have no chance in?” He said this in front of the entire staff, and we had reasons for why the proposals didn’t get selected and it was also because they were not typically in our realm of services, we were trying to break into those markets with little experience. Before I even started the 2nd proposal, I told my manager this was not the best idea because of how little experience we have and we will most likely not get selected… he still said to go for it because it was worth a shot.

He was still upset. And still is. After talking to my manager 1 on 1, he told me the other owner bended the truth for some reason and that they have been rejected before. Which is bound to happen if the business is open and running for 15+ years… plus these were the first proposals we could have had a shot at since I’ve started working there. Only a few come out like this anyways. 

I don’t know what to do at this point because I know I can add a million things to improve (which I am now going to do regardless bc the outcome from a rejected proposal is so bad here) but it’s also how old schooled they are, and it limits my ability to add my expertise. **key thing, I literally repurposed their older proposals. So what did I do wrong if they were getting selected with the exact materials I used for these new proposals that got rejected. And then there’s the team that typically blows off the tasks that are theirs to handle. 

Any advice? I want to improve. I want to hear similar stories and suggestions and hopefully find a light at the end of the tunnel before I sink into a depression come this next weeks meeting lol.

16oyhw3,"Screwed up at my front end brokerage branch job. Just need words of wisdom, I guess","I'm only 24 and haven't fucked up in my first job out of college till now, and idk what to think.  
I work in the front office of a large brokerage firm in New England that you have definitely heard of. I was handed a check to deposit today that was made out to Mr. and Mrs. XYZ Trust. In a rush to not make the client wait too long, I hastily deposited it into the wrong account (the account number on the check was for a joint account for Mr and Mrs XYZ). I didn't do my due diligence in checking the name on the account and comparing to that on the check and entered it improperly. (The registrations didn't match).  
Managers called me into their office, concerned that this wasn't the first time that I had an incorrect deposit and that they had spent many hours trying to rectify this since it became a risk issue. It concerned them since someone else's money could have been deposited into someones account and that it could've become a legal issue over. I have made a few errors recently and forgot/ neglected to follow the proper procedure.  
I was instructed to come up with a written guide/checklist that I can follow to ensure accuracy next time. I think I am just a bit startled by the concern that my mangers had expressed. I suppose it hadn't dawned on me that It could become a more serious issue.  
Any serious advice you can give me on rectifying this and moving on and not being so hard on myself?",redditstowaway1111,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1695349221,2023-09-22 02:20:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16oyhw3/screwed_up_at_my_front_end_brokerage_branch_job/,9,2023

16oxn37,Need Advice Between Two Different Jobs,"First time posting. So, I'm in a dilemma and could really use advice. 

  
I got laid off in May. I have worked in admin in finance (investment banking, hedge funds) for the past 5 years with no real progress in my career. To pick up some side income, I participated in a $150 focus group on a civil case in August. The man who was leading the focus group is a trial attorney who has lead over 1,500 focus groups in 37 states. He also ran for governor but lost. Regardless, he's had an incredibly successful career. He's 70 years old. 

  
At the end of the focus group, he announced if anyone is looking for a part-time gig, come meet with him in the lobby. i and 6 other people were interested. The next day, he reached out to me and said he thought I was bright, articulate, and ""someone who might be good at doing some of the kinds of the work I was thinking of"". I thought, what's to lose, and we chatted. He told me he makes $15K PER focus group and that he estimates if I just do 2-3 focus groups per month, I would make $350K per year. I have never made more than $115k in my life btw. 

  
He invited me to join him in New York to work on his next focus group. He was clear that he would not PAY me but would cover my flights, meals, and hotel. The days of the focus group were really long, 14 hours per day for 4 days. Even though unpaid, I really enjoyed my experience. I asked him if I was to help him with the next focus group, would I be compensated for my time. He was APPALLED and asked with what money? I said, ""Well, you're getting paid $15k, so I would expect to get a portion of that."" He said that I completely misunderstood his offer and that I would not be employee but his partner. Meaning, I would have to invest my time, unpaid, for the next 6 months to learn how to be a focus group facilitator so that I could lead them on my own. He said that you can be an employee all your life and that it takes ""faith and strong entrepenurial spirit"" to do what he does. I said his initial proposition was misleading. He said he'll think about it and that MAYBE he could pay me $2500 for each focus group during this time after I explained I need something to keep the lights on. 

  
Alternatively, I have an interview for an admin role in Finance. It pays 115k, is stable, and would have health benefits. I would be back where I started.

The new position will pay around $85k, but would require me to be in the office 3 days per week (the other two days being work from home). 

A few things to consider:

If this was 2019, and both jobs were in the office full time, I would take the promotion without a second thought. Long term, I may move into private industry and the new job would help.

16owqc0,I need some opinions and advice,"I went to school for nursing (RN associate)
It’s been about 2 years since I graduated and I just recently passed my nclex in august. I took it once before and failed and it was a major blow to my self esteem and made me feel like I chose the wrong thing. I built up the courage to take it again and passed. 

A little background. I suffer from bad anxiety and depression. I worry about a lot of things. I work as a PCA/home health aid for one person and I have anxiety every day going even though I’ve been working it for about 2-3 years now I think. 

I have this constant nagging thought that I chose the wrong career and that I’m just not cut out for it and now that I’ve been out of school for 2 years that it’s too late and I’ve lost all my nursing skills. I do nursing things at this job that I am at because me and the two other PCAs are really the only people to take care of this person (I pass meds, change catheters) but I still get into my own head. I have no confidence (I’d say negative confidence) and it’s beginning to eat away at every aspect of my life. I’m in therapy and stuff but I just don’t know what to do. 

Again my main fear is that I’ve just been out of school too long how am I gonna work an actual nursing job. Idk maybe it’s irrational I just can’t help feeling this way. My entire life I’ve had unimaginable pressure on me and I feel like I’m now just a weak scared person. I feel like I’ve ruined my life choosing to go down this route. It’s not that I’m not smart.

I went in to get a bachelor’s in psychology and I (thought) that my mind was made and I was leaning towards developmental/adolescent psychology. Possibly becoming a therapist.

I do plan on going back to college once I better my current living situation.

16ouute,"Witnessed my boss have a breakdown today, should I find another job?","I am 30F and been at this company for 4 months as a customer operations coordinator. Before I started I did read a lot of negative reviews online, maybe just mentioning understaffing issues, too much work, yelling in the workplace, high turnover, running too lean.

I started in late May. I didn’t feel very supported and felt a bit bullied. Managers seemed annoyed when I asked them questions. I felt I was yelled at and talked down to meanly several times. I had barely any training and as my coworker stated, I was “learning on the fly”.

Everyone works overtime as the workload is just so high. It’s a ton of manual PO entry and order management, babysitting dozens of orders until they ship and then dealing with all the issues afterward, working with shipping and supply chain to get orders out, many issues with that, and communicating with customer a a lot over mostly email. And many reports to check and react to daily.

In July a coworker who had been there since March was fired for being behind on orders and emails and not saying anything. Then another coworker was fired a couple weeks ago. I’ve heard they go through people a lot. They talk about people “making it”, it is like hire by trial. If you can’t keep up with the minimal training you’re done it seems.

The processes are outdated. Manual order entry and a whole bunch of dumb processes are in place along with understaffing. They say they will not hire more as it is a “spend department” that doesn’t add value.

I’m overwhelmed and barely able to keep up, always a little behind really even though I work very focused and as fast as I can (my email is constantly freezing up which gets infuriating, IT is all in another state at corporate and they are never very helpful at all) and work overtime weekly. They made us sign document that states we have to respond to emails within one day and enter orders within one or two at the absolute maximum. 

They had a meeting after they fired my coworker and told us all about it and how if we do anything similar we’re done. Then I witnessed my two managers trash talking him right next to my desk after the meeting about how he vapes and went to his car during lunch and didn’t take lunches or clock out and complained that his manager was clocking him out for lunch (illegal!).

I was looking for new jobs but then they started investing in us and had us read a business book and talk about improvements to be made. They want to change the monthly staff meeting to include our ideas and feedback which sounds nice. Don’t really think I trust the management though. It sounded good and I felt positive but the toxic management has seemed to really just go back to their old ways.

I was invited to some interviews but I didn’t go since they seemed like they were trying to improve. I make 52k plus overtime (2 hours max) at this job which is good for my title.

But today our senior manager was working elsewhere and my manager was using his office to be in a meeting. She might have been meeting with the senior manager, I’m not sure. She came out of the meeting teary eyed and asked if I could please help with orders of another business unit. I was behind on my own orders but said yes. So I brought my laptop home tonight so I could work more even though I stayed a half hour late already today. Then she went to a senior coworker and was crying a lot and the coworker was consoling her. I’m assuming something was said to her in that meeting she had in her boss’ office, probably her idiot insensitive boss being a jerk. My coworker next to me said that, “this place is going to break her”. I’ve never seen her close to crying at all, she’s not like that.

It made me mad on her behalf and want to look for a new job to save myself and perhaps make a point, that they will run away employees. They did say I could shadow the marketing department and are for developing careers there and promoting from within, but every department I’ve come into contact with is apparently understaffed. They’ve all said it. Everyone feels it. 

Everyday is so stressful with the volume of work and stupidity in outdated processes going on. I have no doubt that my senior manager is out for his own career and doesn’t actually care about improving the workplace or how stressed people are due to bad management and impossible workloads. He just demands what he demands and will easily fire you if you don’t live up to the impossible expectations.

I am getting along better with some coworkers especially since my desk was moved away from management (we all changed desks) and moved right next to a senior coworker and the only other person in my business unit, so we can work together, I ask her questions all day and she happily answers, she is a bit of a control freak and very particular, sometimes she gets in her moods and has very high expectations, but at least I get to learn from her and actually can ask questions. I didn’t go to some after work happy hours and I’ve been a bit excluded from the in clique I feel, besides a few people.

Also, my department is blamed for everything that goes wrong and we are held to a much higher standard than other departments since we are customer facing. We work closely with shipping and material planners and feels like we’re doing what management should be doing, that’s what management did at my old job, the reporting on orders, solving issues, and CSRs only entered orders and fielded basic inquiries.

I know you’re only hearing my perspective but it feels very toxic and I hear many coworkers say negative things a lot.

I’m embarrassed because I told my boyfriend that I was looking for a new job a month or more ago and then a couple weeks later changed my mind. He is always positive and I feel negative like I’m just focusing on the bad. Maybe I could use the high turnover and terrible processes to my advantage by growing my career and helping make changes.

Also, this company is at the TOP of what they do, they are a chemical ingredient manufacturer, and their product is in more than half of grocery store items. They charge a premium price and are supposed to provide premium service but we definitely can’t do that with how much work we have to do in a day.

TLDR: should I look for a new job at a new company or stay and try to grow my career at this company that is poorly run?

ETA: I forgot about the fact that each quarter, the CEO sends out a list of all the people who got fired (no names just titles) and why (code of conduct violations). They like to threaten people with firing. In fact on our bathroom doors there is a bright notice about protecting company information and if you violate policy “YOU WILL BE FIRED!!!”",RealAd1811,24,0.800000011920929,28,1695338817,2023-09-21 23:26:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16ouute/witnessed_my_boss_have_a_breakdown_today_should_i/,9,2023
16ou7ok,Unsure,"Hello, I am a (24F) who graduated with two degrees because I began college very unsure of what I wanted to do in life. I have a BA in Psychology and a BS in Computer Science both of which I graduated with a GPA of 3.8+. I did psych as my first degree just so I didn't waste any time and I always grew up loving technology and being my family's tech support when something goes wrong so I thought comp sci would be great. I really enjoyed taking comp sci classes and completing the projects. However, It has been almost a year since i've graduated and I have zero experience in the field and never had the self-motivation to do projects on my own to showcase. Not to mention, I have horrible anxiety so even the thought of an interview scares me. I'm a fast learner and am super reliable but have this deep anxiety and fear within that I just can't seem to overcome. I get so nervous in situations like that and freeze up, I don't feel like I could really show people who I am as a person and I feel overlooked due to having no experience as is. I've gotten a medical office job to keep myself busy and atleast working within the past year but now I moved away and unemployed so i'm starting to feel a little depressed with nothing to do. So basically I just feel like a big failure and very unsure of what to do with my life right now. I've always been a hands-on learner so I have been researching programs I could do on the job training with that could help lead me somewhere but I am lost. If anybody has any recommendations and/or programs I could look into that provides training I would greatly appreciate it. I am open to any type of work, not looking for anything in specific.

16ou4jw,"Lost job, floundering for something new","I've been working as a Salesforce consultant for the past 4-5 years and just recently got laid off, from a combination of upper management nonsense and my ADHD and PTSD symptoms making the situation worse.

I'm mediocre at Salesforce, and I'm pretty terrible as a consultant. I really enjoyed the problem-solving/creative/helping others aspect of it, but corporate culture and tracking billable hours drive me completely crazy. I'm trying to find a job that can pay the mortgage, but before I worked in Salesforce I worked in retail, and there just isn't anything available near me.  


I'm searching for a WFH job that's straightforward, pays minimum $50k, and either a) is creative and 'weird' enough to keep me engaged (example: I applied to help manage a slime toy manufacturer's customer service and product shipping); or b) involves me talking to as few people as possible and won't fry my brain. I've been looking into data entry positions, but they seem to be all over the board in terms of pay/requirements/scams.  


Any advice? I know everyone says ""get into coding!!"" and I already know basic HTML and CSS, but it seems like every single tech thing is deteriorating right now. Is anyone really getting coding jobs anymore? I've thought about learning something like Shopify dev, since that feels a bit close to customizing a Salesforce org (and all the Neocities nonsense I fill my time with) but I have no clue how viable that is.  


And I'll be real with you all - if I could get paid to stay at home and take care of my elderly father for his remaining years, I would take that.

16ou0g6,Losing Technical Skills as an Engineer,"Hello, I'm about a year into my career as an electrical engineer working in electronics. I got pretty good grades in college. Towards the end of my undergrad much of my coursework was not super technical or focused on working with electronics, and I felt I lost a grip on some of the skills I had developed in my earlier coursework, when I had hands on projects and was working on problems routinely.  
When I graduated, I struggled in technical interviews, but I did get a job. I figured once I was in the work force, I would begin to sharpen my technical skills again. Now I'm looking for jobs again, and while my current role is in electronics design, my work hasn't been strictly technical, so I just feel like my fundamentals are still not as polished as they need to be to get through technical interviews.  
Is it normal to lose this kind of knowledge? I feel like it's too early in my career to be losing it. Do I need to be studying and doing hobby-type projects in my off time to prepare? I like my job enough, but I generally like to leave the engineering for work and enjoy other hobbies in my free time.

16ou0bx,What kinds of mid-career roles would be a good fit with my unspecialized experience?,"I am currently searching for a new role, but struggling to land something because my background is very broad. I am essentially a mid-career renaissance woman with tons of strong skills and talents, but no degree or official management experience outside my own very small company.

My strengths are in:
- interpersonal communication
- writing
- presentation design
- public speaking
- event planning
- strategic planning
- project management
- efficiency and problem solving
- guerilla marketing
- any creative, collaborative, or relational work

My most recent work history (since 2016 and as far back as 2010) consists of a few entrepreneurial ventures, freelance contract work, and gigs. This includes work as an artist/designer, performer, astrologer, tarot reader, reiki healer, relationship coach and matchmaker. These all have pros and cons, but none of them are a fit for my financial needs. 

I am also a founder of a relational skills education startup, which is currently in research and development stage, pre-launch. I was able to raise $45k in pre-seed funding and lead a team of up to 4 people at a time for about a year.

Additionally, I have developed a disability where I need less labor intensive work, and a consistent work schedule where I can get plenty of consistent sleep.

Right now I am just waiting tables to pay the bills, but it is taking a toll on me physically and preventing me from working on my startup. I need something that is stable and less physically demanding for a few years, as well as a plan B in the event the startup fails.

I have formal employment experience up until 2017, which includes roles of admin assistant, marketing assistant, office administrator, service coordinator. 

I'm finding my experience is too much for admin jobs and too little for management jobs. It is also so all over the place that I seem unfocused, which is kind of true careerwise. 😬 I am a very ambitious, positive, energetic people person with diverse skills, but it seems I'm not ""exactly"" what anyone is looking to hire.

I work in project management. I’m currently in a role I don’t like and will leave in the near future regardless of what I do in this instance. I don’t hate my current job, but I’m not happy. I’m not doing the kind of work I want to be doing or developing the skills I want.

I recently interviewed for a role internally and didn’t get it, but it did go well. My boss knows this and so I’ve now been shoulder tapped for a 12 month secondment of the same role I interviewed for, but in a different department. This particular department is assigned to one extremely difficult client with a high value portfolio. It’s the most prestigious portfolio in my company and I would be managing all projects for it. The client knows this and as a result can be extremely unpleasant to deal with. My boss wants to recruit internally due to how complex the role is and knows they’ll have a hard time filling it. The boss knows I could handle it and that I want experience in this particular role. I actually lost the role I originally interviewed for to the person who has been managing this difficult portfolio for several years, so it gave her an edge for sure. I asked why she’s leaving and she wants to vary her experience after working for years with the one client. She did acknowledge it’s demanding, but thinks I can handle it and actually recommended me to my boss.

Ultimately it would be good for my career development and give me the experience I want so I can move on the bigger and better things in 12 months. I would know going into it that it would be working with a difficult personality, but also that there is a time limit on it. I’m not one to sacrifice happiness for a career, but it feels like a door has been open that will have long-term benefits.

- 10 days PTO with a handle of personal and sick days mixed in
- Cigna Healthcare and Healthcare HSA+FSA
- Other benefits include gym, therapy, pet care, a Share Option Plan
- A similar title to my last job
- Better opportunity for growth due to large organization + growing team

Job 2:
- Completely remote however will need to go into the office (which is located in a nearby state) once a month
- First day will be Monday
- $78,000 salary
- Nonprofit sector
- 403(b) retirement plan with no employer contribution
- 20 days PTO with no other eligible days off
- Carefirst Healthcare and Healthcare FSA
- As far as I'm aware no other extravagant benefits 
- Much more senior title to my last role
- Not too many opportunities for growth as far as I'm aware

Writing, researching, and story-telling, has always been my passion and I would love to pursue it. I am considering doing a PHD but it's a huge long-term commitment and would involve a significant paycut.  
One avenue I'm considering instead is to continue working in my Tech job, but to spend my spare time research interesting topics/news developments and writing thought pieces and analytical pieces on them. The goal would be to publish them on my own personal website portfolio or blog, while simultaneously pitching them to small time publications and websites looking for contributors.  
My goal would be to have a published thought piece or analytical article on a reputable site within 5 years time and to build on things from there, ideally one day perhaps leaving my Tech job to pursue journalism full time.  
Now I'm not saying that timeline is wholly realistic or anything, but right now this is a path I am considering. I was doing this 8 years ago, but stuff happened and I moved abroad etc.... but now I'm considering this again.

16oq017,Career Advice,"
Hi everyone, I need your suggestion on what can the next step in my career be.

I live in Mumbai, India have a bachelor's degree in mass media with major in advertising. Back when I picked out my degree I was not very much aware of the possibilities out there and even faced some financial problems that made it not feasible to do what I may have thought would be a good career option. Once I graduated I got to know about the opportunities like advertising, branding, filmmaking etc. Somehow through internships I ended up working for shoots. It has been 2 years since I graduated now and I only have experience of internships and projects. Most of which are experiences of freelance assistant direction work or production/artist management. I struggled with extreme low self esteem and identity crisis but I do know that I have the potential in me. Recently, I was at the lowest point in my life and that's when I figured maybe studying ahead specifically in something would be a good option to start a career and get where I want to. I have been giving the postgraduate diploma in advertising and branding by Xavier's institute of communications a thought. At this time of studying I can develop my skills with better education opportunity and grow into it. My brain is fogged. Can anyone help me with whether or not it is a good decision to pursue the diploma course or I should directly apply for jobs? Am I just allowing my self doubts and self confidence get over me? I do believe that studying that course would be beneficial.",notneymarr,1,1.0,0,1695327140,2023-09-21 20:12:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16oq017/career_advice/,9,2023

I have a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology however I need some direction. I have the skillshare app but I’m not sure what skills I should be learning for remote jobs? I’m aiming for something that can help me earn $50k-$80k per year. It’ll help me become more stable. If you guys have any suggestions for careers and even be able to list out where you guys learned those skills it would mean a lot.,Thin_Koala_606,1,1.0,0,1695326513,2023-09-21 20:01:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16opq7i/trying_to_get_into_project_management/,9,2023

16op3gr,How do you prioritize factors in choosing between potential job offers?,"For context, I've been job hunting for a while. Money is getting tighter by the minute, so I feel a lot of pressure to take what I can get. I have two solid leads right now, neither is a sure thing, but I really want some input so I can prepare myself to make a choice under pressure if I have to.

Job A is with a company I've worked for before. Its a customer facing role in an office setting, but only for the Christmas season. HR has told me that if all goes well, there's always a chance I could extend to a more permanent contract depending on company needs. The pay is barely above minimum wage, but it's almost certain that I will get the job (but not definite, obviously). I would start in mid-October if that was the case. My contract would last until January.

Job B is with a company I haven't worked before, but it's essentially the same. This would be totally remote and a permanent contract. The pay is significantly higher, but the interview process will take much longer and my start date wouldn't be until early November. 

Let's say I get an offer from Job A and accept. What would happen if I got an offer from Job B? Do I just quit a couple weeks in? I'd barely be able to give notice if that were the case. I feel like I did a lot of job hopping during the pandemic, so this doesn't feel right to me. I don't want to alienate a connection. My partner, however, thinks this is the way to go.

On the other hand, if I hold out for Job B, I might not get it and then will have already passed up on Job A. Then I'm basically back to the drawing board. 

Aside from the anxiety of making the wrong decision and inconveniencing folks, there's also the fact that I hold a masters degree and am also sending out applications to other roles in my field. I have a couple of soft leads, but nothing super serious yet. Even though Job A is less money, it also gives me a little more flexibility if something comes up in my field. It's also in an office setting which would be a cool opportunity to meet some friends as I'm relatively new in my city.

Am I being dumb? What is the standard here for making a decision like this?",keeeeeeeeeeeeeek,1,1.0,1,1695325057,2023-09-21 19:37:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16op3gr/how_do_you_prioritize_factors_in_choosing_between/,9,2023

I ruminate and obsess constantly to the point that I'm only sleeping five hours a night and just can't shake thinking about how unhappy I am and worrying about all the things that stress me out about my job. My goal was to make it one year in this job (so early December) and then quit to reskill/upskill to a new industry between December and next summer when my spouse and I will move to a new city for their job in June. Lately I've been thinking about leaving in November - or even October - as the anxiety feels unbearable.

The job is like basic support for a specific program that I've worked with in the past, so it's way less than what I do now and it's remote, so way more time for me. It's for a smaller company as well.

The job only wanted 3 years + exp which I massively pass so in theory I should easily get the top range of 90k.

Is this something I should go for? Would taking something that seems like a lesser position be worth it? It is remote so that's a big plus, but I would be leaving a company 'everyone wants to work for', but support doesn't usually get promoted here, I've been here almost 3 years.

16oljhf,Advice on Career Change from White Collar to more Blue Collar,"I (30M) am seeking some advice from others on how to approach a possible career change from a white-collar engineering job to a more blue-collar manager/inspector/field work job. I currently work as an engineer for a large aerospace company and am degreed in such but feeling a bit unfulfilled in my day to day. Each day I pretty much just work on paperwork stuff related to my engineering role (very boring to me). I previously had a job that was 50% on the manufacturing floor, and 50% in the office type engineering role which I enjoyed more but am the usual person who jumped for more $ (bad decision in the end - it was more from that societal pressure to move up in the corporate chain when I really didn't care about this besides family/friends endorsing it). I did this to join a large company and hopefully be in the same role, but it was not what was advertised. And I have proposed the question to my boss about finding a role to be more like this and he said it cannot be entertained at this time but maybe a later date. That was over a year ago and with it being mentioned a few more times; it doesn't seem to be getting addressed. Which I understand, I am in the position which has set duties I must perform.

Ultimately, I enjoyed the 2 manual labor jobs I had up until graduating college and want to get into a slight engineering role with a heavy focus on managing/inspecting in the field on projects within like the construction industries (or others) where I can be outside and not inside behind a desk. So, currently floated a few applications out for a construction engineering inspector and another and ultimately got a few calls stating basically ""why the hell do you want to do this?"". I tell them the reason and they don't believe me that I do not want to be stuck behind a desk and would rather be outdoors getting my hands in the work itself. In the corporate world, it is almost as though you are explaining your reasons in these initial conversations to have it fall on deaf ears as a person who isn't ""serious"" because they are a white-collar folk. And from working in manufacturing, I felt like I always belonged with the workers and not so much the office personnel, so as to my reasoning for wanting to switch. And from personal experience with having been tasked with hiring production/manufacturing people, it is incredibly difficult because now manual labor/makers are being devalued for this societal push for white-collar jobs and a race to stack cash. So, we see issues with these positions going unfilled and companies offering big incentives to attain these individuals. 

So, I guess my questions are how do I convince (because every interview I had you are basically convincing/selling yourself) these HR reps/hiring managers this is what I want to do? I understand I am not fully qualified, but it is mainly in positions where I am familiar with the manufacturing processes they are dealing with. I just need a start somewhere and want to make sure I am presenting myself in the right fashion. Most of the individuals I have spoken to say why would you want this switch from the status and leave what you have started. And to me it is mainly about job happiness and feelings of worthiness, rather than status. I live very modestly and don't desire to have a giant house or fancy car as I grew up very middle class and am used to this. Just need the essentials in life and I am generally content & happy. So, I am generally ok if it is a little pay decrease, nonetheless. Any feedback is greatly appreciated as I am fully on board with this, and my fiancée supports me as well.",beanman214,1,1.0,0,1695316853,2023-09-21 17:20:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16oljhf/advice_on_career_change_from_white_collar_to_more/,9,2023

This morning, I spoke with my tax planning professor about pursuing a career in investment banking. He said the best thing I can do is work for 2–3 after graduation and get my MBA from the absolute best program I can get accepted to. (Think Harvard, Yale, UPenn.) I guess what I am really trying to understand is would I have a chance? By the time I graduate I’ll be 25 with an undergraduate degree. It feels to me that I’ve missed the window of opportunity given all this additional time needed to work for a few years, get an MBA, and then start looking into investment ranking roles.

As I get closer to the office, I wonder why I even work there. The people there seem to incompetent for their roles and most of them seem to be there just because they can't possibly get another job. These people put in so little effort at work and just pretend to work whenever the higher ups show up. Looking at that environment, the initial enthusiasm I had for working has all but dried up. Now I just go to work and feel empty everyday. Just counting the days till I'll have enough money saved to quit this job and just go out to travel for a bit, re-establish my faith in humanity that I've lost over my tenure of working here.

I know the job market is kind of down so it makes me a bit hesitant to take that step. I'm almost there where I'll be able to go off grid for 6 months or so. So I'm still wondering if I should take that step because even though it'll be risky, I know that staying here for another year will leave me in a state of mind where I'll have lost all faith in humanity. Maybe it is my youth speaking and the high hopes I had getting into a professional life.

I just got my start date for my dream job and company. It will be 3 weeks from now. 

It’s an extremely busy time for my team and we are already underwater with no additional help. I really like my team but I want to give myself at least a week off between jobs. (Burn out is one of the reasons I’m leaving among a lot of things… but still like the people, just not looking to be overworked and underpaid anymore).

I am also a chickenshit at quitting having only quit (and wracked with guilt) twice in 10 years and giving a whole month in advance. Culturally I’ve also been taught I should be grateful for just having a job so I’ve never been supported by family in career choices. 

Part of me wants to just tell my boss today and leave myself buffer room to rest. But then the other part is wanted to give all three to finish all my projects, and because I took three days off in the coming week (planned way ahead of this) and not burn bridges (though I am leaving for a completely different industry I still want to be civil)

16ohjec,Do I tell my boss about an offer I turned down to beat the gossip?,"Was given an offer from another company for a lot more pay, but, I don't think I'm going to take it. Just not what I want. I know I need to leave my current company if I want to move up eventually and get paid more, but I don't want to leave for this.

It's been a bit of a weird process for this job. My industry is very incestious and extremely gossipy. I have no doubt that eventually my higher ups will hear from someone who told someone that I was interviewing for this position at some point. Am I better off being upfront about this so they hear it from me first? I'd rather beat the gossip and own the story. 

I luckily have a great relationship with my manager and we are both very honest with each other about career stuff. So, my initial thought would be to tell him this happened, but that I'm not going through with it, and then hopefully turn that into a conversation about future compensation and career development.

16ohawx,Facing a Crossroads in My IT Career: Stick with a Questionable Promise or Look Elsewhere?,"TLDR; Ive been at my current job for 8 months, where I was promoted to a solutions architect but still earn below industry standards ($65k). I submitted a detailed IT overhaul proposal addressing regulatory compliance, security risks, and labor issues, but it was mostly denied; however, I was given a word of mouth raise to $100k if I ""prove myself"" by fixing security issues. What experiences with this kind of situation do you have and/or advice ? 


————-
Hello all,

I work for a company with several hundred employees in the U.S. I've been with the company for 8 months and was promoted from a mid-level IT technician to a solutions architect/full-stack developer after just one month. 

Despite the title, my role is more programming-related, but my current salary sits at $65k, which is below even entry developers.

I recently submitted a comprehensive proposal to our General Manager. The proposal was aimed at tackling several issues:

- Our codebase is currently not up to standard, which threatens our compliance with various regulations. 

- Security Risks: Our internal web pages have glaring security issues. It needs to be redone. 

- labor issues: We need another developer to replace the one we have who has been here 30 years and isn’t in great health. We also need 2 more IT techs to free up my time and my managers time as we are swamped and both are doing Helpdesk. 
———-
To back up my claims:
I've had around 20 meetings with key management personnel discussing tech-related challenges and desired changes.

I performed a successful hack on our internally developed code to demonstrate vulnerabilities.————

My Context:
I have only 9 months left to finish my bachelor's degree in software engineering. My employer is not aware of this.

I have a total of 5 years experience in IT Helpdesk and network administration. 

Over those 5 years I’ve done several contracting gigs as a web and iOS developer.

——
The Dilemma

Despite all this, my proposal was mostly denied. We got approval for 2 more helpdesk technicians and I was told I if I fixed the security issues by remaking the site I’d get a raise to 100k but I had to “prove myself as worth a developers salary”. 
But nothing further. 

I've even built a semi-functional site using OAuth 2.0, next.js, etc., as a proof of concept site shown before the proposal. Which I suppose didn’t count. 

I have savings and could easily bring in enough to pay the bills through contracting if I quit. This also would let me focus more on school. My only concern is how it would effect my resume. 

 I'm now at a crossroads and would appreciate advice on whether or not I should stick it out, threaten to resign, take on another ""prove yourself"" task, or look for opportunities elsewhere. 

Any feedback or learning your experience would be great. Thanks Reddit 🙏",Straight-Ad-4332,1,1.0,4,1695306363,2023-09-21 14:26:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16ohawx/facing_a_crossroads_in_my_it_career_stick_with_a/,9,2023

Then I have to explain to some business person that the Data just doesn't work and that I'm trying my hardest to fix it.

I’m thinking about leaving my current job as a mechanic and want to get into something in tech. A couple specific things I thought of were coding or cybersecurity. What are your experiences in these kinds of jobs and what are  some you might recommend?
Where it feels difficult is that I don’t have any degrees or certifications for this kind of work so I would have to get them while working full time.

16ofltn,Urgent advice needed!,"I’m anxious to hear from a hive of people. Please read and advise!

I am a senior level executive assistant by all intents and purposes. My prior positions include eight years as a paralegal, but my passion is executive assistant.

 I worked for three years contract part time 1099 with a company employing high end exec assistants and essentially very high value executives, mostly entrepreneurs. When I started my current position, I kept one of my executives for night and weekend work because I enjoy working for him, and generally just like the work. He is a big investor and all a Prof Sports Player. Call him PSP. 

2.5 yes ago I was approached by a company whose values I appreciate and that pays pretty well while doing that work, and ended up taking the position and have been employed for 2.5 yrs in a marketing type position. I have been successful and an asset to the company. I am passionate about the sector (building materials) and enjoy about half the work, love my manager, dislike our director (his boss and my boss). There are many reasons, but most of it is because I am unable to execute on things the way I liked you because the company is very collaborative. There are quite a bit of of politics. Salary 75k, 401k match, decent health benefits and PTO. Hybrid work.

I recently was approached by PSP  to come on full-time. I’ve still been working for him very part-time, but things are getting extremely busy and he wants me to work full-time. I am passionate about the work for him and received a contract 1099 offer to provide business support as an EA for 90k per year (no benefits, file my own taxes, etc.) this offer essentially is the same pay as the above position when factoring in benefits. Remote work.

I informally accepted and have not signed the contract. I put in my notice with my employer on Monday and they came back to me an hour later with a promotion to 100k + benefits. Huge jump. there would definitely be more responsibilities for a job that I already have quite a few issues with. I just don’t have the autonomy that I need.

I called PSP. I told him about the offer and he said that while he can’t compete with the benefits, he would increase to 100K to be competitive. Despite the fact that this is more like 85K with a Company, I decided to take it because it will allow me to work from home, focus on other small entrepreneurial things that I have going on, etc. I asked for a day to consider and talk with my spouse.

The next day, I was prepared to acccept, and he called and said that he had done some talks with his attorney, and while he didn’t want to take back his offer, he believes he should stick with the contract offer of 90k. He was kind about it for the most part but he’s nervous about it- he’s never employed someone full-time and as wealthy as he is, he’s frugal. I’m confident that given the opportunity, I will prove the value that I can provide.

I sent him a message in a last effort to see if he would stand by the 100 offer and told him if he would I am his. He said 90k is the offer. 

My current employer needs an answer, and so does he, like yesterday.

I want the work from home, 1099, entrepreneurial type option so that I can continue building my own future in a more flexible way. We just became landlords and are looking into other investments. P S.P also provides a unique opportunity to expose me to certain investment opportunities that I would otherwise never be exposed to. But his retraction and vacillation is concerning.

16oegnv,"New manager asks me to be in the office the whole week to support her onboarding, doesn't ask the same from the other 2 team members, and working from the office is seriously impacting my work life balance, no idea how to proceed","The company I work for has always had a very flexible approach when it came working hours. It is normal to start for example at 10:00, at 2pm head home to continue working from there and log off at 6pm. With the prior manager, I had no issues working from home or switching halfway through the day and continuing to work from home. However, when the new manager arrived, she disagreed with a lot of stuff that the previous manager asked me to do, and she is not revisiting my scope and aims at modifying it to probably include less stuff to do. Her request that was brought up to upper management that I be in the office everyday for the unforeseeable future to help her understand the type of operation I'm conducting. 

Yesterday her manager pulled me aside, and told me that top management are not happy with my work and the mistakes I'm committing. He mentioned an example of how he asked me to send an email before he had made a phonecall but I proceeded to send it anyway (maybe I have dementia or difficulty understanding the English language, but I swear he asked me to send the email and later he will make the phone call), and I didn't even retaliate or protest and just said okay, sure I guess. 

He also highlighted how my approach to the new manager is too detailed in debriefing her on the operation, and I should step back a little bit and give her the general picture instead. Sorry for being thorough. 

Last but not least, he removed an entire scope that was explicitly assigned to me by my previous manager which I had worked very hard on and kept everyone (including him and the other manager) posted about, and asked to instead focus on the core operation that I'm in charge of and later focus on other non-important scope. 

I was basically given shit for following instructions and doing my work. What really sent me fuming is that himself and the rest of the other managers are not able to see what I'm doing in an external outsourced app that we are using, and I immediately stopped him and told him that everyone is able to see what I'm doing, and showed him how. I am even able to see what they do, the accesses are granted but they think I'm doing stuff in secret or under the table. 

I have no idea what changed. Prior to the new manager's arrival, everyone was supporting of what I was doing and happy with my progress on the initiatives directed to me from the previous manager, but now I'm given shit left and right and to top it all off, they asked me collectively, unnegotiable, to work from the office effective last week until the new manager is comfortable with what I'm doing. One week later, and I'm barely getting enough sleep, barely focusing on my job, and not having any life whatsoever outside of work because I have to wake up at 7am everyday and I can't sleep early due to my biological clock being screwed on so many levels. 

I'm really not happy with how things are. I'm fine and supportive of helping the new manager, but I'm not doing anything at the office. I'm just sitting next to her, she asks me a random question or two throughout the 8 hours I'm with her, and I'm working for the remaining of the time.

16odlah,Should I still go to the interview?,"So I have an interview for a position working for a recruiting firm that would report directly to the CEO and CFO (Sr Accountant role). The HR person contacted me yesterday (Wednesday) @ 11AM and asked if I could come in to Manhattan (an hour away by train and walking, so not bad) for an in person interview the next afternoon (Thursday). I said sure and she said she would nail down the time with CEO and CFO in the next hour or so. Fast forward and I finally get the invite when I wake up this morning (came in at 1AM).

16ob5z4,Advice needed! I'm not sure how to progress?,"Hi all! I live in the UK (if that helps). I'm at a crossroads with my career and I'm not really sure how to proceed - scratch that - I'm not even sure I have a valid concern here but I'll ask anyway. 

Background: I've progressed from the bottom up in the railway industry and in to a role that offers normal working hours (for the most part) which allows for a normal work/life balance after having worked physical jobs with a lot of nightshifts. I don't have any qualifications outside of the railway apart from a foundation-level qualification I funded and studied in my personal time in Project Management and a small collection of UI/UX Design certificates. My day job is absolutely boring as s*** but it is stable and the day routine itself is extremely valuable to me. I find myself falling asleep at work during meetings just out of sheer boredom (even though I get sufficient sleep) or my mind wanders and I lose track and even find it hard to just sit still at my desk. On top of that, the company I work for is very disorganised and is still in it's infancy so there are no processes or approved ways of doing things and next to no training, support or professional development. They even struggle to pay their own staff correctly. I was aware of all of this when I transitioned in to this role from my previous after having been with the company for nearly three years but at that time getting away from nightshifts was the priority for the sake of my family and mental and physical health but now I feel like I'm going mad at work with boredom, disinterest and low morale and this can only negatively impact me and the work that I do.

Options: I've always been creatively inclined and basing my next steps career-wise off of my natural skills seem's like a sound strategy and pursuing a career as a tattoo artist would be a dream come true but as we all know it can be either notoriously difficult to actually become one or a very unstable career (from what I've heard) and I'm not sure I can deal with the financial uncertainty that may bring. 

I tried to think of a role that is still creative but perhaps more stable and identified UI/UX Design a couple of years ago. I have studied in my own personal time and gained independant certificates but have had absolutely zero luck with it after having worked on my portfolio a lot and applying to lots of vacancies. I'm losing confidence on this idea as a result and I understand that the problem most likely lies with me and not the recruiters at all but even then, I'm unsure how to proceed.

I then also wanted to further future-proof myself by gaining a qualification in Project Management which I rationalised because it could assist with UI/UX Design due to the project nature of the roles advertised but it could also potentially help with my current role if the opportunity to progress developed or I figured it might allow me to break away completely from my current role but even that is proving difficult due to a lack of hands-on experience. 

TL:DR I guess the toss-up is - Do I stay in my current role and go insane from boredom but have a relatively stable job or do I pursue my passion for art and tattoos in my personal time and work on my portfolio if/until I can serve an apprenticeship part-time and then grow in to a full-time role or do I pursue Project Management and/or UI/UX Design which appears to be oversaturated at the moment?

16oad8n,Two Degrees and Barely Any Career/ Pay Progression. Worried about the future.,"Hi All, 
I’m writing this post as I’m in a strange position in life. I completed both a BSc in Psychology and a MSc in clinical psychology. I’ve also worked in mental health for around 4 years. I’m currently working as an Assistant Psychologist within a very slow moving NHS trust. 

However, I’m becoming quickly disillusioned with the path into clinical psychology and more so by the pay once you’re in that position. At current, If any people in the field could give any advice or a realistic look into career / pay progression that would be amazing. 

Though, I’m posting here for ideas of possible alternative careers. Ideally I want to be paid more than my current band 4 position so aiming for somewhere between 25k -30k (If possible with noticeable career progression). I have no idea where to look regarding careers as there is very little out there about changing career from mental health. There is a lot on entering mental health though frustratingly.

So if you have any suggestions for a possible career change where I can use my degree/ knowledge that would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks for reading!

16o5ik1,What type of engineering (or anything else)?,"I'm a young woman and currently studying to become an engineer (or if you have any other suggestion on other types of careers it would be amazing too!) but struggling to decide which type.

I love being active when I'm working, working with my hands to create things or examine things, building/creating and even designing things. I'm not really fond of customer service. I'd say I'm academically I'm above average and I'm very interested in science. Ofcourse, I'm thinking about a relatively high pay would be perfect, and maybe a flexible career would be nice (I love travelling and I wouldn't mind it if my job required me to). I'd like a job that makes me use my brain, maybe doesn't stuck a lot to a routine (?). I'm also a fairly artistic person since I love to draw, sew, paint, knit, again just in general work with my hands to create something, maybe even design things. If I could, I'd like to work individual work instead of group projects. If its a possibility maybe even remote jobs?  

I'm thinking currently of studying machine engineering and then getting a masters in civil ingeneering (in building?)

16o55es,"Any thoughts about what I should do next? (Molecular biologist, maybe considering switching fields)","I've kind of ruined things at my current job (which pays pretty badly anyway) and I'm trying to figure out what I should do next. I want to figure out something that will eventually lead to a living wage and hopefully home ownership, although I know that's a pretty hard ask. I'm not really sure if I should stay in biology, since it's a field where you just don't make any fucking money EVER, and while I was ok with that before the cost of living went insane it is no longer enough to ever afford your own place, so not viable as a career.

Qualifications:

I have a masters in Biology.  My education was in evolutionary biology, phylogenetics, and also Mycology. My thesis was on the evolution of Fungi. I have two first author pubs and about six contributing author pubs. Since all my post-graduate experience is in PCR (mostly qPCR), I regard myself as a molecular biologist.

I have eight years experience working in agriculture developing and implementing PCR assays for disease detection in various agriculture situations. It was fun, but it doesn't pay enough to live in this area anymore, and I kind of ruined things with my main employer by complaining about the pay excessively. I've got maybe 2-3 months left. I wanted to leave anyway.

There are no other employers in my city so I've accepted that I will have to move to find another job.

Other abilities: I'm reasonably good at chemistry, physics, and math, although not to the level of a person in those fields. I'm a fairly strong computer user, including being able to fix them to some extent and work on networks. I can't program at this time, but have been able to in the past. I'm also a decent technical writer and can illustrate to some extent as well. I have some experience in wildlife and fisheries.

I'm married and my wife makes about $50k as a video game graphics designer/illustrator. She may or may not be able to keep this job if we move; we're not sure. The company doesn't like remote work but did enable it in the past and they might be too desperate to kick her out for moving away.

Ideas:

So, I could go back for a doctorate. My original plan was to switch into Bioinformatics, but bioinformatics is kind of getting slammed. I am afraid of my long term job prospects if I were to get a doctorate in evolutionary bio or mycology, and I'm not super optimistic about them as a molecular biologist, either.

I could try to go into biotech. The problem is that biotech is a flaming dumpster fire right now, and the job market is a smouldering ruin. I don't know if there's any chance of me getting a job there, and if there is, it may not pay enough to live where the job is. I've already rejected two jobs in Seattle that paid $75k and $85k, respectively. Most of the biotech hubs are either HCOL or worse and the jobs often don't pay enough to live in the cities they are in.

I don't have the charisma for sales, and I kind of detest business and don't really want to work in it. I'm also not unethical or slimy enough to succeed. I used to want to start a business as I thought it would be the only way to ever not be poor, but I just never had any kind of brilliant idea for a service or product to build it around.

I could try to do something else. I'm just not sure what, though. I'm ok with computers but I'm not a developer or anything. I guess I could also go back for a different undergraduate degree; probably the best idea there would be ChemE as I'm a very solid chemist, having done so much molecular bio over the years.",Mitrovarr,3,1.0,4,1695266656,2023-09-21 03:24:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16o55es/any_thoughts_about_what_i_should_do_next/,9,2023

16o4w8q,"Leaving job on bad terms, supervisor declined to be a reference on my resume. Will this have a significant impact on future jobs?","I gave my notice of resignation at my current job after things had been bad for a while. I was miserable, and was subsequently performing poorly for the past few months. I'm in management and report to the Executive Director. Because of the deterioration of my performance, she justifiably declined being a reference for me beyond confirming my employment. I took this job as a stepping stone in my career, and she's a big player in the industry - leaving this job without her as a reference is a pretty big blow. It's completely my own fault, but still sucks.

I'm intending to use one of my direct reports as my work reference, as her and I get along very well and had a great working relationship. Is this OK? Should I instead ask another manager to be my reference, or is having a direct report as a reference OK? Is there any specific way I should indicate this situation on my resume, or leave it vague and just carry on as I would otherwise? Are there certain ways in which somebody who isn't your supervisor should act as your reference/specific things they should say or not say?

I've never been in this situation and have always left my jobs on great terms with my supervisors, so I feel a bit lost. I appreciate any tips, suggestions, or feedback.

16o4c1p,What would you do?,"I am currently an executive at a nonprofit in my area. In my role I am basically in the ‘sales’ of nonprofits (Development) and have to hit annual revenue goals and host events. My current role has a terrific title (VP) and is a council of a very well known reputable nonprofit. Unfortunately I am young and have faced a bit of adversity with this in leadership roles I have taken, and after being hired the CEO has been a bit untrusting of me and takes a hands off approach to basically everything except for me hiring for my team. It takes a week sometimes for her to get back to me on normal questions but when I want to hire for my team, she has denied my ask to hire 3 times already, leaving me to do the work of a 23 person team as a team of one and uses my age as a factor as no other leadership members have to ask for permission to hire. Due to the frustration and her inflating numbers for my goals (over doubling the actual YoY numbers even when I said with the past 3 year data it did not make sense and made me uncomfortable) I began applying to other roles. 
I came upon a consulting position for a firm that assist nonprofits. I throughly enjoy process and procedure management and consulting has been a dream of mine to pivot towards to get away from a sales heavy role. This new role would also be 100% WFH (compared to my current role which is about 95% WFH and I must stay in my state lo).
Though the title and company isn’t as fancy or reputable, the role itself aligns more with what I would like to do next.
Unfortunately I have only been at my new job for 5 months.. which may look bad when leaving, but again I have felt a bit belittled by how I am being treated compared to my peers, and have been doing 2 jobs since 1 month in, and have been told no to my top candidates for over 2.5 months now! Would you take the new role (pay is 5k more as well) or stay in a job that has a higher title, better reputation, and stick it out for a year or so even if the boss is someone you don’t quite enjoy or trust.

16o3y4p,How can I deal with my overbearing boss?,"Overall my boss is pretty decent but they have become hypercritical and anal about the Instagram page I started for our small business. None of us knew about social media so I offered to learn and start our social media accounts. Once the account started doing well my boss kept offering unhelpful and critical feedback. Their complaints don’t help me at all and have been minor details while I was still learning the ropes. They also don’t contribute. All their suggestions suck and I don’t even like working on the account when they are here because it’s just a lot of drama. I just want to work in peace and get us more exposure.

They only made one post and lost us followers. I had retained all followers before that post. They followed accounts I urged them not too (we weren’t ready) and they nitpick over everything. The other day I had to explain several times why we should use copyright free music as a business to avoid getting posts removed. It was like talking to a child. 

I gave them a project for a series of stories (since their posts are gonna be ugly comic sans) and they seemed happy at first but shortly after became overbearing again. I even tried to have them take over another social media account that I haven’t started yet to get them to leave me alone on Instagram. They admitted they lacked the patience to learn how to create the other account. Now they are trying to share future posts that I’ve created. I don’t trust them to not mess up my work regarding this. Also not sure why they are offering to do it when I say that I’m finishing it. What can I do to get them to leave me alone about Instagram? Also how can I remove their post so that nobody sees it? Should I suggest to archive it since it’s for a limited edition product we no longer have and the future posts will be stories. It looks so terrible and I’m ashamed to be associated with it. I want to be honest with them about it but am not sure how. At the same time they are being so difficult that maybe honesty would help.

16o37w1,Where do I go from here?,"Background:

24m in KY, USA, parent of 2 kids (5 years and a 4 month old) 5yr started school this year.

&#x200B;

Currently I'm out of my workplace for an unknown amount of time because of an injury sustained at work. I'm being paid weekly for workers comp. I will not know for sure how long I'll be out for until the doctors find out if I need a reconstructive surgery in my knee, as it sits there is to much fluid around the joint to have a definitive answer. I make 55K a year as a supervisor and I'm looking for a career change. My personality type according to the myers briggs test is INTP-T, I'm not sure what to do with that information but the FAQ said to include it. 

I also was (am?) running a side business, currently I am receiving nothing from it as it was a very physical job and required me to be able to travel to a work shop and other peoples homes. When I was able to I was making between $400 and $1000 a week, the pay was inconsistent because it was based on making service calls and or selling units. 

I haven't saved money, I spend it as fast as I get it. I'm working on that and doing better now but I haven't built up a savings yet.

I was 2/3 of the way through an associate degree in computer engineering when I took a break, mainly for purposes of trying to make more money at work. I'm not a great student and never have been, I'm intelligent but when it comes to school I couldn't make myself focus on just school. I may be able to do so now but I've dug a hole for myself because I lost eligibility for financial aid. I can't really afford to go back to school full time and I don't know if I will have enough time to slowly work my way through it before I have to go back to school. I'm not great at focusing on multiple large things at once, when working I filled my day with my job and by night I filled my free time with being a parent. I know the only way to succeed with school is to make time for it, it's just difficult and I feel like I don't have the support to do what it takes. 

&#x200B;

All that being said, I am trying to figure out where to go with my life. I know I cannot afford to take less pay, I am the only income in my house of 4. My wife is a SAHM, now that I am injured she cannot go back to work until I can function well on my own.

&#x200B;

What has worked well for you?,"I'm a few months into a new job, I scheduled a skip level with his boss, but I'm so nervous. My main issues are that my boss doesn't communicate important information to me and he doesn't read or check his email. I've run into issues where I made slight errors but it ends up snowballing because my boss doesn't feel its his responsibility to correct me, or others. I also feel like when I communicate to my boss, he isn't taking me seriously, so the right information doesn't communicated out to leadership. 

**What I'm thinking of addressing during the skip-level -** 

* Getting a sense of where he says my role falls into the organization, and what he expects from my level
* **I really want to express to him that I'm concerned that I'm not being listened to by my boss, and I can't count on him to step in and correct me.** Not worded like that though. I'm still only a few months in at this job...
* History on past monthly company goals and metrics, I've tried to get this insight from my boss, but he (1) can't/won't tell me (2) I don't think my boss understands that this piece is essentially for my job.

I then learn for the first time there's a drug test. And I read in the company handbook that failing it would be me losing the offer.

I consume edibles and use smoke pens and am scheduled for Monday.

My options are:
1-  Get clean and workout and all the jazz to try to pass the test by Monday
2- tell my hiring manager whom I have a very good mentor/friend connection that I didn't know there's a drug test and there would likely be weed in my system

I'm favoring #2 cuz it'll be harder to explain after/if I fail the test. I also am thinking it might be company policy and focusing on other drugs or heavy usage of other drugs?

I have combined 3 years of retail and customer service management where I reached the position of store manager. I over saw 15+ team members and only reported to my district manager 1 time a week so I was very self driven in this position. I also worked with b2b clients for 2 of those years doing cold calls and growing our customer base.

I also have 4 years of warehouse experience where my current position is a supervisor over a team of 25 people. This position is much less self reliant and I have to work very closely with other managers as well as my own. Certified on all power equipment used in most warehouses.

In both of these positions I've achieved a lot and can show my results in interviews. I also have very good people skills and great with computers. (I'm learning programming but don't have the time to dedicate to it to learn enough for a job, most just hobby)

I'm looking for other industries I can realistically move into with the experience I have that would either match my pay (80k including bonuses) starting.",SeaworthinessSure198,1,1.0,0,1695254291,2023-09-20 23:58:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16o0pgb/tired_of_horrible_schedules_in_retail_and/,9,2023

Most of my work experience is sales and retail. I worked at Sephora inside JCPenny for about 6 years and worked as a college assistant in the financial aid department for two years. It's been really frustrating that even internships are requiring experience of some sort. I have experience in projects that I have done in school in regards to marketing. I am currently working at Enterprise Rent-a-Car because that's what my career center at my college recommended and I hate it. I don't see a future at this job, and the long hours are already burning me out.

I am doing a digital marketing apprenticeship at a non-profit after work. I am just having difficulty finding internships and entry level work. I get passed up on interviews and job offers because of my lack of experience and it has been frustrating in this job market. I need any tips and advice on which job boards to look into. I have been working on my resume in both my apprenticeship and career center at my school. I am willing to take a pay cut in my current job to something that is within marketing. I am also interested in getting into data analytics and would like some advice on any courses where I can learn SQL, Python, and Tableau and potentially get certified.

16nytjl,What can I do? I’m worried about my future…,"Background:

I’m 24f. Brooklyn NYC 

I had grad with a degree in SLP 2 years ago. Have 30k debt from it. I’ve decided I dint want to get my masters in SLP anymore as I’m not motivated to do so. 

Within 2 years I had worked odd jobs here and there nothing consistent all way through.

Currently right now unemployed. And have been applying to caregiver like jobs. (DSP/Rehab assist/resident assist) and receptionist /admin in office somewhere. 

I was also considering working as security guard, pharm tech like get a certificate in something and work that job for a couple years until I decide probably go back to school.

Concern: 
I thought at the age of 24 I would have been done with school. Got school done and over with at a young age so I don’t have to worry about it anymore as I don’t like school that much to continue on with it. 

I thought about other master program like social work/counseling/teacher masters. Even nursing loll. But I’m not sure about those either.

I feel like I’m the type person that won’t work a “normal” 9-5 and a creative person. And just got rouge and do my own thing if that make sense. Are just be rich and don’t have to work a normal job ever again. As I feel the normal jobs are controlling and the matrix (ex healthcare, office/business jobs/ IT) 

I have dream I do want to pursue. Like modeling, acting, artist (painter), tik tok/YouTube star, and businesses women (beauty/fashion). But realistically I would need a stable and secure job and pursue these stuff on the side

16ny9e2,"New job, another startup, unsure about direction","Hi all-

A little background: I’m 31, have been working at startups for the last 6 years and have worked for Uber and a major healthcare startup as well, along with a smaller logistics startup. I’m comfortable in customer facing roles and have been a lead on two support teams and have worked in account management as well.

My last company and I separated mutually - I helped them launch and after two years, leadership was toxic, the company did not have HR except for a singular consultant who was never willing to even hear our side (I know I know, HR isn’t your friend). Anyway, I left in December, took a three month severance, and figured it would be easy to find another job. Obviously not. 

It’s now September and I’m supposed to start with another healthcare startup next week. I’ve been out of work for 9 months, and my partner for almost a year. When I found this role for a support lead, I snagged it up and as I continued through the interview process, it seemed like they actually needed a support manager. They are just about to launch and don’t have any sort of plan for what support will look like, documentation, etc. that was going to be my job for decent money and full time hours. Well after I verbally accepted, a few days later, the woman who is going to be my manager came back and said “so our ceo cut this to 8-10 hours a week”. I told them no, so they said the most they could do was 18-20 “out of necessity”. My full time offer and my what are likely shitty and expensive benefits (but still very much needed - don’t have insurance at the moment but have a serious need for it) were off the table. I asked when it would be full time, she said maybe by the end of the year. Because I haven’t received a single offer from anywhere else, I accepted it. 

The woman I’ll be working under has told me and all of my references that I’m “what they’ve been searching high and low for” and “their unicorn”. How can I get them to put me on full time asap? I’m thinking they’ll realize it as quickly as “oh shit we actually do need a support team built out”, but I also don’t want to put all my chips on the table at once.",another-throwaway777,1,1.0,1,1695247996,2023-09-20 22:13:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16ny9e2/new_job_another_startup_unsure_about_direction/,9,2023
16ny2jn,Bad onboarding or just me?,"Got hired for this new job at a very big corporate company I was really excited to start working here but I am now three days in and I'm starting to think this was a mistake.
While the interview was done in the fancy part of the building when I actually started here I was thrown in an outdated office with every drape closed for the entirety of the day (I hate this so much!!!), I can't look outside and the majority of my college's are like robots on the clock.

I have been bombarded with a huge outdated onboarding list that is full of spelling errors, broken links and wrong information,
Onboarding is written in a different language and nobody was apointed to help or guide me and the manager is either in a different facility, meeting or a phone call.

I have already completed over 50 mandatory onboarding tests, some that took over 1-2 hours just to read and the majority were badly written English walls of text (not my native language) about software functions for software I don't know the usage for.
Keeping in mind that I need to complete these tests FIRST to gain acces to said software.

I can't even figure out what I am supposed to be doing here, and the only thing the manager told me was that I should make notes and bookmark the important stuff...

He was also absent for the entire day...so I ended up keeping myself busy with test number 51,52 and 53 the lather being an 8 hour text book about some software I don't even have access to.

This is also the point I stopped caring and closed the test window so I could just stare at my screen for the remainder of the day while listening to a kitboga skit..
Already thinking about throwing the towel in hence the job I left was a 7 year adventure with ups and downs but I'm feeling that this ain't it!

16ny1nw,Is it worth staying for a not guaranteed promotion?,"Today marks one year into my corporate job and I think it may be time to quit. 

Most of my team doesn’t like me, especially my shift lead. My boss doesn’t like me either and most of the team has worked for them prior to this job so they mostly know each other.  People are generally very disrespectful to me and it has gotten worse ever since I came back from leave. Before the leave, people were taking away responsibilities from me, talking down to me, and trying to make me seem incompetent. I was receiving a lot of pushback about things I turned out to be correct abt. I don’t think any of them realized that I have a degree, in our field (most ppl on my team don’t have one period), from one of the most rigorous  universities in the country because most of them honestly don’t talk to me and assume I am stupid. When I asked about doing work for the sister team (I have years of research experience doing their processes), my boss told me it would be “too much” for me to understand…but they selected some of my team for the training.  

The lead that really doesn’t like me + another coworker lied to my boss about an incident and a work mistake which placed me on leave for months. During the leave, one of my loved ones had a heart attack due to stress, partially from potentially losing my job. A deep investigation was made and after that I was called back to work and given some more advanced work and training with other departments that nobody on my team has. The company further looked into my credentials and realized what was going down. Team has less errors and more productivity ever since I’ve been allowed to do my job. However, things are awkward. 

That same lead brought in bagels for the team today and created a separate chat so I wouldn’t know abt said bagels and nobody told me about them 😭😂 Lead keeps tagging me in chats our boss sees to do my tasks and tries to make it seem as if I’m not completing them/taking too long when they’re usually done before they try to “embarrass” me by pinging me. They undermine my work and keep saying there are gaps/asking for info that everyone else seems to have seen. They keep making things awkward for me and people on my shift have been treating me weirdly too. I’ve applied to some better positions in the company and they want to interview me despite a hard company policy of 2 years in the same position 😳 I just don’t think HR will approve it and i’ll have to deal with this awkwardness for 6-12 more months",Best_Bat_0,1,1.0,0,1695247484,2023-09-20 22:04:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16ny1nw/is_it_worth_staying_for_a_not_guaranteed_promotion/,9,2023

Today I happened to come across compensation information about my colleague at work to see that he is receiving $20K a year more than me.

To give some background, he and I were both interns at the company last year and have returned full time after graduating college. This is our first career job.

When I received my offer, I accepted it at face value thinking that I didn’t have leverage for negotiations as a recent grad. Additionally, our company had seen better days, with budget for our offers having been confirmed merely weeks before we received them.

Given the fact that we are in the same roles, I can’t help but be surprised and disappointed.

16nvphy,"Nervous About EPAM's ""Final Decision""","Hey, I recently applied for a front-end developer role at EPAM Systems. I'm in Saudi Arabia, and this is EPAM System's first year in Saudi and we are considered the first candidates to go through the hiring process.

I managed to passed 3 phases in the hiring process, the first was an online quiz, the second was the HR interview, and the third was the technical interview.

Earlier today my assigned recruiter at EPAM Systems contacted me and told me that I have successfully passed the techincal interview, and provided me insight on the location and that expenses are covered by their side. But she said ""final decision by the hiring managers"", so what decision would they make if I already passed 3 rounds?

This is how the conversation went:

_______________________________________________________________________________

- Recruiter:

Hello Saud! My name is Maria, I'm a technical sourcer at EPAM Systems. Previously, another recruiter from our company contacted you, he is now on vacation, so I contacted you.

You have passed the technical interview and now we are waiting for the final decision from the hiring managers.

I have an important question for you: it is already known for sure that we will have an office in Dammam. Are you ready to move?

Expenses related to tickets and accommodation for the first month are covered by EPAM

- Me:

Thank you so much Ms. Maria 🙏

And yes, I'm ready to move to Dammam!

- Recruiter:

Got it! Then we are waiting for the final decision and will contact you immediately. Don't worry, we remember everyone:)

_______________________________________________________________________________

I'm starting to feel extremely anxious since that I might get rejected in the final decision because I'm still studying in university and haven't graduated yet, and that they might reconsider my hiring process because of my degree.

Although in all interview rounds they asked me about my degree and I told them that I haven't graduated yet, I'm expected to graduate in early 2025.

Also, my university is designed for employees, classes are in the evening (after 5 PM).

Not to mention that I've been working full time in the past 2 years while still studying in university.

So, I'm here to ask the experienced people of you what is the likelihood of me receiving a job offer depending on my current situation?",Outside-Feeling973,1,1.0,0,1695242026,2023-09-20 20:33:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16nvphy/nervous_about_epams_final_decision/,9,2023

16nuz1k,Can someone with a better brain than me tell me which career direction is the most logical?,"I have a solid two items on my bucket list and one is to become C2 in a foreign language. I've spent half my life casually working towards this but now I'm ready to actually make it happen. I'm currently considering a few paths and all of which involve me going abroad for a period of time, but I want to prevent career regression if possible. I also know that I'll eventually come home and I want to be able to use the language on a daily basis at work, so my efforts aren't wasted. 

I have been working in HR for a handful of years and I hate my current job. The responsibilities of the role itself are fine, but leadership here is awful. I'm content with working in HR and I find many aspects of HR to be interesting.

Now for the twist. I recently submitted a translation test for a freelance gig and I had a blast getting creative with my answers. I can't remember the last time doing something work related made me happy (slight exaggeration). This made me start thinking about if I could make a career out of translation.


So the the options that I've thought of are:

A) Masters in HR abroad. I can't say if this will increase my job prospects back in the States, as it is a degree from a foreign country. But I'd like to think that if I can add work experience to my resume while abroad (ex: part time job in HR) and I return home immediately after graduating, I'd still be able to enter a senior level position and make 20k+/year more. 

B) Masters In translation abroad. I would most likely spend 1 year before this studying abroad and working some sort of PT remote job. I'd be starting from the bottom on this path, but there are some potential paths that would me to combine my HR exp with translation. Conversely, I could just be content with lower pay and a more flexible lifestyle (freelance + pt education work[?]). Translation looks really appealing as it revolves around a big passion of mine, but I just keep thinking about how everyone says to not try to make a career out of a hobby. 

C) Directly enter into the workforce of abroad. This is debatably the most challenging path, as I would need to not only find an HR job that would hire an American living in the States, but also one that would hire an American living in the States who needs visa sponsorship. It's quite possible that I would only receive an offer for a non-HR related role, but I'd be able to immerse.",lovelln,6,1.0,1,1695240260,2023-09-20 20:04:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16nuz1k/can_someone_with_a_better_brain_than_me_tell_me/,9,2023

16ntxap,Weird message or professional interaction?,"I'm going to this expo next week with over 1,000 people + across the company. It's a 4 day event that goes from Tuesday to Saturday. People are traveling from coast to coast essentially. 


Part of this is downloading this connections app. It already has your name and title loaded in and you can add some other stuff like a profile photo and basically you use it to sign up for learning shows, food and message others in the company if need be. 


Almost a minute after I added my profile photo I received a message from a franchise owner who is several states away (of course will be flying in for the expo) and it read :


Hi, I'd like to see you on Tuesday evening if possible or Wednesday anytime. Thanks (name) (personal phone number). 


I and my director took this as a creep message and had sent it up the chain but I can't help thinking maybe I over reacted? Maybe he just wanted to meet me for some reason?

16nt3c0,"First IT job not great, MSP is hiring","I previously posted about being nervous for a job I just started.

After a solid 2 weeks, I feel pretty hopeless. I began this job thinking that I would be working on a low code application and providing level 1 support to users in the office. A little background:

This company had 1 single person managing the IT needs for the company for around 20 years. This person's last day was my first day. In addition to my in office support, he hired a local MSP to assist with higher level tickets. When he left, I was not set up at all and had to wait for the MSP's technicians to create my user and get me set up. Yes, major red flags but unfortunately, I have been in need of a job so I decided to just roll with it. 

Jump to now, I cannot for the life of me figure out what the higher ups (I am supposed to report to the VP) want me to do. I have tried to sit down with them multiple times and explain that I don't know what overall project they want me contributing/ working towards and every time I am just given an easy 20 - 30 minute task. This week, I was instructed to go to another location for the company to assist with updating the current inventory system. When I got there, I was given a clip board and high vis vest to go and find products in the warehouse. Literally checking inventory. 

I understand in IT/Cyber/Tech the phrase ""that's not my job"" is generally looked down on, but that's literally not my job. Last night, I saw a job post on Indeed for a help desk role at the MSP the company has recently began to work with. I have met both the owner and multiple of the technicians due to not being able to support users/ not having access but being the company's ""IT"" person. I'm tempted to outright just try to contact them and ask about the position, but I'm worried about the possible consequences. Like I mentioned before, I need a job right now, but I also don't want to essentially be a warehouse assistant.

TLDR: Bad IT job with no direction, MSP used for higher level support is hiring.",makostyx,2,1.0,1,1695235611,2023-09-20 18:46:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16nt3c0/first_it_job_not_great_msp_is_hiring/,9,2023

16nsoie,Stuck as a payment analyst-- where can I go from here?,"So for the past 3 (going on 4) years now, I've been stuck in a payment analyst role with a major bank chain here in Canada. I say stuck because it's been a fairly stagnant, unexciting job where I just punch in numbers all day. To make things worse, my team has recently been split in half, and a huge chunk of my regular duties have gone off to a different team. It's gotten to the point where I feel under worked and inessential.

Here are the options I'm considering:
1. Use the learning programs available to my company to brush up on my programming/code writing skills, and from there apply more heavily to the web development or security side of things. The problem there is that I have NEVER been good at coding, and find it all but impossible to grasp no matter how many times I try for it.
2. Try to go for something HR related. The only issue there is that, on the one hand, I really enjoy delivering presentations, devising learning materials and delivering training. I do not like the prospect, though, of having to deal with the bureaucratic side of things.
3. Find something else. I'll be honest, I'm not in love with banking, even though my benefits are great. The problem is, I'm in my late 30s, and at this point I no longer know what that ""something else"" is, as I feel like I've burned out all other prospects.

I feel like I've been out of options for years now. I want to make a change but I feel stuck. Anh advice or observations would be helpful.

For context: I have a masters in library and information sciences, a degree in human resources, and little to no experience in either field due to a lack of success in all previous job hunts.",GiveTheLemonsBack,1,1.0,0,1695234611,2023-09-20 18:30:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16nsoie/stuck_as_a_payment_analyst_where_can_i_go_from/,9,2023
16nseah,Is my planned career move worth it? (Construction Management),"I am about 3 months out of college with a bachelors degree and currently work at a very large construction company in the Midwest. I am doing estimating, which is pretty niche role in the construction world but basically it is a desk job and we analyze construction plans and put together a price for how much it will cost to do the work. Super simplified explanation but I'm trying to keep this brief. I do not like it. At all. It is insanely boring and monotonous. I have been looking at switching for while. I have been here for 8 months, half of which were as an intern and half have been full time. 

I've applied at a variety of different construction companies for project management positions. I think project management is much more inline with me and the type of work I would like to be doing. I've received an offer from a much, much smaller company than the one I work at now. For comparison, the company I'm with now works in 7 different states and the new company works basically in and around my local city/metropolitan area and that's it. 

I'm now second guessing myself about my choice. The new role definitely seems to be more in line with my career goals, but I'm also afraid that there will be much less advancement opportunity at the new company. I want to be sure I am making the right choice here. Details of the jobs below:

&#x200B;

* Current Job :  Estimator - Very Large Company
   * Salary: $62,400 with one bonus a year. (I have no idea how much, but I don't think its anything spectacular)
   * No vehicle or gas card/stipend
   * 45 mile commute 1 way, 90 miles roundtrip a day on my own vehicle
   * Adequate health insurance (I say adequate because while it is decent and it's better than nothing, it is not that great either)
   * Work hours of 8-5, with an occasional 14+ hour day the night before a big bid is due
   * 10 days PTO, accruing an extra day a year

&#x200B;

* New Job : Project Manager - Much smaller, local company
   * Salary: $72,000, two bonuses, a performance bonus and profit sharing. 
   * Company provided truck that I can take home, plus gas card, saving me wear on tear on my personal truck
   * 42 mile commute, 84 miles roundtrip, so basically the same as now but in their vehicle. 
   * Health insurance is pretty similar, same coverage, slightly higher cost. (Very slightly, negligible difference really)
   * Work hours of 6:30 to 4, varying based on workload but should be close to this. 
   * 10 days of PTO, accruing a day a year, but was told they are flexible with this, if you need a day off and you're out, they will give it to you. (So I'm told, who knows how it actually is)

&#x200B;

I guess I'm just looking for other opinions about my situation, and want to see if I'm rushing into a new career too soon, or if this would be a worthwhile decision. I definitely think the new job would be much more interesting and a better fit for me, with some additional stress I'm sure. The money/benefits increase is pretty nice too. While it isn't a massive jump in salary, the company vehicle is a big perk too as it will save me 450 miles a week on my personal truck, and all the gas the accompanies that. Any advice is welcome.

16ns3rz,Stuck due to Visa rules,"Kind of a long post, but would really appreciate some good advice (even better if it’s someone working in tech)

I work in tech, and I’m on immigrant work visa. It expires in 2yrs so they just started filing for my green card - and the 1st stage takes 1.5yrs to complete (after which I’d have unlimited renewals plus I can move to any new company).

Problem is, I feel stuck in my current workplace with no room for technical growth or promotion. I need to wait atleast 1.5 years to switch to a new job.

Of course my first thought is that I can start on a new skillset (my preference is data structs and algorithms for the big tech/faang, or Machine Learning). I have enough time in 1.5 years to gain expertise.

But when I DO start applying for a new job, how do I make up for a lack of real world with experience with those technologies? Will multiple pet projects be considered acceptable?

16nrune,Advice for Career Advancement?,"Almost 5 months ago I stepped out of my position as an operations manager, which I held for a little over a year, and into the role as human resource coordinator for our local branch office. This change was due to a lackluster salary vs. an intense work load. In my previous role, I was consistently successful and highly praised but this also came at the cost of being extremely burnt out. 

Being the type that always strives for success though, at the very beginning of my career as HRC, I reached out to the Regional HRR and HRM asking about what success in my role looks like and what steps I would need to take for growth within HR for our company.

I only received a response from our HRR which was, boiled down, essentially just, ""do your job.""

I reached out again inquiring about additional training opportunities, possible mentorships, or just general advice for growth within the company and was met with radio silence.

I enjoy this field and would like to stay within it long term but have no formal education pertaining to something even remotely related to human resources and at $17/hour, my means are limited.

I strive for success and growth. I want to climb the ladder. I want to work hard and see the results, but I feel stuck. 

Our former HRC jumped ship after 5 years for another company paying substantially more with many opportunities for career advancement. But I have limited experience and I can't sustain myself long term with what I'm currently making.

16npfup,Should I take a higher paying job for crappier medical benefits? (US),"Thanks for taking the time to read this.  Here's my situation.  
I'm a Systems admin by learning/experience.  I started in support and worked my way up.  As with most people, I thought the company was going to be loyal, but turns out they weren't going to pay me for my experience/what I bring to the table.  I left that job a year ago to be with another company in more of  a support role.  This new company was new software and negated my systems admin skills, and has continually pushed my boundaries for work/life balance because everyone here has that ""grind"" mentality.  I'm very good at telling these people no when asked to stay late/work over my time.  Honestly, it's shift work...it's support...nothing is on fire that support handles that you need to make people work 12-hour days.  

&#x200B;

ANYWAY, I digress.  During this year that I've been with the new company (we'll call them job 1), another consulting firm (this will be job 2) reached out to me and I began working part-time using my system admin skills and vast knowledge to help them out.  They allow me to work my own hours, off time from job 1 (My kids do sports things, so I can work while watching them).  Job 2 is great, and I would drop job 1 for job 2 in a heart beat if it weren't for the lacking healthcare benefits.  

&#x200B;

Job 2 recently offered me a heft raise to help them further (with different pieces of software, about a 30k raise over Job 1) but again I'm afraid the benefits will make this a moot point.  My kids don't go to the doctor often (outside normal checkups and such), but the amount of money we'd be spending is a bit crazy per month for not great coverage.  I'm debating on the healthcare marketplace, but open enrollment isn't until November, and it won't let me look at the marketplace.  I also fear I make too much for it to make much of a difference.    


In the end, Job 1 is...fine...but really gets to me as an employee that I am not doing what others are doing because I know better than to work for free and most of the other employees are in different life situations, so they don't have the same responsibilities.  Job 1 doesn't seem to care about that and continues to push me to work over my shift.  I appreciate you getting this far and any insights you could possibly give.  Thanks!

16np5fg,How old were you when you started your 'career'?,"Hi all,

I'm a 26M from UK. First half of my twenties I spent aimlessly. I graduated with an undergraduate in law (without much reasoning behind the decision to do law) then got a random job that I found in indeed at a local small energy efficiency company working in compliance and administrative roles. 

I was making decent money, lived on my own and on paper was doing well. However, The role was fairly unskilled and incredibly mundane. I decided I wanted a career rather than a job. 

Like many my interests turned to coding. I self taught myself for about 8 months and enjoyed it and decided to take a leap of faith to quit my job and go back to University to study a masters degree in computing to then pursue a career as a software engineer. 

Although I know 26 is young and comparison is the thief of joy, I can't help but do it anyway. I have friends who are younger than me earning over 6 figures in fancy corporate finance and legal jobs, living in lovely London apartments and I have friends the same age or older who are working part time jobs in supermarkets living with their parents.

My question is, how old were you when you started what would end up being your career rather than unconnected random jobs? (what was it and what were you doing before?)

Hello,  
  
My wife has had a long career working in hospital settings, primarily in the OR/surgery department. She has become quite tired of her current role and feels like she's hit a career ceiling. Dealing with rude and arrogant surgeons on a daily basis has really taken a toll on her. She does have some sales experience, having worked as a flooring sales specialist in a high-end showroom and in retail sales.  
  
A few days ago, she was venting about how much she despises her job and the 10-hour days spent dealing with surgeons. I suggested to her the idea of pursuing a Medical Sales Representative position, thinking it might be a better fit given her previous sales experience and the knowledge she has gained about surgical equipment and tools over the years. She liked the idea and is currently considering it, but I wanted to gather more information.  
  
I'm curious about the compensation and the work environment. Are there different sub-sections of medical sales, and if so, what are they? Overall, is it a good long-term career, and how is the potential for growth in the field? Additionally, do you typically have to find leads yourself, do leads come to you, or is it more of a door-to-door type of job?

16nnra7,Which job is better for the long run,"Currently in an accounts payable role as a temp making $20/h. I have a criminal justice degree so this kinda work is not what I was expecting to be doing but it’s where I’m at. I have 3 more months to go until I can become permanent and start making around $25/hr. I don’t feel like there is a high ceiling here but I can perhaps one day get a higher paying AP role or learn more at another company one day. 

I’m also interviewing for a civilian job with the police today which starts you off at 39k and you’re stuck there for two years until you take a test just to make 45k. With benefits and probably a much higher ceiling within the department, I’m stuck choosing between the two jobs.

39k is unlivable and I can’t imagine sticking with it for two years but the benefits, the job security and potential higher ceiling can make it worth it.

16nmar4,Post graduate jobs for someone with a social work degree? Just lost my current job...,"I'm (f24) in a crisis right now. I've recently graduated with a social work degree. At the start of this month, I started working as a teaching assistant in a SEN school, thinking I could work toward a career in education. I thought it was going quite well. Then I got a call from my agency this morning saying the school dosent want me to return, with little to no feedback other than I wasn't progressing as expected and they have other candidates.

I feel sick and completely useless and ashamed. The only previous jobs I've had were care work so I could try some local nursing homes but I really wanted to escape that kind of work (long hours, very low pay, very physical). I am not confident or experienced enough to be a social worker, so I'm just wondering what jobs are out there which my degree might help me obtain?

Just some background, I've always struggled in the workplace, probably due to being neurodivergent (mild autism, dyspraxia, possible ADHD).

16nleh3,Should I quit,"Hello,

Here is a little background about me:

\-I'm 28 (M) and I graduated from University in 2017 at a pretty good school with an Economics degree

\- I travelled for a year prior to starting work, I ended working at an awesome fintech for 3.5 years, got promoted to Account Manager and really enjoyed it, however I wanted to explore what else was out there.

\-Pandemic happened, wanted to do something different so I moved to Portugal. I am a dual citizen between Canada and Latvia so don't need any visas. Worked at a startup for 8 months, didn't like it that much so I moved home to Canada to be with my family

\-  Got a remote job as an Account Manager and this company is kind of crap. The product is really bad, most of the customers are upset (75 percent of them). They got a new name and went through a bit of restructuring prior to me joining. (They didn't tell me this in the interview). I wake up everyday and dread it which is clearly a red flag. My coworkers share the same feedback. Since starting 4/8 team members have quit and been replaced.

\- Been there now for 6 months and I want to quit and join a company with a better product as I feel relatively limitless in a role where I don't see the company doing well down the line nor do I enjoy this.

I am living with family and have no rent to pay, 15k savings, 15k in stocks and 0 debt. Thinking of moving back to Latvia or Sweden as I think the lifestyle is better me despite my family living here in Canada.

Any help or advice would be appreciated? I'm concerned with the short job stints on my resume.",cjproblemo,1,1.0,2,1695216704,2023-09-20 13:31:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16nleh3/should_i_quit/,9,2023

So fast forward to my current role I started this past month. Much smaller company much more lax environment and a much smaller work load so far at least. Pay slightly less than my previous role but the work life balance has been much better however at the expense of definitelynot being as stimulated as my last role. So come today one of my old bosses asks me if I wanted my old role back. Pay would be more than before since it's now hourly and OT is an option but now the hours are afternoons as opposed to when I had mornings. 

So here we are. My main concerns are going back to a company that recently had layoffs I feel as if things go sideways again whats to stop me from being another causality? On the other hand I will be making a decent amount more a year than my current role. So hoping to maybe gain some perspectives that I haven't thought about.

16nk3cl,My job has been adding more responsibilities slowly and I'm exhausted. How do I tell them in a polite way it's too much?,"I'm working at a very small animal sanctuary, at this point it's just me working and 2 managers. Usually there's only 1 manager there a day so it's just myself working and 1 manager who isn't helping out anymore. 

I used to work from 2-7pm and I thought it was a good amount of work but not to the point where I was exhausted every day. 

My coworker left because nobody was taking her seriously when she said her work load wasn't fair, I didn't either because I covered her shift more than once and my managers always helped out so I thought she was being dramatic because with 2 people it's not too bad.

I took  3 extra hours a day so I work 11-7pm now and I'm only a week in but my managers have completely stopped helping. I thought the extra 3 hours a day would be no big deal but it's actually the most labor intensive extra 3 hours..

 Basically to clean the animals stalls, we have to fill giant muck tubs (like half a barrel size) and bring it to a dumpster outside and either throw the tubs over our heads or climb into the dumpster, at least 30 tubs a day on top of the labor involved with filling them up and changing all of the animals waters. 

I feel really bad because I thought my coworker who left was a slacker and I was on my managers side when they came to me about it since she was constantly on her phone and taking very long breaks, but she did try to speak up about the unfair work load and nobody took her seriously. I see what she meant now. 

I'm 3 months into this job so I don't understand why now my managers are making me do everything when they used to help out with cleaning stalls and feeding the animals. I don't know how to bring this up in a way that doesn't come off like I'm just complaining, but these extra 3 hours a day are insanely labor intensive compared to my previous shift of 2-7pm.

I'm worried they'll tell me to suck it up and act like this was the job description all along like they did to my coworker. When in reality it seems like they pretend they help out and then pawn all of the responsibilities off on the workers. I only make minimum wage so it's honestly not worth beating my body up like this for crap pay.",throwaway-Critical,11,1.0,4,1695213039,2023-09-20 12:30:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16nk3cl/my_job_has_been_adding_more_responsibilities/,9,2023

My wife and I recently inherited a profitable business. It's not one that either of us are passionate about, but it makes money.

The business only runs well when we're there. As soon as we step away, shit hits the fan. As a result, the level of stress and takehome stress is very high. Compared to my blue collar, I punch out and don't think about it again.

In order to take the business and run, I'd have to quit my blue collar. They will not humor any leaves or time away (with or without pay).

16nileg,How to negotiate salary increase,"Hi everyone,

I started a new job a few months ago. Since I started I found a lot of shady behaviors that make me realize this isn't my forever job, but I'm holding down the fort until I find something else.

We are a small department and multiple people have quit in the past few months. There are now four full-time employees including myself, and one of them is trying to transfer to another department.

I'm currently the only employee working on my project. Normally there are about four. I've been making everything run, including running three back to back major events (300+ people) pretty much on my own.

I just found out yesterday that an intern got a stipend increase. She is supposed to be helping me but she has missed multiple of these events and has been out of the country for 3 weeks. She has been an intern for 2 months. She will be missing another major event coming up. When I do the math, based on her contractual weekly hours, and the stipend that she now currently makes, she makes more per hour than I do, and she has barely done anything. She's also getting paid for those 3 weeks she took off to travel. 

I have another event coming up next week that I'm going to have to run completely on my own. Additionally, my boss in the past two weeks has allowed people to take extended time off that has resulted in their work landing on my plate. It is finally wearing me down and I had three panic attacks in 24 hours.

I haven't accrued much PTO yet but I currently have about 5 days in the bank. 

I plan on meeting with HR and my boss this week to negotiate a salary increase. I'm also planning on using one of those PTO days on the event day next week to highlight the ridiculousness of how this place runs. How should I communicate this? I realistically don't think I can continue forward at this rate. My boss called me a workhorse the other day. At my last job it took three people to replace me. I don't want to be a workhorse anymore. How do I put this to an end?",bioqueen53,1,1.0,0,1695208481,2023-09-20 11:14:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16nileg/how_to_negotiate_salary_increase/,9,2023

16nhsg8,36 SAHM starting a career.,"Hello, I would like some advice starting a career for myself. I have been a stay-at-home mom and housewife for 17 years because my husband was in the military and it was easier for me to stay home with the children because my husband deployed often.  I feel fortunate to have had that option, but I do have regrets of not at least completing some online courses to prepare myself for when the kids were old enough where they didn't need me home all the time. They are now getting to that age and I would like to start working but I have no real work experience or any education past high school. I would just like some suggestions on what would be a reasonable field for someone like me to get into later in age, I don't know where to begin. So any advice is very much appreciated!",Natural_Peace0,1,1.0,0,1695205711,2023-09-20 10:28:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16nhsg8/36_sahm_starting_a_career/,9,2023
16nhhfc,Energy analyst.. where and how to progress?,"Hi everyone, sorry for formatting, on mobile.

I (27) am an energy analyst who was initially supposed to only look at one commodity, and ended up learning fundamentals and writing reports on two more (three total). The commodities in question are kinda interconnected and having a deep understanding on how they affect each other definitely helped me write better analysis.

That said, I don't have business/economic background. I have a Master (Ma), and before getting this job I was into writing data-driven news. I quickly realized energy transition issues are often misunderstood or badly explained. That's a short version on how I ended up doing what I do. 

It's only been a year and half, however because of the career change of my SO I need to move city with them. 
The city in question is basically a business district: think banks and a lot of trading desks. Most job opening are either for senior analysts in support of trading, or renewable consultants (with experience).

I am not entirely sure on how I could cover either of these openings.. I am in a ""I know I know nothing"" kind of situation, I am reading about additional commodities which seems to be hiring a lot in the new country, and taking python courses to be at par to other analysts (and enjoying it so far).

Because I don't have a MS, I feel like it's already game over for me. I hate maths, if I have to do it so be it, but most of the time I get excel and python to do some base modelling for me. Nothing that can compete with people who actually had studied this it and have already experienced in the sector. 

What is a consultant anyway? I get that they understand contracts and subsidies and suggest on the best way to build a project and get funding for it. But how do they learn to do that? There is need of knowledge at least of law, management, sale, etc. in this role alone. It's a lot.
Also I am not a fan of getting paid by contract close kind of thing. I would rather have my monthly salary and that's the end of it. I am risk-adverse.

Sorry for rambling. Stress is getting the best of me. All suggestions are appreciated.",Wonderful_Trouble_13,3,1.0,2,1695204612,2023-09-20 10:10:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16nhhfc/energy_analyst_where_and_how_to_progress/,9,2023
16nhcum,"What are jobs like truck driver, where you earn a lot of money ONLY if you work for many hours??","

So recently I have discovered that owner operator driver in USA makes around 6 figures. Requires little education and training in order to become one. One major factor of that job is isolation from relatives and longish hours. This is not the case for me, as I am completely alright with that, I adore a solitary lifestyle and a repetitive one.

However truck drivers are severely underpaid in Europe (at least from where i live), so I am looking for a job/careers similar to a truck drivers that requires little training and the pay is decent if you work overtime.

I also want to mention that jobs that require analytical and abstract thinking like programming/IT are not suitable for me.

I have no issues if in this post someone suggests me to work 2 jobs simultaneously, however they should both be decent paying.",N3BUL4Z3R,5,1.0,4,1695204164,2023-09-20 10:02:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16nhcum/what_are_jobs_like_truck_driver_where_you_earn_a/,9,2023
16nh1nl,Tradesman to engineer. Looking for some guidance or motivation!," 

Little bit on my history. I worked as a telecommunications tech for 8 years, completed my cert 2 and 3. Left the industry and completed a plumbing apprenticeship, have 7 years' experience. Started a bachelor of environmental engineering two years ago, I'm now halfway. Chose enviro as I want to work in the water industry. It's been TOUGH! have been studying full time and working part time for the two years. Lost the part time plumbing gig a few months back as my availability was so random due to my study commitments. I could not imagine working as a plumber when I'm over 40, I also have no desire to start my own company. Anyway, I have a new casual role as a service tech for a big medical company that offers much better flexibility.

My reason for this post is, I'm considering giving up. All I ever read is ""there are no engineering jobs blah blah"". I have put so much on the line for this. Has anyone been through or going through a similar situation? I'm here for some motivation or honest feedback. Was it a stupid move? I'm considering just settling for a service tech role in the water industry or just going back to comms. Love problem solving and fault finding but hate construction work. I love working in the field but am also ready for some office work, a mix of the two would be nice.

First post ever on a blog btw.

16ngt2o,"Need advice, feeling lost","Needing advice or potential opportunities.

20 years old with experience in automotive & solar sales, operations management, IT, marketing, and media production. I’ve worked various jobs in some of these industries since I was 15, some of which were internships or volunteer while in high school. 

I find myself in a situation where I’m unemployed and coincidentally without a working vehicle as my car broke down (blown motor). Unfortunately I was working for a startup company that failed and left me in a terrible financial position, I have absolutely no money whatsoever and no way to get to a job. The only plus is that I live with my parents and I have minimal monthly expenses, which is only my cell phone bill.

I’ve applied to hundred of jobs, both remote and in-person. Everything from entry level things I’d rather not do, to things that I don’t even necessarily qualify for. Haven’t heard back at all from anyone. I’ve even considered getting my CDL but I can’t drive commercially across state lines until I’m 21, which is 7 months away, so no trucking company will train me tuition free until then.

I’m feeling lost with no sense of direction. I do have the opportunity to go to college tuition free, and I don’t necessarily want to but I’m not against it either. If I did return to school, I would get a finance degree as I have very vast knowledge in anything finance related and while I’m not a math person, anything money related is something I love. My parents would be willing to assist financially with other expenses while I’m in school, but they refuse to help otherwise if I don’t return to school.

Any advice for someone who doesn’t really know what he wants to do in life? Any college majors/career fields, or potential opportunities I am unaware of? I feel so lost and overwhelmed at the same time. Can’t find a decent position at all for anything in the fields I’ve worked in. 

Any input is greatly appreciated.",Appropriate_Piano812,1,1.0,0,1695202097,2023-09-20 09:28:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16ngt2o/need_advice_feeling_lost/,9,2023
16nfwhu,I got promoted to Assistant Manager and my direct Manager is going on maternity leave for 6 months. Should I ask for a raise during this time?,"I recently completed a Management Trainee program and just got my first promotion to Assistant Manager. I was supposed to be running my branch with my direct Branch Manager, except she is about to pop with her first baby. She will be gone for 5-6 months on maternity leave and I will be left to act in her place. Would it be appropriate to ask for a raise during this time?

I understand the company is already paying her Branch salary while she's on mat. leave, but I will be completing all of her actual duties while she's away. I will be thrown into it when I was only expecting to be an Assistant Manager. 

I understand that this is a big opportunity for my resume though too, if I do well, so I'm not trying to burn any bridges by being greedy. If I am able to handle this solo, I will be able to prove myself and apply for any Branch Manager positions that follow.

16nfv6p,Need a job to find a job?,"Hi guys, I’m really burnt out to the max physically and mentally. 

I’d love to take time off and reset / be intentional with my next step ie. Change industry, or change company etc. but I have no energy. I work 12 hour days on average in finance and find that although I still make time to search and apply to things the stress/pressure of leaving is making me apply to everything just to leave.

I dream about quitting and taking a break, but scared that you need a job to be more attractive in this job market and thus to find a job.

I’ve worked at a reputable global company for 3-4 years with a promotion  and have a graduate degree. 

Unfortunately sabbatical and unpaid leave are both not options. I do, however, have the financial means to support myself. My concern is mainly based on career trajectory

I would really appreciate some advice on what direction I should take in life. I’m 26 years old and based in the U.K. , dropped out of university and I’m doing a front of house admin job. I feel stuck. 

I set up lunches and meetings for people but I would like to one day be the person that gets meeting booked and lunches. Academically I’m gifted, straight A student throughout my life, perfect grades. But university was very daunting for me and I just couldn’t take it any more. My mental health plummeted and I became a shadow of my former self. So the best thing to do was to drop out. On top of that, I was told that I would never be successful, so I started to believe it. It’s only in the last month that my mindset has changed. I think I am capable and deserving of a career. 

I’m at a point where I want to build a career and be very successful. But I do not know where to start. My main areas of interest are business, HR, PR and management. What steps can I take?

16ncnlz,Which offer should I take???,"Ok, so here’s the deal. I’ve been looking for a new job for about 4-5 months now and just got a job offer I’m excited about. First applied to this company in early June, so the process has been quite long. It’s a Fortune 100 Pharma company with great benefits, growth opportunities, etc.

Now, at the same time, an old client of a previous employer of mine from a few years ago wants to hire me on a 1 year temp contract with potential to renew, but unlikely. I developed some software for this client and my previous employer is now shutting down, so they have no one with the institutional knowledge to support them. The idea is for me to support their production, make upgrades, document everything, and train someone they have yet to hire to take over long term.

Here are the offers:
Option 1: Fortune 100 Pharma
Role: Principal Engineer
Salary: $170k
TC: $230k (includes Bonus and RSUs w/ 5 yr vesting)
Sign-on Bonus: $25k

Option 2: Old Client
Role: Staff Engineer
Salary: $300k
Sign-on Bonus: $25k
Duration: 1 year via staffing company (still get some benefits- health insurance, 401k, etc.)

Leaning towards Option 1 for career growth. Also concerned about finding a similar job a year from now when it took 4-5 months to get this offer. During that time I received 3 other offers that I declined. Only 1 of those 3 was comparable to option 1. If I go this route the old client is interested in part time work - I can probably do around 16 hrs a week @ $200/hr or so. 

Option 2 is tempting though…

I’m worried that if I do not get into these schools then I won’t be able to make a good living. 

If things don’t work out for me and I can’t get into those grad schools then I was thinking of getting a MBA. Is this a good plan and what jobs am I able to get with a health science + MBA? 

I was also thinking of going into tech but I am worried that it is over saturated with the surplus of computer science/software eng majors. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",Extension_Big_3360,1,1.0,1,1695180099,2023-09-20 03:21:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16naq6a/career_advice/,9,2023

16n9xsu,Started my first office job and already feel burnt out - don’t know what to do,"I started working as a part time intern at the company my last semester in college and things were going good but I’ve been full time now for the last 4 months and I’m starting to feel pretty miserable. I work in the accounting department and tbh my job is the most boring soul crushing thing ever. Most of my day is just doing repetitive data entry and filing and occasionally sending emails. It’s really starting to take a toll on my mental health and my productivity is starting to drop off a lot. I dread going to work everyday and sitting in my cubicle doing the same thing over and over for 40 hours a week. The only thing that is keeping my sane is that I’m allowed to listen to music and podcasts while I work. Overall I just feel really disappointed in myself that this is where I ended up. If I could go back to freshman year of college I would have tried to pick a degree that I was more passionate about rather than accounting. 

I guess I don’t really know where to go from here because long term I know this is not sustainable and eventually I’m going to get to the point where I really don’t think I can keep forcing myself to do this job. I’ve thought about maybe trying to find a remote wfh job so that at least I could be in the comfort of my own home while I’m miserable everyday lol.

16n992g,Is taking a paycut worth it for less stress?,"
I'm currently managing janitorial staff at 6 buildings in Seattle. My current salary is $65k which is the minimum salary in WA state. The company matches 4% of 401k which I like. I bring home around $4k every month after 401k and taxes. I've been at this job for 1 year. 

But I've been extremely stressed lately. My boss is an asshole who never recognize my work and throw shade all the time. The trainer I was replacing taught me so many wrong things as well. And lately, my bosses has been a lot more critical of the janitorial work and its driving me crazy. I train the janitors but they continue to slack even after write ups. The buildings are under staffed which gets exasperated if someone calls out. Sometimes they get on FMLA and we will be short 1 person for 3 months. 

I write a nightly report to the bosses which they have been critizing. I'll admit that I have been missing certain things but that's because I was never trained. My boss wrote the other day ""you should know this by now"", but I was never told so. I can't even relax on the weekends cause all I can think of are the angry emails I might see after. 

I've been looking at jobs but a lot of them don't pay as much or are part time. The paycut will probably be around 15k if I go with the job I'm looking at. I won't have financial stress since I don't have much bills (just paid off my car). I'm also tempted to take a part time job (around  52-72 hours every 2 weeks), which will give me more time to return to school. 

I'm curious as what you may think since I'm really conflicted. Thank you everyone.",Jasonwj322a,19,0.949999988079071,17,1695175816,2023-09-20 02:10:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16n992g/is_taking_a_paycut_worth_it_for_less_stress/,9,2023

16n8rlg,I may be creating a position for myself with two companies. Should I be transparent about the other company to each?,"I have been job searching since I got my current job 4 years ago. I thought this job would be temporary. Now two different leads are materializing into something very serious. Not applications for jobs. Conversations with founders/CEOs about me, and how my experience and skills can help their company. In one case, a position may be written bespoke for me, and in the other, I would be taking on a part-time role with the expectation of going full-time if it works well. I feel very lucky, humbled, and blessed.

I also feel uneasy about the fact that neither knows about the other. If this were traditional interviews, sure, I probably wouldn’t tell them unless directly asked. And I would probably try to make them both have the impression that they individually are my top choice. But this feels different. I feel like I would be consuming an inordinate amount of resources from these companies only to tell one No.

It’s a small world and I don’t want to leave anyone with a sour taste about me. Should I tell them that I have other offers on the table?

If I DO tell them, worst case is they both feel I am not enthusiastic enough about them specifically and both lose interest and I’m back to square one. It’s still relatively early on though. Best case is they each are understanding human beings and I have some negotiating power with two offers in hand.

If I DON’T tell them, worst case is the one I say No to is mad and feels betrayed and I have a skeleton in my closet for my whole career. (Of note: one company is investing a flight/hotel in me and some top-level meetings. The other is giving me a short-term, part-time “trial” position) Best case is the one I say No to takes it with grace.

There may be an outside possibility of being a part time, self-employed consultant for each. But that scares the piss out of me.

Any of you employers have any advice? At this point, I am inclined to diplomatically make sure each learns that I am anticipating a possibility of other offers.


tl;dr I may have two potential employers creating a position for me and don’t know if I should tell them about the other.",jobsearcher0923,1,1.0,1,1695174483,2023-09-20 01:48:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16n8rlg/i_may_be_creating_a_position_for_myself_with_two/,9,2023
16n86tl,How much to negotiate on salary?,"I'm a business analyst at a company with extremely good work-life balance. I do real work maybe a total of 10 hours a week. I WFH two days a week & barely ever do anything orher than keep my Teams active. Ive asked for things to do & Ive asked to be mentored more in SQL & Tableau, but nothing ever happens. My boss is always telling me hes got things to show me, but rarely ever does. He's always complaining about how busy he is & how he has to stay late, then doesn't bother giving me anything to do. I don't mind the lack of stress, but I make a little under $50k/year & with my expected 3.5% raise, I will still be under that next year. I don't feel like I'm learning a ton to use for applying to other jobs or to use in a negotiation. The one good thing is my direct manager, his director, and the GM all praise my work. 

Anyway, I started applying to jobs the last week. I had a phone screen for a role today that listed the role as ""in office, but flexible"" & ""salary based on exp."" The lady kept telling me she was impressed with my knowledge & my resume, but asked about my current salary & expectations. I told her the fit of the job & the flexibility of the schedule would determine that. She suggested $60k was probably where I was hoping & I stated that would be the minimum. The job is about double the drive (from 25 mins, no toll to 45 mins, with a toll) & I wasn't told what the schedule or WFH situation was. 

She told me to expect a call later this week to set up a full interview. Would you think that the $60k was a stab in the dark at what I would take? If I can WFH 2 or 3 days a week, that sounds fine. If it's fully in person with occasional WFH, I'd like to negotiate more towards $65-$70. Anyone have experience with these initial phone screens and mentioning salaries? Or jobs that don't list a range but say ""based on exp"" & what they were willing to pay? The average for this city is $79k according to Glassdoor.",Qphth0,2,1.0,2,1695172869,2023-09-20 01:21:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16n86tl/how_much_to_negotiate_on_salary/,9,2023
16n73yf,Socially overstimulated person seeking meaningful career?,"Hey there! Hoping for some general advice for my career. For some background, I (28F) initially studied fine arts in college because that's all I really thought I would be good at, and I felt pressured by family to go directly to college. After 3 years of art school, I decided to leave and spent some years just working doing odd jobs: barista then cafe shift manager, maid, daycare cook, etc. I decided to go back to school for a bachelor's in Health and Wellness, I wanted a career that meant something. Graduated in 2021 with my BS, and then spent two years as the main operations manager for a local pantry. I loved connecting with patients and the human side of it. That part made the rest of it easier. It became apparent to me that I struggle with conflict and become really overstimulated by the noise and interaction of this work. When I decided to leave this job earlier this summer, I wasn't sure what to do but my job had become so overwhelming that I was having daily panic attacks. I took a position as a social worker a month ago, and I'm running into problems again (not surprising I know). I don't mind the work, I like working with the older clients, but I am so socially uncomfortable in my office that I am back to crying at work often. A lot of this is personal with my social anxiety of course which I am working on but I still need to work unfortunately. I was hoping maybe if the environment and work was different I wouldn't feel as anxious but I am more anxious now than ever. 

I was hoping for a career that meant something, but maybe one with less patient facing interaction. It doesn't have to be completely alone, I do like working with others but it overwhelms me. I feel incredibly lost, I'm worried there's nothing I'm really good at.

16n6l8q,Need advice: How to approach my manager about switching teams and negotiate salary for an internal role,"I joined a large company about 4 months ago and completed my training roughly a month into my tenure.

Currently, in my role, we haven't onboarded a new client since the beginning of the year, and there's no indication of potential clients in the pipeline.

Recently, I stumbled upon a new role internally that aligns with my position and, notably, offers a 20k increase from my current base salary.

I'm contemplating making a move due to the lack of activity and potential growth in my current team. However, I'm in a quandary about how to approach this situation:

How do I communicate my desire to switch teams to my current manager, considering the lack of new clients and growth?
When reaching out to the hiring manager for the new role, what would be an impactful introductory message?
If I do secure an interview or an offer, how should I approach negotiating the salary to ensure I'm compensated in line with the new role's offering?

16n68x7,"Feeling anxious about going to work, should i quit without another job lined up?","I moved to Canada and took on a project management role in a financial institution for about a year. This is my first time managing multiple projects for businesses I am unfamiliar with. The role requires me to collaborate with stakeholders from various business lines and I’m expected to know everything of their operations as a project manager. But in reality, I lack the experience in these domains. This knowledge gap often leads to awkward pauses in meetings when I’m asked questions I can’t answer. Sometimes, I stumble over my words, trying to form a response, making situations even more uncomfortable.

To complicate matters, I also face a language barrier. It’s challenging to articulate my thoughts and project requirement clearly, especially when I’m grappling with understanding the business areas I’m involved in. My confidence has taken a hit. I now hesitate to send even basic emails or engage in workplace conversations, out of fear that others might see me as incompetent or think I can’t speak properly. This is dragging down my productivity and I need to work overtime and during weekends to catch up. When Monday approaches, I'm filled with anxiety and dread about returning to work.

Job-hopping might be another issue for me; I had about 7 jobs in 8 years in my home country. I’m concerned that quitting now might make potential Canadian employers think I’m struggling with adapting to their work culture.

As project deadlines are approaching , I don’t see much progress on my end. I’ve spoken to my supervisors about the workload and my concerns, but their feedback is that I’m doing well and told me to keep on doing what I’m doing. This doesn’t align with how I feel. I genuinely believe I won’t be able to handle the upcoming projects given the current situation I’m in. This job has begun to take a toll on my mental health and causing significant anxiety.

I know the logical step would be to find a new job while still employed, but the stress feels unbearable. I’m considering quitting without another job lined up. Is it wise to do so?

16n3hjb,Interview tips - How to talk about dissatisfaction with my current job without it being a red flag,"I have been job hunting for the past year. A lot the way im learning new skills and earning certifications to build my resume. I took classes in digital marketing and project management. It’s paid off and I’ve made it to four different 3rd round interviews in the last year. 

I currently work as a program coordinator for a small nonprofit. Over my time there I have led many successful community projects, helped us gain hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants and drastically boosted our social media reach. It’s been rewarding work however it’s tough. I make less than $40k a year, have no benefits, and frequently work 6 days a week. In spite of this I still love my job and take pride in the work I do.  but my wife has a baby on the way and I want to give our child more financial stability and have more time to spend with my family. 

In interviews I bring up my accomplishments and speak positively about the projects I’ve led and the outcomes. On several occasions the interviewers have asked questions along the lines of “it sounds like you really love your job, why do you want to leave?” Or “I’m concerned that you’re so passionate about your current job and would get bored here.” When I asked for feedback from one job that turned me down they even sighted this as a factor for choosing the other candidate over me. 

How do I express my accomplishments and that I’m a good and reliable employee while still expressing that I’m ready to move on? How do I express my dissatisfaction with allow pay, lack of benefits and long hours without sounding like I’m selfish and only in it for the money/benefits. It feels like pay is the biggest reason we all transition careers but it’s such a taboo subject to broach in interviews.

16mzqqu,Did anyone ever transition to a social sciences career late in life?,"I am 31 yo, work in IT, good salary, good perks good work environment. Actually I am a career changer, have a degree in another STEM field and then switched to the field.

I've always liked social sciences like history, philosophy, anthropology, political sciences, but I knew if I studied that I'd be unemployed or have a crapy unrelated job. I come from a poor background so I would never have the chance to do fancy unpaid internships abroad (my country is quite small and opportunities are scarce here) to build a good cv. 

Now that I work in a field with a lot of opportunities and are able to save money and eventually some day buy property, I dream of one day pursuing a bachelor and even research in something like history, maybe in my mid 40s (I am childfree so I won't ever have to worry with that expense). Another option would be research in emvironmental sciences (I do have some background in chemistry and biology) to help find a solution to some of the most pressing issues in society as I feel good as it is, my current job does not add much value to society. 

I would no longer have to worry about having a super well paid job because I'd have my basic needs met, so could do it even if it didn't pay much. However I am afraid this is not very common, might even be weird to have a 40 or 50 yo doing a master or PhD and maybe some positions have an age barrier. 

Did anyone ever do that or do you know anyone who did?",Shadowgirl7,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1695151138,2023-09-19 19:18:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16mzqqu/did_anyone_ever_transition_to_a_social_sciences/,9,2023

16mzbnd,When is it an appropriate time to follow up on a job opportunity?,"Background info on me: I’m a therapy assistant  who is working full time PRN, meaning I get my full time hours working at different facilities when and how long I choose. But I also work in retail as my for “funsies” job and just to add some variety in contrast to my healthcare job. I’m only part time at this retail job and work maybe once or twice a week.

I apologize for this being long but I feel like the whole story is necessary!


A recruiter(J) reached out to my retail email, that I only have access to when I’m at that job, about scheduling a pre screening interview for a remote position. I forwarded that email to my personal email and scheduled the interview and wrote in the comment box that I used my personal email because I only have access to that other email when I’m at work once or twice a week. 

The interview went well, she confirmed my personal email was my best contact email and scheduled me for a video interview with one of their hiring managers. 

The video interview also went well, I felt confident after it was over. Before it ended, he(Z) said he would email me a written assessment “assignment” that I was to email back that same day so they could see my writing my style and my thought process and then probably scheduled my third interview. He said he would email it right after we got off the call. 

1.5 hours later, I still hadn’t received anything so I emailed him with my personal email to double check and make sure he had my personal email and not my retail email (even though J had confirmed my personal email the day prior). I didn’t hear anything at all through the next day Friday. Friday after work, I went to my retail job to check my email to see if by chance he sent it there. He did. To say I was mortified would be understatement. I was worried he thought maybe I wasn’t interested. But that isn’t the case, I just don’t have access to that email at home. 

I forwarded the email to myself, i messaged J with the phone number she had told me to reach out if I needed anything. I knew it was outside business hours her time so I didn’t expect to hear back but I gave her the run down and told her I would email the assessment as soon as I complete it when I get home. I got home, did the assessment and emailed her and Z the assessment along with an apology and my embarrassment about not confirming my email with Z before we ended the video interview and reiterated my interest in the position. 

Of course it was outside of business hours for them and it was Friday so I didn’t expect to hear anything again until Monday. Monday, she messaged back and said she will let Z know. It’s Tuesday and I still haven’t heard from Z if he received my assessment or if he still thinks I’m a candidate or if he’s moving on. 

It’s Tuesday now, and I’m wondering when it is an appropriate time to reach out for a follow up to see if I’m even still in the running?

 I will be at my retail job today to check my email again but I’m worried I screwed up and I’ve been chalked out of a great opportunity over a miscommunication with my email

16mxkk3,I am negotiating my pay for the first time ever. I’m scared sh!tless.,"I don’t think I stress easily but this is killing me and I’m not sure if I made the right decision. I just hope they don’t rescind their offer.

So the official story is that I left rural Georgia and a rare opportunity doing work I loved, to move to Atlanta and try out an opportunity as a financial analyst. 
The reality is that I was retaliated against. I moved to Atlanta because I received the Financial Analyst opportunity through a connection after losing my prior job. 
The work as an Analyst wasn’t hard at all. It was fucking boring though; I hated it immensely. I *need* to work with my hands. 

Long story short, I ended up on the job market searching for a similarly collared job to what I did in rural Georgia. I was just hoping to work with electronics again but I got lucky, spotted a job listing doing exactly what I did in rural Georgia, in Atlanta, for another company. 
After applying, I got an interview pretty quickly since I have spot-on relevant work experience. 
The first interview went great. I think that the second interview also went very well because I received a verbal job offer 3 hours after the interview was over from HR. On Monday (yesterday), I received my written, official offer. 

The details are full time, $26/hr. 
I replied, countering with $29/hr.

My job role primary responsibility is repairing a fleet of specialized computers to a component level. There will be 3 of us total, plus the manager; the other two are completely inexperienced and the manager is familiar with the units but not component level troubleshooting. 
So outside my primary role, I will be the only one with any certification + will be the primary person training people + I’ll have to help select adequate inventory and equipment selection and other types of advising. 

Is my counter of $29 appropriate? I asked $3 more per hour in the Atlanta area. I *believe* that I have extremely valuable and relevant experience to the development of their entire repair department. I’m so damned scared waiting on a reply.",Draw-OCoward,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1695145794,2023-09-19 17:49:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16mxkk3/i_am_negotiating_my_pay_for_the_first_time_ever/,9,2023

I'm currently working in the architecture industry as a technician. I managed to get a job not long after graduating and now have been working in the industry for 3\~ years split between two different practices. Ive not really enjoyed the work so far, I feel it's alot of work for little pay and satisfaction.

I've gotten good at the work but at this point it's gotten very boring and repetitive. The aspects I do enjoy are managing the projects and the client side of the work. Unfortunately, I dont get any of this in my current practice as we deal with larger projects and only one project manager. 

Unfortunately the job market for a technician isn't that great, often offering below average pay or working for a very traditional ""closed minded"" practice doing more repetitive work. 

I really want to leave by the end of the year but i know it's not very smart for me to quit without a back-up plan.

The solutions i have come up with are:

1. Career change. Quit and do online courses or college course on software development (this has been a keen interest since university and have enjoyed coding and the ux side, unfortunately i cant find time and motivation anymore due to my current work situation)
2. Find a project management role and try my hands at that.

So why am I getting miserable?,"So after years of talking about how much I would love to have this career, a few years ago, I decided to become a Certified Wedding/Event Planner. My ultimate goal was to work independently but I understand that starting a small business takes time and hard work. So I started interning until I was able to get my foot in the door.  
I settled about 8 months ago and started working for a local planning business. It was all very exciting in the beginning and I couldn't wait to start knocking out events with clients. Even if it meant sacrificing my weekends for work.  
  
Shortly after I started, the company merged with a venue and our team has absorbed that extra workload. That added load quickly shifted to only my plate when a coworker switched to part-time. Leaving me with my work from the planning company and 75% of the venue work. (25% being done by my boss). It's been a bit overwhelming for me - The two companies merged but it's not the same work. So I've been working on multiple clients from both ends and it's been pretty taxing. Especially when things slip through the cracks.  
Thinking about how I'm still relatively new and balancing 15+ events between two different companies with two separate SOPs has been a lot for me.  
  
We recently hired a new employee (about 2 months ago) and I had been led to believe the new individual would be helping with the balance. That hasn't been the case. The new employee has maybe done 2% of training on the venue side so, there's really no relief on that end for me. Especially with Wedding Season starting.  
  
With all of this going on over the last few months -- It's just been a lot on me and worn down my confidence in this field as well as the joy I was originally getting from it. I get the vibe that that standard with my boss is ""only perfection"" and nothing else.  
They're not an aggressive boss but, I hate feeling like I'm going to get fired because I forgot to follow up on an email.  
  
I know when event day comes, I love what I do. But the pressure I feel in the office, working behind the scenes, has started making me miserable. I can't help but wonder ""Am I just not good at this job?"" or maybe I saw this career with rose-colored glasses.  
Am I complaining or does it seem like it's not a good fit as I wanted it to be? Or is the expression ""Do what you love, and you'll never work another day in your life"" just a failed idea?  
  
Side Notes:  
I don't think it matters but I'm about 3 months pregnant. Is it possible the mood/hormone changes would make me feel this way?  
  
I also haven't told my job that I'm expecting yet. I fear that I'll be passed on opportunities that get disguised as ""They're doing me a favor"" nor do I want to be seen as ""Incapable"" because of the pregnancy.  
I'm also struggling with the fact that if this job just isn't for me, I'm not really in a position to quit and go somewhere else. The chances of me finding a new job that will allow me to go on Maternity Leave in a few months seem very unlikely. And my husband doesn't currently make enough for me to be a ""Stay at Home"" Mom.",Happy_Crow5294,1,1.0,3,1695137884,2023-09-19 15:38:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16muayr/i_worked_hard_for_this_job_so_why_am_i_getting/,9,2023
16mtwnk,Should I leave my full-time job to go back to school?,"I'm 23 years old and I graduated in 2022 with a Bachelor's degree in Communication. I wasn't passionate about the field but I chose it because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I have been working the past 2 years full time as a bookkeeper and HR assistant for a golf club in my area but I have been feeling a lack of interest at work and that it is no longer stimulating. However, I get paid about $20/hr and have benefits with this job. 

I have been considering the medical field since I was 18 years old and am thinking of going back to school to become a Radiology Tech. It would take 2 years and I would have to quit my current job and get a part time job instead because of clinicals and the workload. But I feel that the outcome would be more rewarding, I would have a more meaningful, active job and get paid more.

16mt97m,When should I follow up?,"My old company has contacted me a few times since I left 3.5 years ago. Once just to check in, once when they opened a another office in my state, and once to do temp work on the side which paid well but didn’t go far. I still have the PC which I told them but they said to hang onto it. 


They came to my town and took me out to dinner about a month ago. They basically explained how the company has changed and to think about what I wanted if I were to come back. They said it wasn’t an “offer” which I found confusing. I told them I needed time to think and that I would get back to them after my vacation.  


In my “terms” email I shot high on salary (but not obscenely and not too far off from what I would have been making had I not left) and PTO. I also mentioned that I would take some remote only / no travel weeks in exchange for a lower salary. I’ll comfortable going 10k lower in salary and one week less in vacation though I didn’t say that. I mentioned that further discussion was warranted and that I’ll be in their town for a concert this weekend if they wanted to meet in person. 


I sent the email this weekend and I have not heard anything back. I don’t want them to disregard my email because I shot high. They didn’t give me a lot of information to work with so I don’t know what else they expected.


I’m not sure if I should send a text today or tomorrow letting them know that I sent the email. It wouldn’t be unusual to text them. 


If this doesn’t pan out, I’ll probably ask them not to contact me again because I frankly find their “water testing” and inconsistency annoying.",sugarbiscuits828,1,1.0,3,1695135409,2023-09-19 14:56:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16mt97m/when_should_i_follow_up/,9,2023
16mt8qr,Is it possible to move from engineering to a more creative field like event planning?,"I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and 4 years experience plus internships while in college. I’m located in the Midwest USA. 

I am honestly just exhausted by engineering culture. I got into the field because I love knowing how things work and I’m good at math. I’m so tired of the sexism and constant “prove every decision you’ve ever made to our arbitrary standards” culture. There’s always at least one know it all at each job and I just need out. 

When I was in college I ran a huge engineering design challenge each semester my junior and senior years with a co-leader and a team of student volunteers. It involved renting a space, tables, electrical set up, ordering participant merch and competition prizes, contacting companies for sponsorship and professors to judge. It also involved ordering and picking up food for the corporate and professor judges and lots of pizza for the students. All-in-all it was a huge event with about 60 teams of 4 a semester. 

I’ve also had a good amount of leadership experience throughout the years and because of engineering am good at creating project schedules and needs/requirements, but I also love being creative which is why I think event planning would be a good option. I’m also good at vacation planning and often plan the trips for my friends all the way from small budget camping to solo trips abroad. 

Is this change possible without going back to school? Are there any other possible career ideas that might fit this skill set but have more women and/or a better environment than engineering?",TicketPleasant8783,1,1.0,1,1695135374,2023-09-19 14:56:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16mt8qr/is_it_possible_to_move_from_engineering_to_a_more/,9,2023
16msu57,Suggest major degrees that have potential,"Context:

1. I'm very good at biology, chemistry, history (when it comes to logic and discussions) and languages (but I don't like chemistry, math and geography)

2. I'm very interested in dietology / nutrition and endocrinology.

3. I MUST be self employed or build a ""brand"" and work every day towards making it better, since I hate routines. Sitting st a desk doing the same exact thing every day is a no for me (like accountant for example) if it doesn't lead to something bigger in the end. When you work for someone else the growth is missing. 

4. I am very passionate about visual arts, I am not the best, because I've been suppressing it due to school. But it's pushing to get out and I know I can become better because I have it in me. 

5. I'm pretty good at nail art. 

6. It has to be a major, not bachelor. 

7. Of course pay is a factor.

8. I LOVE animals, but I don't think vet is for me. 

At first I thought about medicine, the specialize in dietology or endocrinology, but it's a very long and stressful way to go (around 10-12 years in my country, before I get to open my own office and start from there)... I would also have to leave my artistic side entirely, due to lack of time. I think I have some potential in law, however I stopped pursuing that a long time ago.

16mrn0f,Choosing whats right in times of uncertainty,"Did you ever feel as if you were going in circles in your life?

  
I have been living in Switzerland my whole life. In a bigger city with a lot of options. Sometimes it feels like to many of them.

  
Living at home at 27 because I have a good relationship with my parents and also pay them half of the rent to make sure things are even. 

  
Have worked a lot of different jobs ranging from office work, carpentry, nursing, and also teaching  
I did a year of Uni in Physical Therapy but I stopped it, because just like these jobs that I've been working I dont seem to see myself doing them for long enough that it makes sense to enter a 4 year degree in school just to get out of it and eventually regretting it somehow.

  
The thought of staying in my hometown for the next few years fills me with uncertainty, a feeling of missing out of whats out there. I have done some travelling for a few months at a time and always liked that, though i dont want travel to be some sort of escape mechanism for avoiding anything at home.

  
Somehow I feel like I've been brought up in a society where I'm feeling like a failure for not knowing where my next step is going to lead. Sometimes I feel like I've talked about this with friends so many times that they're starting to get annoyed by this mindset of mine. I know that something has to change but I just dont know where to start currently.  
I often think of  a live abroad meeting new cultures travelling through countries and living day by day, tho im not sure where this will lead me to in a few years.  

  
In contrast to that I have one of the most secure countries you can live in with so many opportunities to study or get into some kind of classical career.   
Its normal the feel like this at the end of your mid twenties I guess, when you look around at people buying apartments, houses or taking over enterprises. I know that I shouldnt compare...  
Something inside of me is yearning for a path that i can venture on to. A path that seems right for me and doesnt have to compare to what the world around me is doing.

16mq3oz,I got fired from my job. Am I doomed to be unemployed since it was with cause?,"So I'm a 34 year old male and yesterday I was fired. It was mostly for spending too much time in the restroom. I have  been recovering from a broken ankle for over three months and sometimes I have been in the restroom if things are painful or I'm just tired but I probably did stay in too long. The managers even said how long I spent in there over certain periods. 

So anyways, I politely just said that yes, it was due to me being tired and stressed but I also was in there on my phone, so I'm guessing that didn't help either. So I just accepted it, and walked out. I was even so darn polite that I didn't get upset. I just left, said thank you and that was it.

Anyways, my big fear is that since I was fired with cause, am I doomed to unemployment or underemployment? I've had this job for five years, had run ins where I thought I was a goner but had decent customer service reviews, and seemed to be fine, but I doubt that matters. 

Another wrinkle in this is that I've heard rumors that one of my department managers, who is quite difficult, has tried to get everyone in our department fired. Now she had no part in this meeting yesterday, and honestly, rumors abound in my workplace, but I wonder if maybe there is some truth to it, or if it was just a convenient time to drop the hammer. Not to mention I was in a boot the whole summer and it might have looked bad to fire an injured man (it was an out of work injury, so it wouldn't be suspicious to fire me then I guess, but still I wonder.) What makes it even stranger is that some people who have seemingly much worse issues haven't been let go (and again, seemingly) but most of them are part time where as I'm full time. 

So should I be worried? Do I basically just have to start at the bottom rung or worse, be confined to unemployment? It doesn't help that my anxiety is running rampant and of course, having just been diagnosed with ADHD again (long story short, was diagnosed as a kid, but went off meds in 6th grade, and did okay, but struggled in some areas after graduating college and in my professional life, so I went back to see if I needed help and looked into getting diagnosed again in the past two years) and that makes me feel even worse, because while I know to do better and have tried, I worry that given my work performance and disorders (which I never told any employer about), I'm just basically on the long term unemployment or underemployment train. 

So are there any suggestions or solutions to get a halfway decent job? Or do I just go back to the bottom, or just take unemployment ? My wife does well enough that we can be fine and we have one kid, but I'm just worried employers will see me as a loser and since it seems like employees can basically say whatever they want about former employees as long as its true, I truly worry I won't find any decent paying job, or any job except for bottom of the barrel ones for high school kids and adults with disabilities.

16mpeq6,"[Advice] Considering my Future Career, Should I Take the Offer?","So last year I worked in a machine learning team for a year at a multinational consultancy, the pay was great, the facility was good, I had full WFH allowance. This was my first data science work experience straight out of grad studies

After a year, I wanted to go back to school for PhD since I felt such a strong disconnect from my previous research and also I wanted focus my time for my family, we’ve been separated by covid for about two years (we live in different countries). As international travel became more lax last year, I didn’t really have much time for them as I was very much deep in my work, to the point that I didn’t take a single leave beside a medical emergency. 

So I decided to leave my position at the end of the year to focus on trying to get a scholarship and spend more time with my family when they get the chance to visit. Unfortunately none of the scholarships went through, but I feel much happier that I managed to spend time with the family, I think this paid off those quality time debts we got during covid.

During this gap year I tried to work on things I enjoy. I built up my portfolio and took on some freelance jobs but mostly lived from the money I made last year and thankfully up to this point I am still financially good, I still have majority of my savings and all. But I started job searching again a month ago, just so that this gap year wouldn’t extend beyond a single year.

Recently I got an offer for a data scientist position, this is at a local company, mid-size, mostly work on government projects and some international clients. So the pay is roughly around 50% of my previous pay, not as much WFH allowance and not as much facilities as before (e.g. health reimbursement). The pay isn’t actually that bad in comparison to the average wage in my local area, still roughly 4X the local average for an office job. I definitely could live with it and still have some savings left, but definitely not as much as before. 

I happen to be directly interviewed and offered by the CEO, I had the privilege of skipping the whole HR interview and tests. So to say the least I’ve negotiated with the top management. They said this was the best offer he could make under their current situation and from what I heard this already 1.5X of the pay for the same position in the company. The contract is for one year and pay can be negotiated when extended. 

I really need some input whether this is a worthwhile job to take now or should I keep going with the job search and wait it out for another couple of months. My main worry is that this will destroy any chance of me negotiating higher pay in the future.

For the last year and a half I've been working at this European tech company remotely and it's been quite a ride. 

So initially I was an outsourced employee until I was offeed the full-time position at the company. (Still working remotely) During the transition I was informed what my actual cost to company was. 

To put it in simple terms, the company had been paying 5000 to the outsource company and I only received 750. Afterwards I was offered  1500 and employed via an HR system, which took a slice of potential earnings(500). Now I have created my own company to invoice them directly and remove all parties taking a piece of my salary. We agreed to meet in the middle and make it beneficial to both parties and proceed with a new salary of 1750. (This all happened in the last 17 months)

I've received 2 promotions during this time but earn far less then then anyone in the company because of my location. I'm currently middle management and earn 3-5x less than my colleagues doing the same kind of work.

My question is - What should I do to ensure I get fair compensation and when can I approach them to increase my salary?

16mnkgu,Take job offer at place I interned or keep searching?,"To give some context, I am currently finishing my first internship that I started after graduating with my Master’s. The internship was for a 6 month period and I have about a month left. In the meantime I was looking for jobs elsewhere to prepare myself for when my time here was up. To be honest, the job market isn’t really favourable for my field currently.

The couple of applications I have put in, I didn’t even make it to the next round. Lots of people were applying for the positions I applied for and even though the description said no previous experience was needed, they eventually made a cut based on experience. Maybe I should lower my demands.

Now the place I interned at has offered me a position to stay in the team, the projects they work on are really interesting but I would be doing a purely administration job in an assistant role. If I’m being honest, I’m afraid I will be bored out by this job. The other con is that I would be ‘overqualified’ for this job based on my degree. This was also kind of the fear my boss had during the interview: he acknowledged my skills and lauded the work I have been doing during my internship, so he has a fear I wouldn’t be committed to stay in the coming years. On the other hand the working environment is great and I have a great connection with my colleagues. The organisation has a great reputation and I would be able to move up, although definitely not the first two years. I would also be able to work on my French with classes that are offered here since my organisation is bilingual, which would be a great asset for future opportunities.

My main concerns are being bored with this job, since it would be less interesting than what I did during my internship, and not learning the right skills that I would like to learn for future jobs.

16mm8h4,Is my resume so bad?,"6 months ago, I left my remote job at a Finnish company as a frontend developer. It was full-remote, or at least 90% remote, and I had to go to the office only in sporadic cases, but I couldn't handle it anymore. I was highly regarded by my colleagues, mind you, but the project was really poorly executed, and rewriting it from scratch was impossible (I asked), at least not immediately.  
  
My days consisted of 8 hours of bug fixing, based on randomly opened tickets, so sometimes the issue had already been resolved, but because there were 10 tickets related to the same problem, it hadn't been closed. So, very often, I would spend 2 hours investigating only to discover that it had already been fixed. But okay, I'm digressing.  
  
Since then, I've been looking for a job. I've never struggled this much, even though I believe I have the experience. It's not that I don't make it through some interview stages, but I get rejected outright without even having the screening interview.  
  
So, I wonder, is there something wrong with my resume? I've always thought that a CV should be clear and concise, without any frills, so I made it as straightforward as possible.

16mk8ci,What should I chase as my career?,"I am an 18 year old high school student from Croatia, currently I am in the last year of high school and my current profession or not sure what I should call it would be ""Mechanical computer technician"" and to be frank with you I am not super interested in it and this is literally year 4 of high school which just makes me lose my mind.

I find school to be super frustrating, but the funny thing is that I actually still have great grades and have considered going to college after school, but I chose web development as my main option.

My real question is if web dev is even worth it right now, I have some experience in JS, HTML and CSS, I can make simple sites myself, never really got around to actually learning React or any other framework, tried learning a bit of React, but got lost and decided to quit because school was bugging me and still is right now.

In my opinion I think that I have way too little experience in both my profession and web dev and so I am scared of what's going to come after school, because I really do not feel like working 9-5 jobs to barely survive each month

My profession is mostly based around CNC  machinery and I have considered learning more about it, but I don't really feel like leaving the country, especially not going to Germany because I don't know German anywhere near enough.

16mk6n0,Getting layered at my job just before maternity leave.,"
I have been with my company for 5 years as an in-house attorney. I started my career as the lone (internal) legal person--the other legal person being an outside GC. I grew my role tremendously, dipping into areas the company has never considered to manage in-house (trademarks, patents, how these relate to product development and marketing, etc.) and was soon named compliance counsel. 2.5 years later I got a job offer with a well-known global conglomerate, but turned it down after talking to my boss, the COO.  Reporting structure here is odd. I technically report to the COO but the outside GC really functions as my regular contact and superior. Because he is not technically a company employee, this is a bit strange. Anyway, when I brought up the job offer, the COO asked many questions. My chief complaint was lack of clarity in growth/upward mobility. What is up? Who is invested in my development? Because it felt like no one. They created a sample org chart for the department to show me what ""up"" means, and promoted me to Senior Corporate Counsel. Another year passes and some major changes have come up in the company. GC tells me i am the future of the legal department and he wants to give me more leadership opportunities. I agree to this, but these opportunities do not present themselves. Aside from me generally taking more responsibility, bigger and more projects, things stay relatively the same. I announce i am pregnant and GC says this is a good time to add to our already over worked legal team. They did this the last time i was pregnant and went on leave where they hired under me, but note that we all report to the COO/GC. This time GC says to me privately and to our greater group that it ""might"" be someone a little more senior to me and we could use someone that knows how to really build a compliance program etc. I'd like to be clear that I am currently the most senior person on the team, the highest performing, and the most trusted. This is both said and demonstrated, often. Anyway, the job description was released today (no one notified my legal team. Someone found it and showed me) and the job posting is for a Deputy General Counsel role .. description covering compliance (my area). This is TWO rungs above my current title. This feels incredibly dishonest and the timing is especially ugly. That my maternity leave was the catalyst for this search that ended up in layering above me (although i may still be reporting to the GC--this is unclear) feels almost punitive. Am I justified in feeling this way? Any suggestions on how to manage this? I am feeling so deeply offended by the series of events that I'm not sure i care to give these people my time and energy... but i have a family and obligations. Logically, i can understand and respect the need for this role, but the entire process feels so dishonest. I feel the promises are empty and discussing leadership growth with me only to turn around and look for someone 2 steps above me (in the org chart created BECAUSE of me) is just sooo dirty.

I ended up 15 minutes late due to construction traffic (I did call), my GPS led me the wrong way in where i was behind slow semis 🥲. 

Fortunately I get there, I profusely apologize and explain myself. She seemed nice about it. She literally only asked me like 3 questions and just kept talking about what the job consists of, the schedule and asking me if i’m okay with it. She seemed to like my responses and she was telling she used to work at my current job 20 years back.  She told me she cut a lot on working since she had small children to attend to back in the day. The interview went longer than it was said and I was already getting anxiety cause I had to pick up my son from school. I had to excuse myself to send a quick text to my mom to pick up my son cause there was no way I was going to make it across town to pick up my son. I explained that to her too. 

Then on the way out as she was still talking the teacher called me telling me where i was cause no one was there to pick up my son. Had to excuse myself. Y’all I was so embarrassed. She told me the hiring specialist will be in touch with me.

16mj0r9,Physiotherapist career change options?,"I'm a 30-year old senior physiotherapist working in private practice in Melbourne, Australia. Currently earning an annual salary of approx $100-115k (AUD). I hold a doctor of physiotherapy and a bachelor of biomedical science degree, which I've worked hard for over the years.

Whilst the salary I'm currently making is considered decent, I'm admittedly falling out of love with my profession - primarily due to the income ceiling attached to the job and the emotional toll the job can have on professionals (challenging compensable clients, working long and late hours necessary to make adequate commisionable billings, non-billed tasks i.e letters, phone calls). I absolutely love the team I work with, however feel as though my clinical time is coming to an end in the next 12-24 months.

My biggest assets are my communication skills, leadership, work ethic and my interpersonal skills/ability to form strong relationships with clients. I love the idea of taking these skills into another appropriate industry and generating a larger income.

Whilst I've already begun researching some career pathways that will enable me to grow my current income, I'd love to hear suggestions from people in similar fields/with similar experiences and what/if any additional training would be required to make that transition successfully.

TL;DR: I'm a physio looking to make a career progression into a non-clinical area (?corporate) to generate a larger income (ballpark of 130-150k+ as a starting point) - what areas do you believe someone in this situation could also be successful in applying and transitioning into?

16mi2fp,Need Advice on Career Progression and Deciding on an Offer,"Sorry for using throwaway.

So last year I worked in an machine learning team for a year at a multinational consultancy, the pay was great, the facility was good, I had full WFH allowance. This was my first data science work experience straight out of grad studies.

But I wanted to go back to school and also focus my time for my family, we’ve been separated by covid for about two years (we live in different countries). As international travel became more lax last year, didn’t really have much time for them whenever they came to visit me as I was working. 

So I decided to leave my position at the end of the year to focus on trying to get a scholarship and spend more time with my family when they get the chance to visit. Alas none of the scholarships went through but I feel much happier that I managed to spend quality time with the family.

During this gap year I tried to work on things I enjoy. I built up my portfolio and took on some freelance jobs but mostly lived from the money I made last year and thankfully up to this point I am still financially good, I still have majority of my savings and all. But I started job searching again a month ago, just so that this gap year wouldn’t extend beyond a single year.

Recently I got an offer for a data scientist position, this is at a local company, mid-size, mostly work on government projects and some international clients. So the pay is roughly around 50% of my previous pay, not as much WFH allowance and not as much facilities as before (e.g. health reimbursement). The pay isn’t actually that bad in comparison to the average wage in my local area, still roughly 4X the local average for an office job. I definitely could live with it and still have some savings left, but definitely not as much as before. I happened to be directly interviewed and offered by the CEO, I had the privilege of skipping the whole HR interview and tests. They said this was the best offer he could make under their current situation and from what I heard this already 1.5X of the pay for the same position in the company. The contract is for one year and pay can be negotiated when extended. 

I really need some input whether this is a worthwhile job to take now or should I keep going with the job search and wait it out for another couple of months. My main worry is that this will destroy any chance of me negotiating higher pay in the future.

HR seems like a safer option because of my business degree. A masters in hr or a graduate certificate in hr will help pave the way.
However, I've also come across a mental health and addiction certificate program that could eventually lead to a master's in social work.

16mh0hw,Am I paranoid?,"I have worked for this company for 3 years in the IT department.

Just before I started we were bought by an international company.  Overall the move has been good, they are investing capital and you can see positive change.

However the president micro manages everything.
There has been a lot of people let go over the last 18 months from all corners of the company. Some positions have been replaced some have not.

Our small department has not been touched.
However I believe that out boss was going to be let go. She sensed it coming and found a different job and quit before the axe could fall.

Her and I worked at the same place previously and started at the same time, so there is a link between us.

Through a neutral party we heard that the president thinks that we could be doing more as a department. This is why I think my boss was going to be let go. 

Now my paranoia. I have a sense that because I am linked to the boss, that I will be next. 

As 2nd in seniority, I have stepped up in her absence and been the interim manager as well as doing my job. I’ve asked to be considered for the manager job and they said no without consideration. We are hiring another technician, which I helped interview, this person will be at my level, but I have to keep prompting HR for info like start date, etc… also the president also insisted on interviewing this person, which seemed odd for a non management position.

It all just seems a little off, and a lot of small things seem to add up to me being in the presidents bad books and I’m on the way out.

16mev7b,When is it acceptable to ask for a raise?,"Before I go into all the details, basically my question is, when is a good time to ask for a raise? Is it even acceptable to ask for a raise when you’ve only been with the company for 6 months?

Here’s the back story. I am a 27 year old woman that spent all of my 20s as either a stay at home mom or working for a family member. My kids are 4, 4, and 1.5 years old (+ a bonus daughter who is now in middle school. My husband has 50/50 custody with her mother) so they’re all in daycare at this time. I started a new job at a corporate office in February of this year making $17.50 an hour. I got pretty lucky because I was hired on in a position that is not typically entry level. My last job was at my kid’s daycare making $14 an hour, so $17.50 sounded like a dream. I had to leave the daycare job when I gave birth to my youngest and I stayed home with him until he was old enough to go to that daycare which is when I started my corporate job. All three of my kids went to that daycare FOR FREE because a family member was the director. 

Since I started my job in February and all the way up until about a month ago, it finally seemed like my husband and I were digging ourselves out of debt. We finally built up a decent sized savings. We were able to pay bills on time, go to the grocery store whenever we wanted without a second thought, and take our kids to do fun things over the weekend like the zoo or a movie. Well, like everything good in the world, it all came crashing down. We found out on a random Friday morning that the daycare was shutting down indefinitely the following Wednesday due to the owner’s health. Our family member, who was the director of the daycare, found a new childcare center and thankfully they had spots open for all three of my children.. but the tuition is 50%. I’m not trying to sound like I’m complaining because I’m extremely grateful that we even get the discount at all because it’s not an immediate family member.. but going from $0 a month for childcare to suddenly $1,800 a month in childcare has literally just put us right back where we were in terms of debt. I get paid bi-weekly and at this point, both of my checks plus some go to daycare. The only thing really making this job worth it at this point is the benefits and the general fact that I enjoy my job and my coworkers. 

Now for another important piece of information. I mentioned that I was hired in a position that isn’t typically entry level. Therefore there are still some things that I haven’t been trained on yet that someone in my position is usually responsible for. I am proficient in the other aspects of my job that I obviously have been trained on. My boss tells me pretty often how proud they are of me and reassures me that I’m doing great. So, is it too soon for me to ask my manager for a raise? I obviously don’t know the etiquette so if I was to ask, how large of a raise do I ask for? I’m thinking even $1 an hour would be helpful but I just don’t know.

Any tips/advice are welcome!",bestgirl314,2,0.6700000166893005,15,1695090452,2023-09-19 02:27:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16mev7b/when_is_it_acceptable_to_ask_for_a_raise/,9,2023

16mdqi9,Corruption,"I started working for my local municipality about a year ago, in the Animal shelter. I was told that by august/September I would be promoted to an official job with full time hours, benefits and a livable wage. I am extremely qualified for the job. I have a lot of experience with animals. I’m not super young but in my 30s and I’m in excellent physical condition. 

 There is a woman who is 55 that started after me. She was immediately given my promised promotion. She couldn’t be a worse choice for the position.

 She is extremely out of shape, borderline obese and I say this because chasing after runaway dogs and wildlife is the job. She has never worked with animals before, and has a terrible attitude.  She’s lazy.  And she’s an alcoholic. She’s gotten in trouble several times with hr in the few short months she’s been there for harassment and putting dog feces on someone else.

She brags that her boyfriend got her the job.  She is dating a former state trooper who is friends with the business administrator of our town. The administrator is being sued for misconduct and hate speech by a former employee. 

She was successful in getting the person who held the job before her fired, by way of using this friend in administration. She wanted the job, it wasn’t available and had her friend make it so. Then instead of it going to me, as it was supposed to, she made it so it went to her. And now rumor has it that since she ALMOST got in official trouble with hr, that she’s scared for her position and she has it set in her mind that I’m the potential replacement if she messes up again. I noticed that  she’s monitering me heavily and I’m told making rash statements to her friend in the admin position.  I believe she wants me gone so they have no one to take the job if she messes up again. They’re less likely to let her go if there’s no one viable to replace her. 

Is there anything I can do to prevent her from trying to get me fired? I’m getting paid much less and part time and she’s starting to harass and bully me. I started an hR claim but I was asked by admin assistants to drop it. Should I ? Is it legal for her to be given this preferential job placement without relevant experience or qualifications?

The older I get the more I am realizing my relationships and mental & physical well-being are much more important to me than money or a job. My only form of education is a high school diploma and some certs related to the trades. I have looked at google career certs but haven't heard great things about them from what I've found online. I suppose I'm mostly curious about good careers to switch to? Maybe someone here was in a similar situation? Maybe some useful certifications that don't take years to get that I could acquire in another field that would land me an good entry level job? I'm not completely opposed to going to college, but I'm not sure I can do what I'm doing now for that much longer until I would graduate. I would love something remote so I could spend more time with my wife, but I understand remote jobs/careers are very competitive. 

Also, I'm not overly concerned with an initial paycut in changing careers, as long as I have the ability to work my way up over the years. Anything that starts \~$50k/year is fine. My interests are pretty broad, but if I had to pick a few it would be sports, math, technology, movies. I should also note, I'm very much an introvert.

16m9o1f,How to Explain a Difficult Job Departure and Find a New Job: Seeking Expert Advice!,"  
I quit my job in April and I’m having a very difficult time finding a new job and answering employer's question of why I left my last job.  
For some background,  I worked at my last company for 1 year and 5 months. It was primarily remote, and I never felt like I was a part of the team. I got the vibe that my manager never managed anyone before. I was his only direct report. He was very anti-social and we never chatted or got to know each other. I felt alone most of the time especially since it was remote. My manager never gave me any feedback and I always questioned if I was doing a good job or if he liked me. I also felt that I wasn’t growing my professional skills in communication by working under him. I never felt like I was a part of the team and felt very isolated.   
Fast forward, I got sick and needed to take off a week to recover. When I got back, my manager informed me that I would need to get cleared by occupational health to return to work. I felt like he was forcing me out and I overreacted and put in my two weeks because I was very upset. I was already very unhappy with him, not having many connections at the company and questioning if they wanted me there, so I quit without thinking about it much. It’s been 5 months now and I'm still unemployed.   
I'm terrified of answering the question of why I left my last job and I feel like my answer to this question is the reason why I have not received a new job offer yet. I feel like no one wants to give me another chance because they don’t know if I will quit my next role. Here is the explanation that I have been giving employers for why I quit my last job. Please help!  
“It wasn’t a good fit. There were few opportunities for me to communicate and collaborate with others and I felt I wasn’t growing my communication skills, something I value for my career growth.”  
I feel like recruiters can tell that I’m hiding something. That something is, I hated my last job, as manager, and didn’t connect with anyone at the company so I quit. I really don’t want to lie when they ask this question but I feel like no one will give me a chance. Corporate is so unforgiving ☹

16m8xg7,"Feeling Hopeless at 20: Shut Out from University, Dreams Shattered","At 20 years old , I find myself trapped in a seemingly endless cycle of disappointment and hopelessness due to my high school grades.

Despite my dreams of pursuing a degree in Computer Science, the reality is harsh—I can't even secure admission into any university due to my poor high school grades. It's a crushing blow that has left me feeling defeated and lost.

I know education is vital for my future, and I'm eager to prove myself in the field of Computer Science. But my past academic struggles have become a roadblock that seems insurmountable at times.

I'm reaching out to this community in search of advice, guidance, or maybe hope. Has anyone faced a similar situation and managed to turn things around? How did you cope with the frustration and despair?

16m80vg,Feeling guilty every time using sick hours,"Pretty much the title. I feel guilty every time I use my sick hours. I don't get sick often,  but last night/early this morning I'd woken up at 4 a.m. with some stomach issues that made it so I couldn't fall back asleep. Come to about 6:30 a.m., I decided it would be best if I asked to take a sick day considering I would not be 100% at work due to lack of sleep, even though the stomach problem had passed. My boss is always understanding, and I haven't used sick hours for anything but doctors appointments in many months, probably since April. I even did some work from home after I rested up a bit, but I ended up feeling overly guilty for even using the sick hours I had earned (I have 86 hours purely to be used in 'sick hours' so there isn't any issue with not having enough time). I just always get into my own head, telling myself that I wasn't actually sick so I don't deserve to use that time, feel guilty over not showing face at the office when I was obviously well enough to do work from home, yada yada. I also had a really fun but busy and hectic weekend, and felt like today would be a good day to get stuff done around the house since I didn't have time to over the weekend, but I even feel guilty for doing that because it's not spending my time being 'sick.' Has anyone else ever used sick days this way? How do you get over the guilty feeling? It's been bogging me down all day, and although it's already 5:30 p.m. I want to reset my mindset for the day and at least be happy I was able to take the time for myself, but my guilt just overwhelms me, and I truly don't even understand why.",1999rc,9,0.8500000238418579,19,1695072726,2023-09-18 21:32:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16m80vg/feeling_guilty_every_time_using_sick_hours/,9,2023
16m7k95,Getting Out of IT HELP.,"I've been in IT for about 6 years. I thought I'd enjoy being developer so I put a lot of effort in to my work. I eventually moved to managing IT projects.  

I've come to terms that management isn't for me and IT is a soul sucking industry. They want you available 25/8 and the higher up you get the higher that expectation is. Understandably, but its not for me. 

I'm in between jobs and found a tech support job that I thought would be good and less demanding while I worked on a side gig. 

Well much like IT is, of course this has snow balled in to pretty much project managing again. Which was not what was described. 

How can I explain this to my boss without getting fired? I thought about asking for another position but I don't want to come off ungrateful. 

On another note, has anyone else got stuck in this loop? It's so frustrating because how am I supposed to get experience doing anything else when all my experience is IT??

16m7agv,Would you keep the job with the long commute..?,"I work in the medical field. I have the option to start another job that is 2 miles from my house. This job would be close to the same income as my current job but the potential to make more. This job may be bit busier than my current job. I would work 4 days a week 10 hour shifts, rotating biweekly weekend (this counts towards my 4 days) and holidays. The health insurance package isn’t as attractive as my former job. I’ve gotten information that this job is flexible, could possibly do 3 12’s instead of the 4 10’s. Can practically choose my hours too. Start as early, or end as late as I’d like. This job also has 2 weeks paid vacation. However, no sick bank - can only use pto. 

My current job has a long commute of 50 miles, 60 minute commute (each way) 5 days a week.

1. I do like my job. It’s pretty low stress. I like my coworkers too. 
2. It’s a flexible job. Boss is understandable. Typically I leave home at about 5:50 am and back home around 4:30-5:00pm. 
3. Health insurance is great. Benefits are good. 11 paid holidays. Paid sick bank (8 days a year). 10 days (~ 2 weeks) paid vacation. 2 paid personal days a year. No weekends. It all rolls over to the next year if you don’t use it. 

Moving closer is not an option. I’ve also had a different job closer to home before and I hated the job, the whole environment was toxic which is why I am currently at my commuter job. But now another opportunity closer to home has came. 

What do you all think I should do? Stay where I’m at or take the new job closer to home?

16m74a8,Bad experience at past employer,"Hello, I am fairly new to Reddit so I will try to keep this brief and concise.  


I had a really bad experience with a past employer, especially toward the end of the working relationship. During interviews, I have mentioned something along the lines of ""The company's culture contradicted my personal morals, and some of the business expectations did not sit right with me on a personal level"" when asked why I left that position/place of employment. I have recently gotten feedback, from a multi-part interview where I felt like a strong candidate, that the biggest issue they had with me during the interview process was the negative relationship with a past employer and that it was a bit of a ""red flag"" for the company I was currently interviewing with.  


I know this is the case because my buddy currently works at this company and I got fairly far along in the interview process off the back of his recommendation. After speaking with HR and the hiring manager, he told me they deemed that a ""red flag"" and chose to go with someone else for the position instead.  


**For the future, what is a better way to phrase it or spin a bad working experience in a positive light?** I am not particularly interested in speaking about why I had such a bad takeaway from the previous position, just want to sharpen my interview skills so that this is not a reason for being passed up as a candidate again. I'm sure there are other ways I could have given a better interview, but my friend is claiming that is the biggest feedback that he received regarding why they chose to not continue with me.  


Any advice or input on this is much appreciated!",_Cxdy_s,2,1.0,5,1695070664,2023-09-18 20:57:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16m74a8/bad_experience_at_past_employer/,9,2023

16m6m00,AI - Job goes Bye bye?,"Posts like this have been submitted in multitude and increased since ChatGPT blew up. However, my question is more specific to Government Contracting. 

A company is researching AI proposal development software, as an employee who is a proposal writer, how could they even compete with the auto generation of proposal templates, draft content, and even pricing/staffing tools?

How concerned should one be for their job and what would be the next step for their career? 

I understand that the evolution of technology is something to embrace and part of our world becoming more productive yada yada and it will change how some jobs function while not being entirely replaced. However teams are likely to downsize or shift salary due to the necessity for the positions or the required hours to perform those jobs.

I fear that as a proposal writer, I could be mostly or entirely replaced. Or any team I’m on could be dramatically reduced in size with many of us being let go. This also feeds into my fear about affording a home as a millennial with student debt and my salary being impacted or being laid off by another corporation.

So what is a person to do? How do you approach securing the future of your career? I’d seek a more technical degree in another field but I had to drop out of my classes due to the nature and requirements of my jobs. 

What are your thoughts on this? How concerned do you feel if you are a proposal writer or have a job that is heavily being automated.

I wonder if I’m the only one starting to have an existential crisis or maybe I’m wrong and just anxious about it.",ContributionOne1099,1,1.0,4,1695069475,2023-09-18 20:37:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16m6m00/ai_job_goes_bye_bye/,9,2023

One worker quit for a new job over a month ago, and now another is quitting this week for a new job as well. The issue is our General Manager, who is skipping out on 80% of his job duties. A few years ago, the company got rid of outside sales reps and turned those duties to the general managers in order to increase sales numbers while lowering costs. My GM isn’t doing this at all, so it’s hurting my paycheck and the branch.

16m5c4m,Leaving a job after a referral?,"I’m curious on people’s opinions of this scenario.

I was laid off back in early May and recently got a new job. I’m just starting week 4 today. 

I had an acquaintance who gave me a referral that gave me a boost in the interview process. I wouldn’t consider us close friends or anything. I know him because we were both leaders in a volunteer organization and met through that. 

The kicker is that he had just recently left this company a short time before I got the referral from him. 

I am truly grateful for this referral and his help, but I’m not crazy about this job or company so far. It’s not terrible, I’m just not thrilled to be here so far. The culture leaves a lot to be desired. Honestly, it makes me sad that I lost my last job and the culture that was there. Other factors are that the insurance isn’t that great and I’m also considering a career transition out of marketing. 

I plan to stick it out for a little while because I need to support my family, but I don’t envision this is a long term place to be.

I’ve done good work and continued to show my growth by Y1 was a lot of training so the annual raise they gave me was ~2%. Y2 they trained me on more product and I ended up being one of two on my team that know the product. I asked for a raise again after I turned around an uphappy VIP customer. I was working closely with my bosses boss on this.  My direct boss said to wait until the annual review again for a raise and even said he’d talk to his boss about it. 

Got an offer at another company for a 15k increase. I told my company it was 20k though. I put in my resignation and of course my bosses boss initially offered me a 10k increase. After the second time I said I’d think about it but today he called again to see if I’ve decided. I told him I was going to continue with the new company and he countered again with 15k. Of course he’s telling me he sees a future at the company for me and he’d put me on a manager track. 

Now the salary they’re offering me for my position within this company is unheard of. Some of the guys that have been here 10-20 yrs were making maybe close to what I got hired on at. 

I’m mostly leaning towards leaving but then the idea of having to build up a rep at another company is off putting but doable.

16m4a80,Volunteer Position at Lab ?,"Hi all,

I need advice please. I just graduated with a Beng in mechanical engineering and did coop with a company during my studies for 16 months. 


I travelled after I graduated but the coop company wanted me for a position they had open, I interviewed, but wasn’t selected because I could only start once I got back from travelling and they needed someone right away. They said they really want me, and that they’re working on opening a position for me in September/ October but that funding has been hard to secure. So I have been actively looking for jobs elsewhere. 

I got an email from one of the post docs that works at the company and that took over the project I was working on after I left my coop position. They are asking if I want to volunteer for their lab (they are working with a prof that I was close with) because the company won’t have a position for me in 2023(but that a position may open up in 2024)  and the prof also can’t get me funding. So they’re asking me to volunteer without pay, but telling me that it would benefit me for my resume and for a publication. 

Should I volunteer? I’m currently unemployed but looking every day. A little voice in my head is telling me that I’m pretty much being disrespected, but I don’t know what I should do or think about this. What do I even reply if I don’t want to volunteer? I don’t want to look bad in front of my Prof and my previous company.

16m1zqu,Stuck in analysis paralysis for my next career move,"Hi all, I’m in a bit of a pickle and would appreciate some advice. 

31 year old - 10 YoE in Cyber Security (Engineering, Architecture, Resilience and GRC)

I work for a big international Bank atm, based in Poland. I have a  Band 5 VP of Resilience and Architecture role (usual inflated bank title, in reality I’m a security flavored GRC architect in charge of resilience projects). The organization is very slow, stakeholder management is terrible and PowerPoint/Excel is your main weapon of choice. People tend to be very adverse to change, and even obvious issues are called out as “caveats” and never fixed - working in security and risk management, this gets really frustrating, really fast. 

My manager (Band 4) left after 2 years, out of frustration for the reasons above. I have been covering the role for the last 2 months without any official role announcement, reporting into a Band 3. It was made clear that I would NOT receive my ex managers band 4, or salary ( I was actually indirectly called naïve for asking).
I am expected tho to cover the responsibilities, and the “plan” is to give me a half grade upgrade and a 5-10% increase next year (in the normal cycle) .

Current pay - 4000 euros net (top of the range for my current band) + 15-20% yearly bonus

Options are:
1. Stay in Poland in the Bank, follow the natural course (5-10% increase in April next year), unclear progression path, but generally chill BAU work.

2. Move to Malaysia with the Bank, same as above but increase would be 15% and cost of life is -30% compared to Poland.

3. Move to Prague(CZ) into my old managers new team into Pharma, doing the same that I’m doing in the Bank but greenfield (new department post-split), 30-50% increase, company car, 20% bonus but cost of living goes up 30%

16m0im5,Deciding between 2 Job Offers - Help!,"After a dead summer interviews have been super busy and I managed to get 2 job offers in one day. Both would like an answer from me by Tuesday. However I can’t decide between these 2 and looking for advice. For background I’m a project manager with 8 years of experience in SaaS tech, mostly startup environments. For context, I live in NYC metro area with $2450 rent as largest expense. 

Job 1 - Ad Agency 
- Pay: 115,000
- Time Off: 15 days vacation; 10 Sick; 3 Personal
- Commute: Hybrid commute into Manhattan (about 3 hours round trip commute time)
- 401k: 33% match up to 5% employee contribution 
- Growth opportunity?: Large, very established company with little opportunity for growth 

Job 2 - Established Tech Startup 
- Pay: 85,000
- Time Off: Unlimited PTO 
- Commute: None (Remote)
- 401k: Employee contribution only 
- Growth Opportunity: Huge opportunity to move up here, possibly make more. Would be one of less than a handful of project managers. 

The pay for Job 1 seems to be a no brainer, but the commute, lack of growth opportunities and type of work isn’t really very interesting to me. 

The pay for job 2 is undershooting my happy medium of 100k. I plan to negotiate but the job posting had 90k at top of range. 

My heart likes job 2 the most and has more opportunities for me, but job 1 would be guaranteed work life balance and the extra pay could help me pay off remaining 6k of cc debt.

16m08o8,What is the best move for a no work experience grad?,"So I am a bit lost and really just looking for some general advice.  
  
I’m 27 and hold a Master of Finance, Bachelor of Laws, and a Bachelor of Commerce (marketing and business law).   
  
I ended up doing 2 low tier internships (one in marketing one in family law), and then attempted to take the entrepreneurial route. Only one of my ideas came to fruition and in reality, I’m not sure I’m going to be able to grow it to a point where it can be a life long thing.  
  
So here I am looking to move back into a more traditional career but I’m not really sure where to begin or how competitive I might be. I plan on either taking the legal or finance path, but am curious as to how competitive someone like me with no real work experience is and what realistic goals might be.  
  
  
  
Currently i am guessing i just have to get to it and start applying to graduate level jobs in either law or finance and hope my age is not an issue.

Two years ago, I moved to the U.S. after earning my bachelor's degree in business in my home country. I ventured into HR, and now I'm working on my SHRM certification and a human capital certificate from NYU. 

Here's the twist: I've been offered the chance to pursue another bachelor's degree here, and I'm torn between two paths: HR or data analytics. The HR major covers a lot of what I've already studied, so it feels like a bit of a redo. On the other hand, everyone's saying data analytics is the future, even in HR. But is it really? Is it worth going in that direction?

16lzfty,"I am not a job hopper, but starting to feel like maybe I'm afraid to go back to work","There's two parts to this. First, how do I present my resume better given the fact I've had ten different jobs? I used to put my career history after my skills, but I got some recommendations not to do that as hiring managers want to know the most current skills first. I'm in IT and my reverse job history goes like this:

* 1.5 years, working for a service company, my client started losing money and cut jobs for me and others.
* 2 years, working for a service company and the client started losing money due to covid and cut back on funding to my employer, so they laid off staff across the country.
* 2 years, job requirements changed and travel increased. I wasn't able to travel for a short time due to health issues and got fired. (I was already job hunting at the time.)
* 4 years, company went bankrupt
* 4 years, company said there wasn't enough work and since it was union, they had to keep the senior person. (Inside story I got was they had to cut my position to hire someone else in the department for a job requiring different skill set)
* 1.5 years, company had no structured IT and I was hired to be the IT manager. Employees didn't like the changes, despite my getting buy in from the owner, so they let me go rather than bother their ""superstars"". Never replaced the position that I am aware.

Before this was 6 years and 9 years respectively, so not really ""short term"" there. Which brings me to my second question, I've been looking for work for about 5 months now and I'm starting to worry that I'm forgetting some of the skills. That and with the anxiety about being blindsided again, I'm having trouble dealing with the tough questions in the interviews, especially the technical ones.

I’ve worked sooo hard and put so much time into my job. I genuinely love it and have learned so much. But I do think I at the very least deserve a promotion to Senior Manager and a raise. Especially since some of the new responsibilities were things given to my role that wouldn’t of fell under the director role.

Lets start by saying that I am loyal to my CEO. Our relationship is very good. He asks I deliver. 
I am not in a mid manager role in any way or form although I have been a Director before. I am filling trapped in this burning limbo where if there is something to be done particularly at the comercial level I am been called to do the job particularly with new product lines. 
Apparently I am good a creating and opening new relationships. Maybe I am selling my self short or my loyalty to the CEO is such that I feel that if I move to another company I will disappoint. I

 know what you guys are going to say: Do what is right for you and your family. Yes, I agree with that statement. However, I have an excellent relationship with him. 

I know that with my 20+years if experience I can continue my career elsewhere. But when and where do I draw the line ? I have always been taken care off so I feel very blessed but sometimes I feel that there is a glass sealing. Everyone in the organization knows me. That is great but maybe because I am very good at what I do I am not being taken into consideration. 

The company keeps hiring outside people while hardly promoting from within specially in comercial roles. When they bring someone to take. Comercial director role it is pathetic the level or comercial experience these people have.

Hey everyone,

I've got a big career decision to make, and I could use some help. I'm currently working as an HR in Talent Acquisition, and I recently graduated in HRM. I've done a couple of HR internships with some well-known companies, and I'm pretty comfortable where I am.

But the thing is that I've got this job offer on the table for a **""Global Admissions Executive""** position with double the pay. It's in a different field altogether. I'm not too concerned about the relocation because I've got friends willing to share rent and some buddies already working at the company, which is a huge plus.

My main worry is whether I should take this leap from HR to a completely different role and if it's easy to get back into HR with the same pay if I find out it's not my thing. I'd also love to know what my career path might look like if I decide to go for it. Here are some specific questions that are bugging me:

Career Path: Will it be tough to jump back into HR if I try the Global Admissions Executive role and change my mind!

Career Progression: What can I expect in terms of career progression if I take this job? How does it compare to HR?

 I'm not too worried about the relocation aspect since I've got that covered. My main concern is ensuring I make the right choice for my long-term career. So, if anyone has any experiences or insights to share, I'm all ears. Thanks for helping me navigate this big decision!

The four years of university was a depressive slump. I really hated it but I powered through. I thought that with enough time things would get better and at least at the end I would have the degree and I could do what I want after.

Once graduation came my country was in a recession. That time I got an excellent job offer from one of the best companies in my country. I thought well I’ve already worked so hard for the degree I might as well earn a little from it.

Life files by quickly. I’ve now been working for five years and while things are indeed better than the depressing state that was university I find my self dreading 25 more years of working this career.

I still do not ever feel excited to go to work to make a contribution. At work when there are problems all I can think about is that I hate this and do not care about any of it.

I’m now married with house installments and car loans and I feel trapped looking down a lifetime of spending all day doing something that makes me miserable.

16lq7xs,"23, no degree, never had a job, what are my options?","I started going to university in 2019 and dropped out due to mental health issues. I've been struggling with mental health severely ever since, been on Universal Credit since 2020. I'm done feeling like a pathetic burden on my family and I want to start trying to venture out and see if I can start trying to become a normal human being again. I love the idea of a job but absolutely hate interviews because of my severe anxiety, and if it wasn't for interviews, I probably would have gotten a job already.

I was just wondering if anyone has any advice or options that would be best for me going forward to try and reclaim my life and not be so far behind everyone else my age, as I feel like everyone else is far more capable than me of getting a job so my chances are not very high.

16lq3pf,Seeking Advice: Leveraging Work Experience in Pursuit of a Master’s in Construction Management,"I find myself in a difficult position as I try to realize my goal of pursuing a Master’s in Construction Management abroad. I graduated with a B.Arch in 2019, holding a GPA of 60%. Despite my low GPA, I have never stopped working towards building a robust profile to fulfill my ambition of studying abroad, preferably in Australia or Canada.

In addition to learning various programs like Grasshopper, BIM, and Oracle Primavera through self-study and completing Construction Management courses on Udemy, I have continuously worked full-time as an architect while also handling construction management responsibilities on the side. This work experience spans the entire period since my graduation, summing up to a rich five-year tenure of gaining practical skills and insights into the industry.

Yet, the journey has been anything but smooth. Over the last two years, my attempts to secure an admission have been met with rejections, possibly due to my GPA and the time elapsed since my graduation. The rejections have not deterred me; I remain resolute to transition into a full-time role in construction management and seek growth opportunities that moving abroad can offer.

As I am gearing up to give this another shot, I am battling a few roadblocks:

	1.	Identifying universities that may be receptive to applicants with a lower GPA but rich work experience - any suggestions would be welcome.
	2.	Crafting a compelling narrative to showcase my personal and professional growth since graduation, underscoring my learnings and contributions in the professional sphere. Any tips on how to go about this?
	3.	Navigating the challenge of obtaining reference letters, a task made difficult given the gap in my education and my hesitation stemming from the GPA score. How do I approach potential referees, and what can I do to bolster my request?

I am here seeking your advice, encouragement, and any resources you think might aid me in this endeavor. The path has been long and challenging, but I am determined to forge ahead, with hopes of finally achieving my dream.

Thank you for reading, and I eagerly await any guidance this community can offer.",Pure-Armadillo-7800,2,1.0,1,1695026930,2023-09-18 08:48:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16lq3pf/seeking_advice_leveraging_work_experience_in/,9,2023

16lpbyz,Need some advice regarding my current situation.,"I'm a 2023 btech graduate from India. I'm jobless rn looking hard for jobs but getting rejection from everywhere. My skill sets are HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, PHP, C++.
so Recently I talked to one of my senior from my school, and she currently works in a MNC as a senior developer. so I asked her for guidance she offered me she would teach me MERN stack and she would charge a total of ₹10k. So I said okay it sounds a good deal to me. although she first came to me saying she needs money for renovating her house that's why ask her to teach me instead so the both of us could help each other.
So now it's been like 15 days of the course and now she yells at me for every single thing. like for the timing issue I used to be a night owl although I also work as a freelance digital marketer, so I also have so give a part of my time to my work also. So she asks me to wake up early so that she could teach me and then work for her office. so when I wake up early I would ping she would say she's busy she'll teach me when she's free from office. I do get that but she doesn't try to understand my situation, I'm an elder sibling I see my father and mom working hard, so I try to help them in every possible way. I help my maa in chores and my father in business. So I've to give my time there also. So when I tell her I'm busy with these things she starts to yell saying I can't manage my time and stuff.
Coming back to the course I know I'm a slow learner, I'm facing alot of issues while developing my basics for javascript. So whenever I ask her for any kind of help in the task she starts to yell at me, and each time she procastionate this behaviour to me by saying she's teaching me about the MNC culture. I don't know what to do I find this thing toxic, Shall I just give up on her?
My friend suggested me to talk to her politely about my views but I'm afraid she won't get my point, he said to change my teacher and learn MERN from any else paid course.

16lo4fa,Should I stay or should I go??,"I am a UX-designer based in Europe with over 3 years of experience, and I've been working for a large corporation for almost a year now. I started looking for a new job 4-5 months ago because I've been feeling quite unhappy in my current role (more on that later). Recently, I received a job offer for a UX role from a mid-sized international company. I am having trouble deciding whether I should stay in my current role (and look for a better opportunity) or accept the new offer.  
Here are some pros and cons for both my current role and the new one to provide more context:

  
🔴 **Current Role Cons:**  
\- The company is undergoing significant organizational changes and has already had two rounds of layoffs in the past year. The second round of layoffs is still ongoing (I don't know if I'm keeping my job yet). There are many budget cuts, and I won't be receiving a salary increase anytime soon.  
\- I'm not particularly passionate about the industry or the product.  
\- I don't feel like I'm learning anything new as a designer, and the work is quite repetitive. Furthermore, when I joined, the stakeholders didn't have much of a UX culture (they barely knew how to work with UX), and although I've made efforts to change that, I see little progress.  
\- I don't have a strong connection with my colleagues, and I don't feel like I fit into the company culture.

**🟢 Current Role Pros:**  
\- The workload is not too high, and the pay is decent. I only need to spend 1-2 hours per day on my tasks.  


  
🔴 **New Role Cons:**  
\- For this role, I will be working with different clients on a project basis. However, they didn't inform me until the last five minutes of the final interview that I would need to travel to clients' offices twice a week, and that a driver's license (which I don't have) is required because the companies are not easily accessible by public transport. They expect me to obtain a driver's license within the next 6 months, which is not that easy in the country I live in. I feel that if this was an important requirement, it should have been mentioned in the initial interview with the recruiter, not during the final interview after I had spent hours on their case study. What's even funnier is that the job posting refers to the role as a ""remote opportunity""...  
\- They're relocating to a new office much farther away, and I only discovered this when I saw the new address on the contract they sent me. They also expect me to be in the office at least once a week, in addition to client visits. Overall, there seems to be a lack of communication in the company and it makes them look unprofessional.  
\- The pay is not a significant improvement (although I plan to negotiate).

🟢 **New Role Pros:**  
\- It might be enjoyable and nice in terms of networking to work with different clients and projects.  
\- I liked the two other UX designers that I'll be working with.  


To be honest, when I started my job search, I was hoping to find a role in a startup. I have experience with startups, and I prefer the faster pace, higher impact, and more freedom they offer. I don't experience any of these in my current role, and I doubt the new job will provide them either. I've applied to some startups as well, but I don't know what will come of those applications, and the job market isn't great right now. What would you do in this situation? Stay and keep looking for a better opportunity even if you're unhappy, or accept the new role?",Massive_Invite9867,3,1.0,2,1695019559,2023-09-18 06:45:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16lo4fa/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/,9,2023

Since 2013, I've been hustling on my own, doing stuff like running a blog I monetized, managing multiple Facebook pages, and even doing some retail trading. I was also helping some clients with trade copying using an EA. But in April, I had to stop it all because of some issues, including losing my account and needing to take care of my mental health.  
  
Now, I'm thinking of switching gears and getting into programming, which I've always wanted to do. Right now, I'm just helping out my partner with her business part-time, using what I know to give her a hand (not getting paid for it, though).  
  
But today, I kinda freaked out about the future. What if programming is not for me? I'm 27 and I'm getting old? And I'm not sure if any company would hire me with the kind of work experience I've got, especially since I don't have a portfolio or anything, well I can provide a copy of my revenue on my monetized blog as a proof but I feel like it's not enough since I stopped blogging since 2018.  
  
I'm reaching out here because I really need some advice. Should I keep pushing to learn programming, which is what I really want, or should I try to get a job with the experience I've already got?

16llmuz,Career and Job Role Guidance - Marketing Analytics vs Product Marketing vs MarTech,"TL:DR; 

Seeking guidance on what skills and job roles should I focus on based on my current experience and technical + domain knowledge and tips on how to prepare myself to get a job by December'2023. 

Hello everyone, 

I am an international graduate student currently pursuing Masters degree in Marketing Analytics in the USA, where I have gained hands on experience with (SQL, Python, Tableau/PowerBI, AWS Cloud, DBMS, NLP, Machine Learning algorithms, Predictive Analytics) as well as worked on projects using these concepts/tools.

Apart from this, I've worked with a Big4 firm in my home country for 3 years in the Business Consulting domain where I have gained exceptional client handling skill, strategic thinking, critical and logical ability, solved business problems leveraging technical tools. 

Marketing Tools that I have hands on are: 
Google Analytics, HubSpot Marketing, Salesforce Sales (building work flows), Adobe Marketo (lead scoring and syncing data to flow into Adobe Customer Data Platform), Adobe CDP (building XDM data models to ingest data from Adobe Marketo, Salesforce CRM, Audience Manager, to create unified profiles and sending to destinations in AWS S3 or SFTP based on client infrastructure.  

Coming to Product Marketing - I have good theoretical knowledge and have worked on case studies with strong thinking ability in GTM strategies and following an analytics driven approach for launching products. Have also worked as a Product Marketer intern for a SaaS startup in the USA. 

With skills that can be haphazardly categorized and decent experiences in every category of marketing I am confused what roles to target as a professional having 4 - 4.5 years of experience in USA considering the current market. I am set to graduate in December'2023 and looking for techno functional roles. 

Below is the list of roles I've been applying on Linkedin:
Marketing Data Analyst
Marketing Data Scientist
MarTech Analyst
Product Marketing Associate
Digital Business Analyst
Web Analyst (but not really confident with the skills and experience for this role)


Any suggestions or help will be greatly appreciated! Thank you!",Doey_Doer18,2,1.0,0,1695011095,2023-09-18 04:24:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16llmuz/career_and_job_role_guidance_marketing_analytics/,9,2023

16lkkvg,Advice on picking a career?,"So, I'm a senior in highschool. I have many years to go and discover what I want to do, but frankly I feel like I have no time to take my time for it. (Not sure if it makes sense)
I grew up in Texas all my life, but I'm not from the US. (I'm Mexican)

I know what I'm kinda good at and some interest.

Math, computers, science, arts, and history. I'm not really a strong reader and writer as English is not my first language. 

I have taken online test and well this is what I get usually:
(MBTI) 'INTJ-A' 
(The Holland Code) 'ICE' (Investigative (I), Enterprising (E) and Conventional (C))
(Enneagram personality type) 8w7

And some career test saying I should join the business field in the finance part. Now if I'm honest I think people that take business are because they are starting a business or because their parents are business people. Which I am not from a family like that and I kinda don't find the interest on starting a business of my own.

I will say I am not really social when it comes to talking but I know I will have to be in my own career and to improve as a person.

I tend to be very picky and switch up so much. Just last week I thought I wanted to be a Psychiatrist, but seeing the years, I knew I couldn't.
 Engineer, architecture, fashion designer, interior designer, Jewelry design, and much more I have hopped around, but can't seem to make up my mind. 

I just feel lost and a little of advice will help. I would talk to my counselors about it, but I tend to be shy and not do that. So I guess I myself am messing my future up like that.",pleasedontbannedme,1,1.0,1,1695007778,2023-09-18 03:29:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16lkkvg/advice_on_picking_a_career/,9,2023

What do you think they would think if I applied to them since they most likely don't remember me at all?",Ben5544477,2,0.7599999904632568,1,1695007733,2023-09-18 03:28:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16lkkcm/what_would_happen_if_you_applied_to_somewhere/,9,2023
16lkjj9,Will I get a raise without asking? (Mid-level designer),"I’m at a company doing brand design and I love what I do. My company has an amazing reputation with big time clients, modern work culture, etc. but it doesn’t feel like I’m paid the salary I thought the reputation gives if that makes any sense. I think brand design is typically paid less than other types of design and though that kind of sucks I’d rather be able to do things I love. I feel challenged here, and I learn so much each project. 

But 45K a year feels depressing. I am living paycheck to paycheck now as I’ve moved to NYC since I’m paying for a lot of debts. I work remote and I know cost of living bites me in the ass but I wanted to move somewhere with more accessibility to things I like.  

My friend is urging me to move into tech but as I know it, tech is really rough right now and it’s something I dislike. 

She also says that they will not give me a raise unless I ask for it. We had a annual review only 3 months after I joined so of course I didn’t expect a raise. Our annual review comes up in 3 months and I’ll have been there for 1 year and 3 months. Since moving to NYC, I pay more for taxes and am getting paid even less than I was. 

When I first accepted the job, my boss said it’s possible to get up to a 10% raise and I don’t know what that truly means. I assume you would have to be absolutely amazing to get that raise. 

During a happy hour I heard a coworker say “I’m glad I stuck it out for the pay” which sounds to me that they all start off with low pay and get much better pay later but I can’t be sure. 

Advancing in our career looks a bit different at our companies. It takes less time to be promoted to senior designer (about 3-4 years as a mid-level designer) I know it takes longer for other companies. 

We’ve been growing and expanding a lot more recently, we just opened a new and better office. 

Is it possible they won’t give me a raise at the next annual review if I don’t ask for it? I just assumed annual reviews included a raise and an opportunity to ask for more than they offer. 

At this rate I’m wondering if it’s worth it at all to stay with this company considering they’re not based in nyc. It’s not likely I’ll ever be paid nyc level pay. But I love working here.

I don’t know what to do.

I freelanced for two years out of school and then joined as a mid-level designer. I’ve never worked a junior role at a company before.",redbeanmilktea,1,1.0,2,1695007663,2023-09-18 03:27:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16lkjj9/will_i_get_a_raise_without_asking_midlevel/,9,2023
16lkaxp,"Unemployed after 6 months, should I consider offer in different role","So I've been unemployed for over a year now (with most of that spent traveling) and I've been back and searching for a few months now. I work in IT and unfortunately it seems to be pretty bad timing as the last year the industry has had a lot of layoffs and competition for jobs seems to be more intense. I've had many interviews but so far no offer, and this seems like it's mostly due to my skills being a bit rusty after so much time not working. I also do not speak the local language at a professional level and therefore have to apply to English speaking jobs, which from what I hear have more competition as there are not so many of them.   
Now, I have had an offer from one of my former employer which is rather good, but is not quite the same role that I had in my past jobs. I was in a pretty technical position and this would be closer to a Business Analyst job, which I'm not entirely sure if I want to do long term as the market for those jobs seems much smaller than for technical IT jobs, and can also be restricted to some specific business domains (correct me if I'm wrong).  
Basically, I am less and less confident that I can find a job within a reasonable amount of time given how competitive the current market is. I am fairly confident that it would be much easier if I could speak the local language at a professional level and I could take classes provided by the state if necessary, however that would take at least a few months and I'm not sure I want to stay unemployed for that much longer. I'm also afraid that the longer I'm unemployed, the worse my chances get of finding something.  
I was thinking I could take the offer for now, and reevaluate in a year or so if it's working for me or not, and if I would rather go back to a more technical job. However, I'm afraid that the move back to a technical job might be difficult in that case, also because my resume would have a lot of 'short' jobs (my previous position also lasted a short time). But I am also quite tired of being unemployed, so it is tempting to just go for it.   
So I guess my question would be, how bad is it for my job search to have such a long time being unemployed, and would I be in a better position taking this job and then finding something else a bit later if necessary? Especially to go back in something more technical?  
Thanks in advance for your answers!",unemployeddev312,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1695006920,2023-09-18 03:15:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16lkaxp/unemployed_after_6_months_should_i_consider_offer/,9,2023
16lk8v5,Any advice on asking for a raise or leaving a small company?,"I am a 26 year old Marketing Operations Coordinator for a manufacturing company. I currently making $50k and am looking to ask for a raise to hopefully get $60k. I work at a small company and in the office side we only have 8 of us. The total company is around 40 people. I’ve been here 2 years and my salary has gone from $40k to $50k in about 18 months. 

I am essentially the entire Marketing department and hold many roles within the company. I feel weird about asking for money given our smaller size and the fact that before I had this job it took me two years post graduation (Covid didn’t help) and this company gave me a chance. Everyone is very nice and I’ve grown so much professionally here and learned a ton. But I can barely afford to live in the area at all on this salary and I don’t have any roommates. 

I don’t believe there is much room for me to grow in the company everyone above me has engineering backgrounds. I get stock in the company every year and they recently gave me phantom stock. But I have to be there 5 years to be fully vested. They always tell me how great I am and how they are pleased with my performance but if they aren’t able to give me a sizeable raise I’m gonna have to start looking elsewhere. My boss is in his early 70’s and surely won’t want to train anyone else again. This job isn’t exactly something I love but I don’t despise it either and I’m still learning a lot. Sorry for rambling.

Preface, I have worked full time in an internship since the week of graduation that  I worked the summer prior to graduation and went into straight after graduation this summer. I have been working full time in this internship since last May and have been learning a lot pertaining to my career. My bosses assistant left for surgery so I have also taken a lot more responsibility.  I’m not sitting idly by but pressure from the outside has made me feel like getting a job post grad even if I have been working is going to be harder for me since I didn’t have something lined up directly following graduation. I have a degree from one of the best schools in the southeast but finding entry level work in my career field has been almost impossible lately as well. I have good references and have years of experience that qualify me but it’s just unnerving to hear from so many people.

16lgrdz,Should I switch my career path?,"Hello there! I'm a third-year computer science student who has been searching for a job in backend and data engineering for about 1.5 years. Unfortunately, I haven't had much luck so far. I've applied to many positions, but most of the time, my resume isn't even looked at, and I often get ghosted after interviews. It's tough because the competition is fierce, with hundreds of applicants for each vacancy that comes up a few times a month.

I'm trying my best by working on personal projects related to web scraping, automation, and web-based applications. I've even ventured into learning a different programming language to build a bot. However, I feel stuck and unsure about what direction to take. My university focuses more on theoretical concepts, making it challenging to gain practical, commercial development skills.

Lately, I've discovered an interest in video editing, illustrating, and drawing, and I've enjoyed dabbling in these creative pursuits through YouTube tutorials. It's been a helpful distraction from the job hunt. But I'm torn because I don't want to feel like the four years I've dedicated to becoming a developer would go to waste, especially since I need a job to sustain myself.

16lgqox,From Social Work to…?,"Hello All,

Im currently a clinical Social Worker (mental health therapist) and I’m at the point where I’m being honest with myself and realizing that I may need to get out of this field. I have the highest licensure level in my state and 10 years of post masters experience. 

I woke up from a dream last night with my face still wet from sobbing in my sleep; all I remember from the dream is saying to myself over and over again  “I can’t do this anymore, I can’t do it.” And before you ask, it was definitely job related stress. Last week was a particularly challenging week. My current role has brought me looking for other jobs for the last year but I’m not sure I even want to stay in the field. I’m burnt out from the direct clinical work and I’m not sure I want a solely administrative role. I’m just so sick of being inundated with other peoples problems…for a living. Sure there’s some rewarding moments but they’re realistically so few and far in between. 

I feel like I’m at such a weird place in my life where I have no direction and no clue of where to go. Up until now, I’ve always had a trajectory. It was bachelors to masters, from masters to getting any job that’ll give me qualifying clinical face-to-face hours for licensure and accruing all those hours, applying for, taking and passing the state licensure exam. And viola, here I am all these years later asking myself, what was it all for? We make terrible money, are often unseen/under appreciated and take on an immense amount of liability. 

Sure, I’ve looked inward and tried to get back in touch with the motivation that brought me to this field in the first place. But the truth is, I don’t think being in this field serving the same purpose it once did, any longer. 

So,looking for what fields/jobs/roles my skills may be transferable to. It is not feasible for me to go back to school at this point. 

I have 15 years experience of working in a pharmacy and being a pharmacy technician for several of those 15 years (it was my first job and my side hustle for a while) but doing that full time isn’t going to pay the bills. 

Any thoughts or alternatives for me to consider would be appreciated. Thank you all in advance.",BrattyWurst,1,1.0,1,1694996533,2023-09-18 00:22:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16lgqox/from_social_work_to/,9,2023

Everyone who works from home will need to work in the office until further notice. When I agreed to take this job I was told that I would be working 2 days in the office and 3 days work from home. Since I’ve started I have noticed I have been asked to come in more that 2 days. I actually worked today (Sunday) and because my position is salary I do not receive overtime. 

I just got home from work and received a message from my manager that I will need to come into the office to work until further notice. It’s 7pm on a Sunday. While I do not have kids, I have a set schedule that makes it difficult to come into the office on my off days. I am actually scheduled for two interviews on Tuesday that I can’t take in the office because they are via Zoom and in person. My manager is basically saying that if I don’t come tomorrow then I will need to take unpaid days. My PTO is currently at the max as I will be taking a vacation in the next few weeks. My manager has not approved this time yet but will not let me take it for Monday or Tuesday. We just received an updated employee handbook with new guidelines for IT issues and WFH where it states that I am able to take PTO.

* Me: ""here is X, Y, Z trends, are you in agreement on change Y to include the gigawatts to improve the trend in a positive way?""
* Him: either he'll talk about something unrelated or he'll say, ""is that what you think we should do?""
* Me: ""Yes for 'reason A'""
* Him: ""Push for A!""
* Me: ""So you are in agreement on changing Y to include ""gigawatts?""
* Him: ""maybe? Is that what we should do?""

He goes out of his way to divert the decision making off of him and nothing he says is clear.

Is there any type of script or word to make it even clearer to deal with these types to get an answer of out them? Something that should be a 5 minute discussion at most turns into multiple 20 minute discussions of going back and forth of me trying to communicate in a different way or trying (and failing) to get clarity on what he says.

16ld8ir,"To leave or not to leave, that is the question","I'm currently working in supply chain management, handling purchasing and scheduling – pretty standard stuff. Randomly last week, someone reached out (not a recruiter) and suggested this opportunity with another company. It's a bit different; more on the vendor side.

Now, here's where it gets interesting: this new gig offers a 15% salary bump plus the potential for quarterly bonuses. Those bonuses can range anywhere from 55k to 85k, if you believe the folks over at Glassdoor. And they're throwing in some nice perks like a company car, card, phone, and iPad. Compare that to my current job where I'm drowning in expense reports for car, gas, and phone. (Benefits and 401k are comparable)

My current job isn't exactly thrilling, and the vibe with my colleagues isn't the best. So, I sent in my resume, did a solid phone interview, and now they're talking about a Teams meeting.

But here's the hangup: if I take this new gig, it'll be a short stint with my current employer, and it's a bit of a career switch. That part makes me a little nervous.

16lbkm7,Wtf?!,"
I taught emotional support for 6 years. I’m very good it, but last year was very difficult. My health was the biggest issue as I was dealing with GI issues pretty much on a daily basis. We were also very short staffed all year, and in March I wound up taking 6 high school students on top of my 6 middle school students to finish out the year. 

I put in for a transfer to a new program, as did many of my coworkers. Weeks went by and I didn’t hear anything. Others had meetings and got their transfers, so I reached out to HR to see what was going on. HR responded and said they were planning on getting a hold of me that day and said my transfer request was denied. 

I was still in the thick of my GI issues with no answers and I was the only teacher set to return. I decided I couldn’t risk it and resigned at the end of the school year. 

Many of my coworkers tried to talk me out, and my supervisor said I could come back if I wanted. Even now, I’m getting texts from parents and coworkers to come back.  

Over the summer, I got my health issues sorted out and started therapy again. By August I felt the best I’ve felt in a long time. I was starting to regret leaving, but chalked it up to nerves. However, I realized quickly after starting my new job that it wasn’t right. 

I reached out to my old supervisor and she told me to submit an application. So I did. They put me through the traditional 3 round interview process, which surprised me, but I did very well. After the 3rd, they asked if they could reach out to my current supervisor. I said yes but requested they wait until after 2 to send it so I could talk to her first. Lunch rolls around, and my supervisor angrily confronted me about it. I tried to explain myself, but she was very mad. 

The next day I get an email saying they decided to “go in another direction.” I don’t know this for sure, but I hear they don’t even have other applicants at this point. 

 Now I’m stuck in a job I don’t like with a supervisor that thinks poorly of me. 

Do I have a right to feel burned? What would you say to your current supervisor in this situation?",Separate_Outcome4620,3,0.7099999785423279,7,1694983361,2023-09-17 20:42:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16lbkm7/wtf/,9,2023
16lbip6,Slow learning work struggle.,"Hey not much of a poster so please bare with me.

I find myself really struggling when it comes to work. The past 6 months i have gotten back into the work force and am currently on my second job. 

History: I worked with my family for most of my work life (family owned business.) when that dried up I applied for a assistant manager at a grocery store and I ended up leavening after a mental break down little under 2 months into the job. My break down was due to bullying for my boss (I believe she may have felt I was lazy/incompetent due to my struggles to learn.) and my own struggle to learn and do my job. I tried my hardest to learn and understand my job and did okay in a few tasks but others I failed miserably no matter how much I tried and practiced. The added pressure of deadlines also contributed to this break as the looming fear of loosing my only income. My current job (3 weeks in.) im still failing to meet expectations, I was told as such by my boss mid last week. 

I don’t know what is wrong with me to even begin to fix it. I have tried to learn diffrent ways, I have asked for and received help, I keep making mistakes due to not understanding and marking costly errors and I’m still behind. I believe if given enough time to learn I could do this job blind folded but i know that no employer wants to spend months with “the screw up” wasting time and money in hopes they one day can do the basics. 

Am I even fit to work…?

16l77l2,Question About Time Off Requests.,"I just started my first job. During the interview my only stipulation regarding my availability was that at times I will have weightlifting meets to compete at. I assured the manager that the dates these meets take place are known well in advance and that I can tell her about them potentially multiple months before her scheduling window of 3 weeks. Additionally I would only be attending a max of 3 meets in a year. At the time she hadn't entirely verbally confirmed that this is not an issue, but seemed to nod and accept the information positively. Come to my second day working and something had brought up schedules, so I ask about a meet I had coming up. My manager tells me something to the effect that even if its outside of the scheduling window I likely wouldn't get that day off. This was as I was about to leave though so I didn't really think much on that. So the next time I was in, when I had the opportunity, I asked more directly with an example. I asked my manager, ""if I gave you a date right now that was 4 months away, just an unpaid day off for an event, would I get that day off?""

16l73wq,Changing a good job to work remotely,"I am 27 years old and have been working as an engineer in a company for almost two years.  
After a year of being long-distance with my (now ex) girlfriend, she decided that the distance was too much, because unfortunately, living and having a life project together is something that in our current situation seems very difficult.  
She didn't ask me for anything and I know she loves me, hence I thought and told her about leaving everything, looking for a remote job and go to live with her, whose country, culture and city I love. However, when I came back from my holidays, I was informed that I was going to be promoted, and that I had been appointed leader of a couple of projects.  
Two things happen:  
\- From a career perspective, leaving now is a lousy decision. I can gain a lot in terms of experience in this company over the next months.  
\- On the other hand, I would like to try a remote job but it scares me a bit. I had already been offered a remote option with very good conditions in the past, but I am worried about two things; the stress of starting a new job while changing country, and above all, by working remotely, I will not generate strong ties with the team members, and in the same way that I have been hired, I could be fired more easily.  
Could this decision spoil a bit my professional development?

16l6dld,Feeling overwhelmed by graduating and totally fucked when it comes to finding a job much less a career,"Hi all,

  
I'm going to keep this as short as I can.  
I am set to (finally) graduate from uni with my undergraduate in spring of this next year. This is good, but I'm becoming increasingly, deeply overwhelmed by the how and what of what happens after I graduate. 

My degree (Media Arts and Sciences) is not exactly particularly ""desired"" (or easy to explain what is), nor has it left me (so far) with any more than a surface level knowledge of a few tools/skills.

  
The degree itself wasn't really what I wanted to do, but I chose it because I wasn't exactly in the best place self-esteem-wise (read: needed a lot of time, healing and professional mental healthcare), and it seemed easier (more possible) than pursuing any of the subjects that I enjoy learning about.

  
Anyway, when I graduate, I'll be 26 (which feels late), have a basic knowledge of a couple tools (python, C++, SQL, Excel, Tableau, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), a basic understanding of data analytics, and I happened to have picked up a second language (German) over the course of my life.

  
What I don't have is a portfolio, or even a resume. I don't know what I'd put on it. I've only ever worked two jobs since graduating high schools, loading/unloading semi-trucks, and for the last four years a barista. Despite having picked up some skills through uni, I don't have any projects to show for it, and I haven't done an internship anywhere. Between being a full-time student and holding down a job (that pays for my tuition, so I can't quit o anything) I have almost no time for doing an internship too.

  
I feel like I don't have what it takes to find a decent paying job after I graduate, much less one that will allow me to pursue my dreams. I want to travel, I want to move (maybe even permanently) abroad, and I want to go to school and actually tackle subjects that interest me. (things like neurology, psychology, physics, and biology). I'd love to pursue a career in academia if I can.

  
I'm a very studious person and love learning for learning's sake, but I feel doomed right now to a life of being stuck. Stuck in a job that either I hate (like the one I have now) or that will never be enough. I feel doomed to be stuck where I'm at (Texas, I hate it here) forever, relying on the kindness of my family to not just go broke while I grow increasingly jealous and bitter of other people (including my family) around me.",prospective_aussie,2,0.75,5,1694970989,2023-09-17 17:16:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16l6dld/feeling_overwhelmed_by_graduating_and_totally/,9,2023
16l5uwk,I’m fukd,"
I’m a 22 year old CS grad (will be 23 in 2 months) 

During by bachelors I never did an internship or any kind of high-end projects

Did absolutely nothing and had a lazy ass lifestyle,
Not good at any programming languages either, had to take an extra semester off since I had to rewrite an exam(yes….1 exam), which further costed me 6-7 more months, and even during that time I did nothing but procrastinate even more (I don’t know how I even graduated with a CS degree tbh - 3.0 gpa).

It’s been 3 months since I finally graduated and I haven’t applied for an internship or any kind of job yet because I feel super unqualified for any job out there.
Obviously…I blame my lazy ass for the current situation I am in.

All of my ex-classmates either have a job or pursuing masters in CS abroad, heck majority of them did internships, were Microsoft/google student ambassadors, chairman/president/vice-president of student organisations of the university 

They Basically did everything I could ever do in my entire life

Recently surfed through LinkedIn profiles looking at what others were doing 

My LinkedIn profile is blank af whereas all of my classmates have got tons of achievements mentioned in their LinkedIn profiles 
For ex:-tons of Azure Microsoft certifications, google certifications, Harvard as well lmao ( note:- all these certificates cost a lot of money and can be earned only after writing an exam) , 4-5 internships 
Including SWE internships in big software firms, etc etc,

Idk how people do it, 
Is that normal? Is that how it’s supposed to be?
Am i the odd one ? Did they have some sort of a mentor to guide them? Or did they do it all on their own? Maybe im just a loser amongst winners….

I never had any mentor or any sort of guidance, I should’ve done the research all by myself instead of trusting people who used to say “eh, i don’t do much” and then proceed to do a lot behind the curtains. 
i failed to realise that the world is competitive af regardless of wherever you belong or come from,
I was the biggest fool to believe them. 

And now here I am with my blank LinkedIn profile 
Regretting how I spent my last 5 years without achieving or doing anything. 

My profile :- 
Bachelor of CS (took 5 years to complete instead of 4)
0 internships 
0 work experience 
0 strong projects 
Weak ass resume (non-existent tbh) 

Maybe CS just isn’t for me
Do i quiet CS at this point ? Do i look for something else to do? 
I wanna be financial independent asap…

What Tf do I do now…..

16l3qsv,"Strongly feel I made the wrong first job decision, panicking a bit","Hi all,

Recently I graduated from uni in a masters of communication. A job offer as recruiter showed up advertised as recruitment-consultancy and really clicked with the boss and person in charge of the team I'd join. Convinced it would be a healthy balance of recruiting and consultancy, I took the job. Currently I am working there around  2 months.

Sadly, it really is just recruiting. On its own I don't mind the journey of candidates and linking them to a potential job, but the sales portion of this job is absolutely not my thing. I work 11 hours a day, spend hours cold calling companies back to back trying to sell our service. This comes with numerous rejections and disrespect towards me.
People truly despise recruiters, and the company I work for asks a ridiculously high fee too...

Right now I spend around an hour to get to work by public transport, and if I hit a certain target I will get my car, a raise and so on. The people around me say I'll start to love it when I hit that target, and praise my boss (he truly does try his hardest to please us all, he is a top notch people manager and puts in extraordinary efforts to keep us happy.)

I know I won't find a job this well paying AND with such a caring boss elsewhere, but the thought of my work load makes me dread going back to work on monday by friday evening. 

Advice? Will this affect my resume? What if I stay and forever lock myself in recruiting/talent acquisition positions? Thanks!!

TL;DR: started my first job, absolutely hate the sales part and constantly feel I'm bothering everyone.",ShoulderSuspicious54,1,1.0,2,1694964905,2023-09-17 15:35:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16l3qsv/strongly_feel_i_made_the_wrong_first_job_decision/,9,2023

16l2hiw,Am I unsafe or just paranoid?,"I've been at my job 8 months. I'm a marketing manager and I work with the marketing director. It's just the two of us. 

  
After starting, I noticed she seemed threatened by me and began micromanaging me. It seemed like she wanted to create a narrative that she was busy, but didn't seem to do much besides tag along on my projects. It didn't seem like she had modern marketing skills or technical ability. And she seemed off mentally, like she was careening around, barely staying on the tracks. A few months in I asked her to stop micromanaging, and she did slightly. After a couple more months I reported her to HR and the CEO got involved. They acted like it was just training but did tell her to stop. She did back off but still seems to covertly try to micromanage. She's subtle. 

  
This might sound silly, but since then I feel scared to go to work because I keep getting the feeling she's going to get revenge. She has never done or said anything to threaten me. It’s little things. She asked if I could leave my computer unlocked for her to use. One day I came in and my computer monitor was unplugged when it hadn’t been when I’d left the night before. She offered me a sandwich and assured me it was sealed when I didn’t ask. One day I had to put a clip art hand on some artwork to tell coworkers where to hang signage. The random hand looked kinda scary. When I saw her looking at it, I announced, “How creepy!” Her head jerked at that and she looked around at me, startled, like she was caught, then seemed to realize I was talking about the hand and relaxed. One day somebody called her and she kept trying to tell them to be quiet without telling them since I was in the room. 

  
I keep telling myself I’m being paranoid but my anxiety is high. My mind keeps telling me something is wrong with her and I need to get out of there. Quit. Get away from her. 

  
I've been in the workforce for 17 years, full-time and no breaks. I've never been scared of a coworker before. I've never gone to HR over someone or had them go to HR over me.

16l0uet,Job offer: How do you negotiate a base salary?,"Hi redditers,
I'm looking for some advice as I recently got offered an interesting mid-senior IT position in a big BIG company based in Europe. 
The salary they offer is honestly good for the geographical position. 

For more context, I'm an expat in this country. I've been living there for 2 years already. And the company that made the offer is transfering their new recruits (from all over the world) to this country. The position is for mid-senior profiles, and is supposedly a 4-year training program for the future managers of the company.

My profile fits 90% of the requirements for the job. The hiring process was smooth. And, bonus for the company: I already live in the city where they are transfering the other recruits.

To contrast a little bit: this position is very demanding, with 50% of the time spent travelling worldwide, working overtime to meet strict deadlines, self-onboarding and working on new technologies every month.
The turnover must be very high and they are probably hiring constantly.

Compared to other competitors, I lack technical skills to be fully autonomous in the shortest amount of time.
But I also speak 3 ""global"" languages, worked 2 years in a similar (not so technical) position, and I already live on site.

Now, I was hoping for 10k more (gross annual). 
I could settle for 3k more, minimum...

After the completion of my degree I attempted to get into Game programming since I was already familiar with the design part of that industry. That didn’t work out because tbh I don’t really have an inclination toward programming, I picked it up to try to make the best of a bad situation, but as I have found out, programming is difficult and I really struggle with it. So now, at the ripe old age of 21, I have a decision to make. Stick with programming and grind through it even though there’s no passion, or pursue a masters in business which is something I actually enjoy, granted the price of a postgraduate course is not cheap at all.

16kyyyc,Worried About Resigning During Busy Season,"Good Day,

Apologies in advance for the relatively long read on your Sunday morning! 

Background:

I work in a fairly small section of the financial services sector that experiences heavy volume leading up to January 1st, starting in the next few weeks.  

A few months ago a recruiter reached out to me about an amazing opportunity at a highly sought after company, and despite being under qualified for the role, I decided to submit an application.  All the interviews went quite well and they ultimately offered me the job (well, created a role for me in a way).  They all seem like great people and it will be an amazing opportunity to learn from some of the best talent in my industry. 

The company is located internationally, so there have been a ton of logistics to work out, with the biggest one being work permit approval in the country we are moving to.  Despite accepting the job offer verbally about a month ago or so, I am yet to put in my notice to my current employer as we are awaiting formal approval from the government. 

Reasons Why This Is a Great Opportunity:

1. My new employer is generally considered one of the premier companies in my industry, and I have the opportunity to step into a front office role there.  I am 25 years old, and this is a level of outward visibility and responsibility I would have to wait 10+ years to get at my current company.  

2.  My new manager has a great reputation in the business and is known for being quite savvy in the way he conducts business.  I will learn a ton from him.  Conversely, my current manager is a great guy who I really like on a personal level.  On a professional level, he is lazy and pawns off a ton of work on me and his work ethic has definitely put strain on our relationship.  Furthermore, I don’t think he’s ever fallen into the trap of overthinking anything, and I’ve actually been teaching him about certain topics in our business.  I feel like I haven’t learned much from him in the last year or so, and this is one of the biggest reasons for leaving.  

3.  Pay.  I’ve known for awhile that I’m underpaid, but didn’t know just how egregiously .  With this new job, I am more than doubling my base salary, tripling my target bonus, and also receiving equity in my new employer.  There is no income tax in the country we are moving to, and with specific tax treaties, I will pay very minimal income tax to the US.  While we are moving to a high COL country, my pay will more than make up for my fiancés lost income and she will work on starting an online business, an aspiration she’s had for awhile.  


Reasons Why I’m Worried:

1. As mentioned above, we are on the precipice of our busiest time of year, so I am feeling some serious anxiety about leaving my current employer high and dry.  We have a fairly small team and I handle a ton of work during this time.  It will get passed on to the other junior employees, all of whom I have a great relationship with and consider some to actually be close friends.  I ultimately think they will be happy for me (albeit envious), but some may not appreciate the added workload this time of year.

2.  While I’m not too concerned with my manager’s reaction, our collective boss and team lead is going to be furious.  They have picked up some slack created by manager in training me and gotten me involved in some pretty high level work.  They have a vengeful personality, and in our small industry, I’m worried about what they may say to others.  

3.  Optics of departure in the future.  Obviously my new employer doesn’t care about the timing of my departure as they need me for this busy season.  That said, I’m worried this could hurt me down the line when a future employer sees the month of departure from my current role. 

So what does everyone think?  Am I making this a bigger deal than it is?  How should I manage the reaction of my team lead?  Any other general advice?

16kyqlk,Is it possible to negotiate salary while relocating within one company?,"I received an offer for relocation within the company i work for.  I am wondering if it’s possible to negotiate salary while relocating within one company or i should only go with what they offer? I guess there might be some policies which differ from one company to another, but what’s your experience?
Also, there are some people from senior management who vouched for me to get the role and I don’t want any troubles for them if i would be considered “picky” for salary negotiation.

If negotiating salary can be the case, how do i understand what salary is good in the country i am offered to move to? I did some research on the salary for such positions and found salary ranges which differ a lot from one another... so i am confused.",Whocares2675,1,1.0,0,1694951595,2023-09-17 11:53:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16kyqlk/is_it_possible_to_negotiate_salary_while/,9,2023

16kwylt,I feel like walking on a thin ice every single day at my work place..,"I recently transferred to another company with 4 years of experience.

However, I barely have any experience in field&product and I'm having a very difficult time learning & catching up.

Since, I came here with a title(assistant manager)..it seems like people had some sort of expectation. However, I've made quite a few mistakes and I'm starting to panic everyday at work because I'm getting SO scared of making another one.

My manager literally told me that I was below his expectation, and office is not a school for him to teach me. He was expecting better of me, but my evaluation at this moment isn't good.

I've been here for 2 and a half months and I'm having trouble eating and sleeping because I'm getting so paranoid of my work. Everyday, I feel like I'm walking on a very thin ice..

My workload piles up since I spend so much time reviewing what I did in order to avoid any simple mistake. Typos, orders of approvals..etc.

I wish there were examples for me to copy, but everyone did such a shit job of keeping&organizing the previous history that I have to make decisions not knowing what is the correct answer.

Before I came here, I was told that I was special and I was loved by everyone. Here, I just look like an idiot, shitting his own pants.

What the hell do I do? How do I overcome this? Is it normal for people to expect results from a guy who's been here for a couple of months only?",Ok-Preparation-3806,3,1.0,2,1694945610,2023-09-17 10:13:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16kwylt/i_feel_like_walking_on_a_thin_ice_every_single/,9,2023
16kwvym,Career change from Law to Project management or something else,"Hey there,  
Im 26 years old from a EU country. I recently finished masters in law school. I have no official work experience. During college I did legal consulting when I had time, and made good money with it, but i did it through a family company (not a law firm, just a company, so that i was able to charge for my work)

  
Long story short: Towards the end of my studies, I realised law is not for me. I like law (specifically the problem-solving, strategy-making aspects of it), but I dont see myself doing this full-time for the rest of my life. Also it became my longterm plan to move to another EU country (I've already learned the language of that country to a C1 level). And law degree is transferable abroad with great difficulty.

  
My family and friends mentioned that based on my personality they think I'd be good in management and I should look into project management, since supposedly to get your foot in the door it doesn't require a specific degree and you can climb up. They also mentioned and I read about it online, that it has option of remote work and work abroad. So, I applied to Google project management certificate, to learn the basics of this profession. I plan on finishing it in about 2 months with hardcore studying.

  
My questions are: 

1. Is it true I can get into this work without a specific degree? This is what Google PM course also tells you, but I find it hard to believe that I can just start with any industry right off the bat, like engineering.   
2. Will my law degree help me in any way, give me more credibility? Can I use it as leverage to get my foot in the door? (skills like problem-solving, analytical and strategic mindset, research skills, being able to study effectively etc.)   
3. If some basic knowledge of an industry is needed, what industries should I look for that have a quicker learning curve (i imagine that it'd be easier to get into Marketing PM than Aerospace PM?)? But still, longterm is it possible to break into some more technical industries?   
4. Is it true that there is potential for fully remote jobs, allowing me to move abroad and work remote?   
5. If the previous holds true, I realise and expect that my first job in this profession would probably not be even hybrid, so when could one expect to have enough value and experience for the possibility of remote work?   
6. What kind of work/life balance does this profession offer? I'm by no means lazy, but one of the reasons Im looking to get out of law is the often toxic work environments, adversarial nature of the job (constant arguing with other attorneys, opposing party...instead of trying to resolve problems with good communication), and usually very long and stressful hours and over-time hours.  
Until I find some career path that deeply interests and fulfills me, I was also thinking about doing legal consulting for low-profile cases in my spare time as a side job to make some extra money. But on the long run I want an out from the legal profession.  
If any one has any idea of some other industry I could go into, I'm open to suggestions.",Sonchek96,2,1.0,0,1694945363,2023-09-17 10:09:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16kwvym/career_change_from_law_to_project_management_or/,9,2023
16kwcd1,How do i choose a career?,"I'm a senior in high school, I have a 4.0 unweighted and a 4.64 weighted, i'm good at everything but not fantastic at anything, and I have no idea what to put under the majors section of college applications. I dont have even a vague idea of what I want to do for the rest of my life. Every time i try to choose a career or degree that I want to get in order to get there, i cant fight the indecision. 

My family refuses to allow anything other than Some undergrad they expect me to just figure out as long as it gets me to get to med school or dentistry, but even looking past the fact that it could make me a lot of money, I would hate it. It simply isnt feasible for me to spend upwards of 8-12 years struggling through school just for something I don't have any passion for. anybody else with immigrant parents like Ive got knows how it feels.

Even if I do continue on that path, which right now is looking like the plan, I have no idea what to do for undergrad. Everything I research has a terrible outlook and likelihood to find a job if i cant continue on to higher education from there (yes, you, biology majors). Im sort of leaning towards biomed engineering but even then I can't find a consensus on what life is like with a BS in that. People are either lucky or they arent, but I cant mess up, we simply don't have the time or money for me to lose the gamble. I need my parents to be able to retire, but this life ive got is for me, too.

Ive recently found my interest in math and space resurfacing, and getting into the reasoning for calculus and the processes and ways in which space travel is possible is pretty fascinating to me, even if I dont know much yet. I find that learning about it gives me more life than most other things ive ever studied, so I was hoping to possibly find something in aerospace, specifically astronautical engineering. im CAD certified and everything, so I thought it might work. With that said, the likelihood of me finding a job working for any mission I dream about is unbelievably slim, and I don't know how well id be paid doing something else if i even get a job with it. it seems like every degree i research has a mountain of people regretting it.

I want to work with space, I want to make enough money for my family to catch a break, i want to love my job, i want to get a degree worth getting, but I just dont know if any of that is possible. Maybe thats just life. This became more of a rant than the college and career advice i originally was going for, but well, its looking like things dont really ever go according to plan.

&#x200B;

Well !!! anyway, how should I choose what to do? Almost forgot why i was even writing ! but any advice is appreciated.

16kvwf2,Company keen on putting me in an expat position simultaneously trying to force me to stay 2 years via contract,"Hi reddit. 

  
I am from an Eastern European country and I'm working for US corporate as a software engineer. We are a supplier for a top semiconductor business in a foreign country. I have several years of experience visiting customers on site and tailoring the solutions for them and no one else in the company has this kind of experience. We are delivering a project with a revenue of hundreds of millions of dollars and based on the customer's positive experience with me, they asked our management to reallocate me to the foreign country for several months and the management is very keen on sending me there and there is a pressure to go as soon as possible (after the visas are done).  
I told my manager I'm willing to go but that I would like to get compensated properly (promotion, LTIP, bonuses if the business goes well). The promotion got denied, I got told LTIP is not possible in our company and got a vague promise that there should be 'some' bonus afterwards, however the amount is unknown.

  
At the same time, I'm being pressured by HR to sign a contract for the assignment. The contract describes that I will be paid the same amount of money as I am right now (which is 3x-4x less than the US equivalent would be), and that I would be paid per diem as defined by my country's law for foreign assignments. It also states that if I leave for any reason or if my employment is terminated within 24 months after the assignment starts, I will be required to repay the full price of the reallocation, including immigration costs, taxes (if I understand correctly I will be taxed in both my country and the assignment country and the company promises to pay the extra taxes so I only pay my country's tax) and of course the flight tickets, accommodation, transportation etc. 

  
To me this seems like a terrible deal, and I refused to sign it. The cost of the reallocation will be so big that it would make it impossible for me to leave for two years afterwards. It also gives the company a big leverage over me so I assume I won't get any promotion or salary increase in the following two years since I cannot leave. At the same time, I might still get financially ruined for life if I have to leave for any reason (health / moving countries). The contract also doesn't say anything about the bonus, so I'm not even guaranteed to get anything for moving to a foreign country, where everything is much more expensive and there is a very unforgiving work culture, for half a year, and having responsibility for such a big project.

  
After raising my concerns with my manager, he understood my position and started a communication with HR. Now he says the HR 'promised' him that if I leave for health-related reasons, they will not ask for the money back and that I should sign it, while disregarding the other concerns.  
Is this a normal way corporates negotiate? When negotiating I felt like I'm the one begging to be reallocated and that I should be subservient and understanding of company needs. I think it doesn't reflect the circumstances at all. What should I do? How should I continue the negotiations?

16kvmq5,Should I quit or not?,"I have a weird situation.

I like my job and have a really good relationship with my boss. We're on a same wavelength about how to do this job good. I've been having some health issues lately and he really pulled through for me, so I know he values my work (he also gives me mostly good feedback). My paycheck is okay.

But, I have 2 toxic coworkers and 2 okay coworkers on my team. About a year ago I only had 1 toxic coworker. He is really passive-agressive and trying to do the bare minimum of work, but keeps bitching how his pay is low. The other toxic coworker was added to our team about a year ago (shifted from another team within the company). She is openly hostile, agressive and snaps unpredictably. She also had negative effect on the other toxic coworker so he is even worse in his passive-agressiveness. Both of them are working for the company for the past 30 years and are known to everybody as 'difficult', but I don't know why the company hasn't fired them in the past. At this point, I don't think the company can fire them, because of strict labour laws in my country about elderly employees. They are toxic to everybody in the company, not just me. They do have some specific knowledge, but nothing that we couldn't pick up in couple of months.

So my problem is, should I stick it out for another 3 years untill they both retire, or find something else? We work as business analysts in IT firm that works for financial sector. I currently work for the only company that covers this niche in the country.

16kvbgd,Should I transfer?,"I work as an IV pharmacy technician at the largest hospital in my state. I have an interview tomorrow for the same position except at a much smaller hospital in the suburbs in the same health system. I'm a bit unsure if I should follow through with it. Hopefully some of you can help me decide. 

I applied to this position because in general I'm very overwhelmed by how much work there is to do at my current hospital. I'm probably making 300-400 IVs a day in a clean room. I spend all day in this clean room, often without a break. I get so many IVs that are STAT that really causes my anxiety to get raised. Because the nature of the hospital, we get all of the complicated cases in our state. Which means the IVs that I'm tasked with making are often time consuming, difficult to make, and put me in a situation where I have to think on my feet. Overall I enjoy the actual act of what I do but the amount of work is not healthy. Everyone I work with in the clean room shares in this anxiety about the workplace. Our scheduling is also not ideal as we often get mandated to work a double shift at least a few times a week. It can be pretty demoralizing. The amount of work and how often I'm having to work has led to injury in my hands. I've torn a muscle in both of my hands at one point, but in general it feels like I have arthritis. I have a very rocky relationship with my pharmacy manager because of my penchant for advocating for better working conditions. I also have to pay $100 a month for parking since it's in the middle of the city, and frequently I have trouble finding parking if I work the afternoon shift. Cafeteria prices also feels like the hospital is robbing me. My commute is 35 mins, 15 mins to walk from the parking ramp to campus, and then 10 mins to change into my scrubs. I really don't like the commute. 

What I do like about my current hospital is that my hourly wage is at the top of my field in the area, I have amazing medical benefits, I get free dental insurance, guaranteed sick time due to city ordinance, I often can take an extra 10 mins on lunch without anyone caring, and I generally enjoy the people I work with. 

The hospital that I'm potentially transferring to is in a suburb and they have about 1/4 the amount of beds available, which means it's nowhere near as busy. A coworker of mine recently transferred there and she told me she only spends about half of her shift making IVs and the rest is just helping out in the regular part of the pharmacy. That sounds really nice in terms of my mental and physical health. The commute would be about 20 mins. There is free parking right next to the hospital, so no walking a mile to campus. My coworker told me that she works 8am-4pm, and weekends every third weekend. Wheres I work generally 6am-2pm, Wednesday through Sunday at my current hospital.  

The only issues I've determined so far with transferring to this hospital is that it's not union, I'm likely going to have to take a pay cut, and the medical benefits are likely not going to be as great. All of which are important to me. I enjoy having union protections at work. And I rely on the good medical benefits as I take a lot of medications and have to see doctors monthly. 

I'm not entirely sure what I should do. I feel completely torn. The interview is mostly a formality as my skill set is high in demand and since I already work in the health system.",Elsa_the_Archer,1,1.0,0,1694939619,2023-09-17 08:33:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16kvbgd/should_i_transfer/,9,2023
16kuw2r,My supervisor is blocking my progression at the company. What should I do?,"Basically, my Team Leader wants to promote me from junior to senior, skipping the middle level but my supervisor is blocking that promotion and even says I shouldn't be promoted to the middle level.

16kt9ek,Co-worker literally trying to fight me,"So I just started a new contract job in  the Australian mining industry which I work for two weeks in a remote location, then get one week off. I've been doing this kind of work for about five years.

I was supposed to get a week of training, but I got sick with COVID so I missed out on the training.

Anyway, apparently this place has a high turnover rate and they can't get enough people with my qualifications. In the department, it's just me, a coworker, my boss, and my bosses boss. My co-worker and boss are on holiday, and the big boss doesn't come to site, so it's just me in charge of about ten contractors. I don't really have a good idea of exactly how things are run here.

Anyway, for the first few days everything was fine until a new worker joins who I'll call ""K"" he's about ten years older than me (I'm 30), and he's one of the boss contractors who has about 20 years industry experience is very good at what he does and is well respected. 

I could tell immediately that he has a chip on his shoulder. I was going through the pre-start meeting, reading off a checklist of questions related to safety, when he became agitated. He kept butting in and correcting minor details aggressively. I ignored the first few jabs just by saying ""ok"" or ""thanks"" but he became more angry and complained that the meeting was taking too long. I assume that everyone else had been skipping a lot of the checklist, but I didn't know what to skip because I'm new at the job, so I just went through the whole checklist. 

My meetings were only taking about five minutes but this one was taking longer because K kept interjecting. When I told him that, he became irate. I can't remember what he said, but he was very angry and he moved closer to me in an attempt to intimidate.

It wasn't my best moment, but I told him to ""fucking relax"" which obviously pissed him off more. I think I embarrassed him in front of his workers because I wasn't intimidated. I ended the meeting and just walked off, forgetting to give K his paperwork because I just wanted to get away from him. He had to come up to me to get it, which he wasn't happy about. 

For the next week he was tense but cooperative. I made an effort to be nice to him, and while he only gave one word answers, he was no longer hostile.

That was until today.

There's an exclusion zone around K's machine which I need his permission to enter. So I waited at the edge of the exclusion zone as he walked towards me mumbling at me inaudibly. I took the bait, thinking he was asking me to come to him and I stepped into the exclusion zone. He then angrily revealed that he was infact telling me to ""stay there"". He's been doing this for a long time, so he knows tricks like this. He's going to tell people that I entered the exclusion zone without his permission. 

He then informed me that he'd reported me to my boss for swearing at him and for failing to give him his paperwork. Both of these are true, but caused by his aggression towards me. He also said he wouldn't allow me around his machine (which I need to be to work).

Here is where he tried to instigate a fight.

Although I look like a pale gamer who stays inside all day, I do have a decent amount of kickboxing, and some BJJ experience, which I don't really tell people about.

I don't know what experience he's had, but with that attitude, he must have fought before. we are about the same height and weight, but he's ten years older. I don't know who would win.

He told me I was lucky I hadn't sworn at someone else or they'd have knocked me on my ass. 

I know this tactic, it's a threat by proxy. He doesn't want to directly threaten me, so he tells me what someone else would have done. 

He wanted me to be scared, but instead I responded ""or maybe I'd have knocked them on their ass"". He laughed and walked away, but when he saw his workers (who I get along with) watching, he turned around and said ""what was that!?"" Pretending that I'd said something under my breath. I knew he was trying to bait me to come over to him. He wants me to swing on him first so he has an excuse. I just told him I didn't say anything and kept walking.

That's where I am now. This guy obviously wants to fight me, obviously I don't want to fight him. He's restricted access to his machine, which I need to work, and he keeps successfuly baiting me into doing things he can use against me.

I'm tempted to just quit, but it might not look good for me career wise, and I'm trying to buy an apartment. This is a high paying job I'd rather not lose. 

I don't think I can do anything about him either. He's been here for over a decade. Even if someone does put him in line, I don't think I can work with him. I'll never know when he's about to snap and he's in control of heavy machinery.

16ksnsq,Quitting Job for a Client - How?,"Seeking advice using a throwaway account since I know I have colleagues here. 

I've been with my company for over 5 years, but the progression has been slow. After three years, I'm finally being considered for a promotion and had a discussion with my boss 3 weeks ago. 

The contract my current company has with the client that I've been working for over the last two years comes to an end in December. 
Being fully aware of this, the client doesn't want to let me go and has offered me a job with a 50% raise, and a better title. 
I'm still negotiating terms, but, it feels like the client offer is certainly better. 

I'm torn with a weird sense of loyalty to my current company, especially when I know that they've been considering me for a promotion and I'm wondering how I should navigate this situation. 
If I quit, I'll still be working with my current company, the same colleagues, albeit from the client side, until the end of the year and I want to make sure I don't burn any bridges.

The only issue is that I'm severely underpaid and there are no available slots for promotion any time soon. I've looked for new jobs and received a few offers that are higher than my current salary. The offers are about 30-40% higher than what I am currently making.

My end goal would be to stay at my current job and receive a counteroffer of 25% or more. Doesn't have to be as high as the other offers. 

Would it be wise to bring an offer to my boss and ask for a counter? Would it be better to just make a clean break? The issues I can see if I were to bring my manager an offer is that he will think I'm a disloyal POS because I'm already looking. And if I decide that I do want to stay, I'll probably get fired.

16krybm,Counselling vs IO Psychology,"Counselling or I/O Psychology?

Helloo! So I’m currently working as an IO psychologist after getting my masters in the same field. But I’ve always wanted to pursue counselling; I did not do so due to the low wages and the years of supervision required along with passing different licensing exams. 

But I’ve realised IO Psychology isn’t for me. It pays decently but it’s so boring and frankly a bit draining. I’ve always wanted to help people and knew counselling is something I would be good at.

16krurm,First layoff experience,"I'm not usually the type to put things into the universe like this but I think I'll be laid off this week and I'd like some advice on how to deal with the situation since this is my first time being laid off, ever.

I work for a tech company and it all started with the last financial report that came out some months ago when the company made couple billions in revenue but low millions in net profit. I suspect it was due to a bloated payroll. First, they started laying off contractors. My team lost a few. As the months went on I started noticing a few subtle things like being locked out of the HR platform where I'd schedule vacation days. Meeting invites past a certain date started bouncing. But the most significant sign is a canceled invite to the staff meeting this coming Friday. The original meting should have been yesterday but it got canceled and rescheduled before my new invite was subsequently canceled. The rest of my team has the meeting in their calendar. 

To be quite honest my nerves are all over the place. I'm in my third week of my masters plus I just got approved for a car loan. I had a few drinks yesterday and I was quite calm but now that I'm sober I can't even sleep properly. I'm laid in bed looking at the ceiling between these sentences. 

For those of you who have been laid off before or know persons who have, what advice do you have for the week ahead and how do you suggest I go about dealing with this if it does happen? How should I prepare myself going into unemployment? What should I do/not do during unemployment? Should I expect my manager & teammates to express empathy if it does happen?

I really hope I'm overthinking it",Particular_Brush_967,8,0.8999999761581421,9,1694926502,2023-09-17 04:55:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16krurm/first_layoff_experience/,9,2023

I need some advice. I am a 35 year old married guy from Gurgaon, India.

I have been working in Digital Marketing from 6 yrs now. I have been looking for a new job but have been unsuccessful so far, not because of lack of options, but because lack of quality option.

To cut it short, I want to know if I should do the following:

1) Full Stack web development from intellipaat (in association with IITs) or from UpGrad/Code Ninja/Coursera etc (Don't have any understanding of any basic coding language)

2) Data Scientist course from from similar institutes, and a few in collaboration with IITs.

3) Upgrade myself in Digital Marketing, and continue with the same career.

The reason for looking at these options is, a better package and because I want to explore work opportunities abroad.",SpaceMan2047,1,1.0,1,1694926040,2023-09-17 04:47:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16krqah/which_option_should_i_go_with/,9,2023
16krhxe,MIS vs Finance for Project Management,"Hey y’all ! 

I'm currently a Finance major at a McCombs business school however I also have the option of majoring in Management Information Systems (MIS). I really want to go into PM but I feel that being a finance major will set me back. The issue is my options are: 1. Do finance and be able to study abroad, 2. Do MIS and not study abroad, and 3. Do MIS and graduate a semester late. I've heard from so many people that studying abroad is such a great experience and something that you shouldn't pass up and I think it would be a great experience for me. I don't know how much of an advantage it would be for me to major in MIS rather than finance. Does anyone have any advice on what to do?

16kr14i,Tech vs Dentistry?,"I graduated college as a pre-law major in 2020. Spoke with countless lawyers after graduation who all advised me to stay away from law school, insisting that most lawyers are working miserable hours and are struggling financially. I ended up working in marketing for a few years while building a small online business on the side. Being 25 now and fully acknowledging that I graduated with an utterly useless degree, I started to consider other avenues for work.   
After weighing the pros and cons of several different career paths, I came to the conclusion that I should either go into Tech or Dentistry. I always enjoyed learning simple html/css when I was younger and I know once your a good SWE you can earn a lucrative salary. I could also pivot into other sectors of tech whether it's AI/ML, Data Science, Cyber Security, Systems Administration, Solutions Architecture, etc. I'd most likely go for my second Bachelors in Computer Science at WGU or Maybe consider an MS program somewhere local. I've heard some pretty bad things about bootcamps and I know a degree would most likely open more doors for me going forward. Although, One problem I've always thought about in tech is stability. There's not much barrier to entry, and your pretty expendable/easy to replace overall. You hear about companies nowadays doing mass layoffs and the job market is always flooded. I also considered the ageism situation in tech as well. The fact that it's usually a young man's industry. You don't hear about many people in their 50's and 60's working in tech.  
Dentistry on the other hand, is a way different path. Being a dentist is usually looked at as the more stable option long-term with so many dentists owning their own practice. It will most likely require 3-4 semesters of Pre-Requisite Science courses, and intensive study for the DAT before getting into Dental School. Dental School will be another 4 Years. The loans would likely be substantial, but the potential for a lucrative income and flexible work hours is appealing. It's fairly common for General Dentists to work 3-4 days a week. Working 5-6 days a week can result in some serious cheddar. I always loved working with my hands, and I enjoy helping people face to face. I know dentists in their 60s and 70s who still operate their practice and love what they do. I understand the gravity of the commitment dental school would entail, but I'm willing to give it my all.  
\* Have any of you made a career switch from a non-tech field into tech, and what was your experience like?  
\* Are there tech professionals here who can shed light on the industry's stability and the ageism issue?  
\* Dentists, what has your journey been like, and do you find it as fulfilling as it seems?  
\* Any general advice or alternative career paths I might not have considered?  
I'm open to any additional recommendations, suggestions, personal experiences, or overall thoughts and opinions.  
Thanks in advance!🙏

16kq3fw,I experience imposter syndrome frequently at work. Because of that I feel I should go back to school to obtain my bachelors after 6 years of no school. But is it necessary? Is it worth it?,"I'm a computer science uni drop out. Admittedly I wasn't a good student. I had to retake calculus twice, and failed calc 2 once. Dropped to a 2.0 GPA before ultimately dropping out. Prior to that, I did achieve an associates degree in computer information systems from a local community college. The only classes I performed well in were the programming classes.

After dropping out I landed a contractor job at department of defense company as a technician. And honestly it was luck, the recruiter over exaggerated my resume from a warehouse job, which was mainly shipping and packaging using a machine (he exaggerated my machine use). So I had no experience with any of the job responsibilities, but I pulled through and rushed to learn all the necessary technical skills within my first week, thanks to a patient coworker. So with that job I got cable harness building experience and PCB soldering experience. Electromechanical tech was the job title. The inspectors told me my cables were very good, they said I made cables as if I've been doing it for a while.

After the place closed and laid the technicians off, I ended up getting a job at another DoD position as an EM tech again. But this time I was also trained to use a coordinate measuring machine along with GD&T, and with that it started my career in Metrology. Ended up programming on the CMM for aerospace and DoD parts. After 2-3 years I've made about 200+ programs and assisted with multiple DoD engineering projects.

And then here's the big jump. Landed a metrology job for a biotech company in the silicon valley. Nearly double my pay. It's been almost a year but I've been keeping up, but I often feel that imposter syndrome. Everyone I work with has an engineering degree, and the work flow is very fast pace.  A lot of my coworkers are very surprised I don't have a bachelors.. I was also a direct hire, a lot of my coworkers are temps, so I'm getting paid a lot more, which is crazy to me since I don't have a bachelors. But the lack of one makes me feel like I have to work harder than everyone else to keep my job. I feel like I always have to prove myself, so I end up working a lot of overtime, even though I'm successfully completing job tasks and developing more programs. The great thing about this job is that i've also learned a ton and added so many skills to my resume, one of those skills I became the best at, which earned me some job security.

&#x200B;

But I just can't shake the feeling that I'm in a temporary peak period, and that I'll eventually fall. I feel like I'll be more secure with a bachelors in engineering.

16kkmfh,Jobs Relating to Animal Shelters,"Hello reddit. I really have no idea where to go to ask this question, so I guess I'll start here. I am currently a senior (17 y/o male if that matters) in high school and I am very interested in working with animals. Specifically companion animals. I have tried to do a bit of research and the thing that interests me the most is working in an animal shelter with the animals there. I really love the idea of helping pets who have little chance of getting adopted to find a home. I would also enjoy working with other animals (like animal control or something), but working in shelters is what I am most passionate about. One thing I should mention is that I don't think I would be able to do any jobs that would require me to see dying animals, so no vet or wildlife rehab please. I can work with injured animals just fine, but any career that would require me to watch an animal die on any sort of regular basis would probably be really hard on me.  
  
I guess what I am here to ask is if anyone knows any decent paying careers that I could pursue that would line up with some of my interests. Would I need to go to college for this? Would that just be a waste of money? What are some of the best areas (I live in the United States) for these jobs? Really any advice would be greatly appreciated.  
  
I really need some one-on-one help figuring this stuff out but none of the people in my life have any experience with this line of work (parents are both accountants). Even school counselors just told me to research careers, but it really isn't easy for me to do alone.

16kirtq,Seeking help with building a career contingency plan,"Hello all,  
I (26m) am looking for some help with building a career “contingency plan” (and apologies in advance for the long-winded post but I feel like context is important).  
I graduated college in 2019 from a respected college in the US and spent 3-4 years working primarily in sales/account management and customer success first for a staffing company, later for a SaaS startup. I was promoted several times, built a solid network, made decent money, and was able to save a fair amount of what I earned.   
This past February, though, I was laid off due to company restructuring. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise for me as I had been feeling burnt out in my latest role, so I decided to take two months completely off as a mental break from anything career-related. Over the course of my two-month break period, I got really interested in digital entrepreneurship as a vehicle to live a life “on my own terms”, free from the corporate world, so I spent the subsequent several months teaching myself the fundamentals of web design, digital marketing, and more with the goal of getting literate in all facets of e-commerce. In tandem with my quest for ecomm knowledge, I began working with a friend on a separate business venture that is tracking well, albeit slowly (R&D issues outside of my control).  
Yet even with all that I’ve learned + my new business venture, I can’t help but think about a worst-case scenario where I don’t “make it” as an entrepreneur. I’m committed to the vision of finding success as an entrepreneur and am grinding on a daily basis to be successful, but I’m also well aware that it can take a lot of time to make any significant money with digital entrepreneurship. And while I’m fortunate that money isn’t necessarily an existential problem for me right now as I know it is for others, it’s 100% a major consideration for me given inflation and my current lack of income.   


To this end I’ve been lightly applying to soft-skill SaaS jobs in my free time with the goal of testing the market for soft-skill corporate workers. What I’ve found is that the market for people like me right now is complete ass (surprise!). When in 2019 I was landing IVs left and right without any work experience and in early 2022 was able to change jobs with very little effort, my recent job application efforts have yielded nothing but a handful of dud first-round IVs. Before getting laid off I used to believe that soft-skill SaaS jobs would be largely immune to automation in the long term, but now I’m not so sure. There are literally hordes of people just like me that used to work in sales, customer success, recruiting, etc who’ve been laid off this year and are all trying to get back into their old roles or something similar. Even assuming a macroeconomic turnaround happens in the next several years leading to more SaaS companies receiving funding, I no longer see working in tech as a viable Plan B for me if I strike out as an entrepreneur.  
And this is where I’m looking for advice. I have a lot of interests that conflict with each other, so am finding it super difficult to optimize my Plan B career path effectively. I need help in crafting an optimized career contingency plan based on my below 3 interests - each of which I view as more-or-less equally important.  
**- Long-term financial security**  
\- I want to be in a position such that I am able to be the sole breadwinner for my future family if needed. \~$150k plus annual salary earnings cap ideally, but I’d be willing to swing for lower expected earnings if I can nail a great work-life balance and an interesting industry/role.  
**- Long-term work-life balance**   
\- Having the time and flexibility to travel and spend time with family is important to me. I would love a full remote work career long term, but am open to compromise.  
**- Subject-matter interest**   
\- If there’s one thing I learned about myself over the course of my \~3.5 years working in the corporate world, it’s that interesting subject matter in my work helps keep me psychologically and emotionally stable. Some spaces/functions that I’m open to/interested in exploring include CPG/Food&Bev, Travel & Hospitality, Renewable Energy, International Trade/Trade Compliance, Project Management, Tech Product Management. Again, I’m open to compromising if it means improvement in achieving goals along the lines of my other two guiding interests.  
Some additional notes:   
\- I would be willing to attend the right specialized graduate degree program, MBA, etc to get wherever I need to be. I already have solid references in line who I know I can count on, and I can begin test-prepping in January 2024 with the aim of submitting any applications as early as Fall 2024 (Fall 2025 matriculation in mind).  
\- I’m open to moving anywhere - geography is not a concern.  
\- I’m open to connecting & working with with a reputable professional career planner/consultant… just don’t have a ton of financial flexibility in terms of budget rn and wouldn’t know were to start, so any suggestions or referrals are welcome.  
Again I recognize that this post was long and that my ask is somewhat open-ended, so many thanks to anyone who has taken the time to read this far, let alone respond!

16kfcif,Has anyone ever been fired by a trainer's influence to upper management?,"Hi there,

&#x200B;

First, let me warn you that this a quite a long read, so for those of you who don't have the time to sift through my explanation (tl:dr)  I've summarized it here:

&#x200B;

*My probation was rejected due to my main trainer unfairly reporting that my performance didn't meet their objectives, after one year on the job. From what I gather, this trainer didn't like me and was difficult to work with at times, particularly over mistakes (which I tried best to correct). This contrasts with my secondary trainer, who was more welcoming and not as ""high-strung"" or impatient in demonstrating how to do tasks. I couldn't go to HR to file an appeal for reconsideration due to my probationary status. I sincerely was looking forward to working with this department, which was local government. There were no written or verbal warnings ever issued whether I was faltering on my performance. I'm still very sore about it after 11 months, as I feel my majority of my work met standard-level criteria.* 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Here is the long version:

  
Last year, I was fired after one year of probation. I had two trainers. The main one was helpful, but difficult to work with. While I strived to do my best, she would often get very nitpicky over mistakes. The second trainer was more laid-back and nicer, and complimented me more on my work.  


I never once got into an heated argument with my first trainer, as I believe maintaining a cordial relationship and discussing how I can improve my performance was key to making sure I was a critical asset to their team. I also had good relationships with the other coworkers. I tried to be dependable as I never called in sick during my probation or was rarely ever late. I was even the sole worker on a major project of reorganizing the city's real property system.

  
However, I feel the first trainer was creating somewhat of a hostile work environment with the way she treated me. I've had other positions in my career where I was never treated this way. Or if there was conflict, it was usually settled with our main supervisor.

  
\- She would get annoyed if I asked a question again that I had forgotten (I have ADD and Fibromyalgia, where brain fog sometimes plays a role in forgetfulness. That's why I make sure to write down notes).

  
\- If she was annoyed, she would demand in the chat message, ""What did I just say?"" Or ""We've talked about this already."" A a bit of a condescending ire.

  
\- If she was frustrated with me, she'd put her status message to Red ""Do Not Disturb."" I never argued or bit back like some wronged people would do, but tried to do better according to her instructions.  


\- She claimed not to micromanage, yet she was constantly monitoring a shared email where we received our work. She would get irritated if I didn't let her know if the email was addressed to her - even though she was frequently reading the emails.  


\- She'd purposely ignore me calling her if she was in a bad mood. It's only when I came to her desk and spoke up louder that she'd have no choice but to give me attention.  


\- If I tried to do the right thing (or what I perceived what it was) with a task or response to an email, she'd demand, ""Why did you do that?!"" Or ""Why didn't you do this and that?!"" I understand she was trying to correct me on the proper way to do the task, but when it happened constantly, it was beginning to be a bit much.

&#x200B;

\- There was a very specific way that she did things and was very Type-A personality about it, I suppose. Even though she could be helpful and approachable at times, there was one incident when she got real annoyed with me and rudely chided me for misplacing some documents in another folder. I only agreed with her and told her I would be sure to pay attention to where I filed the documents.  
\- I found it strange that during my mid-year evaluation, she didn't speak up about my performance. Only my second trainer (the nice girl) went over my progress and for the most part, it was good. She even pointed out areas I needed to improve on. All three of us were in the same room.

  
I strongly feel that my main trainer was conspiring to get rid of me. After getting upset with me over a mistake I made (I was too intimidated at that point to take action on delivering requested documents when she was out sick. I assumed that my second trainer would take care of the task. I felt if I had taken action, my main trainer would have jumped on my ass about it. Like, ""Why didn't you wait until I came back from being sick? Why did you give it to so and so to approve?!"").

  
So, she set her status to Red, ""In a call."" At the same time, my second trainer's status was also set to ""In a call."" No other team member (we were a small group) was in call. I'm certain - though it can't be proven, admittedly - that she was ranting to my second trainer about it and that they shouldn't pass me on the one-year probation mark.  


Even when both of them took me into a private room to disclose the bad news, it was my second trainer who spoke up. She could see how hurt I was and asked if I needed a moment. I suspect she may have been crying, as she kept sniffling and wiping her face at her cubicle.

  
I knew the second trainer didn't want to fire me, but it really wasn't her choice in the matter. She even agreed to let me use her as a future reference.  


I always had the goal to show my first trainer that I wanted to meet all objectives outlined in the job, despite how poorly she saw me. It was like, ""Okay, today, I'm going show Patty (not her real name) that I can do this! I'll finish all the work with no mistakes and deliver high-quality results!""

  
I felt like I could tolerate working with such a mercurial person. Only for it to blow up in my face when they decided to boot me out. I strongly feel that she was the main influence in their decision as she mostly worked with me, even though I excelled at other duties in my tenure.

  
Hell, I even *corrected* mistakes on other employees' work (from a different department)!  


What hurts me is that there were no verbal or written warnings - something I was used to in my past jobs. They never once sat me down and said, ""Look, if you can't sufficiently meet this objective or goal, it's going to affect your probation.""  


Or they never outlined any goals such as producing work that was error-free 99.9% and set a timeline for accomplishing this. I personally feel she didn't like working with me (as she often talked bad about several clients or didn't like the way they responded in emails), and so her answer is to permanently cut off the person if she could. 

She may have been bias, but again, this cannot be proven. I really liked working in this job (it was local government and my first foray into public service) and would have filed an appeal for reinstatement with their HR, except I was on probationary status. So, no leverage there,

  
Anyhow, I understand that you're only hearing one side of the story, so take it as you will. Thank you for taking the time to read this!

16ket0v,Can you re invent yourself career wise at 32?,"It has been an up and down path for me. And I am curious about solutions rather than the probelms I have faced so I wont really go into them unless its relevant somehow. I went to school for Finance but have never really used it as I had intended. I realized I really liked interacting with people and so I got into sales. Its fun exciting and VERY stressful. My career has not been a failure but recently it feels that way. So, I want to re invent myself. I want to commit to a change in life and lifestyle that will help me get out of the sales cycle or improve it. Sales is a highly lucrative career path, but its not for everyone. I have done entreprenurial stuff and had some success at this and would be open to doing that again and partake in the digital nomad life. However I am also open to using my finance degree going back to school and obtaining a MS or MBA in finance, but without the experience (I did consumer finance but its not the same as corp finance or relevent finance fields). The other option is going towards my passion of sports and getting into a front office position, I actually have an offer for ticket sales gig but pay is very low compared to where I was even 4 years ago. So as I write this, I am curious if its even possible to re-invent oneself career wise.

&#x200B;

I figure, If I am to do, I wanted to hear from people who have and get an understanding of the path you/they took to do so?

16kdpen,Faking test reports,"Good morning all

Not gonna make any name for obvious reasons.

I've just been on a work trip for this new company I'm working with and something troubling happened.
In short we had to carry out a test of an industrial equipment and the conditions for a significant test were not met hence the test should have been aborted according to protocols.

What happened after I made it known to my colleague that the test conditions were impossible to meet, he then called the head of department who then told him to carry out the test anyway and manipulate the data to achieve the desired efficiency knowing full well, that the test conditions were not met.

My colleague then obliged and manipulated the data in the final report of the test.

Now, I have another company ( multinational company in the oil 1nd gas industry ) in a sector I worked before, that's wanting to hire me.
Given that I've been working in this company for a little over a month and also given what I seen, should I leave and get into the other company ?

As a disclaimer, I voiced my discontent with the manager about the report but was shut down immediately being the ""new guy"".

16kdbuk,Do I take the new job or stick with the old?,"This week I landed a job. Better pay, hybrid schedule after basic training, but…I’m unsure. Also to note I have already accepted the offer for the new job. I am having doubts. 

My current job needs me because no else knows my position and in that way it’s secure but last week the company laid off 20 key people including one of my teammates. Now his work falls on me with no option for overtime or additional compensation because the company is trying to stop the hemorrhaging of funds. I know the people I work with, I know my job and I can get it done. 

What’s the concern? I can’t do it anymore. Over the entire year, it’s been nonstop overtime, learning a new system, training others, creating new processes, with no reward. No title promotion, no additional pay, and now no financial bonus for completing what was promised since the beginning of the year. (This bonus was promised by our executive president in a meeting to all the key players in this process.) After giving my all, I can’t. 

So yes, exciting new job with upgraded pay and schedule, but I don’t get to do the job I’m use to anymore. I lose the comfort and familiarity of the position. Also losing PTO and insurance coverage is never fun.

I had to go back and forth with her to get the wording right because she kept changing how she wanted things to sound. Eventually I was in overtime at the office so I told her I needed to leave but would message her first thing in the morning to confirm the newsletter. I’ve gotten in trouble in the past for sending things out with getting confirmation so I wanted to be sure everything was okay before pulling the trigger.

The next morning as soon as I clocked in, I messaged her for confirmation. I could see her typing on IM but no message came through. 2 hours go by, I message her again, no response. Another 2 hours go by, I try a third time, again I can see her typing but no response comes through. By this time it’s late in the afternoon and the newsletter hasn’t gone out.

22 year old prosti - career advice needed

I’m 22, I have no college education & I feel stuck career wise. Quick backstory, I’ve always been indecisive about my career path and when all my friends had things figured out & were deciding to go to college and university I decided to take some time to work and think about what I wanted to do. At the time i figured that was better than taking on student loan debt. 

I ended up working under the table for a start up company making a decent wage for my age. Unfortunately I lacked financial literacy, lived paycheck to paycheck until the company started losing money & shut down, I lost my job. 

Being that I was getting paid under the table, I didn’t qualify for unemployment. I finally understood why we paid taxes (seriously I didn’t understand). I felt lost again, I started brain storming and realized that I’ve always been passionate about entrepreneurship . I decided “why not start a business & be my own boss.” As you can imagine starting a business without an income meant id have to acquire debt while taking on such a big risk. Long story short, the business didn’t take and I’m $15k in debt. Lesson learned! 

Life hit me pretty hard after that, homelessness, debt…the whole shabang. Last month I started working as a prosti (Please try not to judge) to start paying off the debt and in the hopes of saving up for a car that will allow me to have more job options and transportation to school. I signed up for some course upgrading classes to get some prerequisites for a university nursing program. I’m not passionate about nursing but I have friends who travel nurse and they make a great living. (I’m also considering nursing because it will allow me to be able to work in the US and potentially be able to live there. A huge part of my career dilemma is how do I move to the US from Canada and start my live there. Nursing makes that possible with a TN Visa). 

Besides nursing I really have fell in love with business and personal finance. I am just beginning my journey to getting debt free and it’s really hard but I am learning to make sacrifices, how to budget and how to invest my money in the future when I am out of the debt. I would love to do something related to that in the future. But I am so fixated on doing something that allows me to move to the US & makes a substantial income since the cost of living is so high. Right now I make $5,700/month and if that continues that’s $68k/yr. If I wanted to continue making this income and working a “real job” I’d have to bring in $98k/yr before taxes. 

Besides travel nursing, I’m not sure what career path I can peruse where I can make that income and move to the US. (I’m not into tech or trades). Who even makes $98k right out of university?


I guess the point of this post was to ask, 

•how does one figure out what their passion is?
•what do I do career wise until I start school in a year?
•should I continue this “job” until I am debt free?
•what other TN Visa careers can I pursue?

I feel like a data entry robot. I have outgrown the role (a long time ago), there is no space in the company for further development (even if there was, I don't think I want to work in an accounting department).

I shouldn't have stayed any longer than 2 years. The job does not require any qualifications, and I have a Maths degree from a good London University. This was my first job after graduating (which took me a year to get because I am terrible at interviews due to my anxiety).

I genuinely despise my job, and struggle to get through such boring, brain-numbing tasks every day. Nonetheless, a lot of my colleagues are aware that I am 'better' than this job, and that I should be doing something else. As, when there is something remotely complex, I tend to be the go-to person to sort it out.

But what can I do? Yes, I've always been good at maths, and I've always been 'the smart one' at school, but I feel like such a failure. sometimes I feel like I have potential, but my confidence and self-esteem is so low.

What can someone who is good at maths, but not a people's-person do?

Please help. Any ideas are much appreciated.

16k6ee2,I need to do something new,"Basically I've been working for a little over a year in IT and I'm finishing up a degree in a related field and I realized I just don't have it in me anymore. I think it's a combination of burnout and my poor ability to handle stress. I also think it's because I don't feel like my work is meaningful. The work was related to the financial field and I just find everything in that field to be morally wrong. I want to be doing something that feels meaningful. That feels like it's helpful to the world rather than making it work. I like creating art, I wanted to be a writer at one point. The thing is the language in the country I live in and where I have residence is not the same as the language I write in (English). I also think my mental capacity has been decreasing. I'm moving to the EU soon and I want to start on a new path. I'm incredibly burnt out with regards to schooling. I am really apprehensive to even do a work/school hybrid but if it's a good fit then maybe. I mainly just want to do something that I dont dislike, that doesn't make the world a worse place, maybe even a better one, and hopefully something I don't take home with me (or if I do it's important enough to be worth it).

16k5or8,Took over a company but have no motivation to keep running it,"TL:DR at the end
After high school I started working for a really close family friend doing residential construction work. It was a small company with 5-7 employees. I worked for two years and we had a plan for me to take over after another two years of my role slowly growing. Sadly the family friend had a medical emergency and couldn't run things anymore. I was given the company overnight two years early and tasked with keeping things running. I finished all the open jobs and started a few of my own over the course of the last 4 months. I was looking forward to this for a few years but now I have no want to own the company. I downsized to keep a better group of guys working for me and I have plenty of clients who want work done. I can expect between $150k-$250k profit for the first year depending on the amount of work I take. I can see this growing into something that easily makes $500k profits in a few years but it doesn't excite me anymore and I see no meaning in the work. There is no mental challenge in any aspect of running the business or building the houses. The only challenge is the stress of working long hours and dealing with either stupid clients or employees who can't do their job. Would I be an idiot to close down the company and move on to another possibly more meaningful career? Or do I stick with what I have because it is a good thing? 

TL:DR I took over a company building houses that makes good money with a bright future but don't see the meaning in the work and it doesn't excite me like it used to. Would it be dumb to close down the company and look for a more meaningful career?",Adventurous-Cream753,2,1.0,6,1694865328,2023-09-16 11:55:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16k5or8/took_over_a_company_but_have_no_motivation_to/,9,2023
16k5o7y,Which company should I choose that aligns with my future plans?,"Hello,  
  
I'm facing a significant career decision and could really use your insights and advice. Here's my story:  
  
I'm a front-end developer with three years of experience, currently based in the Netherlands. Earlier this year, in March, I applied for a position at Company A, a startup. I had a positive interview experience and met the development team. However, they were specifically looking for a senior developer back then, and I didn't make the cut. The owner expressed interest in considering me for future openings.  
  
Fast forward to now, in September, Company A reached out recently, saying they are ready to bring me on board. One crucial factor is that Company A uses React, which I have less experience with, but they are willing to give me a chance.  
  
However, there's a new twist to the story. In the meantime, I applied for a position at Company B, a larger company with over 30 developers. I was offered the job, and I'm scheduled to start on November 1st. Company B primarily works with Vue.js, a technology I'm familiar with and enjoy working with. A notable aspect is that Company B is located a 30-minute public transport ride away from my home.  
  
Both companies have offered me the same salary package, which continues to make my decision difficult.  
  
Here's the breakdown:  
  
Company A: A startup that initially left a positive impression. They now have an opening, and I know they use React, a technology I'm less experienced with. The commute is only 10 minutes by bike, which is very convenient.  
  
Company B: A larger, stable company where I'd work with Vue.js, which aligns with my preferences. The commute, however, is a 30-minute journey by public transport.  
  
Adding another layer to this decision is my long-term goal of living and working in Canada. This goal influences my career choices.  
  
With this information, I'd like to ask for your advice. Given the convenience of a 10-minute bike commute to Company A and the fact that Company B focuses on Vue.js (which I enjoy), how should I weigh these factors in my decision? Should my aspirations for Canada play a role in my choice between Company A and Company B?  
  
Your insights and perspectives would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance!",devduha,1,1.0,0,1694865285,2023-09-16 11:54:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16k5o7y/which_company_should_i_choose_that_aligns_with_my/,9,2023
16k5bao,How do you deal with somebody who’s always calling in sick and playing the childcare card?,"We have a team at work. This guy J is our deputy. And he is brilliant at leading a team, none of us doubt that. But he has lots of sick days. 

We work 2 days on and 4 days off. We have to do sleep ins at work either on day 1 or day 2. In an ideal world, a day 1 sleep would be great because we’d do a shift, stop over and do a shift the second day and then finish and go home the night of the second shift. But, so it’s fair, we split it evenly. One week 2 people will do a first sleep whilst the other 2 do the second sleep. The following week this will change over so it’s fair. 

Somehow J always manages to get out of the 2nd sleep. Either he will swap it with somebody or drop his 2nd sleep so that somebody has to do an extra. 

Every time he will either say he is poorly, his daughter is poorly or his partner is poorly and he has to go home because she’s too poorly to look after their 3 year old daughter. Everyone on the team knows it’s bullshit because he does this regularly. 

I can’t play the childcare card because I don’t have children. Also I’ve never had a sick day so I wouldn’t do this anyway. 

It’s unfair to me that he’s the deputy of the team and supposed to set an example and to cover any shortfalls but he’s unwilling to. He will only do something if it suits him, will never put himself out like the rest of us do. 

I am much more dedicated to the job than him and I want progression myself. If we are ever short of sleeps or a night shift on our team then I will cover it, if I’m able to. He would never put himself out like that. He will always have an excuse of why he can’t. 

The other day, him and I were due to be on a second sleep. I already knew before the shifts that he’d find a way to get out of it. It gets to the second shift and he receives a call from his partner. Apparently she’s had a funny turn and he can no longer do the sleep because he needs to go home and look after their daughter for in case she passes out. We all knew it was bullshit but somebody, N, kindly stepped in for him even though she’s already overworking herself at the moment and I’m concerned for her. 

I was off with him and he asked me what was up and I was honest with him. I said, “I know you’re lying, you always get out of a second sleep, I don’t believe you. I’d respect you more if you said you just really couldn’t be bothered to do the sleep and wanted it covering”. He acted hurt that I could think he was lying and he became very defensive and raised his voice and said, “Your opinion is wrong”. In the end I said, “What do you want me to say? I’m not going to lie and say that you’ve changed my mind and I now believe you, I don’t believe you but I don’t want to fall out with you over it.” That’s how it was left and we haven’t spoken since. 

We have a great team but his unreliability lets us down. He isn’t a team player. I feel like I’m more dedicated to the job and the team yet here I am being denied any progression. I wouldn’t want him to leave, I’m close to him and think he’s great. When he’s on it, he’s on it and we work well together. But this just lets the team down.",PrettyGreenEyes93,1,1.0,2,1694864190,2023-09-16 11:36:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16k5bao/how_do_you_deal_with_somebody_whos_always_calling/,9,2023

16k1esw,Should I rejoin my previous company?,"I joined my first company at the start of 2022, it was a startup and my first job. I liked working with them. Of course there were some problems there like every other company but mostly it was a pleasant experience. I left that company because it was not challenging enough and did not provide a huge learning opportunity that a startup should

I left that company after working there for 8 months and joined my current company (Also a startup) at the end of 2022, here I was presented with real challenges and had to learn a lot, always on my toes, my current company gave me lots of experience but I was/am constantly bullied or made fun of by my colleagues, I dont feel respected here by my colleagues or my supervisors, I like the work that I do here since I still learn a lot but due to my co workers I started looking for other opportunities

In the past few months some of my co workers from my department had been fired due to their own wrong doings but there is a rumour that some more people will get fired, there is a small to medium chance that I might get fired too

I got tired of job searching after 5 months and decided to contact my previous employer if they had an opening for me, and they did offer me a job at seemingly a better and more challenging role than I previously had, they are offering a me a good enough hike on my salary as well

I am not sure if I should rejoin my previous company or stay in my current job and look for a better opportunity

Reasons not to stay at my current job

1. My co workers dont respect me
2. There is a small chance I might get fired soon
3. Current company might not give me the hike on my salary that I want (I have completed 11 months here and due for a hike)
4. Boring and kind of an uneasy environment in the office due to lots of people getting fired and leaving the company

&#x200B;

Reasons not to rejoin my previous company

1. Its a less matured company as compared to my current company
2. I might not get a challenging enough role
3. I might get fired from there too (They have job security issues as well but not as much as my current company)
4. I might soon find a better opportunity with a bigger brand and more employees
5. My current company might offer me the hike I want",Spiritual-Body-6241,1,1.0,1,1694850150,2023-09-16 07:42:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16k1esw/should_i_rejoin_my_previous_company/,9,2023
16k0zef,Graduated in CS and feel under equipped/lost,"Hey everyone,

A few months ago, I graduated with an undergraduate degree in computer science and engineering. It's been quite a journey, and now I find myself at a crossroads, feeling a bit lost in the vast world of tech. I'd love to share my thoughts and get some advice from you all.

My programming skills are okayish; I've dabbled in various languages and used them in different projects. However, I haven't honed my skills in any particular one, and my last project was a machine learning related one. While it was intriguing, I'll be honest – a significant part of it involved relentless StackOverflow searches and frantic Googling. 

Now, as I contemplate entering the job market, I'm confronted with doubts about my preparedness. I'm not entirely sure if I want to dive into a super technical role that demands high-level programming skills. I've been contemplating a shift toward the realm of Data Science and Analytics, perhaps pursuing a master's degree in the field.

But here's where my confusion deepens. I've heard whispers about how the data science job market is oversaturated, with limited opportunities. This has left me in a state of uncertainty, unsure of which path to take and what to do. 

All I want is to do something meaningful and valuable. If any of you have been in a similar situation or have insights to offer, I'd greatly appreciate your advice and thoughts",tyr1699,1,1.0,0,1694848586,2023-09-16 07:16:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16k0zef/graduated_in_cs_and_feel_under_equippedlost/,9,2023

16jzscq,Should I leave Phd in physics to get a job in data?,"I'm currently enrolled in a Phd program in Physics (2nd year running) at a US university. Over the summer, I started questioning if i am actually enjoying my time as a phd student here partly because i started to get overwhelmed and partly because i have not been doing well mentally and grad school hasn't been helping with that. I have wanted to take a break ever I started my graduate school but being an international student, there is a lot of navigating to do about that. So taking a break didn't seem possible last year but now that I have learned about the possibility to leave with a masters, it is seeming a bit more plausible.  
  
So even though i like the environment and people at my uni, I am questioning if i should try to stay here or try to get a job. I should also mention that my university gives three attempts at qualification exam, and I have failed two. My third exam is approaching.  
  
I do not have any prior work experience. I have a double major from my undergrad: in physics and math. And if i decide to leave my university, i will get until the end of spring 2024 to get my masters. In terms of skills, I have a working knowledge of python and i am hoping to build on that in the coming few months along with skills in machine learning and sql.  
  
I'm afraid if it would be stupid to leave behind a phd opportunity at a good school to chase a job that i currently do not possess a lot of skills for. At the same time, I do not want to drag myself through the program if it means i will be more miserable. Thank you for your time!

16jyjl9,Advice for getting a Paid MSW Internship?,"Yes, it is possible. Here's a video to demonstrate:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8c9VMFGUiE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8c9VMFGUiE)    
The way I see it there are 3 options here:  
1. doing your field placement at your place of employment (which many MSW programs are starting to allow.   
2. the Americorps internship as described in the video  
3. applying for a job with the express intent to do an MSW field placement there.  
After discussing the potential for interning at my current job with my boss, it looks like option 1 is currently out of the picture for me. I'll be starting option 2 today and seeing what Americorps has to offer, the video is pretty straightforward so I don't need advice here.  
The main thing I'm looking for advice with is the 3rd option; applying for jobs with the express intent to do an MSW field placement there. My plan is to basically apply for as many jobs as possible that appear to meet the agency requirements set by my school's field placement office:  
– LCSW or equivalent required - if this person comes from an outside agency, you'll also need someone at your actual site with a master's degree or higher in any field who can serve as your task manager.  
– Supervisor is responsible for one hour of weekly supervision, approving the hours you log in your placement portal, and assistance with your learning plan, process recordings (I believe 5), and an end of term site visit with your Practicum Liaison from Simmons.  
– 12 of your 24 hours of placement a week need to be clinical.  
Honestly, these requirements are pretty minimal, and considering that the LCSW can even be found off-site it seems all the more flexible to me. The biggest pitch it seems will be finding a task manager at the agency (who would essentially just be my boss anyway) and then being able to get 24 hours minimum in total, with at least 12 of those being direct clinical hours.  
Honestly, the requirements seem like a pretty basic job description of most part-time SW jobs requiring a Bachelor's degree, which I have along with about 3.5 years of clinical experience.  
Still, knowing how social service agencies can be, I'm expecting some level of resistance in my applications, even though it would essentially just be hiring me to do a normal SW job and then me finding 1 hour of weekly supervision either on or off site.   
Having said that, my question to you guys is this:   
How can I make the best pitch to an employer that hiring to do a paid internship  would be beneficial to both parties and would require pretty minimal commitment on their end? What are some key points I should stress? How can I phrase things best here? And should I mention all of this in the cover letter? Or should I wait until they reach out to me or express interest in an interview?

Tesla is currently hiring for several positions for their autopilot team in their Palo Alto office. I am thinking of applying there, as the position definitely seems very interesting. However, before I come to a decision I would if anyone here could share their experiences working in the software teams at the PA office?

16jv3ln,"Update 2: Got thrown under the bus by my boss, now what do I say when I'm asked about what happened during the department meeting?","🙃 

Before the change process meeting with my boss and his boss, my boss and I spoke earlier in the morning. He goes, ""I don't want there to be friction between us"", me: ""I have felt like I've been hung out to dry with no support""; him: ""I'm sorry you feel that way""; me ""i would expect you to tell me before I make the change if I’m incorrect""; him: **""I assume you know what you're doing""** (I was 2 months into the job at this point...), me: ""you're my boss, it's not going to hurt my feelings if you correct me"". He seemed to not understand why there might be ""friction"". If I was doing the wrong things, why wouldn't you fix that as a manager?

The meeting with him and his boss was fine. We ended up sidetracked with his boss going deeper into some of the projects we work on, so we have another meeting to actually go over the stuff I wanted (accountability, roles, risk assessment, etc.) next week. But I don't know how I felt after. I think I feel super uneasy knowing how two-faced my boss is. Even though my boss's boss seemed impressed with my accountability earlier, I don't even know what type of conversations he's had with my boss, or if my boss is in trouble.

I had to ""chat"" with my boss about something today via Slack. I wanted to pull my hair out because he WOULD NOT GIVE ME A STRAIGHT ANSWER ON ANYTHING. Like I would say, ""are you okay with painting 30% of the wine glasses red?"" and he'd go, ""paint the drinking glasses that will max out the volume"", me: ""does that mean you are okay with the 30% then?, him: ""place the priority for wine, margarita then martini glasses to squeeze out the other types of glasses."" AHHHHHH It took an hour at 6pm on a Friday. 

**With what I mentioned above about his ""I assume you know what you're doing"", I have multiple screenshots of telling him everything multiple times, so...yeah. I'm thinking about referencing those screenshots during the next meeting with him and his boss. But now I'm wondering if there is even a point. Is his boss going to think I'm the problem and antagonistic? Should I schedule a skip level with his boss and show those screenshots to his boss?** My boss said again today that he didn't throw me under the bus and that we're a team...

I'm so enormously beyond fucked. I'm so livid and burst out in tears twice tonight over how frustrated I am. He's worse than someone letting their reports sink or fail, he's a two-faced, underhanded snake. Especially because before every meeting he makes such a big deal about asking about what I did the night before, my plans, how my dog is doing. Phony ass bitch.

background -  *I’m at a new job and kept my boss on the loop on “Project Vulcan”, discussing it multiple times and emailing him. During a critical time when he should have been more on top of it as head of the team, he was forwarding emails from his boss to him, to me without any additional comment, leaving me to handle everything. I wrote back to him in these emails what I was doing, but he never followed up. This caused a fire and he left me alone to explain what happened. Last Monday I wrote an update to my boss and my boss’s boss. My boss's boss wrote back and he seemed very impressed that I wrote and he had positive feedback. And he suggested all 3 of us sit through a ""change process plan"", which happened today. Another piece of this is another a junior level teammate was fired a month ago due to “not advancing enough”*

16juwno,Sales career advice?,"Sales career advice

Hello everyone,

I feel like I’m just stuck. I got my first sales job as a solar consultant in the beginning of 2022, I did fantastic with it! I got burned hard come December (I live in the snow belt up North) and got picked up by another solar company that promised full time work come spring. That never happened..so I left the solar industry and went into car sales because I love cars!

I’ve been doing it for a couple months and it’s awful with the current market. This month I haven’t sold a single car so I’m just living off draws which are next to nothing. All the new guys end up quitting because they can’t sell many cars. I don’t care about working late nights and weekends, but not for the money I’m making. Our benefits are expensive and completely out of pocket. I can’t see this being a long term thing at all. 

I love sales and providing value to my clients regardless of what I’m doing. When my client(s) has a smile on their face and are grateful for what I’ve provided, it’s an amazing feeling. 

Solar was great until it wasn’t, car sales is awful, where should I go from here??",yaboicnote_,1,1.0,0,1694827922,2023-09-16 01:32:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16juwno/sales_career_advice/,9,2023
16juvw6,My Story and Your Help,"Hi!  I am new to reddit and am looking for some help...  

I am in the early stages of developing a program to help high-performing women in their 30’s & 40’s who continually crush goals, but they still feel unfulfilled, overwhelmed or stressed to the point of emotional, mental and physical damage. To create the most impactful and transformational program possible, I am looking to interview people who fit this description and learn more about their challenges, frustrations, dreams and goals.  
   
The reason this is so close to my heart is because I was this description just a few years ago.  This is my story: I have worked in healthcare marketing/operations/professional development for 15 years. Mostly on the agency side but also on the client side/manufacturer. Before the age of 30 I rose through the ranks and found myself in senior leadership at a healthcare pharma agency. I met (and exceeded) my goals, but I wasn’t happy.  I worked 70-hour work weeks way too often. My first born, Grayson, was diagnosed with autism and needed intensive therapy and there were no flexible ""work from home"" options at that time. I knew I needed to focus on him but still support my family, so I found a small agency that would give me flexibility BUT the tradeoff was working till 4am most nights and on the weekends. And the company didn’t align with my values or beliefs. I was 3 kids in, exhausted and miserable— something had to give.  
  
I decided I was going to believe in me the way other companies believed in me. If they were going to pay me a generous, 6 figure salary to run their account departments, operations, strategy and deal with their biggest pharma clients— I must be valuable (it was hard for me to believe at the time). I quit and took the leap to freelance/consulting.  I also started my own investment property company, in a search of finding something that would fill me up.  
  
Covid hit and that was a collide of so much stress, right?! I was at an all-time low and I started a personal growth journey to try to figure out how I could be more content.  I had hit every checkmark on paper -  mother, wife, successful career, company owner - but I didn't feel fulfilled - I felt drained.      
  
I took a course based in mindfulness, and it was life changing!  I realized I wanted to help people like me — those that are living the “American dream” but not feeling as content as they “should”. I wanted to make an impact on a larger scale in a way that is authentic and aligned to what I believe in. I had an idea of taking my professional success and skills and combining it with the mindset tactics that changed my perspective.  I want to help those like me find clarity in their next step and have the confidence to take it, so they can connect with contentment.  I launched a new company, Liv Connections and I am working with people to do just that.  

&#x200B;

I really want this program I am creating to be the best it can be and help a large number of people.  So, that’s my story and I hope to connect with you!",LivConnections,1,1.0,0,1694827862,2023-09-16 01:31:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16juvw6/my_story_and_your_help/,9,2023
16jusej,Need advice on the next step to grow as a developer," My goal is to grow my skill set so I can become a better developer. 2 years ago I started learning Fullstack web dev(MERN stack) just for a hobby and then I started applying to roles but after several interviews nothing came of it. About a year ago the CEO of the company I am at currently caught wind that I was into coding so he talked me into switching from a my mechanical engineering role at the company to a role as an Oracle Developer. It was a nice change as I enjoy software much more than Mechanical and I also got a 15% pay raise. However, the Oracle work they have me doing is extremely niche and our ERP system is very mature. As a result I am hardly getting any experience with PL/SQL or Java, or any coding in general. My job consists mostly of clicking through UIs setting up automation process by clicking nodes and entering inputs for parts. It is helping the company in a big way but I fear this job may be stunting my growth as a developer. I feel like they are getting what they want out of out but I am not sure if I am. Oracle developers typically use PL/SQL and Java so in my free time out side of work I have spent much time getting good with these but I still feel like I am missing out not getting to use them in a real world experience.

Here is another important factor concerning the job: I am not sure if the Sr Engineer I am working under really wants me to become a good Oracle developer. He was not part of the decision for the company to hire a second Oracle developer. At first he was a jerk and I think it was because he thought the company was trying to replace him. I could see this as a possibility because he at retirement age but refuses to retire. My company has force retired people like this in the past. What I mean by force retire is they pitch a retirement offer and basically say you can take this money or no money about a year from now. 

 Also he talked behind my back with multiple people to make me look bad and was a jerk when I asked for help. He even said some things to make me look bad on the MS teams chat where our whole department could see. As a result of I talked with my supervisor and he got him to chill out but I am still not sure if he has my best interest in mind. Although he is much nicer now he always has me working on things that are not technical whatsever and are more data entry. On top of that I asked my boss if I could work on more PL/SQL and SQL projects but when my boss consulted him he siad we hardly use SQL or PL/SQL for this role. Meanwhile, every time I look at his screen he is working with SQL or PL/SQL. Lastly, One of things I will eventually have to do in my role  is helping users with bugs that come up in certain parts of our ERP system. I asked him if I could shadow him on some on fixing some of the issues the users were having but he never pulls me in whenever he gets an issue.

 I have interviewed for several other Oracle roles but they keep saying that I need more PL/SQL experience because I only have 1.5 years under my belt in this role. My question is what should I do next? I just want a job where I can really grow my skills. 

Here a few Ideas I had but I am open to other recommendations: 

option 1. Keep busting it with PL/SQL and Java outside of work and continue applying to other opportunities.

option 2. Use the free time I have at this low demand job and get masters degree in computer science. I find fulfillment in development work, whether it involves Oracle or full-stack development. However, I acknowledge my limited knowledge in the realm of computer science, and pursuing a master's degree might open doors to explore other areas of interest. This could also help with finding another role.",jerm1698,1,1.0,0,1694827578,2023-09-16 01:26:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16jusej/need_advice_on_the_next_step_to_grow_as_a/,9,2023

16jtmoi,CEO is trying to keep me..,"(TL:DR at the end)

Hey everyone,

I’m at a fork in the road.. I’m 28 (M), married, living in Southern CA. I’ve been working in the cannabis industry for 5 years, at my current company for 3.

The company is a retail chain, with about 10 stores, fairly big player in SoCal Cannabis. A mix of great people and a handful of assholes- owner is a bit of a manic coke enthusiast.

I started out as a contracted employee to just do ordering at $16 an hour, however over the past 3 years I’ve been hired on full time at salary currently $64k plus the semi-regular bonus (2 a year avg). In this time I’ve built up the entire demand planning and purchasing department from a single spreadsheet to a somewhat sophisticated centralized system capable of being ran by 1-2 people.

Last year I started learning Python, and been applying that to my work to increase productivity- I’ve realized that I love problem solving, and am deeply interested in science/technology.

This year I’ve been saving about 80% of my pay (I live in a cheap shit studio with my wife 29- who also works at this company) to afford going back to school full time and possibly pay out of pocket.

In the last 6 months I have busted my ass to leave on a good note, proud of my work. Building out high level assortment analytics and reporting, developing/sourcing for our multiple white label product lines, and assisting in building out our new centralized distribution- including some software solutions to reduce labor.

As the year has gone on, keeping up with my schoolwork has been difficult.  I’m still maintaining A’s but work is beginning to suffer.

My CEO is aware and I recently told him I’m leaving at the end of the year for sure. He’s a huge fan of mine and wants to go to the owner and offer $85K. Also looking into developing a new role that focuses on analytics and software solutions. 

My long-term thinking is that an engineering degree has a better overall trajectory and higher pay, with a wider range of opportunity- even outside of engineering disciplines. However, that’s a serious pay raise and skips the need to pay for school. 

I want an education but it would be an opportunity to continue to make my own and I would also continue to just be self taught, as well as possibly continuing to fight for more raises, long-term.

Lastly, ownership/cannabis is mostly greedy, engineering has the potential to be more meaningful in the world.



TL:DR
I’m a married 28-year-old man, my wife (29) and I work at a cannabis company. I’ve been there for three years, started from the bottom and built my department(s). Been saving to go back to school (engineering), when I’m ready to leave for sure, work offers a $20,000 raise and possibly a new role.

CEO is great, owner is always doing coke.

I tried to explain to him that not everyone finds their job fulfilling and that a lot of it is about mindset. But he wants his job to have meaning or do something good. Right now he is a bread delivery guy and he is actually making good money doing it. But he’s not happy doing it. He has no schooling past high school, and he is a self proclaimed terrible student, so he doesn’t love the idea of going back to school.  Before getting into delivery/truck driving, he had worked his way up in restaurants. He was fairly successful in that and on his way to a good career, but the atmosphere is extremely toxic in the restaurant industry and he had to leave. So the majority of his work experience is in restaurants, but it’s not really a place he wants to go back to. Unfortunately that leaves him at 33 with very little work experience.

16jr7az,"Asked to decide how I want to exit the company, what is the best path to take?","I have worked for this company for nearly a year now. There have been a lot of ups and downs, but mostly downs recently. 

The big bosses came this past week and noticed there was a lot going on in terms of neglect at the property. I am the Director of Operations, pretty much in title only at this point, and oversee one specific department out of six. The big bosses do not know this and believe I am involved all around (which I should be). 

I have an Assistant General Manager and a General Manager above me that are responsible for day to day operations of the entire hotel.

I learned from being too friendly with the AGM that the blame was put on me during their meetings. Ever since, I have been receiving baseless e-mails that basically come across as ""you didn't do this or that"" in an attempt to document my neglect. I respond to each of these e-mails in a fashion that states (not exact words here), ""I will get this done, and I apologize for not doing so. I would also like to clarify that going forward this will be my sole responsibility to complete, as we have not previously discussed that this was my responsibility.""

The GM has told me that I don't need to respond to the e-mails and that I should just do the tasks. I told him that I am on property every time he sends me these e-mails and that he can just tell me to get them done. Needless to say, he did not take that well.

I have now been getting a lot of pushback from both the AGM and GM recently and being told I am spreading office gossip and rumors and it's hurting their relationship with the staff and that I have lost all their trust and they would like me to make a decision on what I want to do. 

I countered their argument with the fact that the rumors they mentioned have been spread long before I started at this property, and the AGM himself was well aware and presented a few of the rumors to me himself. I was told the AGM wasn't the person we were discussing and that I was attacking him.

They threw out the idea that I could give my notice, but if I don't then it will be in their hands and they will make a decision for me. He did offer to keep me on as long as needed if  chose to resign, but I believe this is simply because he can not fire me because I know that no one can corroborate what he is saying because it is not true and he can not properly prove that I am neglecting my duties through documentation. Yes, Massachusetts is an at will state, but the company does not terminate unless there are extreme circumstances.

I have not been in this position before, so I don't know where to go or what to do. Obviously, I'm looking for a new job to get out of this hellhole ASAP, but I can't afford to be unemployed at the moment so resignation is pretty much off the table until I get a new job. 

I'm not sure if I would qualify for unemployment if they fire me under these conditions either. I don't know if this is something I could bring to HR, because I know they don't care about the employee as long as the company is doing well. I know they would certainly side with my GM because he has been with them for a decade and I know there have been severe complaints about him in the past in which nothing was done (such as an employee saying that he physically threatened him, which is entirely believable).

Sorry for the long post, it has been an even longer day.

So, all I care about a career is ability to make money and more with more experience ( $60K-$100K+ ), having a fair schedule where I know my schedule a week ahead, benefits and job security ( always get calls from recruiters )  


I'll be getting my permanent residency card in a year or two and one plan is :

  
Join the military ( army / air force ) to be a biomedical equipment tech, get trained and work on equipments, leave when I'm 35-36 years old and make it a career. But from what I heard BMET don't make as much money I would like to make. If you are a BMET in the US, please lmk apprx $$ you make.

  
Second plan is, join the military ( army ) for the shortest MOS ( 3 years ) , complete and use GI Bill 100% to get a STEM related degree. Not sure what major though. I'm good at tests, studying and memorizing.

  
Third plan is join the military ( army ) for the shortest MOS ( 3 years ) , complete and use GI Bill 100% to study for 4 years to become a Registered Nurse. I heard they make $42 out of the college.

16jp8j8,Fired from first real job out of school looking for advice.,"So, as the title says, I was fired from my first serious job after graduating. It was in a career field where I already have a lot of experience through internships and other work. I have never had any issues with my other jobs; however, this one was different. I will be the first to admit there were definitely things I could have done better; however, the office environment was toxic, and I got burnt out rather quickly. This burnout was reflected in my work and attitude towards the job and it was something I was not able to mask as much as I tried. The office had a lot of nepotism, turnover, and poor management. I was promised a job in client management and research but was trained in admin from day one and had my contract changed without my consent. After about six months and change, I was informed through an Outlook calendar invite that I would be being let go. They did not give me a chance to resign and did not comment on why I was terminated, just “We need to let you go,” even after I asked for feedback.   
  
I was told by some fellow employees they would write me recommendation letters; however, the career field I work in can be secretive and high school-like at times. After whatever meeting they held discussing my termination, the employees had a change of heart, even though many are still in contact with me.    
  
I am now trying to figure out how to manage this setback and downplay my firing. I stretched the truth a little after my firing, telling some companies I was looking at I was still employed because I was on the pay role for one more month. However, now that time is up I don't feel like I can ethically continue to use that excess. I have started the interview process with two firms, so hopefully, one of those will work out.   
  
Any advice on how I can do damage control on this? And how I should approach new companies to explain my situation. Thank You!!!

16jp3cb,Electrician wanting out,"Hi so I’m just about over a year into the trade as a “real” journeyman and currently making about 160k a year for a camp job.

For some background I’m 21 and only went into the trade to pay for school/investing in my future and know this isn’t what I want to do forever. Now that I’ve reached that goal, I want to return to school to persue my passion for businesses/ real estate.

I have 2 uncles that have made it pretty big with one making 250k+ in B2B a year, and another in investment banking making more, so I know what the work entails and the stress and lifestyle changes that I will have to overcome.

I currently have about 180k saved with it split between retirement/investments/savings/emergency fund, so realistically 100k which should be enough to attend 4 years of school.

16jor5x,"Salary Negotiation - Over-involved Engineering Major, Quadruple Minor","I would love insight on what employers consider in negotiating starting salaries to overachieving applicants who may have more potential qualifications in candidacy. I'm not sure how much these factors are weighed in consideration.

For context, I'm graduating next year as an Industrial & Systems Engineering Major with quadruple minors (Engineering Leadership, Mathematics, Global Energy, Environment & Resources and International Studies) thanks to a lot of overlap and AP credit.

I'm highly involved and held numerous leadership positions in and worked in diverse environments --hoping to study abroad this summer for a third time. I've done undergraduate research abroad, nonprofit consulting and hopefully venture capital aside from Lean/Six Sigma Green Belt and other scholarship awards. I'm aiming to solidify an internship with Deloitte this summer, and aspire to attend a solid MBA school. I have people skills as an RA on campus if that helps stand out from other engineering applicants.

The only thing is my Bachelor's GPA, which is at a current 3.13, and don't know if that'll deal-break negotiating a higher salary with companies.

I had a few questions:

\- Are there specific attributes I should capitalize on once I start considering job offers ? Will GPA affect this ?

\- How much does an MBA propel me in a starting salary ? Does the school significantly matter ?

\- To what extend could I negotiate for a higher starting salary ?

\- Any specific things I can do or say in my case with these qualifications ?

16jnqor,Economics v Mechanical Engineering,"So I'm really at a crossroads as to which one would be a better Bachelors to pursue

Economics
Pluses:
- Very interesting to me
- Connects well with wanting to start a business
- Has lots of remote positions
- Seems challenging
- Some cool math
Minuses:
- Good pay, but not outstanding
- the theory is fun, the work might be a bore
- Hard to get your first job?
- Programming 

Mechanical Engineering 
Pluses:
- Super challenging
- I could learn to build stuff
- Fun Math
- Some fun science
- Money
Minuses:
- Lack of remote jobs
- I suck at building things
- I'm not sure what the job would be like

Remote work is very important to me. I want freedom. However, I'm not a programmer, and don't want to put in hundreds of hours into learning it. Economics has fun theory, and I enjoy seeing it's connection to politics. Engineering is cool  because you create things. I've never learned how to build, even though I'm good with math and physics. Being able to make something that flies sounds awesome. At the same time, I'm not sure it fits my goal of working remotely, or if I'd even like the work itself. To be fair, I'm not sure I'd enjoy the actual work side of economics either.

16jn3at,"UK 18 years Old - 2 Job Offers - £22,000+Commission vs £30,000+Overtime","Hi everyone,

I'm a teenager in the UK who is 18 years old - recently finished college and completed A levels, but not looking to go to University and am instead looking to travel and work in New Zealand and Australia.  My Dad was from New Zealand, so I am a dual citizen and could live and work in both permenantly. I currently haven't set a limit on how long I am wanting to stay in either - I could be there in my head currently from anywhere from 6 months - 3 years. Looking to leave early next year (between January and March).

I'm looking to work in different bar roles across both countries while travelling as this has always been a dream, and bartending is something I enjoy - I currently have 2 years bar experience working up to 70 hours a week for a 5\* Wedding Venue. Previous experience in restaurants. For a long term career, I am not looking to stay in hospitality and am instead potentially interested in a career in Sales long term. Ideally within a technlogy company as a Sales Development Representative (SDR) initially. 

I've been to multiple interviews and have been fortunate enough to be offered some very good job offers (contracts received) and I'm unsure of what to pick in my current circumstances - I have been in a dilemma for over a week. Both currently think I'm starting with them in the next 10 days, although nothing has been signed. The confusion is from them being completely different roles and opportunities.  


**Job 1:** 

*Head Mixologist / Cocktail Bartender* \- Full Time - 45 hours per week - £12.50/hr (£29,250) + tips & overtime)

Brand new opening fine dining italian restaurant with michelin star executive chefs etc, would mostly be working non-social hours Wednesday to Sunday, mostly evenings 5-12pm. I am used to this, but not in such a restrictive way.   


Pros:

\- Higher base pay  
\- Something I know I enjoy, already have experience in, better job title and experience  
\- Great for CV, helpful for travelling and doing bar work at a higher level.  
\- More premium cocktail experience - 3 monthly rotating cocktail menu, local ingredients, something I'm passionate about, etc.  
\- Better paid than anything else in my local area within bars outside of management, extremely good full time role with a good salary for this industry and my experience  
\- More guaranteed to be able to save a large majority of income (low expenses, much more money to travel)  


Cons:

\- Unflexible anti-social hours. Especially when going abroad for extended time, could I be missing out on evenings and weekends with friends - I've already missed out on a lot of this in my current Bartending Wedding role (but if I wanted to go to something I could with no issue unlike new role)  
\- Continuing hospitality, limited CV work experience  
\- Not something I want to do for a long term career past the next 3 years.

&#x200B;

**Job 2:**   
Sales B2B Telemarketer - Full Time - 36 hours per week - £11.75/hr (£22,000/yr) + commission (250/month guaranteed first 3 months, then undetermined maybe 250-750 a month)  


Local sales agency, works with many different companies to generate leads. Very much cold calling focused. But, seems like a friendly environment to work in - both owners seem great, and spirit between team and management seems good. Potentially a good place to learn, as much as telemarketing gets a bad rep, I do believe that some great skills could be learnt - especially with a friendly local agency and management with lots of experience. Works with many different companies, events, technology, estate agents, software etc.  Monday - Thursday 9-5, Friday 9-3:30.

Pros:

\- Less hours  
\- Commission available  
\- Learning a new industry from scratch  
\- Opening in something I could consider a career (Sales in general), good experience for CV potentially  
\- Potentially more easily get into a sales role a year or so in to NZ/AUS or when I come back to UK compared to no experience  
\- Sociable hours, able to see friends and socialise more without feeling like I'm missing out  
\- Weekends  
\- 10 day shutdown over Christmas without having to use holiday days to spend more time with family before time abroad  
\- Evenings free, and could pickup shifts at current bar venue on Friday evenings and weekends. (Could workout similar income to Job 1, albeit with a few more hours and working two jobs)

Cons:   
\- Less money potentially (depends on extra shifts picked up in current job, commision etc, pay review after 3 months)  
\- May not enjoy the role, and constant cold calling  
\- Could miss the hospitality bartending buzz  
\- May not stay here long enough to fully learn the role and be the best I can be at it, reach full commission etc.  
\- Wouldn't have a different bartending mixology role which would help with future bar employment travelling.  


I could go into both of these roles much more, and am happy to answer any questions and have disccusions with anyone who comments. Any help would be much appreciated. I'm normally used to high stress, fast paced decisions and don't normally doubt myself - with this I've never felt so confused in which path to take. I'm thrilled with both opportunities, and would be happy if I'd have received either. Now that I've received both, I can't determine what would suit my personality and plans for work and savings more because of how different they are in many ways.

16jmjes,"I have options, but I don't know what would be best and would like some input","I currently have a job that I don't want to do anymore. The schedule and the customers are just awful. I hate serving spoiled entitled people and I have been doing it for 6 days a week year round with no holidays for years and I'm just tired of it. I asked for some work/life balance, just 5 days working and 2 days off, and my boss hired someone else and put me on 2 or 3 days working. So it's like, either work my entire life away for a decent living but have no free time, or work only just barely enough to survive and now I'm worried about paying my bills? That's awful. To top it off I've been there for years and shouldn't have been treated that way anyway.

So I'm done with that. I applied for and was accepted into a role at a newly opening restaurant in my area, they are a franchise that has multiple locations out west and are rapidly expanding and I will be training to be a prep cook starting on the 29th. It's $20 per hour with health insurance, with the ability to move up and a corporate structure so I can definitely do something different if I just don't like cooking at all. I'm completely unqualified for this job and will be having to start over learning everything from scratch because I know that everything I've learned in shitty japanese restaurants is going to be wrong and not the way it should be done in expensive fine dining. The managers all seemed confident that I was their guy though and that I should be able to do it, but I'm still worried that I might get filtered out by being ineffective or inefficient or not performing up to standards through the orientation and learning process, then I'll have quit my sure-thing job that I already know how to do and I'm out of the new job too. Lots of worries. It's going to be a lot of hard work that I'm not used to and don't know how to do.

On the other hand, I just interviewed for a position as a lounge server attendant at an international luxury hotel. It's probably the one you're thinking of, they have one in basically every major city across the world. It's $15 per hour plus tips to run food and drinks, help bartenders and servers, clean shit, stock the bar, etc. Basically I'm the lounge bitch, but not a server. I don't have the job for sure, I just have the opportunity to go into a second interview, but when asked about my availability I was honest and I told them that I have the new job's orientation starting the 29th, but I'm not honestly sure it's the job for me so I want to at least go to that and see if I'm successful there. Based on that, the person I interviewed with told me to just go home and think about it and call him if I want to proceed to the next interview because he doesn't want to waste HR's time with getting several people into a meeting to interview me if I end up just going to a different job anyway. But it has a 401k in addition to healthcare, so that's better, plus I know I can blow smoke up rich people's asses for tips, as that's my current job (I just don't like doing it). It doesn't take any special skills to learn how to attend a hotel lounge. And I'll be able to move up through the corporate structure of that company as well.

TLDR: 

Job 1) I already work at a shitty basic restaurant, but it's at least guaranteed $14 per hour plus tips which brings me up to around $25/hr (no benefits), and it's in my comfort zone. If I leave, I'm not coming back, due to personal treatment and my ever-growing resentment of the rich customers and their picky requests. I might be getting pushed out by the owner who is currently trying to save on labor and hire less skilled workers to replace me, but at the same time he's not too sure about them either, so I still have a job just with shitty unpredictable hours and sporadic days off.

Job 2) I have a guaranteed job as a prep cook that I've already submitted tax paperwork for, but it's at a pay cut at $20 per hour no tips, and it's working in an actual real big-boy kitchen where I'll be completely out of my element and learning from scratch and may get fired once they realize I'm awful at it. But if I'm not garbage, I could move up to line cook sooner than later, then I'd make $25 an hour again plus health insurance, and also I could eventually move to manager or whatever and get that 401k. I wouldn't have to deal with the rich people directly, there is a wall of glass between the kitchen and dining rooms, and this might make me feel better about the shity ass picky rich customers since I don't have to see them face to face. Might still hate it though, idk 'till I go do it.

Job 3) I just had what I think was a good interview at a luxury hotel doing foh help for their lounge or bar or whatever, for $15 per hour plus tips (I was assured I'd make at least $25/hr with the tips like my current job), but it's right back to putting on my bullshit act, face to face serving luxuries to the rich, trying to pretend I don't hate everything they stand for. $1000/night hotel with $50 valet service in a shitty B grade city with awful traffic. It's literally built to pamper the worst of the worst; either the local ownership class or more typically the out of state bourgeoise who are just passing through to do a concert or basketball game or corporate event or whatever. 5 stars. I don't have a guaranteed job yet though and in order to get the second interview, which I might not pass, I would have to sacrifice job 2 entirely and they probably wouldn't want me back after being wishy washy with them. But, full benefits package, and the ability to apply to other jobs within the company after 6 months of working.

Obviously leave the first job, since I'm getting fucked around. But sacrificing a job I already have that I might be able to do and it's good honest hard work where I still have a chance to grow, and instead taking a job where I'm guaranteed money and a chance to grow, but it's not honest work, it's the same thing I do now where I act like I'm happy to see people I hate? It's a lot to think about.",JosephPaulWall,2,1.0,0,1694806366,2023-09-15 19:32:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16jmjes/i_have_options_but_i_dont_know_what_would_be_best/,9,2023

16jlawe,Weird resume advice?,"Apologies for the length; I just want you all to have the full context.  I have recently started ramping up a job search as the company I work for is experiencing a lot of instability, financial difficulties, multiple layoffs, etc and upper management is more reactive than proactive.  It's become clear that there is no future here and in fact there's a very real chance that six months from now we will go under.  Our reputation in the industry is in the toilet and is unlikely to improve unless the entire C-Suite is removed and replaced with people who actually know how to run a business.

Anyway, here's my question.  I am in my late 30s and work as a Staff Accountant currently.  I have been in my current position for 2 years and have been working in accounting roles for the last ten years.  Prior to that I mostly worked in purchasing and supply chain jobs but have no desire to return to that as I really love accounting (weird as that may sound).  I currently work in the veterinary medicine/services industry, but prior to my current job the bulk of my career was in the hotel and restaurant industries.  I really like vet med and would like to remain in this industry.  I have a friend/former colleague who left my company a few months ago who offered to take a look at my resume and fix it up to make me more competitive for other accounting jobs in vet med.  However, some of the things she's suggesting seem counter to resume advice I've been given in the past and are genuinely confusing me and I want to make sure that in her zeal to help me escape my current toxic job she's not inadvertently making my resume less strong overall.

She thinks my resume should be truncated down to 1 page as opposed to 2 (which it is now) and I should remove most of my earlier entry-level post-college jobs and put most of the focus on my current job because it's the most relevant to staying in the vet med industry.  

In theory I can understand her reasoning - if I want to stay in vet med my resume should really highlight my experience in vet med.  In practice, I have 16 years' work experience and have been working consistently since I graduated college (save for the COVID interruption), and my resume shows that I have progressive experience in finance and accounting roles (even in my early supply chain roles I was doing inventory control and forecasting).  

I worry that removing all of those early jobs, especially at my age, would give the impression that I haven't been consistently employed, and I think that would make a poor impression on a hiring manager.  I also have always been told that once you move to mid-career level a 2 page resume is the norm - it's not like I'm a recent college grad with a couple of internships and one job.  My 2 page resume has gotten me hired several times (including at my current company) so unless the job market has changed dramatically in the past 2 years I don't really know if I agree that a 1 page resume makes sense for a mid-career professional.

Am I off base here or is she?  I definitely value her input as she's been working in vet med for longer than I have, she's also in accounting, and she just landed a fantastic accounting job in the vet med field after leaving our company so she really knows the specific type of job I am looking to land in.  But truncating a 16 year long career showing progressive experience down to one page would probably end up with me only listing three jobs max.  She says in an interview I would be able to talk about the earlier jobs but would I even be getting an interview with a 1 page resume at nearly age 40?

On top of that, while I've been working in finance and finance-adjacent jobs my whole career I don't have a degree in finance or accounting; I have a kind of irrelevant liberal arts degree from a dubiously fancy school that I have done nothing with.  My degree has literally nothing to do with my career, and so removing a ton of my finance work experience from my resume when I have a random BA I would think would make my candidacy for an accounting position less strong.  I have so much work experience in accounting just by learning on the job that it effectively cancels out the irrelevant college degree.

Look, if my take on things is wrong and her advice would help me in my job hunt I'll happily be wrong and shop myself around with her retooled one page version of my resume!  I'm not trying to say I know better than her - I asked for her advice specifically because she had more experience in this industry than I do.  That said, her suggestions fly in the face of everything I've always been told about how to write a resume, especially with my lack of formal accounting education.  Just wanted to query the hive mind and see if there is a general consensus about whether I should be taking my friend 100% at her word.",newstar7329,0,0.5,1,1694803395,2023-09-15 18:43:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16jlawe/weird_resume_advice/,9,2023
16jl097,Good (possibly remote) jobs for a rural country boy?,"I graduated high school earlier this year and will be taking a gap year. I live in the middle of nowhere in Oklahoma (an hour away from OKC). What are some good jobs for someone in my situation? Willing to do remote, not willing to relocate.

A few things for context:

I am lucky enough to not have to worry about finding a place to live, since I can either live at my parent’s or girlfriend’s house during this time.

I worked two jobs during high school, each for a little over a year. My second job was as a teller at a bank, so I have cash handling and customer service experience.

I consider myself relatively tech savvy. I pick up new skills fairly well with enough practice and time.

I got into a few ivies (yes including Harvard) and other big name schools, went to MIT for a week, realized three things: 1. it wasn’t the right place for me. 2. depression and anxiety do not mix well with one of the hardest schools in the country and living thousands of miles away from home by yourself. 3. untreated sleep apnea sucks even worse than I thought. So I’m technically a college dropout but I am fully planning to go back to (a much easier and more chill) school next year once I am mentally and physically better.

I guess another question is, what can I do during this period of recovery to further my career and make my return to college in the future a little bit easier?

16jkxxz,"Give me some guidance, do I go back to Budapest or do I travel to Spain and become an au pair?","I currently live with my parents but the original plan was to go back to Budapest, find a new flat, and start working while learning Spanish so that I can start my translation masters. However it has been harder than I thought, I have found an apartment for 3 people but it is hard to find 3 people. I also have a lot of stuff at my friends' house, which was supposed to be there until this month. Plus I have been thinking about this lately, flat prices are so out of touch with reality in Budapest and I started playing with the idea of just leaving everything and becoming an au pair in Spain in hopes that my Spanish would get better easier by the time I have to start uni. I used to be an au pair in the past, and was babysitting during uni too.

16jk5mz,Career Advice,"My sister has had a challenging life filled with unfortunate circumstances. She is finally at a point where she can focus on herself & start her career. She’s always been interested in business administration, book keeping and things of that nature. 

She is in her 40s, no college education. She recently completed an administrative Assistant program with Good Will Career Services (📍Toronto)  & they haven’t been supportive in helping her find a job. I’ve been the one helping her look for months now.

For a lot of personal & medical reasons she needs to find remote work. I’m at a loss of how I can help her find administrative kinds of jobs without a degree. 

I asked this question in a local Facebook group & someone recommended a paid government program that lets you do a 52 week certificate of your choice to upgrade your skills. I fear that anything less than a degree is going to be a struggle but considering she needs to start earning an income ASAP she’s thinking this may be her only hope. 

Any suggestions on what certificates are worth it? How does one get their career started without a degree.

She lives in Hamilton Ontario Canada & remote jobs are slim but remote administrative jobs without a degree are almost impossible. (She also suffers from anxiety, she’s tried sales and customer service jobs & those haven’t worked out well) 

If you have any suggestions for programs, job boards beside indeed & LinkedIn or any other suggestions would be awesome.

I hope you are fine.  
  
I need your advice regarding my academic situation.  
  
After spending 2 years in an engineering university, I was selected for a double degree exchange program in a top engineering uni abroad, a program that lasts 2 years.  
  
After spending 2 years in this exchange program, I only passed 60 credits (the required number of credits was 120 credits) and due to health problems, I decided to withdraw from this exchange program and go back to my home university to finish the last year and only get the engineering degree from my home university. Even worse, I wasn’t able to transfer the 60 credits to my home university degree because of incompatibility with the syllabus.  
  
Now, I feel shitty and remorseful about having wasted 2 years in the double degree program without getting the degree.  
  
Do you think it’s legal and doable that I mention the 2 years I spent in the exchange university on my CV and LinkedIn as a simple exchange program ? Before leaving the host university, I got an enrollment certificate where it s mentioned that I spent 2 years there and I earned 60 credits and the courses that I passed.

But there are some points that are just hard to deal with and if someone has any advice feel free to share.

1. The position is unforgiving for mistakes or being the guy who just 'doesn't know'. All I can say I don't know a lot and sometimes I get encounters where I should. 
2. I wouldn't say I feel 'accepted' as for now which makes everything just harder - getting info or 'feeling comfortable'. It's not like people hate me (i think), it's like somewhere between not liking. 
3. Because of the second point I feel stressed and anxious inside and it doesn't help with any of the points.
e.g. Had a meeting and thought I really need to start talking even though i'm not comfortable and said something not really accurate because of anxiety. Didn't feel too good all I can say low key was laughed at. :/.

16je1mi,"Joined a company with bad team culture, the work isnt bad, but i dont know if i can deal with this and concerned about breaking up job history","I started a job at a company on a team that i later found out had a walk out of 5 people in december after they mandated return to office.

The one person that left is a ""problem employee"".  Who had been pushed to 3 teams and constantly moved around.  They replaced everyone with over seas contractors (22 year old, poor technical skills) and myself. Making  me the lead.

&#x200B;

The problem employee and one of the contractors each independenlty stoppped doing their responsibilities for 1 month plus.    we had daily scrums. and they just never started anything they were assigned.  They put the problem employee on pip.

But, like the team does not have the technical skills to do the work on the team anyways and multiple people are putting hour long meetings on my calender DAILY. because they are unable to do any of their own work.

I am not their manager and have to document extensively. and even then, its kind of documenting what one of your peers is doing at work, because i dont have any authority over them nor do i assign them work

&#x200B;

**my thoughts on situation**

yes, i could ride them or continue to escalate.  but, its just the team culture imo.

one of the 22 year old contractors admitted to skipping work for an entire month because he was actually at his moms place. and they didnt want to reprimand him because it would make him feel like he ""isnt on the varsity"" team anymore.  

also, even if i sat around and escalated. being a new hire. i see this reflecting poorly on me.  so ive decided to leave but am unsure about how it look on  my resume.

**last 10 years of job history**

4 years fortune 50 company

16 months fortune 100 company ( 2 jobs within same company)

14 months fortune 100 company

13 months consulting at a very well known consulting firm

6  months current job. its the same company that i was at for 14 months a job ago.

&#x200B;

im also a blend of data engineering, data science, IT, and analytics.  but worked in the advertising industry (high turnover).

**questions**

1. **what would you do if you joined a company and are put on a horribly performing team? like the point where two people on the team didnt contribute from june thru august. like no excels, powerpoints, or code. would you leave or stick it out??**

16jddhp,"Should i delay starting my career for a nice, guaranteed, opportunity? (X-post)","Hi,  
I am 21 and expect to graduate with a bachelors in financial engineering next spring (May 2024).  
I had been working in the restaurant industry inconsistently for a year. I dedicated this past summer to branch out and assist a manager of mine in opening his cocktail bar. The bar did very well and as such I was offered to take a co-manager role with a ""sister"" restaurant of ours (same owners/investors).  
I like the bar a lot but the working hours are difficult on my mental health, working to 1-3 am, having to get home, and get to school in the morning. Additionally, I will not be offered a step up to a more managerial position there, in the foreseeable future.  
The manager job offers more reasonable hours but a bigger commitment, being a co-manager. Though, the restaurant is willing to be flexible to an extent, during my studies. Them compromising on shifts during my studies, they want a ""gentleman's agreement"". In that i will commit to an entire year to them, working full time. As in my first year from graduating (Summer 2024- fall2025).  
My questions are:  
whether or not it's worth it to sacrifice my first year as a graduate to an industry not directly related to my field? More generally if it is reasonable of me to expect to get a nicey job right out of school, or if a masters is required?  
Whether having managerial experience is considered in applications to positions in financial / consulting institutions ?  
If delaying the start of my career will inhibit my career in the long term?  
\-In the same vain, if my assumption is correct, that the salary progression in corporate is greater than that of the restaurant industry?  
If anyone has been in a situation similar to mine and could share insights?  
Finally, if I'm making too big a deal of this? I've always considered myself very analytical and I view this as kind of a pivotal point in my life. However all the older people i talk to give me the same old line of ""you're young, do what excites you, no regret"". I very much get that view but as the young person in question I can't experience myself as ""young"". I've only ever lived as long as i have, and each decision feels major. On top of that, ""what excites me"", is both options. Being a manager, excites me, getting a start in corporate, excites me as-well.  
Extra considerations:  
(positive) The reason I say ""gentleman's agreement"" is that I've talked with the owner and in the event I get a great offer in my field he will understand and let me leave without any grievance.  
(positive) Taking a break from academics for a year and going for my masters afterwards sounds like a nice idea.  
(missing info) I've yet to have a discussion about salary. It will most likely be better than any entry position in the corporate environment where i live.  
(negative) I expect to lose most of my free time (social time) which is especially hard seeing as I have very nice friends and an incredible girlfriend.  
(\~) I never planned on me becoming so integrated into the restaurant industry and always expected to go into more corporate work. I do enjoy this line of work, though.  
(\~) I'm not on track for the dean's list, but am on track for 1st honors (avg. > 7.2 /10).

16jcorl,Am I entitled to compensation from my employer?,"I'm not really sure, but I wanted to ask anyway. 

I got a job at a gas station, and somehow somewhere my hiring forms weren't approved/completed correctly so the system said I was terminated. 

At first, my manager said to keep working and she'd figure it out. We redid the hiring forms, and again, they came back somehow not completed. However I have screenshots saying that everything was completed and I had no active/ongoing tasks.

I get a text from my coworker saying ""[The manager] told me to tell you not to come in today, she's calling customer support."" I was bummed but agreed and took what I thought was a day off. 

I texted my manager multiple times, called, even emailed during the following days and even a week or two after that. After the 3rd or 4th day with no reply I had already started putting more applications in because I was panicking. 

I went in to get the stuff I had left at the store, and my coworker was shocked to see me. She said, ""Why haven't you been here? You've been on the schedule this whole time."" 

I didn't know this. I could have been working if my manager had just communicated with me.

Fast forward to 4 weeks now, my paycheck for the little days I worked before being ""ghosted,"" is 2 weeks late. Because my forms were ""not completed,"" my I-9 wasn't accepted and according to my manager, I can't and won't be paid until it's done. 

But I'm exhausted. I've gone back and forth 5 times now and don't understand why it's not completed. Thank goodness I'm in an okay situation where my bills aren't swamping me, but what if they were and that job and paycheck was the deciding factor in keeping my apartment?

I work in radiology in central North Carolina,
, most recently as a general x-ray tech. I quit in May due to constant childcare issues (my spouse makes enough that we could scrape by and we had a bit of a nest egg to pull from for bills as well). At the time I quit, I was making $32/hr. 


I recently got the opportunity to get trained into the cath lab, which is a rare position to come available but also a pretty intense job. From all of my research on average salaries for this position, I was going into this interview expecting around $35-39/hr. Interview went well (although pay wasn't discussed) and I was excited to move forward with the position. I got my offer letter yesterday and the hourly is $29/hr. Less than I was making doing a less strenuous job just a few months ago. 


Granted, these are different hospitals but they're in the same geographic region. But if I were to take the job, most of my paycheck would go to childcare. I have three one year olds and we'd be paying $3800-$4000 a month. 


Do I take the job and hope that there is something I'm missing as far as pay? Maybe an increase after I finish training?

16jawaz,A total rant!,"I work for a private hs with people who aren't technologically inclined. I have a MS in info systems and a firm background in data analysis with python,  SQL etc. I've tried leveraging these skills for the school and they either think I just brute force copy and paste everything into spreadsheets,  because that's what they do (when in fact it's power query) or they say they're not really into understanding PowerBi dashboards I painstakingly create to benefit their decision making! Today I learned that my manager (don't even want to call her my boss bc she's just a mess of a person) said that they can't accommodate my abreviated summer schedule for next year (that they had no problem letting me have this past summer because I'm ""so valuable"")--where I could be available for my kids--bc they need me in the office now. Last year she told me the summer is laxed after Jul 1 but now it's not anymore. Mind you I've never not given them what they want and they always say I'm amazing but then they just want to control me. I basically told her no problem. I'll just work up until the summer. I know she was shocked bc she said,  ""what do you mean? "" I just said again,  I guess it's just not going to work out so I'll just work up until the summer. She was quiet for a moment I suppose because she thought I would just bow down to her. I know what people think... you have to do what the ""boss"" wants... but come on!

16j9nn9,Is it worth wasting 40 hours a day in a mindless micromanaged job?,"Hi everyone. I am fortunate to have a job after a layoff. I thought it would only be three months until something new came along but clearly the market is a bit more brutal. It’s been 10 months and I feel like I’m wasting my brain capacity in this job. I spend 8 hours a day at a desk, being micromanaged, and when I don’t have work I still need to just sit there. I need to at least have items open because my boss is right by me. I’m not allowed to pursue online learning because it’s not relevant (is their opinion). 

My goal is to work in consulting because industry has always bored me. I need to be learning more and doing more. 

Deep down I know this job is holding me back. I also know that this is not the time to lose an income and have been actively networking to land a new job. Unfortunately I get many “you were great but we went with another candidate” replies.

16j8ftk,Material engineer first job," My name is Lior and I am a second/third-year student at Tel Aviv University studying for a Bachelor's in Material Engineering and Chemistry.  
I say second/third year because I have some courses mixed from various years as I started the degree with several courses I did before joining the University.  
Anyway in the last year or so, I have been trying to get into the industry with a student position, I've had interviews in several places but I was mostly me with being declined and told that it's too early in my degree for said position.  
I'm on the cusp of being accepted into the ICL (Israeli Chemical Laboratories) (last step is medical tests) scholarship which is as follows:  
\- ICL pays my yearly tuition (15k nis a year)  
\- ICL gives me a monthly stipend of 1,400 nis for living expenses  
\- Once a week I am to do a shift as a process engineer in the ICL Rotem Factory and during semester breaks I have a full-time job there as a process engineer.  
For every year that I participate in this scholarship, I am obligated to work for ICL as a full-time engineer when I finish my bachelor's. If I decide to break this contract I have to return the amount that they 'spent' on me during the scholarship (around 30k nis a year).  
I have my own pluses and minuses regarding whether or not to take the job but I wanted to post this in hopes someone can give me an opinion on the career side of the decision.  
I've always wanted to go into the green energy field as a material engineer and eventually work my way into something that's related to space exploration.  
The job I'm offered at ICL is one that's more for a chemical engineer rather than a material one in a factory that works on fertilizers and I'm worried that if I decide to leave ICL after my four years there the experience I've gained there won't be relevant to the field of material engineering and I'll essentially start from scratch in a junior position without any experience.  
I would really appreciate any and all comments regards my issue, whether it is further questions about my situation which I am happy to provide, or suggestions/thoughts about what I should do.

16j5r1n,Qualify for a job 33-40k more than my last job - what salary range do I say I expect?,"Hello! I am in an odd position where I went into uni later in life after owning my own business and working as an Editor in Chief for a statistics magazine. I have a Bachelor of Business (Economics) with a focus on Econometrics (this isn't usually important but for what I do, it is), a minor in Statistics and a minor in Indigenous Knowledges (and I am Native American, living in Australia, with close ties to mob here). I am in part-time postgraduate studies for my Economics Honours, a Masters Equivalent (ie I can go to PhD from here) in this country, depending on who actually knows that (jobs don't seem to realise this unless they're for unis or research roles). My Post-grad thesis is in Bayesian Statistics for cancer, but its in the Economics and Maths departments of the uni, but I find Bayesian statistics has so many applications that the 'cancer' part doesn't really negate the 'economics' part of me.   
Short story - I am an EXTREMELY mathematical economist. And ""mathematical"" is a  giant gold star on my resume (as is my being Indigenous as jobs get kickbacks for it). So, I do have a fairly shiny resume that kind impresses myself? ""Wow, I can do all the things I list here."" I know super advanced Excel, psot-graduate level R-Studio, moderate Python and post-graduate level Stata, as well as work experience in ArcGIS.

My last job which I got FIRED over because, well, I'll just quote them, ""We don't like telling you what to do because you always do exactly what you're told""....  well it paid 75k a year. Which I was VERY happy with. However, it did teach me ArcGIS which seems to be super valuable to this job I'm applying for (it's on their ""not needed but OMG IF YOU DO"" list). I  only worked there for FOUR MONTHS so a job from ""fired"" at 75k to a job offering 109k MINIMUM seems like a HUGE leap, right?

YADDA YADDA... worked a job 4 months (Economics Graduate)where I was let go because of a mismatch of management/worker styles being paid 75k. However, I can do ALL OF THE SKILLS and THEN some of a job offering 109-115k. I have the experience it requires for the management portions because of my pre-uni work and my experience in statistics through uni.

I asked around and someone who works in hiring graduate economists said I was worth ""70-75k"" HOWEVER MY UNION says I am worth ""as much as I deserve, if I can do the job, so if it's 130k, it's 130k!"" 

So given ALL OF THAT - should I offer myself up as ""rejected fresh meat"" for a lower pay than they're offering at all... which sounds like a terrible idea.  Should I ask for 109k, which is literally 33k more than I made EVER, because I have the skills...or because I even have the extras, should I ask for the 115k? For my job and location, the average base is 58k and the average-overall is 78k. This is for a NEW graduate, which I am, but an OLDER new graduate.  


In order to secure an interview, what amount would YOU say you were expecting in this circumstance? My friend, who I think believes in me the most, says go for the 115k.

16j55vg,"Verbally berated and yelled at by someone I supervise, and now I'm terrified.","Sorry, this is going to be super long, but I really need help with what to do and I feel like a full picture is necessary!

I am a school-based occupational therapist on my 5th year of practice. I was hired by an agency to finish up the 22-23 school year in May and the district continued my contract for this 23-24 school year. The thing is, the district didn't have an OT for 3 months before hiring me, so there were 3 months worth of make-ups to complete in addition to my caseload. I had one OT working with me for the month of May to complete the make-ups and the regular sessions (after 1 month, she started a different job), and I continued to work through ESY to cover some for make-ups as well. In total, we completed about half of the make-ups once school started.
The company hired a COTA (OT assistant) to begin in September (through the end of October) to help with the remaining make-ups, and I was assigned as his supervisor (also in charge of signing his timecards). Before he was hired, I also advocated for him to get more hours so that he could be working full-time and had ample time for whatever was needed. All the students he does make-ups for are my students that I also regularly treat and attend meetings for.
I thought it was weird that when I first met him, he seemed very insistent on not receiving any information on the students and wanting to be independent with scheduling. He made it clear all he wanted was the student names and their locations and that he'd take care of the rest. I still introduced him to all the teachers and students so that they could be familiar with his face, and also gave him notes on the students (what they like, what they don't like, what their goals are, who works well together in groups, etc.). I offered to share my materials with him, which he declined.

After receiving the students and their number of remaining make-ups, he commented that he doesn't know how he's going to fill his contract time since there were way less make-ups than he expected. At this point, I asked if so, if he'd be willing to help with a whole classroom session (1x/week, 25 mins), to which he again rejected and said no. I was taken aback, but I'm really awful at being assertive and I figured he wanted to focus on make-ups, so I accepted what he said for now. However, I confirmed with my boss that if he had free time, he should be helping with whatever treatments I need help with, especially given that I have many assessments/meetings coming up.

On the Friday of his first week, I asked him if he had his schedule for me to which he said no, and I asked if he could send it to me by Tuesday (Monday was Labor Day) because I needed to relay the information to parents and also see how much free time he has to determine what other treatments he can help me with (I made it clear that our boss had ok'ed this). He never responded to my email, and when I followed up with him on Wednesday morning, all he emailed was that he would send me his schedule by Friday and also gave me a general idea of which schools he'd be at each day. At this point, I asked him if he needed help with scheduling or if any teachers were giving him trouble because his caseload was only about ~20 students but it was taking him 2 weeks to schedule. He never responded to this as well.

On Friday, when I received his schedule, I was further confused as to how it took him 2 weeks to schedule and wondered if he even really scheduled with the teachers because all of the students had individual treatments (even students I had mentioned should be grouped), some students were not at the correct schools, and some were scheduled during their lunch/recess. I sent him a follow-up email with notes re: some errors/discrepancies I saw in his schedule as well as some questions, and this time, all he responded was ""Thanks for the clarification!""

This Monday, I looked at his schedule and I intentionally assessed a student at 9:45AM in the morning because I saw that he was treating him in the morning. However, when I got to the classroom, his teacher mentioned that the other therapist had scheduled the student to be grouped with another student for 10AM that morning. When I saw the COTA, I told him that I'm sorry that I had to assess the student and I based it off the schedule he sent me, and he seemed irritated. After my assessment session, I had to quickly go to my next school to do more testing.

Later, I asked if he had time for a quick chat because I wanted to clear the air. Over the phone, I started by apologizing for the miscommunication in the scheduling and asked if his schedule changed from what he had sent me. This set him off. He started yelling at me saying that he's worked at many different school districts, but he has never worked with any supervisor or director more micromanaging or impatient than me. He also continued to berate me saying that I pressured him multiple times into emailing me his schedule. I had never been yelled at by a colleague, and I felt myself getting really scared, shaking, and on the verge of tears. I told him I didn't mean to come off micromanaging and that I honestly only emailed him 4 times in the 2 weeks that we started working together. I also tried to explain to him that because I am the students' primary therapist, I just wanted to make sure I knew what was going on, since I'm the one going to their IEP meetings and communicating with their parents. He then continued by saying that I seemed pissed off at him and didn't say 'hi' or 'bye' to him that day. I, again, was super confused because when I first came into the classroom, the student he was working with said hi to me, so I said hi, and I was directing it to both of them. I also didn't say 'bye' because he was outside with a student doing an outdoor activity and I didn't know where they were and wasn't going to go find them when I had to go to my next school site. Additionally, I typically don't like to interrupt other therapist sessions and usually like to quietly enter/exit so that the student can focus. He was huffing and puffing and raising his voice and just seemed so angry the whole time we were on the phone, and I was profusely apologizing the whole time. Looking back, I feel so stupid for doing this, but again, I'm generally a very passive person and I've been trying to work on being more assertive, but because the direction of this conversation took me by surprise, I didn't have the chance to. We ended the conversation by him asking me if we're good and I just said yes and continued to apologize for the miscommunication and for micromanaging. He didn't apologize to me once.

I was initially not going to bring this up to my boss because of fear of retaliation, but when I found out that they were considering extending his contract, I talked to my boss about the incident. She informed me that he said he only wanted to work through the end of October, and asked if I wanted her to speak to him, but I told her no since he wouldn't be extending. She said it's probably best to just avoid him and to interact with him as little as possible so as to not set him off. I agree with her and I really don't want to trigger him, but at the same time, I feel so upset, hurt, and genuinely stupid. I know I brought this upon myself, but I really don't know what to do from here. I'm genuinely terrified of him, and I'm scared to share a space with him. I also feel uncomfortable signing his timecard, knowing he's only working 10-15 hours per week but getting paid for 30+ hours per week.

Does anyone have a similar experience in a supervising role? What am I supposed to do?",macandcheeeez,1,1.0,0,1694757494,2023-09-15 05:58:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16j55vg/verbally_berated_and_yelled_at_by_someone_i/,9,2023

I’m work from home for a company in a different state and get paid salary, not hourly. They have another office based in another state as well. 

In all the jobs I’ve worked for, I’ve always gotten (2) 15 minute breaks, however I was always hourly. This time I don’t have that break. I’m also told I need to work 40 hours even though I’m salary. To me this seems weird, but whatever. 

My question is if any of this is legal? It was my understanding that California workers are entitled to paid 15 minute breaks.

16j4t87,Full remote contract to hire vs. in person full time,"TLDR: deciding between positions, looking for advice

Context: first job out of college

Contract to hire position:
- fully remote and can live at home (save a lot of money)
- 6mo contract with full time possibility after (not guaranteed - what I was told by the recruiter is that they do these types of positions “with the intention of hiring afterwards” based on performance, but based on the economy, budget, etc. could just end up extending the contract instead) based on performance

Full time:
- security clearance position
- will have to relocate to a city with a high-ish cost of living
- government agency and expect it to be stable

Will say the contract to hire position does seem more -fun- based on the team I talked to but given the current market I am worried if things take a turn for the worse at the 6 mo mark I’ll be once again unemployed. That being said, being fully remote has its obvious perks and benefits.. 

Full time pays more but only slightly (4k) and allegedly the contract to hire will match or exceed that if I get brought on full time afterwards.

16j2ii5,nervous about failing background check?,"i just received an offer for a case manager position dealing with estate management and im subject to employment, sra and credit check.

im not too worried about employment/ sra check but im nervous about the credit check.

i just graduated (class of 2023) and have had a maxed out overdraft of 1,500 for the last few months, esp as a student away from home with the cost of living crisis in the uk. i had a part time job for the last 2 years but thats mainly paid for rent, bills and food expenses.

ive read that during credit checks overdrafts can show up as debts and ill show up as having a debt. im worried bc my credit score is just 'ok.' i recently missed a payment for spotify premium bc i forgot to transfer money into my account a few days before the payment was due - what a stu\[pid mistake i know :(

ive been on time for rent, bills and other payments.

with this position does anyone know if my credit check could potentially be failed bc of this? im about to add 200 into that account to reduce the overdraft a bit and am working to pick up as many shifts as possible but im really nervous about it. (i have intense anxiety issues and tho ive been offered the job im terrified of it being withdrawn bc of a failed credit check) am i just overreacting?

my credit score is due to be updated in 2 days as well and i have a sinking feeling its going to be reduced more.

any advice appreciated? thanks in advance.

16j17sy,"Coworker who I work closely with constantly badmouths others, what to do?","I just started a new job in March 2022 and tired very hard to start off on the right foot. My workplace is a bit toxic, well can be very toxic, and there is lots of gossip that goes around. I tried to keep my mouth shut and then was told over and over that I’m too quiet, etc.

I was moved to a business unit where there’s only one other person. She is an older woman who’s been there about 12 years. We were moved to sit right next to each other.

When we sat apart, she would constantly rush over to my desk and tell me about emails I needed to look at right then, did I do this, did I do that, etc. It would always make me feel bad since I was working as hard and fast as I could sitting next to two not friendly managers who just gossiped and complained a lot and were always rude when I asked a question. 

I’ve since moved to be next to the woman in my unit and we started to really get along. Had several good laughs, getting to know each other, we chat all day about work, I can ask her questions and she helps me a lot. 

But she can also kinda bad mouth others. Her latest person she is badmouthing is the coordinator who newly manages the business unit email inbox, something she was doing before but was completely overwhelmed with. She goes and checks the inbox many times a day and freaks out that he hasn’t sent us the emails yet. He is brand new and just learned two way bigger inboxes and ours was last to learn. Training is very minimal and managers are not very helpful, so I feel for the new guy. I was the one being ragged on before.

So, I haven’t really corroborated in my coworkers bashing of the new guy, and my coworker seems to like me less for it. I have agreed with her on accounting issues or shipping issues. But I don’t want to gossip with her or bash people who I’m sure are doing their best…

16j166k,Pivoting to some kind of remote work from Construction? Dual Citizen (US/IT),"I'm in my mid 30's and I've been in the residential construction field for over 10 years. Started out working for others, had my own little handyman/small renovation business, worked as a site supervisor for a national builder, then left to go back out on my own. I currently have two employees, but we do larger remodeling/reno's.

The grass is always greener, I know, but it's a tough job and I've been thinking more and more how nice it was to be able to leave work at the end of the day and just live my life. It doesn't help that all the people I've worked for the past few years have mostly been working from home, and I'm honestly a little jealous.

My question is-where could I reasonably go from here? I enjoy working in this field, but it seems impossible to find remote work. I have experience managing people, budgets, tight deadlines, and pretty extensive building knowledge. But without a college degree or a specialization, I don't see any real path out.

In July, my coworker was fired who started in March. I work in a high responsibility customer service role, and aparently he was behind on orders and hiding emails and falsifying metrics. They held a department meeting a couple hours after they fired him, and told us all why he was fired and basically threatened us, if we are late on any emails etc. we’re done.

Last week, they fired another guy who’d been there about a year. The managers talked horribly to him, really condescending and rude. He apparently wasn’t catching on well, I’d have to agree, because the things he would say most times wouldn’t make sense, wasn’t how stuff worked.

I’ve gone back and forth on if I want to continue with this company. I definitely don’t want to stay in this department. We take the blame for everything and have a lot of responsibility.

16j0hy9,Very burnt out and job worries keeping me up at night,"I'm a data analyst and have been at my current company for about three years. Most of the time i've been there I have enjoyed it. Interesting and challenging work, supportive coworkers, given autonomy and trusted to purse my ideas.

 One common theme though is I have always been given way too much to handle. I am supporting too many accounts and some I don't even have time to devote time to. I have been telling my manager for about 6 months that when we come to our busy season i will be very overloaded. They told me we were looking to add someone to our team. Well busy season is underway and now we will hopefully add someone early next year. 

My boss also recently started a tracker for me and him for writing all our projects and deadlines. He wants me to write every thing on there for prioritization even if little. The work load is so intense and we are churning out requests from leadership to build this and that and because I'm overloaded I feel like my quality of work is suffering. 

In the past, my manager and former manager have valued my creativity and ideas and let me be mostly autonomous. However lately I feel as if my ideas are being shot down and I'm being more micro managed. It keeps me up at night because I feel like I'm not doing enough. 

I think it's time for me to move on and start looking for a new job but I have concerns because what if the new position is worse?

16izxk7,Ex tech-journo looking for advice.,"I'm desperately trying to figure out how to find a new career, as I'm in an extremely unique position and don't know what to do. Here goes - apologies for the long read.

I'm age 47 - at age 22 I started a Computer Science degree. I did 18 months of the 3-year course, but was approached by a computer magazine to move to Sydney and work full time for them. That was in 2000, and for the next 19 years I had a simply incredible career writing about computers, games and technology. I specialised in reviews, and worked for the biggest magazines in Australia, and the biggest websites online. I climbed my way to the top as Editor in Chief at several of these. In the middle of this job I did a 2-year stint in PR working for a major game publisher, but soon went back to writing. I had a full-time job for all of those years, and also did freelance writing on the side to make more money. I worked extremely hard, but because I loved it, I was happy to. I can't overstate how much I loved my job, and feel so incredibly lucky for those 19 years.

Unfortunately in 2019 I had a life changing event - I was visiting America for a press trip, and in my spare time went to a gun range for some fun target shooting (as this is impossible in Australia). Unfortunately I was involved in a horrific suicide at the range, which utterly broke me for the next 2 years. I almost drank myself to death, and screwed up all my work contracts. I became broke and almost homeless... and then my long-absent father died, and left me a small fortune. It's almost enough to live on for the rest of my life. 

I got sober after a lot of work in rehab, and then rebuilt my life. In 2021 I bought a house, moved in with my wonderful partner, and then realised I don't want to just sit around doing nothing all day. Unfortunately the industry I used to work in basically no longer exists - people now turn to YouTube for reviews, and at age 47 nobody wants to see me. I'm a writer, not a video presenter. The handful of websites that still do reviews do not hire new people - the tech writing industry is basically dead.

So I went back to university to study game development in 2022. By the end of the first year I realised the course was an utter scam, as my experience in the game industry showed that what they were teaching was next to useless. I left, and at the start of 2023 I started a very expensive 3D modelling course online, which promised to train me in 3D in just nine months. By the end of the first term, I realised that I'd need to train for many years to get anywhere in the industry. The online course also failed to deliver many of the things it promised. So I left.

Since May this year I've been doing bugger all, and I'm going a little crazy. I need to figure out what to do with my life. I have a very strong interest in technology and computers, but my knowledge is extremely specific. Nobody hires a person to benchmark 20 motherboards these days!

I'm very keen to go back to school to learn something new, as I love the learning experience, but the Aussie university sector has become all about the dollars it earns through international students, and less about teaching the students. 

I find CyberSec very interesting, but have no idea which courses I can attend which are industry recognised and worth doing - note I'm still in Australia, but there's a lot online. I've seen many courses for CyberSec, but then I've also found certain certifications that are required. If anyone can point me in the right direction, or suggest other work I'm qualified for, I'm all ears. Money is not a concern whatsoever - but finding a satisfying role is.

16izqan,Toxic Leadership in a Small Town IT Shop,"Hi All, we all deal with incompetent's bosses sometime in our career, sometimes its better to pack our bags and leave, but in todays economy its not as easy.  
  
Background, this person has quite a bit of tenure, but not much technical skills, we are a small department in a small government in the Midwest, and have to deal with the growing pains with such environment.  
  
The level of incompetence and unprofessionalism has reached a boiling point. Just bit of the issues are them the taking 2 hour lunches, leaving early without using leave, using a government vehicle for personal errands and commuting, vulgar name calling of other department heads just to name a few, some things you let slide , but when a leader can not meet the competence and basic leadership duties of their role, I feel like this really gets under your skin. So...the boiling point... we recently migrated to our antivirus solution that required all of our computers to be brought in on the domain...well a laptop of mentioned supervisor hadn't been on the network for some time, and needed the local admin password updated, windows updates, AV updates etc. The computer was on our workbench in the center of the office, and the start menu was open...If you ever have the photos app pinned as your live tile on the start menu, it does a slideshow of your pictures folder on your user profile...and guess what was the first picture in the slideshow... a dick pick of this person.....It has been quite embarrassing to say the least, especially in a small department, and all of the above issues fore mentioned.. it has really snowballed into a toxic work environment.  
  
Otherwise the role has been a great learning opportunity and I have excelled in growing my IT skills, but the gross incompetency and this event have really crush my endeavors and mental health.... Normally I would pack my bags and depart, but to throw away decent pay, good insurance, and decent commute isn't as easy as it seems... What would you all do? Is worth going to HR?

My company is being bought out by a larger Japanese company. It is a Boston based company but five years ago I relocated to Texas with them. 

The corporate office was always really casual. My office is in a depot so even more casual. 

Now with the sale, I’ve been invited back to Boston to meet the new owners and discuss a new opportunity. 

The opportunity was presented to him by his new boss and I was his immediate recommendation. I only say that to say that this isn’t really a job interview and I’m not competing with anyone for it. My boss is the CEO and we’ve working together for 6 years. 

That said. 
Should I take out my septum ring for the meeting? It’s very small and the full ring, not the traditional one.

It’s a dumb reason not to get something out, but we had a bunch of other work to get done and I didn’t do enough to make sure this arrived by the need by date. 

I’ve come to the conclusion I’m just going to need to suck it up and accept my ass chewing. There’s nothing I can do to make the tools show up. Im thinking I just call the guy in the morning, tell him I fucked up and I’m not going to be able to keep my promise, let him get pissed off, then ask him what I can do to make this right.",SnooSketches1814,8,0.8999999761581421,12,1694733058,2023-09-14 23:10:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16ix0yp/made_my_first_big_mistake_at_work/,9,2023
16iwyx2,English Major Graduate Trying to Enter the Job Market. Doesn't Know Where to Start. Please Help,"Hello everyone. So I think Im going to give you a few quick facts about my situation.

  
\- I have my BA in English  
\-I have no interets in becoming a teacher  
\-I have no interest in social media, or social media careers. It just doesn't spark any interest or understanding with in me. I have always been like this.

  
\-I am getting my MFA in Visual Development: I decided to get my masters a couple months into the pandemic. It was a very impulsive decision. I still want the degree because Im literally half way done with it, but I dont think I would want the career of a visual artist. I really dont know. Im not really enjoying what Im learning and how Im learning. The classes are online and I also feel my skill as an ""artist"" isn't improving. It's not the worst thing ever, just not what I thought it would be. But this could just be because I have never enjoyed school and learning for the sake of a degree or grade. Also my mom really really really wanted me to get my masters in something, because she believes that it will guarantee a high paying job eventually. She's alone and doesn't have any financial support and doesn't want me to end up in a similar financially struggling situation.

  
\- I have been working as a Starbucks Barista for about 4 years and Im ready to quit: I just feel as if it's time for me to move on to the next step. I have no interest in being a barista, Im not getting paid enough, and we just got a new manger and she is literally the most anal person on the planet. It's just time for me to do something else.

  
\-I have a strong interest in storytelling, especially visual storytelling. I love how art is an expression of the human experience and the different ways it can be molded by people. I always saw myself in some kind of creative field, with lots of words, ideas and images being conjured up. But I guess I also have a curiosity surrounding the writing that goes on behind movies and television. Characters, story arcs, etc.

  
\-With my interests, my BA and future MFA I don't know where or how to begin professionally. I don't know what jobs to search for. I dont even know if my interests can transfer over to a job. Also I feel as if I have zero skills. I write but it's mostly for myself. I know people say that being and English major means that you gain the skills of critical thinking, communication skills, analytical skills, observation skills but how does that transfer to a job or internship? How can I apply myself for jobs or internships? Do I absolutely need to have an internship under my belt before acquiring a job?

  
I know that this is the time where I need to hustle and hunt for a job and that it's going to take a while to get where Im going. And Im fine with that. I just don't understand where or how to start. Ive just been scrolling on Indeed and feel as if I lack proper direction. Am I in a bad position? It feels like I am sometimes. Most of the time. I also don't really know anyone working in a creative field. People in my proximity are doing more social work, nursing, engineer type careers. I like what I want to do, doesn't really exist sometimes. Like my interest aren't valid and they won't take me anywhere.

  
Can anyone else relate? Are there any resources I should defiantly be using? What was this period in life like for you? Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you so so much.",AvailableSlide7561,2,1.0,1,1694732902,2023-09-14 23:08:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16iwyx2/english_major_graduate_trying_to_enter_the_job/,9,2023
16iwpqq,Questions about studying psychology,"Hey, so I have some questions about studying psychology. I have a computer science bachelor's and I do web design (UX/UI design) as a freelancer, and I'm considering psychology because I have always been very interested about it, and it seems to me that becoming a therapist and helping people with their problems would be the most fulfilling job ever. However, I would like to keep doing web design, so do you think I can do both at the same time? (studying psychology / working as a therapist and web design freelancing on the side). Please let me know about psychology as a career path in general.

Some say that you need a PhD to become a therapist. Maybe it depends on the country (I'm more targeting the EU/UK), but I'm thinking that even if I just get my bachelor's and stop, the degree would still help me with web design at the very least. Is this true?

Also, and maybe most importantly of all, how can I know that I really would like being a therapist? It's not something that I can really try doing beforehand to know if it's for me, is it?

16ivrt5,Boss not giving me a chance to develop despite this being agreed actions,"
So yeah I’m getting a bit frustrated with my current role. I’ve been in the role for a few years now and I’m the second most experienced member on the team. There is one other girl who has done the job for longer than me. 

In the first few years of my role my manage changed a few times with my current one being promoted from within the department into her first leadership role. She while managing the team has got better she has never reached out from what I can see and tried to build any personal relationships with any of the guys. In fact most of the time when we were in the office she was more concerned with sitting with her friend in the old clique than the team she was meant to be managing and if she came over to speak to us. We all knew it was bad news because that’s the only time she came to sit with the team members she is meant to be looking after.

Anyway end of last year start of this year I made it clear I wanted to get into management. There is a training course for aspiring managers but when I first wanted to go on it I was told I couldn’t and had to wait. I accepted this kept my head down, worked my ass off and eventually was given the go ahead. That finished in June when I had my mid year performance review. I was given a slap in the face as I was told I’m only recently started developing my leadership skills despited being told I could do the development I wanted at the start of this year. She essentially didn’t want to go bat for me in-front of the other department managers. As rating as decided via committee. I flat out asked her what do I need to do to get exceeds for my end of year review. This affects pay rise etc for the next year and was told we would put a development plan in place. 

For agreed actions for the second half to the year we agreed I would be allowed to do some management shadowing and also attending some meetings, do some project work. The official development plan is as far as I am aware yet to see the light of day. The only slightly extra role I was given was more of an afterthought as when I asked my boss during my management training course what I can do, she first said she has nothing and then had this daily report she send to her boss she didn’t want to do so gave me that to shut me up asking. 

So far we are mid September and after two months nothing had happened. I’ve been to no meeting, done no shadowing and been given no time to develop despite his being an agreed action in this half of the year as will be part of my performance reviews. In fact since June we have not had one monthly performance discussion. These are meant to happen every month but nothing. 

In the same vain the one girl with more experience than me is given all the projects. All the training opportunities, is attending weekly meetings, with higher ups in the business and getting to make the connections while im resigned to working my ass off to make sure all our stats are good at the end of the day with little reward. In discussions with the other guys on my team they have shared similar frustration with my boss about not being given chances outside of the role. A guy a work with was on a trail project with her. Did the project for longer but my boss picked her for training out the trail when it went live. 

The good news is we are finally for filling my development actions but that’s only because the one girl I mentioned in our team meeting mentioned setting up a discussion and afterwards I asked her to could I attend without asking my bosses permission, it’s the only way I would get a yes as whenever I’ve even so much as hinted I want to be involved in this it’s been ignored by the person meant to be in charge of my development. Whenever I’ve asked about going to some meetings I’ve been told there is nothing yet I know there is a weekly management meeting every Tuesday and other meeting as well that she and this other girl attend on the regular I could have been sitting in on. I have also got some of her project work but again that’s only because I went behind my bosses back to get on it and then told her afterward this is happening as otherwise I would get the same blank, I have nothing for you answer I’ve had since June. 

I should maybe mention that the girl in question is best friend with my managers boss who for a short time was my own team manager. To be clear I don’t even dislike the other girl. I get along well and she has been more proactive and supportive of my development than my boss she has at least got me involved in the conversation. It’s just annoying as my manager won’t commit to me or the other guys on her team stumping all of our career growth.

I don’t want to undermine her. I would love to have a great working relationship with her and support my boss to succeed but I’m also not going to let my own career growth fall to the wayside while others are given chances and I’m being passed up on for. I like my job, and for the most part like what I do.
It’s just frustrating that nothing is happening to move my career forward and my own boss seems oblivious or “has nothing” yet come my performance ratings won’t go and bat for me to get the top marks. 

TLDR: new boss for the last year. Has done nothing to development me or anyone else other than the best friend of her boss. Only way I’ve developed is by going behind her back and getting opportunities and asking permission later.

P.S I don’t actively believe she is out to sabotage anyone’s career.

I do believe she is a new person in leadership and has never been in a position to develop staff under her. It’s safer to give all the opportunities to one person who she knows is friends with her boss than take a risk on someone know and it blowing up infront of her peers. So she is being risk adverse at the detriment of the staff she is meant to be in charge off.m, as that’s the easiest option.",Eriol_Mits,2,1.0,0,1694729860,2023-09-14 22:17:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16ivrt5/boss_not_giving_me_a_chance_to_develop_despite/,9,2023

16iuk3z,Need advice as a 21 year old.,"Hello,

I recently turned 21 and I am not sure what I should do for my future exactly, let me explain.

I am from India, have decent(average) marks in my school life. Did my Bachelor's in Business Administration (BBA), got a decent GPA in it too. Got completed with my bachelor's a few months ago and have decided to get a Master's in Business Administration (MBA) in Human Resources, so I am preparing for different competitive exams that will be held through November till January.  
My problem is, I do not really know what my exact career path should be, as you know because of the rise of AI jobs will be in danger and everyone I ask for advice regarding HR tells me not to take it up as it will be difficult to maintain after a few years, nobody really helps me with career paths.  
Can anyone help me regarding this, as I know and am **100%** sure I want to take up HR as my future, so what can I do to make myself indispensable from the very start so as to not be replaced.  


I would really love **any** but especially if it is someone from the HR field or related to it.

16iu2jc,65 + return to coding/dev,"So, I'm 65 years old. Don't want to slow down, but want to get into something less physically demanding and more mentally involved. I started out years ago programming in C then moved to web dev for a while. Taught programming concepts at a community collage for about 4 years. 

Then I started my own business outside of IT, but kept my fingers in web development on the side so my ramp up would be short and sweet.

So anyway, the million dollar question, is it possible to get back in? What would be a recommended path? Thinking remote work would be preferable.

16iqs7y,I'm totally burned out--should I wait for a full offer or abandon ship?,"Hi Reddit,  
  
Burnt out nonprofit worker looking for advice on my current situation. I've been at my job for about a year and a half, and I've been increasingly burned out since this May. My current job could be its own advice-seeking post, but in brief it's a small nonprofit with a disrespectful and uncaring executive staff, unsustainable workload, and regularly expected to work 12+ hour days (I am their only events manager). I'm desperate to get out and have been on the job hunt since June.  
  
I finally got a contingent offer with a contracting company for the DOD in mid-August, and it would be a much better position for my mental health, plus a more stable field, better salary and benefits. The problem is that my new job is contingent on me getting a security clearance, which I've gotten little to no detail about from my recruiter. I was told about 3 weeks ago that clearances have been taking about 2 weeks to come through. My husband works at the same company and his took about 4 months, and he was told to not quit his job until the clearance came through (granted, he was hired at the height of Covid and works in a completely different department from what I will be doing). I've tried to get a general sense of timing from my recruiter but she's been unable to provide any detail. I was told I could begin with an interim clearance, which takes less time, though I haven't been sent any forms or info from the security team yet.  
  
My mental health has been in a complete tailspin since the beginning of August at my current job, and I think I'm starting to edge into mental health crisis territory--I've been crying and having panic attacks regularly at work and my depression is worse than it's ever been, mostly due to my current job picking up into busy season right now. I really need to quit, but I'm worried that quitting before getting my clearance will jeopardize my new offer or disrupt the clearance process, and sticking it out at my current job for an indeterminate amount of time while waiting for a clearance is my actual nightmare. But it's also a nightmare to quit and then have my new offer fall through BECAUSE I quit!  
  
I have about 2 weeks worth of PTO I can still take, but we have a lot of events in the next month that I am required to work and am the only person on staff who can do them. Working these events are a major root of my stress, and I highly doubt my boss would approve me taking extended PTO or finding a replacement so I could take a break from heavy-lifting these events.  
  
I'm desperate enough that I've been wondering about quitting my current position ASAP and trying to go part-time somewhere in the interim while waiting for my clearance just to have something in the pipeline. My husband and I have talked it over and we can float me being jobless for definitely a month and probably two.  
  
TLDR; is it worth risking screwing up a potential security clearance timeline and quitting now for the sake of my mental health? Should I try to stick it out at my current job and wait for updates, which might take anywhere from a couple weeks to a couple months (but, in the long run, would be a great and stable career for me)? Or should I quit, abandon the DOD red-tape waiting altogether, and try to find another job somewhere else?

16ipl94,Should I go back to my old company.,"I’m a real estate agent and have been able to survive on commission only since 2014. I  jumped around to a few different companies and my best year was in 2020 with my previous employer. I did my best numbers $4+ million in sales with my previous employer. In 2021 I was going through a bad mental health period and barely did $1M. I did get referred some business by my broker since it was such a small firm but things fell apart quickly. Also, at my previous employer, I gave up 30% of my commission to pay for office, services, and etc. Which is fairly standard. But the difference with this company is that it’s a boutique company. I can do and sell anything. I’m not limited to only residential or commercial. I could do commercial sales to and that’s what the company was known for. Also, that broker was the best broker Ive ever worked for. 

Now I’m with another company and I get to keep 100% of my commission which is nice but it’s limited to only residential. Also, they’re heavily bureaucratic in how deals are done and expect a lot of additional paperwork and tasks to get paid out. Which is fair but it adds extra hurdles to deals. 

Over the last three months, I was interviewing for an upper management position at my current company. I did well and was interviewed by the ceo, the founders and the cfo/head of personnel. They said that I was their candidate and to be patient since there was some restructuring going on. After weeks of me reaching out and staying on top of them, they kept reassuring me that I’d get the position. 

I attend a training and everyone goes to introduce themselves and I see another agent there that I haven’t met before. She introduces herself as the regional manager for our area. The same position that I was going for. My current company placed me into a recruiting role with no salary and I’d get a referral bonus for every person that I recruit. But it’s basically 50% of the work that the regional manager would do and no pay. 

Now, here’s my thinking. Commercial real estate agents is definitely the old boys club but there will be a huge wave of retirees that should be retiring over the next ten years. I think that this is a huge opportunity to catch some business and establish myself. Also, some of the top producers in commercial can make $1-2M a year, while residential is topped off at an average of $166k (top 10%). I’m not expecting to be the top anything but my thinking is that if I’m even average at best, I’d still end up in a better position financially than I would staying in residential. 

Also, my previous employer still allowed me to sell residential so I can always use residential to fill in the gaps until I get up and running with commercial since there is a ramp up period. 

I did leave on good terms and I do think that I might’ve made a mistake. But I do feel jaded with my current employer since they misled me and didn’t even acknowledge that they decided to go with someone else. I tried to fit almost four years of events into this post so let me know if you have any questions. Do you think I should go back to my previous broker and see if they’ll take me back? 

I forgot to mention that typically commercial firms typically like to have contractors with college degrees. Residential does not. They gave me a chance since I didn’t have a degree and even gave me a title as an associate, which is higher than entry level analyst, with no issues. I don’t have a college degree since I could never really afford it.

16iolta,highly qualified but can't get an interview,"I've been looking for jobs for almost two years with minimal success besides occasional contract work. I remain underemployed.  
  
I'm 50 years old with over 15 years of experience in my field, which is mostly international. However, I want to work domestically in the US because I'm burnt out from traveling. I have an Ivy League Masters degree and also served as adjunct professor at a well-known school.  
  
My background includes program management, evaluations, social science research, and planning work for foreign governments - really a wide range of roles. Used to be a journalist too.  
  
My expertise relates to children, youth, gender, public health, refugees, and poverty. These issues are very relevant domestically as well.  
  
I've applied extensively for nonprofit management, technical and program roles in nonprofits, government jobs, and fundraising positions.  
  
I'm not sure why I keep getting passed over, but I assume it's partly being seen as overqualified and having a predominantly international background?  
  
Working independently as a consultant for 5 years seems to be a red flag for some employers. My international experience also appears to be a major barrier, as interviewers suggest I'll get bored and leave quickly.  
  
I also think managers can feel intimidated by my extensive global experience with the UN, international NGOs, governments, etc. despite my program evaluation, writing, and fundraising skills being very applicable.

16in8wm,Looking for advice on a new career path,"So, I’m at a point in my career where I’m looking for a change. I’ve been at my current company for approximately 5 years now. It was my first job out of college, but I feel like I’ve done all I want to do here and moving any further upward in the company feels like I would be moving into a space that doesn’t align with my interests and goals.

For some background, I work as a researcher/data analyst at an agency for pharmaceutical clients. My primary roles are to: 

1) analyze social conversation of patients or doctors to derive insights for clients on how to approach an audience regarding their treatment. This mostly entails a lot of reading, as well as using some analytics tools to cut the data in ways that brings insights to the surface. 
2) analyze search metrics to best understand the audience’s search behavior, which can provide insights into an audience’s understanding of a particular disease state, as well as what their thought processes are when they search online. Then, I can provide SEO/SEM recommendations.
3) analyze an audience’s demographics, interests, as well as brand and media affinities in order to provide insight into “what kind of person” this audience is and what is the best way to target them.

In addition to this, I have a secondary role as a tech enablement and automation liaison. In this role, I am responsible for being the point person who helps the analytics department understand how to best leverage technology. I do this by being the middle man between analytics and data science/engineering. We have proprietary tools stored in Databricks and I have also been learning SQL on the fly to help develop queries that can aid in accessing certain information from our internal databases.

Reasons I want to move on: 
- I am somewhat tired of doing analytics for pharma clients. If I am going to continue to spend time deriving insights within the healthcare space I would like it to be in an effort to make meaningful change. If I am going to continue to do that kind of work, I would like it to benefit the general public rather than just a corporation’s market share.
- The further I move up the company, the more the focus shifts from hands-on work to organizational aspects and selling projects. I’m not much of a salesman, and I do enjoy working with my “hands.”

My Interests:
- I would like a greater focus on mental health and even drug addiction. Those areas feel more interesting and rewarding to me, and those projects can be few and far between in my current line of work. And when they come it’s not like the insights go out to those who could really use it.
- I enjoy being creative. In my free time I love to write and to draw and my dream would be to turn that into a career by writing and illustrating my own comic books. However that is a long term goal and I know I still need a steady job in the meantime. 

My College Background:
- I went to school school for communications and digital media, with minors in advertising and creative writing. 
- I learned a variety of interesting creative skills including digital art, blogging, video editing, and web design (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). 
- I interned at a non-profit where I was responsible for maintaining a social media presence, blogging, doing some video work, as well as community outreach
- I also briefly spent time as the lead video editor for a startup TV series. 

My video skills are probably not as sharp as they were, because it’s been some time since I’ve put them to use, but my analogue skills (writing/drawing) are still as sharp as ever, as I still utilize them in my spare time almost daily. 

How did I get here?
- Getting a job out of college was a scary prospect and I was dealing with a lot of imposter syndrome at the time. So, I settled for a job more tangentially related to my skills with the help of a friend to reference me. 
- I am genuinely good at my current job and find that I pretty easily can pick up a variety of skills.

So, now I’m feeling a little lost and a little stuck. I feel like I have a lot of good skills, but I can’t seem to put the puzzle pieces together.",mcap43,1,1.0,0,1694709727,2023-09-14 16:42:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16in8wm/looking_for_advice_on_a_new_career_path/,9,2023
16imgh4,Need help navigating a tricky reference situation,"So I’ve been working at a job for around 9 months. They have recently decided that they are changing from hybrid/remote to fully in person. Many have left because of this, including (hopefully) me. I found a dream job and after two rounds of interviews and lots of reassuring words from the last interview they want me onboard. However they have to do one last step of calling three references. I have two from my prior roles, however my current company is giving an issue.

They are telling me that per company policy they will only provide a record of employment, nothing more nothing less. It’s BS and they are saying this because they are pissed like hell that I’m leaving. I asked if they would be able to elaborate if asked about my performance and my duties and they said no. Not exactly what I’m hoping for out of a reference.

I could try to reach out to some colleagues and see if they would be willing to do it instead, but one is on maternity, one recently left, and another is likely to be too scared of potential backlash. I could also in theory reach out to clients I worked with to try and get them to speak on how I’ve helped them.

16imasn,Confused on what to pursue.,"I'm a 24 year old living in Montreal, Canada and I have a diploma in accounting. I have been working mostly part time as a bookkeeper since 2020, and I was convinced that I should go to university to get the degree, but now I'm not sure if I should go and do that. I picked accounting because I figured that since it's office and computer work that it would fit well for me, but after three years of strict dress codes like cutting my hair really short, being told not to play on my handheld on my lunch break at the kitchen, and once being asked to go to a golf event to make some connections (which btw I hate golf) I don't know if that kind of environment is really for me. (If these aren't common please let me know)  
I am currently taking a remedial course for computer science out of pressure since the day I realized I needed advanced sec 4 math for it was also the same day the remedial deadline happened. I had no time to think if I wanted to pursue computer science or not since the application deadline is in march of next year. As for computer science itself the main interests I have for it is that it is where people are taught how games are made, it is computer work and that it is high paying. I don't know if I should put in years on it just because of that.  
I originally wanted to take theatre courses since I was inspired by many actors from the entertainment I consume. I wanted and still to this day want to become a voice actor, but I got nervous and changed fields since I'm not that social and very introverted. Plus recently I discovered that actors don't have stable jobs and being someone who values their games, computer and other belongings that thought worries me.  
For months my head has been telling me “take computer science” and “take acting” and it is annoying.",Economy-Ambassador60,1,1.0,1,1694707506,2023-09-14 16:05:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16imasn/confused_on_what_to_pursue/,9,2023
16ilxq1,Google certifications or inside company growth?,"(Tldr on bottom)

I recently gave up my car and took a job at walmart as a grunt worker and even though it was a massive pay cut i am finally able to focus on me (28) instead of tending to my families bs.

Unsure of which direction to take and if i do get a certification which one would be the best to start with.

Its basic manual labor stocking work which means ive got plenty of time and energy to start looking into more long term options career wise.

Ive never had a job that didnt end up promoting me into management rather fast but im overly friendly and tend to burn myself out trying to do everything. 

Experience wise though outside of manager and (failed) general manager of pizza joints i have nothing.

Im good with computer and have even built most of my friend groups set ups but building computers is not exactly profitable and the solo start up requires more then i can afford.

Id love to look into some google certification but Im unsure of which one would even be worth trying to start with and to try and grow into a proper career.

I could always try to just grow internally at Walmart its not exactly a hard job but after a few weeks working there i really think it'd be better long term to just keep my head down and collect a paycheck this time.


Tldr : made life change, focus on me. Do i advance internally at walmart or get a google certification and advance into new career.",manindragondrag,1,1.0,2,1694706648,2023-09-14 15:50:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16ilxq1/google_certifications_or_inside_company_growth/,9,2023
16ilk6y,Is the 17% raise I plan on asking for justified?,"I work for an engineering consulting firm, specifically as a financial analyst/junior consultant. I primarily build financial models and design utility rates for cities across the country.

When I started 3.5 years ago it was my first job out of college. I had a finance degree and had absolutely no knowledge of the utility world. It has been a massive learning curve for me and still is. My starting salary in March of 2020 was $49,500. As was expected when I started, I needed to be guided through most things, as I didn’t know how to design utility rates, build financial models, etc.

Fast forward to today, I still don’t have the in depth utility knowledge that my coworkers do, but I can build models and design rates on my own, in fact I am the primary person who builds the models now. I can contribute in meetings with clients but still struggle to talk in depth about their utilities. My work with certain cities has led to more projects with them. For example I did a random data analytics study for a city last year and I was the main point of contact for them. This led to us taking on two additional projects with them this year for over $80k in additional contracts.

I’m not going to pretend that I’m a perfect employer and exceptional overachiever. I still make mistakes, I still find myself having to redo work more than I would like because I really struggle with double checking the original work that I do. I’m not a good public speaker and get noticeably nervous when asked to speak. I would say in most cases I’m adequate for my job, not exceptional.

Now to the salary and raise. My current salary is $59,600, or about $10,100 more than when I started. When looking at my starting salary adjusted for inflation, $49,500 in 2020 would be about $58,879 today. In other words my current salary is only about 1.2% more than where I started three years ago when accounting for inflation. 

So where does that leave me? Well, when I look at where I’m at today, with the knowledge that I have gained in the industry, and my ability to be much more self sufficient on a day to day basis, contributing during client meetings and even leading some. I’m much further that where I was 3 years ago. More than 1.2%. If my goal is to attain more of a senior financial analyst position and move up from junior consultant to consultant, I think my salary would be much more appropriate around $70k. An increase of 17.5% from where I’m currently at.

Is this fair?",trader2488,4,0.75,9,1694705719,2023-09-14 15:35:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16ilk6y/is_the_17_raise_i_plan_on_asking_for_justified/,9,2023

A little bit about myself, for starters. 21, male, 4th year Computer Science Engineering student at a Tier 1 university in India, with a decent CGPA. To put it bluntly, I don't know what I want to do with my life. One thing I am sure about is that I want to be working in corporate. No founding a startup or government job. I have a decent job offer from an MNC in an SDE role.  
  
However, I am not clear about my career aspirations regarding whether I want to go down the Tech path or not. This is why I want to work in IT for a few years to get clarity. However, that is a big IF, and I want clarity on what I would do after that. If I were to go for an MS, my sole aim would be to work in a big tech company, but I don't think I have the profile of a conventional MS applicant (no publication, research exp, etc.), and I would have to look for programs more suited for industry-based roles (would appreciated leads in this regard as well) . Moreover, I am still determining which field I would like to pursue an MS in (although I am sure I am not interested in ML/AI). Going to the MBA side, I am also perplexed about this since I am unsure whether I want to continue in the IT field or change to a different domain.  
  
So, all in all, I am in sort of a mess here. While writing this post, going with the flow seems the most logical thing that I think I should do. Put some time into the IT job and see where that takes me. However, like I said, that's a big IF and unsettles me. I apologize for the vague nature of this post.

Automation of reporting by extracting data from the ERP using web queries and writing macros in Google App Script to clean, format, and insert any calculation columns to provide on-demand reports to management. I am currently working on presenting these reports through a GDS dashboard.  
  
Creation of various templates in xls/csv for data imports into the ERP.  
  
Writing SQL queries, based on superiors' requests, to extract data from the ERP's DB and put it into a spreadsheet.  
  
Having developed an interest in data analysis, I have obtained various certifications (on Coursera/edx) in Javascript (which I chose to understand how G App Script works), Python (although I completed a basic course, I have not used it much), and SQL. This new interest is driving me to move my career further away from the ordinary tasks of a classic accountant and towards potential opportunities like Data Analyst, Financial Analyst, and eventually Controller roles.  
  
So, here's the first problem: What should I do? My work experience has varied only in companies, never in roles. All my previous job titles are ""Accounting Specialist."" Additionally, I have a degree in Management (earned entirely in the UK), which doesn't fall under the ""STEM"" titles that might be attractive to recruiters for the roles mentioned above. How would you advise me to proceed? Are there specific certifications that could boost the relevance of my CV once obtained?  
  
What job prospects can I expect? How do you think a ""basic"" role like mine will evolve in the coming years? What should I do to make myself competitive in the job market against other candidates with similar experience?  
  
What kind of salary should I aim for? Currently, Im employed and live in Italy (my country of origin), my annual salary is around 30k gross (around 2k NET), which is an average salary for where I live. Do you think that my ""skills"" could afford me a higher than average salary? If not, what should I aim for in your opinion? I know that the local job market plays a big role in this regard: Italy employers are for the most part SMEs with very high IT illiteracy. That said, I would prefer to avoid working for an SMEs in order to stay competitive in the years to come.  
  
Considering the above, what kind of career should I aim for? Any specific field/sector? Could I find work as a freelancer for foreign companies and achieve a much higher salary? Would there be any demand for profiles like mine? Considering that I have the option to move abroad (my girlfriend can work remotely from anywhere), would this be a career-enhancing choice?

16ia6cv,How long does it take to get the hang of a new job post-grad?,"So I graduated university with a bachelors degree of English Language & Literature and expected/wanted to go into the publishing field. Unfortunately, internships were hard to score and I got rejections left & right. A friend of mine asked why I didn't look into NGOs. I got super excited about it - felt like a good career choice. She referred me to a job opening she had in her program and - after being wrongly sent a  rejection, went through a difficult assessment & a 3 person interview - I got it. I started my first day on July 9th. 

So, two months. It's been hell. I still feel lost. My supervisor has been on leave or traveling for work for maybe, at least, half of that time. For the first 2 weeks I pretty much just sat at my desk doing nothing. My anxiety levels are so high, I can barely function enough after work to cook. I am also the youngest, by far, in the office, with the least amount of experience. Most people here are 26+ with previous NGO experience. 

Yesterday, it was my first time facilitating a meeting and I basically flunked it. It was pretty bumpy, reading off slides, I sounded stupid and my supervisor would take over for me a few times. Afterwards, she was basically like ""I need you to get the hand of things because in 3 weeks you're on your own. Is this job exciting for you? What can I do to make it more engaging, etc."" Well, IDK! I asked her for more tasks to do last week to fill up my day. That made it better. But now she's basically saying ""you need to get better ASAP bc I can't support you in 3 weeks."" 

God, I feel like I suck at my job. It's the worst feeling. 

I know nothing - barely understand the process, the workflow, what's expected of me? I also barely understand the field of non-governmental organizations. I come to work everyday wondering when things will start making sense. I feel so lost. I don't know if I want to stay here but isn't it bad to half short experience on your resume? What do I do next?

I've tried to find other work, but I just can't get my foot in the door anywhere. I've been trying to get into the trades, and took a pre-apprenticeship course in welding. Couldn't get hired anywhere.

The general message from recruiters and employers seems to be that if I spent 20 years in retail, I can't do ""real"" work. I was actually advised by a few people to take all my retail management experience off of my resume.

16i5yni,How to deal with difficult coworker?,"I've been in this career for 7 years, and have not come across one truly difficult coworker until this month when I switched back to an old job. This guy is new. He is an African American, I am Caucasion. First thing he says to me on day 1 is ""Do you like cops?"" I say, what kind of question is that? He responds with ""That's all I need to know thanks"". At first I didn't think much of it because clearly it's someone who has not been socialized, no ""hey, nice to meet you"" just straight to that question. But, from then on the issues arose. He refused to communicate with me for about a week, told all my coworkers not to trust me because he thinks I ""like cops"" etc etc. For weeks I tried to repair the issue, saying Good morning every time I saw them etc or asking them work related questions but they would always just put their head down, smile, and ignore me. This past week I said good morning again, and he said ""F\*\*\* you still"" in front of the whole office. At this point, I was fed up, stood up and walked over to them, tried to ask him what the issue is, lets work this out, he responded with ""why are you talking to me right now"". Got my manager involved, manager drags both of us in office, manager asks him what the issue is, he says there's no problem. Manager asks if he treats two other coworkers the same way, he says ""no, I treat them accordingly."" Manager tells us he ""doesn't wanna hear anymore about this high school BS"" Coworkers responds ""won't hear it from me, I'm no snitch"". At this point, I am just completely demoralized. Don't know what to do. But as a man, if you've ever felt another someone have truly malicious energy towards you, you know what that feels like. At this point this behavior is just bizarre and quite honestly, I am a bit worried for my safety and career.

This is when my blood pressure skyrockets, I get ringing in my ears, a head rush, feel insanely disoriented- like my limbs are 10ft away, and I can’t move my legs. Sometimes my hand clamps and I can’t open up my fingers for 30 minutes. Thankfully I felt it coming on and was able to find an empty meeting room where I rode it out in private.

I’ve been getting these attacks since I was a kid. Recently a doctor suggested it was a mild seizure given that I couldn’t move my limbs (though I could still speak), but that’s speculation. I have high BP and some iron/calcium deficiency but my blood work usually checks out. It could be genetics.

Anyway, I have a few presentations coming up at work and I’m so scared I’ll have an episode in front of everyone. During one of the last spells I got, I lost bladder control. it would be absolutely mortifying to have that happen in front a room of coworkers.

16i3zfq,"Applied for internal job, havnt heard back. What do I do?","I interviewed for a role within the company I currently work for. The first meeting was virtual and it went well. At the end, they invited me to an in person interview at HQ with the department lead and the CEO. 

I went to that interview, and personally thought I did really really well. I’ve always been a good interviewer, and about 90% of the time I do, I get offered the position. This particular one I felt like I did exceptionally good, evident by the body language and conversation from the 2 I met with. After the interview I went to grab coffee with the department lead and we seemingly got along really well. Lots of personal and professional interests. 

That was a week ago. Now I know what your thinking - “Well stop being impatient. One week isn’t very long!” … and you’re right; it’s not. Unless you consider that every person in the company that I know had received their job offer within 24-48 hours after interview. Including me, when I got my first role. 

Part of me wonders if they were just giving me the perception I had a chance, so I wouldn’t get upset at being denied, however they called me up for a second interview with the CEO. That would have been an expensive thing to do if they knew I wasn’t the one. 

I’m not sure how to proceed. Some people have told me to send them a follow up email today (exactly 1 week post interview) while some people have said wait until 8-10 days after. 

Frankly, this whole thing puts a sour taste in my mouth now. I’m trying to stay positive and be optimistic, but on the other end… they haven’t hesitated in the past when it comes to sending the offer. I’m beginning to think they chose someone else, and are afraid to tell me, as it would effect my morale and quality of work.

16i3cft,Will this new job opportunity be a stain on my resume?,"Hey all, 24m looking for some advice. 

For the past three years, i’ve been a custom art framer & designer through a small business. As each month passes, my shops owners wife seems to be getting increasingly unhinged in both her business decisions as well as how she’s treating us (her employees). I love my job endlessly however, from reading in between her lines and her actions, I fear that she has developed a vindictive mindset toward me since i’ve been the most vocal on resolving company issues that she has been extremely avoidant with. Due to this, i’ve decided I need to look for a new job, even though it will suck to put myself back on the market.

After applying to about 10 jobs in the last two days, I scheduled interviews at 3 who have responded promptly. All of them offer me good schedules, decent pay, and opportunities for growth (which is something I currently don’t have). I mostly wanted to stick within sales however I also applied to a few jobs that are quite a bit more hands on. Today, I interviewed for a tire technician & sales position with a regional tire, brake, and alignment company. The store manager was very impressed with my resume and despite lack of experience in this field, he hired me on the spot for $2.75/hr more than I currently make and was speaking highly to me of my chances for promotion.

Seeing as I have no prior experience in the auto industry outside of working on cars i’ve owned as a hobby (doing rebuilds, brakes, and stuff like that) I feel almost like this might impact my ability to land a future sales job or a job in a more formal environment as my resume is now hardware store, hardware store speciality sales, art framer, now tire technician. 

I don’t really have a career path in mind although I currently am studying physics and have flirted with the idea of being a teacher one day as I love kids and the idea of enriching young minds with information near and dear to my heart makes me happy. I just don’t want to run into a situation where this new job becomes a road block, ya know?

Fortunately, I’ve been landing interviews and been moved onto final rounds without no selections and it is really becoming exhausting. In all I’ve been final listed 2x, ignored/no communication 2x and currently in the process for 3 other companies/orgs with one being a final round. I think the reason for landing these interviews is due to my very impressive resume, along with backgrounds and interests for all the jobs applied. I’ve managed to passed on phone screens along HR rounds but not selected after final interview. 

I strongly BELIEVE this is because there are (2) articles of my previous arrest while in college. I do have a misdemeanor conviction. In 2018 I pled nolo contedre to (2) misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance. However there is also an article of the INITIAL arrest along with the allegations for the arrest showing (14 felonies). All of these charges were dropped/dismissed and I  received 12 months of probations for this charge and attended drug counseling, for which I successfully completed. I made a mistake, but I have moved on with my life. I have worked hard on moving forward with my life in a positive manner. I’ve obtained my BA/ MA and have strived to be an impact citizen. 

Entering the workforce was challenging but I manage to start my career with a really great TECH company. I disclose my misdemeanor to the recruiter and was allowed to proceed with the process. However after a year in the industry I was recently part of a wide lay off and have found it very difficult for my next role. 

Due to recent being layoff; I have been successful in reaching the managing director to update the article in order to demonstrate future employers of the actual disposition that I don’t have felonies but the article still remain on the third very top. Along with the articles are tons of other accolades and achievesments that’s on the corner of google under my name.

My question for you is can I use my preferred name on resume/linkedln? And for HR purpose I can disclose my full name. My full name also includes my middle name but I would not record my legal name for professional purposes. Only my middle name/last name will be use to track me. I’ve ready started updating my social media profiles to this.

 is this possible to pull off?
Can I get in trouble for this on the long run?
Can I make a successfull career under an alias name?

16i2q1c,I learned a life lesson about jobs and bosses,"When I started my job about two years ago my boss told me how they’re all about a flexible schedule and how we aren’t on a set schedule.

I stupidly took that as she was relaxed about a work atmosphere. Well fast forward to today when had a meeting about my “lack of communication” after I left at 3:48 one Friday instead of the 4 o clock which is my norm that she knows.

She then starts telling me I should tell her when I leave for the day because she’s used to being able to my msg my coworkers and they respond whenever, and she says she wants to know where the line is not to message me (even though I told her I mute all my work related apps outside work hours).

So I guess the point of this rant is I should have seen it as a red flag when she’ll email and message at like 9 pm, she probably expects everyone else to do the same

I recently accepted a job which comes under the level needed but I don’t see myself doing it for long term. It does not come with any benefits as well as involves lot of cold calling. It has hourly pay+commissions. The hours are not fixed though. I just accepted it because of category it comes in.

Today I received a job offer in one of the fastest growing startup with a fixed salary and benefits plan with an opportunity to grow quickly (ofcourse depending on my performance, but I’m sure I can do well). The salary is not amazing and works out to be the same as other job but can increase with performance. I’m interested more in this particular job and can see myself working long term with the company. The only problem is, the current position offered does not come under the level needed.

16i1n4o,Is It Okay to Not Give 2-Weeks Notice?,"I got a job offer where they want me to start in two weeks. 

I am currently working at an office where I literally had no training. I understand they hired me with experience. However, there was no one to show me how they do things in their office such as when they get documents, where do they file them in their version of File Explorer, what is the protocol for anything. If I do two full days' worth of work, I have nothing left to do the rest of the week. I am sending out emails regularly asking if there is anything I can do. When I was hired, I was told that they were extremely busy. That isn't the case. I'm basically watching tv on my phone. For some people, this would be great. However, I work in a field where I am to bill my hours. I don't think this work ethic will help me for future employments. I have no designated tasks to do.

After four months of this, I got a call from a recruiter that turned into a job offer. I have been thinking about going to the first day at the new job and if everything is good, email my old job that I found employment with a little busier office and will not be back. Normally, I wouldn't do this route but what can I do in the two weeks. I have no designated duties, the tasks I do can be done within a day or two. What could I train someone when I didn't get training and I wouldn't know what to tell them to do or look out for. I just can't collect a check doing nothing.

My reason for this cushy job is I overhead a managing partner tell someone on the phone that a client had been pressuring them to be diverse. I got I was the answer from heaven when I walked in the door to interview. They didn't check my credentials nor did they background me. Not everyone who's a minority is lazy and just want to stand around getting paid to do nothing so the office can look ""diverse"" to their client.

16i17t1,Using a new job offer as leverage for a raise with current employer — but it's complicated,"My coworker of 4 years is trying to get the hell out of our current workplace, as am I. Our old bosses were forced out 8 months ago, some new bosses came in, they don't know how to supervise or even understand what we do, yet are yanking us around and changing processes without our input, despite repeated attempts to reason with them. After our bosses were forced out due to internal politics, we started as a team of 11 under the new guys. 4 people have already left due to their ineptitude, disrespect toward for our expertise, and failure to raise salaries (despite the company having massive profits, and despite each and every one of us regularly discussing with them the dire need to raise salaries before we lose more people). Now 2 more of us (myself and my coworker) are looking to abandon ship, and many of the others are, too. Even 3 new hires are voicing their concerns and expressing regret that ""this wasn't the job we signed up for."" It's an absolute mess.

My coworker makes $55K/year. She just got an offer to go work for our old/good boss for $57K. But we've been told by our current bosses to finally expect raises in early October, when our new fiscal year starts.

My coworker has very little intention of staying regardless, but she wants to use the offer as leverage to see how much our current bosses WOULD value her. And also for the satisfaction of watching them try to bend over backwards and finally do the thing we've been warning them about over and over. It's sort of about the principle of it, and this whole year has been emotionally heartbreaking because we were a truly tight-knit work family (I know it's corny, but it's true) and very happy with our jobs til they came and destroyed our joy, so it's been therapeutic to plan our exits and reclaim even just a glimmer of our agency/self-deterimination after feeling so disempowered for so long.

Anyway, she let them know today that she received an offer, and now they're asking what her offer is at the new company, and they want it in writing. But it's ""only"" $2K more (basically a lateral move), and based on past raises, I'm pretty sure that the new salary they would have given her in October anyway would have exceeded the $57K, so that offer she's been given won't be hard for them to beat.

She also told them that she has until Friday to make a decision, but they're asking for more time. I'm sure our old boss (at the new place she's moat likely going to) would be flexible and give her til next week to decide. (She's the only one they interviewed, and he knows how things are over here, and he's super chill.)

1. How does she navigate this situation? Does she tell them it's $57K?

2. Should she stay firm on Friday, or give them til sometime next week to attempt a counteroffer to keep her?

3. And if (and likely when) our current employer makes an offer that beats her current offer of $57K, how does she justify telling them ""no"" anyway?",agoodanalogy,2,0.75,3,1694644672,2023-09-13 22:37:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16i17t1/using_a_new_job_offer_as_leverage_for_a_raise/,9,2023

16hzslg,How to land an internship with a very low GPA?,"Long story short, I had a rough junior year for various reasons. It absolutely killed my gpa. I’ve matured and have collected myself since then and am looking forward with my academic and career path. I have decided to switch my major to something I am more passionate about, which is adding a 5th year. This gives me the opportunity to land one more summer internship before graduating. That being said, a lot of internships have gpa requirements and I do not have the gpa to fulfill that requirement. My GPA does not represent my intellect, my motivation, or my work effort. 

I am a new economics major and attend a top 10 public university. I have experience with tech sales (internship this past summer) and event coordination. My GPA is a 2.8 on a 4.0 scale.

I am interested in these fields: energy (mostly oil & gas as that is what my father and grandfather have done but open to anything related), consulting, commercial real estate, international trade, politics (policy analyst/reset type roles), and finance (would only want to work at a larger firm just to build my resume and credibility to create more opportunities to pivot in my career) 

So far after applying I have been finding alumni from my school who currently work at the company on LinkedIn. I’ve been just letting them know I’ve applied and asking them a little about themselves on their path from the school to the company and asking for any advice. I am also asking them if they know anyone that is in a more relevant role that could help me through the application and interview process. This is VERY hit or miss, with mostly misses. I also use my cover letter to explain my gpa (if I do not meet the requirements and a transcript is required on the application) and talk about the recent advancements with my academic life (not making it the theme or being overbearing with it making sure to keep most of the cover letter pretty standard). 

With that being said I’m pretty nervous about landing a desirable internship for this next summer. I am seeking advice on how to navigate this process with a low gpa.

16hzns0,Dilemma with returning to a old employer.,"I find myself in a bit of a career conundrum, and I'm hoping to gain some wisdom from your experiences. Here's the situation:

Initially, I ventured into the real estate world with high hopes, but it didn't pan out as I expected. I made the decision to return to my former job, where I had three years of experience. Here's the twist: they rehired me with a higher base salary than everyone else in my position, but they're expecting me to hit the ground running and perform at my previous top-performer level within just 30 days.  Or they will let me go..

What's disheartening is that I was a top performer but it took a lot of time to get there, and it seems like they aren't giving me any grace period to adjust. This lack of flexibility is incredibly demotivating.

While job security was a significant factor in my decision to return, I've noticed a significant shift in the company's culture since I left, and that sense of security has eroded.

I'm feeling quite overwhelmed and lost at this point. Has anyone faced a similar situation or can offer advice on navigating this challenging career transition?

I took a job as an In Branch consultant with another financial firm between the layoff and this new offer. My current role pays $110k, but as my book grows there could be potential to be making 300K in 5 years, but I'll probably be close to the $110K for the next 3-4 years.

I'm good at what I do, but my growth isn't guaranteed with this new role.

-> for our biweekly team’s meeting he rarely shows up because he’s too busy

-> we held a very important team’s discussion and he didn’t say a word even after our boss asked him for his thoughts… my boss then told me after that he apologized to him for not being more engaged, he was distracted

-> won’t respond to chats or emails 

-> I will ask him for something that is integral to our jobs, usually just like can you do an introduction with a customer.

1: Delete the job from my resume and write down those skills onto another, similar job I had in the past. Explain the gap as something they can’t verify like a medical or family emergency.

2: Say I was either laid off, or it was contract work. My issue is that they may be able to verify these? Plus again, they might just see right through me and start asking difficult questions.

Ask me any questions you have on day to day, pay, etc…",Neither-Category-710,1,1.0,0,1694638787,2023-09-13 20:59:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16hynrv/ama_former_international_freight_broker/,9,2023
16hyaat,Conflicted between choosing current prestigious lower-paying job over higher-paying job,"Crossposting here.

So I recently got a job working for a prestigious company - like the kind that your dad brags about to all his friends kind of prestigious. Salary is $90k per year with quarterly bonuses, and it's prestigious enough I've been sent on major business trips to help build relationships with other companies. In short, it has opened many, many doors for me - doors that I never thought imaginable in my life. I've also been able to work on projects that I'm truly passionate about, make important connections in my field, and even get invited on podcasts. It's basically a dream job.  
  
The problem here? It's a work hard, play hard situation and my manager has added new goals that are simply unattainable and unsustainable. I don't know what will happen if I don't meet them, but I'm working late hours right now. Like 6-8PM logoff times. I mind it somewhat but at the same time, I simply love what I am doing here. My manager also doesn't really manage well, and chooses to find my flaws rather than celebrate my wins. While I've only been there five months, I've completed a bunch of amazing opportunities that have boosted my company, and only received recognition twice - and one of those times was completing my first week there.  
  
Because I don't have the most supportive manager, I have now taken to recording all of our meetings to make sure that I'm in the clear should I get yelled at. I'm the only person on my ""team"" which gives me job security. And so long as my numbers are good, I am left alone. That being said, there is an expectation to perform and increase my numbers in this role.  
  
So the issue? In a fit of fury last month over my manager being a jerk yet again, I applied for a job out of spite. It's of a similar vein, and while not as interesting or in something I'm as passionate about, I'd be building out a project and team essentially from scratch (similar to what I had to do at my current job without adding further details). The benefits are just as good (unlimited PTO, decent health insurance, etc).  
  
The work-life balance I've been told at this company is significantly better; they all log off right at 5PM and you're not expected to work long hours unless it's your ""season"". And, surprise - they really liked me. I passed the test they gave me with flying colors, and I have one more interview before I receive this offer, and barring any catastrophic changes, it's coming next week. It's all but guaranteed at this point.  
  
The salary for the new role is up to $30k more, so up to $120k annually, and it's a full title boost into management. No bonuses or raises that I'm aware of. While it's with a legacy company, I don't think it will open nearly as many doors as the current one I'm at, and the area I'd be overseeing won't get me invited to major events and networking opportunities, if that makes sense. This is also a new role that I expect to stay in for at least 2-3 years based on our conversation to build out the team and project.  
  
The other issue is that I've only been with my current company five months, and I really am nervous to move companies since I was laid off from my previous role after 10 months, and so my resume is a little sporadic right now. I also don't want to be blacklisted from this company if I leave after five months which I'm fairly certain will happen.

16hxloh,Mid 20 career crisis,"I think I’m having mid 20 life crisis. I’m in my mid-20s, working in partnership sales for the last 5 years. I fell in love with the job because of my mentor, after working for her for 3 years, then I was recruited by my now company’s boss, which is also my old company’s competitor. On my last day, my mentor gave me this speech of how she loves me as a person but she’s very disappointed in me. A year later, I’m still working at this company, It was good at first then the boss who recruited me who promised me sunshine and rainbows, quit 5 months after I joined. Now I hate my job, I hate half of my coworkers, and I’m tired of how I can’t understand my boss, she has a very strong accent. I hate people keep asking me to go on business trips, I’m tired of making small talk, I’m tired of companies not hiring, but keep asking why we have no numbers. Most importantly, I hate feeling so alone working here. 
I want to quit so bad, I interviewed for so many jobs, but no one wants me. I want to start over but I'm not sure what I want anymore… do I only hate my current company or do I hate this industry in general? I broke down crying last night after having night calls till 11 p.m. with my team in Asia. All I want is to hang out with puppies… But I can’t quit my job because we have a wedding to pay for. I know I sound extremely naive as a woman in her mid-twenties, but I’m so tired and could really use some advice, have anyone gone through something like this?

I’m a single parent (21F) and have been job searching for a better career that’s not 9-5. I want more time with my child and more time to actually ENJOY life and invest in the future…not glued to some office or place all the time. 
I have looked into so much and nothing really excites me that much BESIDES being a freaking mom and eventually getting a husband. But obviously that’s not happening anytime soon (no love interests atm) so I’m really at a loss. Top interests are writing, acting, photography. No great jobs in those right now that I could get fairly soon (correct me if I’m wrong). I’ve looked into blogging, real estate, waitressing at FANCY restaurants, small business owner, plumbing, teaching, YouTube influencing…just everything is so…idk mind numbing? I also hate social media even though I always gathered a pretty large following, so I have no interest in doing something with that. I wish something would slap me right in the face where I’m like “YES THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO DO”.

16hvzcv,7 months as a HRIS coordinator feeling burned out.,"As the title says, I’ve been working for a large school district for 7 months as a Human Resources Information systems coordinator. I am the sole person in our organization that handles all of our (several) HRIS systems. I received two weeks of training and was left on my own to figure everything out. 

Our HR department has around 30 people in it, that’s how large our organization is. Out of 30 of those people, I am the only one that knows how to do my job, there have been mentions from management asking if anyone would be willing to cross train to learn parts of my job so when I am out of the office someone would cover for me, but everyone shuns away from it and says they don’t want to. 

I have been completely overwhelmed with the amount of projects, tickets, and calls I have to field every day, with no help and no direction from anyone. Management is completely hands off and acts bothered if you ever go to them with anything. 

Aside from my job being incredibly overwhelming, our upper management has demonstrated time and time again that they don’t value me or any of their subordinates. The CHRO acts like he’s above the lower level employees, and only chooses to say good morning to select individuals. I have been recognized at large gatherings in front of the superintendent, I have been given recognition cards from my direct manager, but yet, anytime I’ve demonstrated how overwhelmed I am, or that I need flexibility to accommodate my Autistic sons part time school schedule, I have been turned away and made to feel like they don’t care. 

I have been trying hard to keep my head up and maintain a positive demeanor but every day, I am beaten down to the point where it’s been affecting my mental and physical health. Today I took the afternoon off after the busiest and most hectic past two weeks of my life, I even made an appointment with a psychiatrist on Monday to get help coping with my tremendous anxiety levels. 

I know the right thing is probably to stick it out for a year because it looks good on a resume, but every day I work here it is a huge struggle just to walk in the door. I am defeated, sad, and burned out. I’d love to hear what other people’s thoughts are on the situation and if they were in this same boat, what did you end up doing? Is this really worth all that it causes me? I want to start developing my career as I’m 28 and a college grad, but this place isn’t setting me up for success.

I am currently working in a role that is sales, commission and bonus. I make a decent living once everything is added up. My base right now is 60k, bonus 35k and commissions are decent.

This firm will pay for all my benefits, I get fridays off all summer long, unlimited pto and profit sharing as well. This jobs salary would meet cost of living for my family currently.

I’m currently in my 4th year of bachelors degree in software engineering. I was in my university’s co-op/ internship program before I was withdrawn from it since I failed one my 3rd year courses. I’ve been seeking external internships since. I get interviews here and there but don’t make it to the final round. 

I’m splitting my 4th year to take less work load so I can work on heavier side projects while im looking for internships. However, many internships now have been asking for at least one term of work experience which makes my chances of finding an internship slim this year. 

Though, I’ve been upgrading my skill and learning new programming skills to work on bigger projects this year which I hope can help me finding an internship this summer. 

But if I don’t, do you think having a well built personal projects portfolio could help me find an entry level job after graduation? Would creative projects be considered to be an asset if I don’t have any field related experience on my resume? I’m getting worried that I’m not going to find a field related job after graduation.

To be fair, my company is nice, and allows employees to pick whatever location they would like to complete their work. Coming into the office is permitted, but nobody actually goes in. I’m one of the few who goes into the office everyday, and I can honestly say that my mental health has improved significantly after I gave up on working from home. 

When I worked from home, I noticed that I became extremely lonely and felt isolated. I craved the opportunity to see literally any real person. I’d go for long walks during my lunch break to the grocery store just to see what real people look like lol. Now that I go to the office, I feel like my life has so much more purpose. I get to wake up early, take transit, and feel like I actually accomplished something. 

Sadly, my coworkers don’t agree. They actually think I’m crazy for wanting to come in. Honestly, I’d love it if we all same in and saw each other more often, but I know that they’re not interested in doing so

I am planning on quitting my current job and moving to a different city, the exact timeline isnt known, but I'd say the earliest would be in around 3 months and the latest would be no more than 12 months.

During my interviews, I made sure to express interest in moving into leadership roles at some point. I do want to be an engineer but figured at some point I also want to lead engineering projects, and maybe move into a leadership career track if I like it.

My boss told me a few weeks ago that there might be some opportunities coming up. I didn't expect it to actually work out, but I was just told that it has been decided that I will transition into the design team lead role for one of the projects I'm currently on. 

This project is smaller scope than most of the others, as it's mostly now just a bunch of testing of a product that is already designed. I was told an experienced leader would be able to manage it in less than 50% of their time a week, but it will be my full time appointment. I would be leading a team of only about 5 or 6 engineers. It's expected to wrap up probably late spring or early summer 2024.

I think it'd look good on resume to have performed this role but I am unsure if I will be able to see the project through to the end. And this job really is no longer the priority in my life.

At the same time, my boss is a good person that has worked to help meet my expressed career goals and I'm going to feel guilty quitting on him.

I am not sure what to do, as things are already in motion to start transitioning me to be a leader on this project.",RileyGaustad,2,0.75,5,1694623171,2023-09-13 16:39:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16hrvb5/would_it_be_wrong_to_accept_a_leadership_position/,9,2023

16hqymr,Finance major with passion for mentally retarded people,"Hello all,

I am currently studying finance as I have good connections and high aspirations in this field, but I also have a passion for the mentally retarded. 

 I went to a middle and high school that had a lot of people with intellectual disabilities (it was a connected school) and I always had taken a connection to them.  It all started when my mom told that autistic people aren’t really different than “normal” people, and since then my outlook has changed entirely and I really enjoy learning about them and being friendly with them.

My problem is I realized this passion too late. I’m kinda already too deep into business school and do like it, AND definitely don’t wanna do an extra 2 years for OT school.  I fear it may too late to switch majors so drastically.  But, I would still love to work with mentally retarded people.

16hqnba,Would work remotely when sick and take long annual leave nagatively impact my employment?,"I'm currently employed in a really big company here in the UK for a year. This is also my first job. I have a couple of questions regarding company policies, particularly in larger organizations.  
  
Working Remotely While Sick: I've been facing some health issues lately that make it difficult for me to work in the office consistently. I do have valid medical documentation to support my condition. I'm curious to know if anyone else in large companies has experience with working remotely when they are unwell? Are there policies in place to support such situations, or is it generally discouraged? How have companies handled similar cases?  
  
Taking Annual Leave: I want to use all my PTO all together, like for 30 days which would be around 6 month. This seems like quite a long time to be away from work, and I'm concerned about how this might impact my employment. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Did taking extended leave affect your job security or standing within the company?  
  
I understand that policies can vary widely from one company to another, but I would appreciate hearing about your experiences or any insights you might have on these matters.

16hqn80,Should I take a low-paying job and continue looking for a job and interviewing?,"My DW and I moved to a new country recently, she is working remotely on a term contract, I've been looking for a job for the last 6 months. Her income supplemented by our savings helped us get started  and pay the bills over the last 6 months. However, we can no longer sustain ourselves on a single income and will probably start falling short on our bills in the upcoming month of October.

I've got a job offer from an organisation in a role that is not in my career trajectory, the pay is abyssmal, my work-life balance would be absolute poppycock as well since it's a job with rotational shifts including weekends and public holidays. The organisation also has terrible reviews on Glassdoor. On the other hand I'm already interviewing with another organisation, it's in my career trajectory, the pay is good and work-life balance would be great as well; however, it's a competitive role, the interview process could take 6-8 weeks and there is a possibility that I might not get the job.

I'm thinking of taking the job I'm being offered and continue interviewing for the other role, if I crack the interview and get the job I can jump ship, if I don't get the job, at least I have a steady paycheck; and I can keep looking for another job.

16hqdvm,Is “quiet quitting” actually a unique concept to the younger workforce? Not prioritizing a personal life after work seems so foreign to me..,"I’m gen Z and recently started working full time. My attitude towards work has always been get in and get out. I’m in exactly 8 hours a day, and I’m very punctual to my clock in/out times down to the minute. I do my job, and attempt to do my best with most projects, but even though I generally enjoy my job, I do not think or care about it once I’m off the clock. My husband is the same way and honestly even more punctual than I am. Sometimes I don’t mind if a work conversation keeps me a minute or two late, but my husband will get up and ask someone to leave work with him if they want to continue to talk. Any conversation after 5pm happens in the parking lot next to their cars. And even then, if the conversation is exclusively about work he’ll cut it short to leave. We’ve always seen work as a strict 9-5 and time outside of that is for our personal lives.

I see people defining this attitude as quiet quitting.. but it’s quite shocking to me that this is a ‘new’ and ‘negative’ concept in the business world. Was there not always the average worker? Did everyone always put work first and work insane amounts of overtime etc etc. The concept of a ‘normal’ worker beyond these quiet quitting terms seems so foreign to me. I can’t imagine being expected to not put my personal life first after work. 

To add to this, I have noticed that my older coworkers all work much longer hours than I do. We have flexible time at my job and many of them are clocked in from 9-7 even as late as 8! None of them are married though, but still I can’t imagine always working so long? Do they really not have lives beyond work or perhaps that is the general attitude we’re supposed to have?? So far my boss has not cared that I work strictly 8:30-4:30 and often respects my time by not scheduling late meetings. But now I wonder if I should ask if I’m being seen as a quiet quitter.. 

I’m curious what people’s thoughts are on this? Has the younger generation actually developed a different work attitude? Or is it just a media attempt to normalize overworking and stigmatize having a personal life?",cabbage-soup,359,0.9100000262260437,391,1694619721,2023-09-13 15:42:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16hqdvm/is_quiet_quitting_actually_a_unique_concept_to/,9,2023
16hq588,Should I do a career change to psychology? Where can I study it and what should I expect?,"Hello! I'm 24M from Algeria. I have a computer science bachelor's degree and work as a freelancer in web design (UI/UX) for foreign clients. It's nice, but I really want to move out of Algeria, I always wanted to, it's just a question of how. It turns out that the easiest way is through a student visa. This got me thinking again about my old wish to study psychology (I didn't do it because it's pretty bad in Algeria), and considering a career change. The possible route is to study psychology and keep freelancing on the side at the same time to finance my stay abroad. Then when I become a psychologist, it might be possible to keep freelancing to support my income. I'm not sure how doable it is to juggle both but I hope it is, because I don't want my web design skills to go to waste.  
Now what I'm unsure of is where to study based on the accessibility for me and interests. I would much prefer to study in a tuition free or very low tuition university because I don't think I can afford US tuition for instance. Also, I'm very interested in becoming a psychotherapist. I'm not very interested in behavioral psychology and the more science and brain experiment-based approach to psychology. My goal with is to help people with their problems, I imagine that it can be the most rewarding job ever for me to do that. It would also be great to be able to work remotely, which is something therapists are apparently able to do. In the end, it would be amazing to do both web design and psychotherapy.  
So in which country/university should I look for this degree? Anything I need to keep in mind?

16hpkf0,Feeling lost... Psychology or economics?,"Hi there  
  
I've been feeling completely lost because I need to decide what I will choose as a career path in a few days. Any kind of advice is greatly appreciated.  
  
Basically psychology is something I've always been interested in, but it takes a huge amount of dedication and I'm not even sure if I am fit for it. Of course I would need to do a masters after the BA (the BA is worthless in itself), and then also another 2-4 year long course to be an actual therapist. The BA and Masters is government funded but the rest isn't.  
  
Economics on the other hand... it's not something that interests me, but I wouldn't hate it either. I know that there are many career options and many of them pay quite well (at least in my country) and have a nice career path. You can get jobs even with a BA (though the market is oversaturated atm). This is a field that is very often recommended to high schoolers who want to earn well, but not do IT or engineering. But from what I've heard it's really monotone and people burn out quickly if they aren't fit for it  
  
It scares me that I might change a career I completely regret (in my country you can't just change majors or double major, once you start the course it focuses entirely on the subject)",big_fIoppa,0,0.5,0,1694617808,2023-09-13 15:10:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16hpkf0/feeling_lost_psychology_or_economics/,9,2023

16hnh7h,Is security a viable career?,"For starters, I’m a 28 year old male living in Australia.

I have around 5 years of experience in the security industry. Personally, I do not like the industry because I feel like there’s no hope of progression to higher positions, people don’t really move from their positions which makes it even more stagnant. I like the current job I have because of the people I work with and well, my workplace is pretty relaxed in terms of what we do for our job.

I’ve started studying, 4th attempt at going to university so far and I’m starting to think that I’m not cut out for studying either. My traits and skills are compatible with anything to do business, specifically HR, i find myself repeating the same steps as before, letting go, not doing assignments although to be fair I have been experiencing health/anxiety issues which make it very hard to travel to university. Online is a no-go, too many distractions and I can really only absorb information in a direct type of learning.

I just want to chase bigger paychecks. I don’t even have savings to my name, i live paycheck to paycheck and feel like I’m wasting my time for no reason at all and am racking up useless debt. I can still pass the semester because my university is lenient with students who experience disabilities as long as I do the work and attend here and there but even then, is there any point?

One section of the business was a start-up, the rest of the company is pretty corporate, but I think they were acquired last year so they are still mixing the culture. We were talking how with the people who came from the start-up, it was very obvious and how different it was from the rest of the company.  
  
My coworker mentioned how years ago when she was briefly at a start-up, the culture was that no one wanted to make decisions, they would push responsibilities to other people, the hierarchy was flat (as a way for leaders to push off decisions to their reports), importance of ""face time"", cameras always on during meetings. When she said that, I gasped so loud because that's how the start-up people are at our company. It made so much sense and gave me a little more insight into my terrible boss.

16hls42,24 year old just beginning life,"I have been heavily effected by mental illness the past decade or so, and I'm just not sure what I should do/ am capable of doing? I managed to graduate high school and I have my gen eds out of the way, but other than that there isn't much to me. I have worked three different jobs, one being for my mother, and the other two don't look impressive at all on a resume. My mental health is sorta at a point now where it just ""is what it is"", I'm on an antidepressant that is better than nothing, but ultimately for now I just have to accept that life will be more difficult for me. Anyways, I am considering joining the Air Force, although I have dealt with mental health issues, I am still in good shape physically, and my issues didn't include any psychotic issues, ""just"" depression and anxiety, and I feel like the Air Force may be good because it would force me onto a strict schedule and also they pay for schooling and housing. A huge issue for me is that I really lack discipline and the military would enforce discipline into me.

I'm unemployed and not in school, and the logical next step would be to get a part time job and enroll back in school, I'm still living at my mothers house and I have EBT so I have virtually no expenses. I also have $15,000 that I got for my car that was totaled earlier this year (not at fault), so I can either get another car with that money, or use it for school, or possibly some other venture. 

I just don't have much passion for really anything, like every career I look at I judge how hard it would be for me mentally, how demanding it is, how many years of schooling, and just all these very overwhelming things that I have a hard time imagining myself doing. 

Another big factor that influences the way my life is going is I have never really been able to get good at anything regardless of how much I practiced. I am not stupid, I just get extremely overwhelmed and anxious and especially performing something at any type of high level and competing with others, my brain seems to hit this wall. I have so many examples of things throughout my life that I haven't succeeded at despite trying. It's so difficult to imagine myself truly succeeding at something and becoming an ""expert"" at anything. 

I also have this type of OCD where I am constantly questioning my intellectual capacity and my memory. Consequently, because of this, especially in high pressure, my mind panics and often blanks, but once again like I mentioned earlier, this is gonna be something that I will HAVE to push through, it just is what it is.

I am absolutely done living this non-existent life, for quite some time now I've literally just been existing and trying to figure out my mental health, and that's it. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks

16hjlwy,Should I leave my job after 2 months.,"For context, I am a psychology graduate who was working for a financial institution for around 4 years. I had a lot of great experiences there and made good relationships but I wanted to challenge myself to try something new. 

I was applying for roles for around 6 months, and finally scored this new role for a government owned agency. The job has great pay and benefits, however the role hasn’t been anything like what it was advertised to be. 

Since hiring me 2 months ago, I have received essentially no training or education (Despite this being a new industry for me). I have asked several times for extra training or assistance to feel confident enough to do the role, however my boss is very dismissive and basically says this will come later on. For additional context, she hasn’t been a manager before so I presume she doesn’t know how to (or can’t be bothered) to train me properly - which has left me feeling deflated and like I may have made a wrong decision moving into this industry. 

On top of this, for the few pieces of work I have managed to produce since starting, my manager has micromanaged every aspect of the process and told me off for minor things despite never training me on how to complete the tasks correctly. 

I am now in a position where I’m thinking this wasn’t the right career move for me, however I don’t want it to look bad on my resume that I was only in a role for 2 months - do you think this is a red flag to employers? 

(Also I can’t raise the problems with my manager or the role as I’ve already had a conversation with a senior leader in which they were also very dismissive and essentially said I need to “train myself”)

16hh3cv,"[NEW JOB] @ Citigroup bank as call center associate for customer service w/credit cards - its been very miserable, two weeks non-stop back-to-back calls... No such thing as 10 seconds b/w calls. Is this normal? Please advise","Helllo all I recently got a job at citi and am going through training. The job is essentially a call center job though wfh and helping customers with their credit cards. I have had a call center job before, which was much easier and I was hoping this would be something similar to that.  
  
However, there is never a break with citi. It is as if there remains an endless amount of customers to which you must help. There is never even 10 seconds between calls. Its back to back for your entire shift... for 2 weeks straight now. You can use a brief period of after call work but of course this is counted against you... heavily.... This is miserable. It is so much better if, at times, you get a minute or two between calls. I don't understand it. Take our class for instance... we just getting started on the phones. I don't know how many call center employees citi has doing what we do also, but I reckon it must be a decent amount. Then our class gets thrown in on top of it. Thats an extra 18 people taking calls. But still, never did even 10 seconds go between calls.  
  
What in the world....? Me and another classmate just looked at each other and were like this is big time miserable. At previous call center jobs (non finance field), there was much down time between calls. Sometimes they came in back to back for a few hours... but never non stop for literally 2 weeks now. Can anybody advise me if this is par for the course? I am hating the job more and more.... Please advise, thank you everybody \~",HabaneroHottest,2,1.0,0,1694592422,2023-09-13 08:07:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16hh3cv/new_job_citigroup_bank_as_call_center_associate/,9,2023
16hgogw,"Do I reapply for an internal vacancy that I was nearly chosen for, but ultimately rejected from?","hi everyone,

TL;DR: have accepted an external offer with a significant pay rise for an interesting role, but I have some doubts overall. An internal role opened up that I really really want, applied and was second choice but ultimately rejected for it. The internal vacancy is open again. Do I try to reapply, if so, how?

The too long part: 
I’m currently in the process of changing jobs, and it’s my first time doing so, so I think some advice might be useful for me. I am currently a Senior Strategy/Transformation Consultant at a large firm, completely client facing, and have been working here for just over 3 years. I joined right after university, but have had some jobs during uni that were office based and give me some relevant experience. 

I have accepted and signed a contract for a job at a different company recently, and handed in my notice at my current firm. The role is interesting, and they gave me an amazing offer (slightly better benefits and around 25% annual salary increase), but I have some reservations. Primarily I’m just conscious that it is a new and completely standalone role, with no immediate team or anyone else working in the same subject area. The company and the business unit are also both wayyyyy smaller than what I’m used to (currently working in a business unit of c. 400, new job is in a business unit of c. 80), which I am a bit hesitant of. However, the people seem lovely, the actual job is exciting, and it would be a development opportunity for sure in many ways. 

I applied for an internal transfer while I was interviewing for this external role (and a few other roles, but those don’t matter much). The internal role would be a promotion within the firm’s grade structure, and it’s internally focused (not client facing). The internal and the external role are similar in their subject matter, but a key difference is that the internal role has people management elements (day to day managing a team of 3), and more stakeholder management than the external role - I was very open in the interview that I have some experience in both, but not as much as other candidates might, who have been in employment for longer than i have. I did also give detailed examples of directly managing people in my current role. 

I interviewed for the internal role the beginning of the week two weeks ago, and felt positive but not overly hopeful. At this point, I have verbally accepted the external offer, but had the same reservations as mentioned above. They (internal hiring managers) said they’d get back to everyone that week, so when I haven’t heard by Friday I had chased the recruiter. I also able to figure out through some digging and diary stalking that they had made an offer to someone else, but they haven’t rejected / closed my application. The recruiter said she’d follow up and let me know asap. On Monday, I asked again, and got a similar response. On Tuesday morning, the Senior Manager from my interview messaged me, and we ended up talking over a call that afternoon. She explained that they had indeed made an offer to someone already, but that person ended up rejecting the offer. They really liked me, and I was their 2nd choice (she also mentioned that they had already rejected everyone else that they had interviewed), but that she just wanted to have a think because I am more junior than they had in mind and so she wanted to be sure. We had a good conversation, and she said she’d confirm first thing wednesday morning. 

They rejected me on Wednesday, and they have reopened the vacancy, both internally and externally. Now, the thing is, I really really fucking want this job, and Id be really good at it - the role is literally created based on my work and research, and was created as part of an internal transformation I worked on. it’s perfectly in line with my development goals personally and professionally, I know the company super well and I know i like it overall, and would prefer to stay at the firm (I decided to leave because of my department, rather than the firm overall). I have some great opportunities here that I’m really sad to be losing, too, which the other role doesn’t have, such as formal coaching programmes, both to be a coach and a coachee, both of which I’d have had in the internal transfer role. Lastly, I know some people in this team, all of whom love it and I know they are great people to work with too. 

The reopened job posting is live for another week. Do I reach out to the recruiter or the hiring manager? If yes, what do I say? Or do I just stick with my external offer, gain some new experiences, and see how I like it?",Annabanaana,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1694590874,2023-09-13 07:41:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16hgogw/do_i_reapply_for_an_internal_vacancy_that_i_was/,9,2023

16hfxhh,How do I raise this to my manager?,"I work closely with someone, we're both Analysts. She tells everyone that we work so great together (I agree in terms of the social aspect of it and some idea brainstorming). Although, I feel I like she would brainstorm ideas with me but I do all the implementation like literally the heavy lifting part eventhough we both should be doing it. We would split tasks but she would do her part looking like a draft which obv i have to do all over again (basically i could have literally done majority of the work myself).

She would sign us up in doing presentation or showcase of our work, and I would also try to make sure I get equal time to present but it's always like she wants to get more time. 

Since we work together, I know this would be understood as a team effort by everyone but whenever she speaks it feels like she's mostly taking majority of the credit or shares a lot of credit which it's kinda getting annoying when it's always almost 90% me and 10% her. She says ""i or me"" a lot.  She likes the attention and sometimes I feel like she tries to make it like we both did it when it's a good thing and she points at me if it's an unsure thing.

I've always been feeling like a show of her now just because she has more outgoing personality (regardless of how much i try) eventhough I do majority of the work. I've tried to talk to her but she's a different person when other people's around.

16hdypm,Is quant finance- or financial engineering the right choice? Also researcher or worker?,"So i am in the middle of my bachelor's degree in which i will graduate with a business analytics (with many courses on finance) major and a software engineering minor. The thing is i really like economics and finance but i also like algorithms and generally algorithmic thought which can be found in software engineering or mathematical optimization for example. Is there any sector that combines all of that? I am thinking of quant finance or financial engineering because it seems that it combines both math (which is not exactly algorithms but i guess its something) and finance. What do you think? Do you have anything else in mind?  
Also another concern of mine is that in the quant finance sector things are really year based and not performance based. Maybe its because i live in a conservative small country but it seems like for the first like 3 years you do nothing productive and you just prepare excels and power points. I really dont want my job to be something not constantly challenging and dynamic and new. A thought of mine is to maybe become a researcher on that matter or work as a researcher in a company (or even start my own). That being said i havent yet worked on quant finance to be sure for my claim. For that reason obviously any chance i get on working on quant finance i will follow through so i know for sure how things are.

16hdyi8,I’m not sure which career path to pursue,"I’ve graduated from college back in 2020, with a bachelors degree in marketing. During my time in college, I’ve never had an internship, which I now realize has made it substantially harder to find an entry level marketing role, since I have no experience in marketing itself. During my time in college, however, I worked a couple years for the university in the IT Helpdesk department, which really helped me land a couple remote IT helpdesk roles in the past couple years since graduating. I’m interested in tech, but I consider myself to be extroverted, and I love working with people. Call center work just wasn’t for me, and I left, thinking maybe sales was the right option. I did pretty well in sales, but the grindy cut-throat nature wasn’t for me. I’m 26, and I’ve been a good server full time to pay the bills. At this point, it’s really stressful trying to figure out what the right path is, and what I should do, and I’m tired of living paycheck to paycheck. I like working with people, but I’ve noticed that the tech industry can be really financially rewarding.

I’m wondering, is there something in tech that would be good for an extrovert, like myself, or a job that has marketing and IT overlapping? I’m happy to hear all suggestions. I’m happy to get any sort of certification that would prove useful",Sodapop_101,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1694581399,2023-09-13 05:03:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16hdyi8/im_not_sure_which_career_path_to_pursue/,9,2023

16hc82b,Aware That I’m Being Fired Soon - Any Employment Attorney’s? Overall Advice?,"If you want the fuller story you can go to my other Reddit but here’s a top line recap:

- I work in entertainment advertising as the only comms manager for an office of about 80 people. Tasked with drafting press releases, internal announcements, event planning, gifting, awards entries, etc.

- We had our biggest award entry of the year due last month and I had about 17 simultaneous awards entries going from copywriting to video producing case studies, etc. All on only me to do.

- I was under the impression that the deadline had been extended until the end of the month. The entry website had it listed as “Open For Entries - Enter Now!” up until last week. Anyways I had all of our entries in and they closed the portal just before I could submit the payment.

- Pleaded my case to the awards manager who said no. Then pleaded my case to the executive director of the awards who was very rude honestly and still said absolutely not, no exceptions. I was devastated.

- Had to call boss this weekend and ask for help. I was crying on the phone as I hate to let the company or her down. She called and magically the director woman lets us enter.

- Been trying to keep my head up. Found out today through an accidental email that they are planning to let me go. They are gonna try to get me to agree to a mutual separation agreement with 2 weeks of training someone else in the company to do my role and then 2 weeks severance.

I’m obviously heartbroken and also angry. I’ve been with the company for 5 years (one of the more senior people here), always had glowing performance reviews, very well liked in the office. It feels like 1 mistake and they aren’t considering a performance plan, transitioning me to a role where I’m not alone, getting me support, anything.

Is this a normal agreement proposal? I can’t imagine wanting to stay at the agency to train someone else for my job especially knowing I’m being fired essentially. Will they make it if I don’t agree to do that then I won’t get any severance? I feel like they are taking advantage again knowing how much I care or did.

16h9z64,How to feel less upset about my manager not letting me apply for a promotion?,"Hi! Work for a company that encourages movement every 18-24 months. After hitting my time and multiple review cycles of positive feedback from my peers and manager, my manager surprisingly shot me down when I asked to apply for a promotion on another team and said he wanted to “see more” and that I’m “not there yet” and that I should “keep doing what I’m doing” and he’ll support me for a new role starting next year. 

This came as a total shock to me as I consistently ask for feedback and have never received anything significantly negative. When I asked what he wanted to see more of, he couldn’t provide any concrete examples and kept saying vague phrases like “strategic thinking”. While it may not be the worst thing in the world to wait until next year like he asked, I feel frustrated that my peers are able to apply for new roles with their manager’s full support while I’m stuck twiddling my thumbs on what feels like an empty promise. 

I’d always felt like I had a good relationship with my manager so now I can’t help but feel entirely disconnected to him and this job. I also feel salty towards my teammate that’s been applying for roles and is getting the support he needs, despite us doing the exact same thing for a similar timeframe and the fact that I constantly pick up after the things he forgets to do. My manager also recently left for PTO for a full week and had zero coverage to hand off because surprise, I do everything for him! Ugh.

16h9dw2,Do I leave my stable job/career for a new one that has nothing to do with my current job?,"I have been in education for just over 15 years in the US.  I was a special education teacher before making the switch to administration.  I have worked hard to support and make positive changes for teachers, building administrators, and families.  In my career, I have worked for different districts both small (approx 400 kids in the whole district) and large (the biggest 2 districts in our state approx 70K students, one is where I currently hold my AD position).  We are doing great things to help KIDS but it is the ADULTS that are making my job impossible.  Please don't get me wrong, the majority of staff are fantastic!  They are dedicated and continually go above and beyond for the KIDS, but as in any line of work, the few ruin it for the majority.  The pushback on the smallest of items is incredible (for example, implementing a schedule that provides all students their needed services - for those unaware these services are LEGALLY BINDING for students in special education making this a nonnegotiable for the job).  It was recently suggested to me to take my skills to the private sector, and I'll be honest I'm wondering if I should.

Currently I:

* manage 40 direct reports and 340 indirect reports over 35 site locations
* manage multi-million dollar budgets
* create and deliver onboarding
* create and deliver continued professional learning
* review company policies and update them through a collaborative process when needed
* assists with recruiting, screening, interviewing, and disciplining regarding staffing
* attention to detail and documentation
* communication with staff and families including the creation of public notices
* oversite of compliance with state and federal laws
* plan, organize, and conduct high level meetings as well as location specific meetings
* ensure systems are working efficiently and being utilized
* collaboration with other companies and agencies
* lead collaboration with stakeholders to make changes or update current systems

So here is my question, am I crazy for considering this?  If I leave my current position it could take me years to get it back.  If I take these skills outside of education or anything that has to do with kids (most ideas I am finding still have to do with kids) where do I take them?

16h85pc,"Update: Got thrown under the bus by my boss, now what do I say when I'm asked about what happened during the department meeting?","First of all, thank you, thank you to all that gave advice. It meant a lot. Monday morning I emailed by boss and my boss's boss with a very high level overview of what happened (without mentioning my boss using some of the wording y'all suggested), what I need clarity on/will change next time, suggested solutions etc. My boss's boss wrote back and he seemed very impressed that I wrote and he had positive feedback. And he suggested all 3 of us sit through a ""change process plan"" The meeting ended up being fine, I wasn't grilled on anything or put in a bad light. I sent out an calendar invite both of them, which is later this week. Where was my boss during all these? I don't know, because he never responded to the email chain or sent out an invite (I sent it out at the end of the day to see if he would step up). And he never spoke up during the meeting when I spoke.

I'm still doing the CYA-email plan. He's been responding to them so far. Since I sent out that email his demeanor seems a bit deflated, or maybe I'm projecting. But his behavior is still kind of them same. He's taking absolutely no initiative to try and improve anything. It's all me. He's made no effort to improve his decision making (still trying to push everything on me), or being clearer with what he needs (ex. instead of ""we need to bring Project Vulcan's watch revenue up by 20% by X, Y, Z"", he'll be like ""we should work on watches, so yeah.....""). Seriously, he uses ""yeah"" so much to try to explain stuff and he can't articulate when I try to get details.

Although I feel positive about my boss's boss reaction to it, I'm still nervous for this meeting about putting together a plan for change process. Really the main issues are that he doesn't know how to articulate in a clear and confident way, still doesn't listen, doesn't understand what we do, doesn't know how to prioritize and he doesn't know how to lead. The biggest thing is that he doesn't want to make decisions. 

Any advice going into the change process meeting?

They totally tried to phrase it like I'd done something wrong when I have no write ups or performance issues. 

I dont want any more money and I understand it's way more than I'm entitled to. What gets me is the non-disparaging clause in the agreement. It says I can't talk about my package but I have. It says I can't negatively comment on my situation but I have. All in person other than this post. No online talking. 

I wanted to leave a glass door review but haven't. This was definitely unwarranted and they know it hence the six weeks.

16h3vfw,Negotiating Job Offer for a More Senior Level Role,"Hi Reddit - not sure how I should approach this. I recently received a job offer from a company that I'm overqualified for. I currently have a cushy job where I make about 16% higher salary than what the position is offering me. 

The reason I'm thinking about leaving is that this new company has many intangible benefits including more comfortable work/life balance, team of previous coworkers I got along with very well, and slightly more interesting work. I could see myself there long-term whereas I'm already feeling kind of burned out at my current job. 

The offer they've given me is the absolute maximum they can stretch for the role. However, I discovered through multiple internal resources that they have a vacant senior-level role in their org chart that they haven't posted yet for unknown reasons. No one on the current internal team is qualified, but I would easily fit the bill. 

Two questions -

1. Is this more senior-level role something that would be appropriate negotiating in a job offer?
2. If so, how would I go about bringing that up? I think it's kind of weird outing that I received this information from internal staff because it's not public knowledge.",gaucaflackaflame,1,1.0,0,1694554503,2023-09-12 21:35:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16h3vfw/negotiating_job_offer_for_a_more_senior_level_role/,9,2023
16h3r5p,"[ADVICE NEEDED] [ELECTRICAL FIELD] I am interviewing for a ""Project Engineer - Protection/Relay Settings"" role at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories. I have questions and concerns that I'd love some insight on.","I understand this will be a bit of a read, but here are some details as context for my questions/concerns at the end:

  
**Job Description**  
Preferred Qualifications:  
\- Electrical Engineering degree or relevant discipline  
\- Experience with electric power transmission, distribution, and/or generation systems  
\- Experience being a part of and/or leading a project team

  
Protection Specialization:  
\- Experience creating protective relay settings for transmission & distribution utilities, substations, generation facilities, and industrial clients  
\- Experience including (but not limited to) line, bus, transformer, autotransformer, and feeder relay settings  
\- Experience reviewing design packages including one-lines, three-lines, AC schematics, DC schematics, wiring diagrams, bill of material, SCADA points lists  
\- Demonstrated ownership of each stage of the settings creation process, calculations, and delivery of high-quality work  
\- Deep level of understanding of zones of protection, instrument transformers, and protective relaying schemes

  
**My Background**  
\- 7 years in the US Navy as a Nuclear Electronics Technician  
 \- Qualified Reactor Operator  
 \- Extensive amount of maintenance done on reactor protection systems  
 \- Supervised junior Sailors on complex maintenance tasks  
 \- Strong emphasis on understanding technical drawings

  
\- 2 years as an Instrumentation and Controls Technician  
 \- Installed, maintained, troubleshot, and commissioned critical power equipment  
 \- Strong emphasis on understanding technical drawings

  
\- 3 years as a Field Service Engineer (this is where most of my qualifications for the job above reside)  
 \- Installed, maintained, troubleshot, and commissioned critical power equipment  
 \- Took on project management related tasks in terms of coordination with contractors, procurement of necessary equipment from internal warehouse as well as through vendors, and writing integration and commissioning procedures based on the job site.  
 \- Performed a significant amount of root cause analysis when necessary.  
 \- Mild experience with SCADA and Modbus/Ethernet networks

  
**My Questions**  
1. Based on the job description, what would you recommend studying in preparation? I am working on compiling a study plan, but I'd greatly appreciate some outside perspectives on this.

  
2. When it comes to protection relay settings, what are some important settings and concepts I should be familiar with? (See concern #1 below the questions section for context.)

  
3. Does anyone here work at SEL or are you familiar with this role specifically? What tips do you have?

  
4. Besides googling, are there any resources you recommend that I utilize while studying?

  
5. In regards to my concerns below (it may help to read them first), how can I come back from a failed question, or, worst case, if I feel that the technical interview went poorly? How can I convey that I am a person who can learn quickly and that I have full confidence in myself to perform the job (because I do)?

  
**Concerns/Thoughts of Mine Going into the Interview**  
1. This role is heavily geared towards protection relays, the way they interact with the distribution system, and the plethora of settings they have associated with them. In my Field Service Engineer role, I was directly exposed to SEL and similar relays at every job site. However, I have not had much experience with the settings that can be altered and what sorts of things are being considered when determining the settings to be used. As I explain in concern #3, I know for a fact that I can learn and master these concepts. But, given my limited exposure to them, I am a bit nervous about being able to intelligently speak on them and instill confidence in my interviewers.

  
2. I have a long career in the power distribution field, however, I am extremely intimidated when it comes to demonstrating electrical theory knowledge. I understand the fundamentals and I feel as though I can hold my own when speaking on most topics. However, I also feel that I have gaps in my knowledge, which I am doing my best to fill. But, the range of questions I can be asked is so broad, I feel a bit overwhelmed going into this.

  
3. To go along with concern #1, I have a strong ability to absorb and retain complex subjects due to the rigorous training I received while in the Navy. On the flip side, I believe this is where my anxiety comes from when it comes to having my knowledge tested. I was expected to know anything and everything about the reactor plant given my role as a Reactor Operator, and heavily scrutinized for any gaps in knowledge.

  
4. Given the above mentioned anxiety, I can get quite flustered when I am approached with a topic that I am not fully confident in. When this happens, it's easy for me to completely lose my train of thought and in turn may make me seem incompetent or unprepared for the interview, knowledge check, or board review that I am in at the time.

  
5. On a positive note, SEL provides a fully fleshed-out training program when hired on. This, along with my ability to learn quickly, instills a level of confidence in myself that I can excel in this role given the opportunity  


**That's It**  
Anyway, that's about it. I know this is a lot of negativity and I'm beating myself up quite a bit. But, I wanted to be genuine in my feelings going into this interview. Any help and insight would be much appreciated.

16h1rq8,Should I consider a career in engineering and how would I start?,"Hoping to get some advice from engineers, but I guess the AskEngineers and engineering subreddits are both the wrong place for this? Please let me know if there's a better spot for this.

Hi all, hope this is the right place to ask this but I was hoping for some advice from people in the field. I am currently struggling to find a good career path after graduating from college with bachelors degrees in math and physics.  
  
For some context I started off in a community college and transferred to a university, initially just studying math. In community college I really liked math, I took the highest level math courses they offered there, which went up to calc 3 and ordinary differential equations. For the most part the courses just came naturally/felt easy to me, I was able to learn from lectures and doing the homework assignments without ever needing to read the actual textbook. For some context, I absolutely hate reading and don't feel I really learn well from it, I tend to learn from seeing examples worked through and doing problems myself. I also took physics 1 in community college and had a similar experience and enjoyed the subject.  
  
After I transferred to university though it felt like nothing made sense. I'm not sure if it's because they had higher standards, a different teaching style, or more reliance on reading the book. I suspect it was a combination of all of the above. In community college I didn't feel like it was about reading or memorizing much of anything, it was always just problem solving, using logic to get from a to b, and actually doing problems to learn the subject. Either way, the end result is that I have two degrees in subjects that I now feel I don't remotely understand and am too stupid to use in a job.  
  
After I graduated I decided to study on my own for a bit to become an actuary, I had a friend who had gone to the same university who went through their actuarial program, and he had to take the actuarial exam yet anyway so we studied together. It seemed like a good goal as the actuarial field always came up as a highly recommended field. The subject itself wasn't that horribly interesting to me at the time but the math was easy enough and it was kind of fun to work through the math and problem solve with someone else.  
  
After a few months of studying we took the exam and I passed, shortly after I was able to get a temporary position as an actuarial analyst at a consulting firm. I hated it. Basically all of the work was using Microsoft office programs, mainly Excel, Word, and Access. Using Excel I expected, and in some ways I didn't mind, but there was a lot more time spent on formatting and checking than the actual math. Like I said before, the math itself wasn't that complicated, instead a lot of the work was more along the lines of coding or understanding the products that we were working with. I don't necessarily mind coding, but I definitely am not interested in it or particularly good at it. Additionally there was a lot more reading/document work than what I was expecting, there were days that I would have to spend most of the time reading through state regulations for example. Not to mention I just didn't feel like my work was up to the company standard and I always felt like the dumbest person in the room, and frankly I probably wasn't wrong about that. When I interviewed they made it sound like it was a 6 month position and then they would either let you go or hire you as a regular employee. Around the 6 month time I had a discussion with my supervisor and he informed me that the 6 months wasn't set and stone, I could still basically be in the ""temporary"" position indefinitely. I stayed for almost a year and nothing changed, in the end I just mentally couldn't handle it, I just felt like I was too dumb for the job and quit.  
  
And now here I am, I'm not really sure what I should be looking for. I do know that I want something more visual if that makes any sense. I thought that mechanical engineering might make sense, but I don't know what the day in a life of an engineer really looks like. I could see myself enjoying working with stuff like building 3D models, but I have no experience in it. I am also concerned that there would be too much reading, or that I wouldn't be smart enough, or that I just wouldn't understand the physics needed. I am also concerned that I would misunderstand projects/directions given, this felt like a common issue that I had working as an actuary. People would say and mean one thing and it felt like I would constantly interpret it as something completely different, at the end I was just wondering if there was something wrong with me, it felt like I was just defective or something. Is this something that I should even be considering, and if it is how would I even start? I'm just really not sure what to even be looking for at this point.  
  
Sorry for the wall of text, I just thought it would be better to give more context rather than less. Thanks for any advice given.

There are other people orgs that offer this career, but my org is really awful, there is no oversight and rules are constantly broken to benefit a few. Any complaints from gender, race or religious minorities are followed up with being summarily fired. There is no data capture of why people leave or return. HR is obscenely terrible. Eventually, the stress of the environment made me sick and now I must leave with a disability. No exaggeration. I have worked pretty diligently and consistently to make to my career dream that amounted to be more of a nightmare. For some reason, I cannot apply for a job. I have tried to start applications, therapy, EDMR, gratitude journaling, meditation, spiritual guidance and friends’ support for people in and outside my career space. Nothing is working. I have started working out feeling better. Still nothing. I had a particularly gruesome period where I was also harassed by HR to swallow at abuse at work that sustained for over two+ years.

16h0z7r,Am I being gaslit of am I being too “sensitive”?,"For all intents and purposes, this is my first real job. I’ve been assigned to a team which everyone in the organisation agrees is an extremely toxic team owing to the team lead who’s very brash and unreasonable. I work in this team under my reporting manager who reports to the team lead. I’ve joined alongside two other campus hires though they have another reporting manager. Now the issue is that I seem to be over burdened by work which is Atleast two times more than other colleagues who work at the same level as me. Whenever I try to bring this up to my manager, I am told that I need to work on my efficiency. I’ve started working about 12-14 hours a day ( a lot more than other new joinees) but all of concerns are always scoffed at or answered with “just get more efficient”. And I’m totally at a loss because trust me I am trying my level best but nothing seems be enough and I’m at a loss here. I don’t know to bring this up with. The team lead is toxic anyways. And my reporting manager recently let us know that she’s moving out of the company and since then she has dropped any pretence of being nice and understanding. If I take a sick day I’m told of the work I’m supposed to present on the next day. I’m extremely lost because while I’m struggling my bosses are hell bent on telling me that there’s something wrong with me while I’m doing everything humanly possible.

16h0vpd,Am I too late to study Physics at 32?,"LONG POST AHEAD, if you wanna skip to the core, scroll to the boldened part at the end  
  
  
  
Hi there, 32(m) here. I had a rocky life with less-than-ideal parents, and a major depressive episode in my mid-20s that set me back. I'm semi out of the woods in that sense, for the most part, but still unhappy with my life. The main reason is that I don't get to do what I would love to, namely work in tech/Physics. However, I'm underqualified to apply for jobs (or at least so I feel), more importantly, ""people who make it"" typically have a combination of luck and resilience that allows them to get it all straight in their 20s (finish uni, find the desired job, etc.).  
  
  
  
Anyway, this was a short intro. Now, onto a brief bio about me of the most relevant facts:  
  
\- in high school, I was an above average student while studying nearly nothing. At the cost of sounding arrogant, I think I'm close to the ""gifted"" territory.  
  
\- shortly after, I enrolled into a top uni in my country (and in EU) that taught Business Administration. My program was very renowned and would typically land you a high-paying corporate job. I tried fairly hard in this program and was among the top 5% of students upon finishing the 3-year Bachelor, an achievement which landed me 2 scholarships, at the uni I studied, and at another I applied to (in France). However, toward the end of the program, I became VERY disillusioned with Business (and Management books in particular). In high school, my passion was always Mathematics/Physics, I enrolled into Business with the illusion that I would do tons of mathematics and study complicated concepts, instead I was basically fed psychology minutes (such as, what type of organizations there are, horizonal and vertical, types of managers, some accounting classes... if you studied business, you know the gist).  
  
  
  
This disillusion led to me abandoning this career path. I took a 1-year break to study a foreign language in order to enroll at a university that taught what I truly liked, which at that point I felt was Mathematics/Physics. I succeeded in learning this language and enrolled at a top-tier Uni in Europe in a Physics program  
  
  
  
\- my Physics path was rocky to say the least. In the country where I enrolled, University is something very elite, visited by relatively few people. In my country of origin, in contrast, up to 60% of population attempt university, so even my elite Business Administration course was comparatively easy because the bar was lower. Anyway, I completed all my coursework until the 4th semester on the 1st try (which, if you judge by this metric, I guess would put me somewhere in the top 15% of people). I also completed the last year of the 3-year B.Sc. in Physics program on time. However, my grades, which were excellent in my B.A. Bachelor, were average at best in Physics. I blame this especially on the (initial) disadvantage I had compared to people who came from high school with a preparation higher than mine. But most of the ""blame"" is to be put on professors, I suppose. Our exams weren't ""fair"", or similar to the coursework that was given during the semester. Anything could happen at an exam. Sentiment was widespread that grading was generally unfair (most students were ""average students"" like me, there weren't really top performers), but overall if you studied, you'd pass. I guess to say it shortly, my university didn't buy into the notion of ""grade inflation"".  
  
  
  
\- at this point, I fell into depression. My self-esteem was always deeply tied to my work performance. Getting average grades after my B.A. B.Sc. ""taught me"" that I am more of a ""straight As"" kind of guy was a very big blow to my ego. More importantly, at this point in time I was also worried A LOT about how I would explain to an employer that although I'm smarter than most of the workers at a company, my grades tell a different story. My uni didn't really care about this sort of placement stuff.  
  
  
  
\- major life events here intervened to worsen my mental state. Living in a foreign country, too many girls rejecting me, and a harsh family situation contributed to worsen my self-esteem even further and worsen my depression.  
  
\- I started with a M.Sc. at the same uni, but never completed it. I was given to understand that the M.Sc. is A LOT easier, in fact, most exams become oral exams. At oral exams, the ""human factor"" matters more, questions are A LOT easier, and in short, everyone gets good grades. This is something I underestimated at the time, though, because at this point in life I was 26 or so, and very worried that I still had ZERO work experience. I wanted to do an internship at a research lab, or maybe a bank, idk.  
  
\- the last years in our story that bring us to 32 have been me being in depression, slowly recovering, and taking shit jobs (and I mean, VERY shit jobs, I endured employers not paying me, screaming at me on the phone, my phone number being blocked, paying for trains to go to work only to never see a paycheck... this was a very low period in my life). In the end, I managed to land a semi-decent job at a tier 3 Engineering company (I would call tier 1 companies like JPMorgan or Google, tier 2 would be those that would open the door into a tier 1 company, i.e. those that have structure and good internal processes, but no prestige, and tier 3 is basically family-run companies that do something right and show a profit, but where employee specialization is low). The money is above average for my country (especially for a career start), but I really dislike the people there. The company is too politics-driven, there is no real management (so most people basically come to work to do what they like, with the speed they like, with all the stress that ensures), and protocols are few and not enforced (which results in loads of mistakes, and I mean LOADS, from warehouse management mistakes, to purchasing dept. mistakes, etc.).  
  
  
  
For the past few years, I've been convinced that my true passion in life is Physics. I would like to work on Physics-related projects long-term, or work in research. While it might not be evident from my story that I love Physics, I really would love to go back, and give it another go. In terms of personality, and passions, I believe this is the right choice for me. Maths and Physics are breaths of fresh air for me.  
  
  
  
However, this brings us to the painful question of whether it's still possible for me to work in math-related fields. The biggest hurdle I see to this is my age.  
  
My current plan would be to get enough money to finish my M.Sc., and give an M.Sc. in Physics another go. I predict that I will have an M.Sc. in my hands (which at the uni I'm planning to attend lasts a full 2 years) at the age of 36-37. From there, I am considering the following paths:  
  
a) pursuing a Ph.D.: motivation-wise, at the moment it doesn't seem a problem. However, if we assume an average of 4 years to complete it, I would be 41 with minimal work experience. Since I don't plan to stay in academia, but would rather apply Ph.D. knowledge to industrial work, I see it as a potentially big hurdle to come to an interview as a 41 yo and show minimal work experience. On the plus side, my Business degree taught me some everyday psychology, I can read people well, I took marketing classes and all and in short, I think I know how to sell myself fairly well, how to write CVs to minimize weaknesses and emphasize strengths, and all that.  
  
b) pursuing a career in Data Science: is a Ph.D. needed here, or is a M.Sc. enough? What are my chances here as a 37-something entering the field?  
  
c) pursuing a career in AI: similar considerations to Data Science  
  
d) pursuing a career in Quantum Computing/Experimental Physics at a lab/company. Again, is a Ph.D. ""required"" here due to the sheer competition? Would my age be a hurdle?  
  
e) pursuing a career at institutes like CERN/Max Planck Institute/Fermilab etc.: is a Ph.D. needed here, or a Masters enough?  
  
f) pursuing a career in finance/quant finance: I deliberately list this as last, because I think this is a very overhyped job. Nevertheless, the money is VERY good, and I'm fairly sure that an M.Sc. is enough here. Still, the question remains whether ageism at 37 would make me an unideal candidate, or not  
  
g) pursuing a career at a tier 1 engineering company (like ABB). Here I think M.Sc. is enough, and ageism wouldn't be too relevant as I could show previous work experience at a similar job.  
  
  
  
Sorry for the long wall of text! I would gladly hear your thoughts on the following questions:  
  
Is finishing Physics a good idea for my personal situation? I am mostly worried about age. I know I have what it takes, intelligence- and perseverance-wise, but I am afraid I will always be seen as a bottom-of-the-barrel candidate, having finished Physics at 36-37. While I've come to realize that Physics is a deep passion of mine, ultimately I'm in it also if I can make a (small) career out of it. Studying Physics to relegate it to a nighttime reading doesn't sound appealing.  
  
Is finding a job in an unrelated field in what I will call ""the Tech Industry"" (very umbrella term) at 37 possible at all if you have a recent, relevant degree? Or should I not bother?

16gypiv,Former boss will be my boss again in the same company.,"Hello, this is my situation, and I need some advice. I moved to the United States through a company mobility program in New York. Although I'm a foreigner, I pursued my master's degree here. I joined the company just before the pandemic reporting to C-suit member. 
During the pandemic, I requested a relocation outside the state where my company has an office. Since my company operates throughout the US, it wasn't a significant issue. Around that time, company decide to split that department and my boss received a promotion and moved out of the country. The company hired another manager for the old function and then crated a news department, where I’m the lead manager. I established a new team, and things were going well. I now have a dual reporting structure, answering to the CEO and my manager in Asia.

However, in the last five months, I've been receiving negative feedback from my Asian manager. No reason. He's been complaining that other managers can't fully assess my work because I'm working remotely. I asked more feedback but he was not able to provide details. Just general comments. 

Today, he informed me that my former boss, who is in Asia, wants to return to the US and take back my position. He suggested that I stay with the same salary and title but report to my old boss. He mentioned that the CEO considered terminating me, but he (Asian boss) argued against it, believing that I am valuable and my former boss and I can create a all start team together. I'm under 40, and he thinks this transition with my old boss (60) as a mentor might be a better fit for me.

My initial reaction was to resign. However, I feel my Asian boss is right. I feel I don’t have the skills (yet) and the energy to lead the department but I also feel that the situation is kind of weird. I'm contemplating how to inform the company and other managers about this potential change (story). Part of me believes this could reduce my workload and improve my quality of life, but I'm uncertain about how to handle this situation with my team and other managers before the official announcement. It appears my former boss wishes to return to the US due to cultural reasons and his family's relocation. What are your thoughts, and how should I manage this situation? Any advice?",Resident-Afternoon12,3,1.0,2,1694542652,2023-09-12 18:17:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16gypiv/former_boss_will_be_my_boss_again_in_the_same/,9,2023

I’m Italian and I have a C1 cert in English language. 

I have a master degree in psychology and I’ve always worked with children as a nanny and teacher.

I’m looking to change my career and live in the Netherlands mostly.
 My dream would be a job that gives me the freedom to live a bit in the NL and a bit in Italy. 

For this reason I would like to learn another language that would be easier for me: French or Spanish? Which one would give me more chance for a job in the NL or Europe in general? A remote job would do to.

I don’t really know which job, but I have ADHD and I’m an INFJ, so I’m open for suitable entry lever suggestions that pay good enough.

16gxv9d,Should I Ask for a Raise?,"Okay, so I work at a FQHC as a SUD case manager/patient coordinator. Besides my actual job functions which include patient tracking (approximately 120-145 active patients), scheduling, refill requests and referrals for community resources. I also participate in a local Taskforce which has several ongoing projects to promote harm reduction education and anti-stigma. I have also contributed to planning and implementation of clinic program improvements. Basically, helped in integrated a specialty into primary care - not easy to do with SUD & residency program. 

I have done all of this (Taskforce, implementation, etc.) in the 6 months since my first 6-month review. I feel like I’m working way above my pay grade, but I’ve *never* held a job with responsibilities that might put me in a position to ask for a significant raise. My 1-year is coming up and I’d like to ask for a raise or change in contract. I currently make $60k in WA but would like to increase by $5-7 yearly. Certain individuals I work with think I’m making way too little. I only have a BA in Psych.

Anyways, I would love to hear from the community. Would you go for a raise and how so? Might it appear I’m too lofty considering my low education?

From there, I got into Account Management. Over the years, it's had its ups and downs- I am currently working as a Renewal Manager for a large, well-known tech company. The post-COVID world has been hard on our clientele and it's very hard to hit quota and essentially, morale is pretty low. I've also just been sick of the sales grind for a long time now. I'm a mother now and my priorities have shifted. 

I've long wanted to make the leap into the Learning and Development space because I'm best at training and mentoring, but my current org doesn't have much of an established training program. I also considered going back to get my master's to become a therapist, but over the years I've become interested in Organization Development Consulting, as it would combine my talents. 

The thing is that it's a big investment to become certified and I still have so much to learn about what would be available to me if I were to do that. 

I'm curious to hear about anyone making the leap from sales to a more rewarding, but still lucrative career. I feel like the only way I can make a jump in careers is if were to happen internally and that doesn't seem like an option at the moment.

16gx9yt,"My internship is killing me, am I the problem?","So I've been working for this company for 4 months, 40 hrs per week or so, remotely, and had a pretty tough time already one month in. I work in a small organization with one direct supervisor who micromanages me to an unbearable extent. A couple of examples:

\- Finishing all my assigned tasks at 5 p.m. and being asked to wait around for my supervisor to greenlight one of my tasks. I offered to stay for 45 more minutes to wait for the approval & finish the task but stated I couldn't stay more than that -- found out my response was reported by my supervisor to the management as 'unwilling to stay over 30 mins to finish a task'. Later that day, the supervisor approved my work at 8pm, aka 3 hours later.

\- Consistent complaints about me taking 30 minutes to perform a task my supervisor says they can do in 5 minutes. Mind you, on my second week. 

\- Complaints about me requesting additional help/info from my fellow interns on a day my supervisor is out of the office, because 'why did you need to contact everybody else before me?'

\- After these complaints, an official email from my supervisor with extended feedback on what processes I can change (improvement!!), followed by complaints about me prioritizing speed over quality of the work (!!!!???)

\- In these circumstances, I reached out to HR and asked for help on how to manage interactions with my supervisor as I was experiencing a somewhat hostile work environment. HR tells me my supervisor likely knows better, and basically to shut up and do my job. A veteran intern kindly informed me that my supervisor and the HR person are very close in IRL, and that other previous complaints also got dismissed.  

\- I've been told by fellow employees that during management meetings my supervisor complains about me occasionally not turning on my camera during morning meetings (while 3 other employees consistently don't either - I share my working space and it's not always private). That I'm part of 'the new generation' and very obviously cannot properly perform in a corporate environment -- all while I never receive any face-to-face feedback of this kind.

Lastly, I'm not perfect and have made mistakes and errors of judgment, but I'm also severely overworked as right now our department is just me and my supervisor. This is the first time I have experienced such type of management despite having 4 other internships in the bag, and frankly, I don't know if I should be dropping it or not.

16gx32r,What should I do?,"Hello there! 

I'm from India, hailing from a lower middle-class family. In 2019, I graduated with a B.Tech in civil engineering, achieving a good rank. Initially, I pursued a career in construction due to family support. However, I soon realized the limitations and challenges in the construction sector, especially without influential connections.

I made the decision to switch to the IT sector, teaching myself Python while still working in civil engineering. I did secure an initial IT job, but due to personal reasons, I had to leave it. From the start, my aspiration has been to work abroad, but I'm facing uncertainty about how to make this dream a reality.

I'm willing to take any available job to accumulate savings for ticket and visa expenses, but I also need to support my family back in India once I move abroad. This situation is challenging because I can't rely on my family for financial help.

I'm truly confused about what path to take. I'm ready to seize any opportunity that comes my way, as long as it helps me support my family. Your guidance and advice would mean the world to me. 🙏

16gwzv1,Recent grad who took a job unrelated to degree considering switching back,"I studied mechanical engineering in college, had a few internships and a solid resume.  Graduated about a year ago. 

Ended up taking an opportunity in commercial real estate as a broker in a new state from the one I grew up in, I just had a gut feeling about it as I could use my analytical and people skills, and I really liked the team and the company. 

About 6 months in and not enjoying it as much as I thought I would.  I knew heading into this role that it would be tough, especially with the current RE market. 

I am considering two options:

1. Stick it out - my main concern is money, I’m paid on commission and living off savings. My pipeline has fallen apart recently (lots of deals aren’t happening right now tbf) and I barely have a leg to stand on, and as we approach the holiday seasons at the end of the year, things tend to slow quite a bit.  This said, once things do pick up, the commission checks are fairly handsome, just one decently sized deal can cover my living expenses for a year, but the deals take a very long time to close. 

2. Go back to engineering - Move back home (large city with plenty of opportunity) and get an engineering job there.  I have leaned towards this option because I will have a more secure income and will save a lot of money living at home. I can use my current real estate investing knowledge that I’ve learned to start learning more and start investing my earned income into real estate when the time comes.

I would appreciate anyone’s feedback on my situation.  I know that time wasn’t built in a day and 6 months isn’t much, but there’s also the possibility of sticking this out for too long and going broke.

16gw991,Which job should I accept?,"Background: I was a nanny for 8 years, and then worked at a trade association for the past year. I did event planning and membership management (I built the membership program from scratch). Really startup-y and got a lot of great experience with PM, design work, etc.

Job 1: Program Manager for a nonprofit involving children. I'd be managing their after school STEM programming, and also bringing a lot of it to life. Ideating, executing, managing people. It pays 50k, standard benefits.

* Pros: Flexibility to WFH. office is 5 minutes from my house. It's a good career story that ties in my previous experience and gets me more experience with I want to go (project / program management). Having a 'program manager' title would be awesome for future opportunities.
* Cons: Nonprofit pay stinks and I sort of want to get out of the nonprofit space. I'm exhausted by my last job and I'm scared it would more of the same -  under resourced, over worked.

Job 2: Administrative Coordinator for an air conditioning contractor. It pays 55k with bonuses, flexible sick policy, great benefits.

* Pros: Company treats employees extremely well. They pay your whole health insurance premium (and your family if you have one). Opportunity to grow within the company. Very little job stress. This is the kind of position where I could show up, do my job, and live my life outside of work stress-free. Very understanding and supportive management.
* Cons: It's a step down in responsibility and more of a support position. I'm a thinker and a builder and worry about getting bored doing repetitive work. Job is on-site and is a 20 minute drive. Don't want to be pigeonholed into admin work.

&#x200B;

Please offer some perspective! I'm really excited about both of these opportunities in different ways.

I'm 30 years old, a Temp Recruiter for a new start-up company and I cannot stand the thought of being here for another 15 minutes let alone another 30+ years.  I've been told I'm long-winded so I will attempt to keep this short and sweet but anyone willing to help is appreciated. 

I've never really been passionate about anything in my life, besides playing sports, especially at the age they want you to be ready to attend school and have an idea of what you want to do with your life. 

I'm now 30, with a child and wife and I feel like everything I do is wrong, the career path I'm on is a dead end. I was told this position would be different and more high-level recruiting.  Well, It's been 6 months and I'm still hiring Forklift Drivers who call off every day because their daughters, grandmas, cats cousins fell into a hole and their car was stolen. The point of this post is to ask for **HELP!** I have my first therapy appointment tomorrow because work has overtaken my entire life. I need to get out of Recruiting but without a degree, I'm not sure where to go without using the 10 years of recruiting in lieu of a degree. I've attempted to get into low-level HR roles but never seem to even receive feedback. 

Any ideas, thoughts, or anything really is appreciated. I can edit this if I left out any details that may help. I've always been a protector my entire life and grew up in a loving family that just happened to focus more on extracurriculars than school. So the fact that I feel I could lose this job at any time because I feel like I am underperforming (I love it when other people do not show up to work reflects my work ethic). I just want a position that does not require a degree and does not rely on other people to be successful. Any help would be most appreciated.

16gtff5,Stuck on whether or not I should accept a counteroffer,"I have to give my answer to my current boss' counteroffer today, so I am looking for some urgent advice. I am currently in marketing I graduated in 2021 and have worked for this very small agency since I was a senior in college. At first, it was an unpaid internship, which then turned to minimum wage, and now a little more than minimum wage. Although my title sounds impressive, I make a lot less than people expect, and I always assumed my boss could not afford to pay me more. I also work part-time. My boss always said that he ""planned"" on making me full-time, but never did. I started applying to jobs a few months after graduation, but with no luck so I decided to try grad school. Finally, I got a job offer after years of applying and getting interviews. I decided to share the news with my boss that I am quitting, emphasizing that I am grateful for the opportunities he has given me. However, he takes it pretty badly and tells me to at least consider his counteroffer. He offers me the same wage as my new job ($50,000), but with no health benefits, dental, vision... not a huge deal because I am young and healthy. He also said that I should've asked him for full-time and more money than just applying for other jobs and leaving. It's true that I didn't ask him, but he always talked about the agency's money problems and I just assumed he couldn't afford to keep me on a full-time salary. The only things that have me considering staying are:  
1. Promising to help me get a career before graduation, in 9 months, which makes more than the position I was just offered. He promised to help me get a job with one of our clients that I really like. I should mention that he said that he thinks I should be making more than 50,000 based on my skill set, but he's also not offering me more than that.   
2. I feel anxious about starting this new job and not being able to perform. I am ngl, taking literal years to find a new position has put a damper on my self-confidence, especially after multiple 3rd round interviews only to be rejected. I am scared I won't be able to do my new job and complete school at the same time. While I feel under-appreciated at my current job, I know I can do my job with confidence full-time.   
3. My co-worker just announced she is pregnant, right after my boss gave me his counter-offer. I feel bad about probably putting some of my work on her during this time (we are a team of 3).     

4. I did not ask him for full-time directly, be he mentioned it and promised it in the near future multiple times. He says I should not have just assumed he couldn't afford to, but what else was I supposed to think? Should I have asked, and is this a reason to accept the counteroffer?

16gsrgc,Guidance for recent graduate,"Hello, I am a recent graduate from college with a bachelor's degree (or as we call it in my country ""Diplôme Licence"") and strong academic background in industrial maintenance engineering.
I am searching for a job from 3 months ago, during my journey I couldn't find many open positions, I only found 6 jobs, 2 in Baker Hughes, 2 in TechnipFMC, and 2 in Schlumberger and I applied for all of them.

For Baker Hughes :

The first is control field specialist, they only asked for a bachelor's degree in engineering and said it is preferred to have work experience with rotating and turbo machines, which I do have. 

The second is lead application engineer, they asked for a bachelor's degree in engineering and 5 years of experience ( which I don't have it, I have only about 2 months ).

For TechnipFMC :

2 positions for a field technician, they demanded a high school diploma and said it's preferred to have 3 years of experience. 

For Schlumberger :

I applied at their recent graduates website for positions of field engineer and maintenance engineer, they demanded only bachelor's degree in engineering. 

However, one week has passed with no reply which made me think that the reason is my lack of work experience, I searched for internships but sadly I couldn't find any, the only 2 companies that offer internships in my country are sonatrach and Schlumberger, Sonatrach offers it only to university students ( you have to be studying in order to apply for one and you can't have more then 2 weeks ), I applied for internship in Schlumberger website because they only demanded finishing at least 2 years in college.

It's been 2 weeks since I applied for the Schlumberger internship but no reply either.

I'm waiting for a total of 3 weeks and I don't know what to do next, can you kindly give me some advices ? I would really appreciate that.",zak2017,1,1.0,0,1694528679,2023-09-12 14:24:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16gsrgc/guidance_for_recent_graduate/,9,2023

I'm currently in my last semester at community college located in Michigan and I've always been fascinated by the field of forensics. You know, the exciting stuff we see on TV shows. But I also understand that real-life forensic work might be a bit different.  
I have an INTP personality – introverted, analytical, and creative.  I'm very quiet, sort of shy, reserved I love problem-solving, being alone, and immersing myself in creative activities like writing, drawing, and reading.  
I've taken some science courses, including microbiology and introductory chemistry, though I faced some challenges there. But I've always been determined to learn and grow from my experiences.  
I'd love to hear from folks who are already in the field of forensics. 

1. Does this career align with my personality traits? 
2. What's the real deal when it comes to forensic jobs – especially in terms of social interaction, problem-solving
3. day-to-day tasks? 
4. what  is the start up pay  for someone who doesn't have any experience 
5. how can i get my foot in the door

16gj5s0,How to deal with a draining coworker?,"Chances are that I should have posted this to AITA but anyway. 


My team consists of myself and a relatively new hire who has no previous experience on the field. Our manager walked out after hiring her so there is no direct manager.


Due to these changes, my workload has essentially tripled and I’m an unofficial acting manager without the title or pay - I’m simply in charge of basically everything including training the newest member. Although I work in a global corporation, we have next to no documented work manuals or instructions of any kind. 


Since I’m not getting compensated for any extra work, I’m doing what I can during my regular hours. But the worst part isn’t the actual workload but my incredibly insecure and needy colleague. She’s lacking basic hard skills needed at work but she also requires a ton of encouragement, support and mentoring. I’ve reached out to upper management for these resources as well as I’ve tried to step up and do my best to help her, but I’m drained. 


I’m tired of trying to manage my daily workload and teach and train basic consents, principles and processes. What I find even more annoying is her general neediness that’s beyond a professional scope. She overshares, panics and if I don’t chat with her constantly due to meetings, she’ll assume that I’m angry at her. Worth mentioning that I’ve always kept my cool, I’m friendly and treat her with respect.   I’ve explained to her that I’m really busy and that I’ll try to train her to the best of my ability given limited time resources. I’m also annoyed when she tells me how stressed she is when she in fact has one job and task to do whilst all the decision making and responsibility falls on me. 

Any advice? Upper management “hears me” but that’s it.",Unusual_Jellyfish224,1,1.0,0,1694498121,2023-09-12 05:55:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16gj5s0/how_to_deal_with_a_draining_coworker/,9,2023
16gimda,my brother is 24 and still living under our parents roof,"(Apologies in advance if my essay is messy, I didn't do that good in my English classes.)

I have online friends around his age who still live with their family for their own personal financial reasons, and it can also be just a cultural thing that adults can live with their family until the age of 30 or so. But he is closing into half a decade in his 20s already, doesn't have many friends other than a few classmates from high school, but more like acquaintances, no one can he really depend on. Both of us share his worries, I am only a minor and still have a few years left for highschool. I have my own responsibilities and credentials to take care of and also my own part-time job, eventually I'll be going to university. But it doesn't make me feel any easy and I feel like I'm leaving him behind, after all we grew up in a household, again culturally pressured to thrive for quote ""more stable jobs"" anything that guarantees a high worth of salary and so forth, to return the favour to your family who raised you. For some readers, you can already start to imagine how that kind of system or childhood sets you up in the future, my parents rarely took accountability for his struggles (e.g mental health) and passions and were a lot harder than him compared to me, whereas he's the eldest brother. So yeah, main cause for his current situation is the lack of support from our parents, they don't treat me any different either, fortunately for me I am little luckier because I'm still with my friends and still sociable because of highschool.

Me and my brother don't verbally communicate on personal matters nor we show affection, usually because we have a huge age gap and he doesn't recognize me to take on adult responsibilities. I understand that though I am dying for answers on how to help him. He has been saving up his money to move out for a few years now (sometimes I'd offer my money but he'd rather handle himself), and while I do support him, he doesn't really have a solid career or passion as of yet. He currently has a job (I can't give that many personal details, I'm speaking on another person's behalf) and works a few times a week, on his free days he would take the opportunity to build up his freelancing as an artist. But despite doing that for years, it's been trial and error to gain the popularity online to have his works recognized, and it's okay maybe freelancing isn't his ideal career. He's still trying out other options, right now his priority is to find a fitting community and aspire to become a content creator. It seems like a pretty good plan, but if there's any other options I could help find to keep his options flexible, I don't want him to be limited to content creation in case it's not his thing in the future.

I might also have a small bias against content creation, (I don't want my brother to be desensitized to the algorithm and you know, don't want my brother to develop an unhealthy atrocious online personality and become mini Mr. Beasts), all I wish for is to find a way to support him especially in a way to not shut him forever indoors and make real friends (I think I might sound too insulting sorry if I'm being rude).",i_love_my_hairline,0,0.4300000071525574,0,1694496215,2023-09-12 05:23:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16gimda/my_brother_is_24_and_still_living_under_our/,9,2023

16giea6,Looking for advice about what path to pursue,"Background: 42 year old Italian guy living in America. Got an Italian Bachelor of Laws degree, and American master of laws degree, got a job 20 years ago right after my masters’ degree doing something completely unrelated to my field of study (linguistic parsing using a now-extinct application, and with the extinction of this app, my entire job field went extinct too).

I used to make great money, and now I found myself in dire need of a new job. No biggie, right? I may not be able to become a practicing attorney here in the states (inb4 go back to Italy - this is the country I call home now, and I have spent 20 of my 42 years here, it’s not gonna happen) but people always say “you can do anything with a law degree”, right? Well say ain’t so.

I became a paralegal and I was pretty excited about it, only to find out that what I saw as a respected support for a lawyer, someone who writes pleadings, motions, forms, etc is actually seen in the same league as well, someone working at McDonald’s or packing bags at WalMart, both in terms of respect and pay. I may not care about the respect (plus I respect anyone who works an honest job, including fast food workers and baggers), but I do need to earn enough to pay my rent and maybe, just maybe eat something that won’t poison me slowly from time to time… is it too much to ask?

Now for my question: I see two paths here for me:

1) keep doing the paralegal stuff, be poor, and hope that with years of experience I can earn a bit more.

2) Teach myself web development (CSS, HTML, JavaScript, some frameworks too maybe) and/or get into a boot camp, and try to get a web dev job. 

what option is more realistic? Is there such a thing as a non-poor paralegal? Do people actually get webdev jobs nowadays without a CS/STEM degree?

 Bonus option: keep doing the paralegal stuff and eventually sit for the bar exam (I can actually sit for the CA exam, though I don’t live in CA) and do lawyer stuff working on federal law matters where it doesn’t matter what bar license state you have as long as you have a bar license.

16ggp80,"CRNA vs Lawyer? Looking for advice, please","I am currently an RN, as is my wife. I got into the field completely blind, I had no idea what I was getting into. I was motivated by a sick family member and seeing the difference the nurse made during their stay, and idk, it just tugged on my heart strings. Fast forward, I initially was doing EMS on an ambulance while I pursued my nursing degree, obtained it, and started working in the hospital.  
Honestly, I enjoy it in terms of: ""there are definitely worse jobs out there and this one can pay well."" I'm a travel RN, so my yearly gross can be anywhere from $100k to $250k, but usually on the lower end. I truly don't like the job, primarily because I would rather be the thinker/decision maker, not the ass wiper that carries out the tasks. I also just....don't like it, it just seems like a bunch of mindless busywork. Why not medical school? I'm not saying that I'm going to walk in and ace an MCAT, but what I am saying is, at 32 years old, married with 3 kids, I just don't think (if I got accepted) I am willing or interested in 8-10 years minimum before becoming an attending.  
My option one is, CRNA. It would require a minimum of 1 year in the ICU (more likely to be 2-3 years though, YMMV) and then 4 years in school for the doctorate degree. Pay is good, $200k+ and from my understanding hours are around 40-60/week, on-call, overnights in the hospital, etc. I think I would like it, but I'm not sure. A family member of mine is a CRNA, so I will be shadowing him soon to really get a feel.  
Option number two, I have been looking into becoming an attorney. Which, I know almost nothing about other than the basic job description: represent party A against party B. I understand that it is a 4 year program that requires the LSAT. However, what I am curious about is peoples thoughts/opinions/facts that do work in the field. How is the pay?

16gg61a,Mastering CRM Analytics: Building Effective Lenses for Deeper Customer Insights,"Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems provide a treasure trove of data, but to extract meaningful insights, you need the right lens. Imagine a camera without a lens – it captures light, but the image remains blurred and unfocused. Similarly, in CRM analytics, a well-defined lens helps focus your attention on specific aspects of customer data, allowing you to glean valuable insights.

Define Your Analytical Focus  
  
The first step in building an effective lens is to clearly define your analytical focus. Are you interested in customer demographics, purchasing behavior, or engagement patterns? Knowing what you're looking for will guide the construction of your lens. For instance, if you're a subscription-based service, your lens might be focused on churn prediction, allowing you to proactively address customer retention.  
  
Choose the Right Data Points  
  
Selecting the right data points is crucial. In CRM analytics, this means identifying and collecting relevant information about your customers. This could include contact details, transaction history, customer service interactions, and more. Remember, the goal is to gather data that aligns with your analytical focus. Too much irrelevant information can lead to analysis paralysis.

16gg4sq,Education history on resume. Help!,"Hello all, 24m seeking advice on the education history I should list on my job resume. 

So, I graduated from a charter high school in 2017 that was ultimately shut down a few years after I graduated due to failing grad rates, falling enrollment, and lack of proper staffing. Due to this, for the past several years i’ve listed the high school I attended prior to the charter school which is apart of my county school district as it, to me at least, looks like a more reputable school to show on my resume. My concern is that having a charter high school on my resume, i’ll be viewed as less than somebody who doesn’t have this by potential employers. 

I was also formerly enrolled in college as an enviro science associates but dropped in 2018. As of a month ago, i’m now enrolled in courses to get my BA in physics so it’s not like i’m slow or anything like that. My main goal is to just make a good enough impression to land an interview as I know i’ll be (likely) golden from that point forward.

16gfb4q,"New college graduate in healthcare, interested in tech","Not sure if this will reach the right audience, but to give a little background, I just graduated from university with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Public Health (my school does not offer a BS route for those wondering).  
  
During my 4 years of college, I went with the flow and I did not get great advice/ assistance in choosing a career path. All I knew and was familiar with at the time is healthcare. During college, I volunteered at a hospital where I was able to see nurses perform direct patient care, and I got to practice some of those skills on my own as well. I quickly realized that I did not like working in direct patient care and I did not like the hospital setting. Because of this realization, I thought that maybe I could get into the business side of healthcare by studying healthcare administration. My plan was to obtain a Master degree in Health Administration, but I feel like advancing my studies with little experience will be meaningless and a waste of money.  
  
Thinking back at my time in college now, I really wish that I studied something in the tech field/anything related to tech (such as engineering or informatics). I realized that I don't really like working with patients or in healthcare. I've spoken to many people who studied engineering and even if they don't love their job, I see the great benefits that come with it and ultimately, it always pays well even with a Bachelor's degree. All of my friends in engineering are able to quickly find a job after college and even my dad, who is an engineer himself, has great work-life balance and it is generally not stressful.  
  
All of this to say, I am kindly asking for any sort of advice/tips/thoughts/anything necessary for me to know if I want to use the experience that I have in health care to transition into tech.

16geza1,Have to jump ship 4 months in .. what do I say?,"Hi everyone.

I'm pretty sad to be writing this post. Basically, I landed what I thought would be my dream job. But since I started, 3 people above me on my team have been fired, there is chaos all around, and it seems that everyone is concerned about their job security. I don't feel protected at all, and the company is incredibly unstable with the way it handles its employees (my boss' boss got fired for kindly disagreeing with the CEO on a strategy). In addition, there seems to be some shady upper level practices going on. Because of this, my entire team is jumping ship. Pretty uneasy first few months. 

Anyway, my concern now is that I have to start applying, and I'm not sure how I will explain departing a company after 4 months. I really want to include it because I already have done manager level work, led several high stakes and big name events, and done some incredible things here, but I don't know how to explain why I'm leaving so soon since you're not supposed to really talk negatively about where you're coming from.

16gdrh1,SW Engineer Contractor for Amazon through Actalent,"Hey guys, I'm a software developer with 3+ YOE on the east coast, USA. I currently work in the defense industry and have been looking to move to the west coast in California. I've been interviewing for jobs the past few months, but recently was contacted by Actalent for SW position with Amazon project Kuiper (LA, California).  
  
I had a brief call with the Actalent recruiter, followed by a teams call with an Amazon Software Engineer (45 min). It was a great discussion, the work sounded awesome, and we finished with a basic live programming question. I didn't do great, but felt I did good enough. Later that afternoon, I get a call from the recruiter saying they want to make an offer. I'm a bit confused and honestly sketched out that they want to make an offer after only one short video call. I just assumed multiple rounds (at least 2 with Amazon).  
  
The contract is 3 years with an offer of 70 per hour (145k), which is a really good amount for me, but I can't help but feel concerned that there's some kind of catch (bad work environment, turnover, etc.). Currently, I'm trying to get my Actalent recruiter to set up another call with an Amazon team member to get more info, but it's been difficult. Luckily, I'll be chatting with a different Amazon engineer tomorrow.  
  
I wanted to get some suggestions from you guys. I don't know much about contracting, so have been researching a lot the past few days. Anybody have experience with Actalent? What about working as a Contractor for FAANG? It could be a great opportunity, but I can also wait and continue looking for a Full Time position since my current job is excellent right now (decent pay and great career growth.

I know I am not bad at this job but I'm not as good as I should be either. I know I can do a lot better as a creative but I'm struggling to figure which direction to go in. 
Also, I want to generate more sources of revenue for myself while exploring more career options on the side. Recently (been a year), I'd been getting coached in lifting and I received nutritional advice. I spend a LOT of time consuming all kinds of food content and there's been a huge difference in my lifestyle which people have noticed. They've been asking me for nutritional advice and I would rather not give it without scientific backing and knowledge. I was quite keen on getting the Precision Nutrition Level 1 certification. I know things won't be as rosy and I won't get steady clients right away. I don't even know how I'd find my way in the whole industry. However, I do know that this industry is quite lucrative and in my country, people REALLY do need help with this. I've been speaking to my family about pursuing this and they asked me why am I doing it. I didn't have a strong enough reason. They said that I should focus on improving my performance in the role I'm currently holding because I'll never get the kind of platform I have (great bosses, senior management visibility, encouraging team, opportunities) anywhere else to grow. They said I'll be into too many different things and will end up achieving nothing (I also pursued a course in Japanese, cleared N5 but couldn't study for N4 because of work load so they think the same will happen here).

16gbwsf,Advice for a Recent College Grad,"I (mid 20s) graduated from college in Dec '21 and am about to be involuntarily terminated from my first FT that I've had since Jan '22. I've been told by my manager that I had done nothing wrong, and that my employee profile would note that I was 'involuntarily terminated'. My manager is a great person and was honest about all of this. They've even offered to write a reference letter later when/if I'd need it. So as a result, I'm moving back home with my parents so I can restart and figure out a new plan of action while I file for unemployment.

I don't have much of anything to show for my time at this job in terms of transferable skills I can take to my next job, given how niche i was as a consultant deploying HR software. My parents are telling me that they'd pay for college again if I thought I'd need it to get more skills, but I don't have any interests right now on doing that. I do however have access to a Data Analyst certification website that offers trainings and Data Analyst certifications, so I'm planning on starting that up again when I have more free time. My fear though is that I won't be able to get a job in the next 6 months to a year (at least) given how crazy the job market is right now and what I feel like is a looming recession.

16gb14v,3 Months into new job and I hate it. Do I say I'm unemployed or tell the truth in interviews?,"Back in April I was let go from my job after making a harassment complaint about our sales manager. That's a looong story (and yes I did look into legal measures but there was nothing I could do).

It took me a month to find a new job in my field, but I think I jumped the gun and ignored red flags...the place I'm at is a nightmare. It's a much larger company than my previous job and organizationally they're a mess. Everyone is remote which is nice, but no one onboarded me in the slightest, it took them two months to get me a computer, HR is the CEO's wife, the head of operations insists I do my job the way she wants it done which means everything I do has to go through her. She is also outwardly hostile to me in meetings and my boss (the CEO's brother) has told me ""she's a bully, that's always been a problem"" and there is no plan in sight for rectifying that. He keeps telling me to ""bully her back"" and is disappointed when I tell him I'm not going to do that.

Anyway, I'm interviewing to get the hell out but vacillating between pretending I'm still at my previous job from April, or being honest and saying I don't like the new job I'm at. I don't like either option.

Should I just say I've been laid off from the April job? 

I really wish I could quit as this job has honestly caused me very serious mental health problems, but I have a house to pay the mortgage on.

16gapgu,Routinely unemployed looking at moving away from corp job...,"Appreciate any insight anyone may have.

I'm 33,M, college graduate with a degree in marketing. This July, I was laid off for the third time in three years. First was in March of 2021 from a place I had been a contractor for over 3 years. They did a team restructure and laid off maybe 10 or so people. Took me 7 months to find a job. Worked at job #2 (small insurtech startup) for 6 months before they decided to change directions as a company and didn't need my role anymore. Took me 8 months to find a job (cycling industry company) and worked there for 7 months before they went through a round of layoffs (half the marketing team laid off, 20% of the company overall). Been unemployed for about 2 months now.

At each of the last two places, I had been hoping to find a long-term home, somewhere I could grow my skillset, feel comfortable and secure, hopefully find a mentor, and honestly just do my job. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have some PTSD at job #3 because of how the last two ended (quite abruptly and without warning) and then it happened again. 

One other note of background, I've been a volunteer ski patroller for 4 years and quite enjoy it. In my current stretch of unemployment, I've also picked up climbing instructor shifts (had been doing this very part-time because I enjoy teaching climbing). A local hill is still hiring paid ski patrollers for this season and I'm thinking about applying. I had reached out to the hill prior to last season when I had been job hunting for months with no luck, but they had already been full. Come next spring, I can do climbing instruction more often and start to get into the mountain guide lifestyle. Ski patrol in the winter, climbing guide in the summer.

My question basically boils down to am I closing the door to corporate jobs by walking away now? I just feel as though 10 years into my career, I should be getting into the heart of my career, taking on more responsibility, growing in a company, or making moves to climb the ladder, but I'm not. I take a season to work outside of the office, I don't see how that can possibly make finding a job down the line easier. 

Subtext on this would be the guide lifestyle is hard. Hard on the body, hard on the family. My wife and I don't have kids, but enjoy traveling, enjoy our house in a high COL area, enjoy the lifestyle we have as two white-collar DINKs. There's no 401k's in the ski patrol or guiding world, and if you get hurt, you may not come back. It worries me. As boring as the desk jockey life is, there's at least some stability. 

Thanks for any recommendations or advice. ",cjohns716,0,0.5,3,1694473915,2023-09-11 23:11:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16gapgu/routinely_unemployed_looking_at_moving_away_from/,9,2023

16g4hai,Feeling unanchored in life - how to choose & follow a path from here?,"Hello reddit,

  
Figured I'd ask some strangers online for advice since I keep going in circles on figuring out a career direction. In advance, I'm sorry if this is all over the place... Please be kind. I know I'm lost. :) I hope including my story will help y'all understand where I'm at.

  
Backstory:

  
I (27F) graduated about 4.5 years ago from a really good university with a BA in Geography. Unfortunately, during my undergraduate degree I had a pretty serious mental health issue come up (Bipolar II, if that's relevant).. I withdrew 3 times, got medicated, mostly stabilized, & then finally graduated. Because of that mental health issue & an abusive relationship, & not totally addressing my other issues (ADHD & GAD - finally addressing it now!), I wasn't able to be totally ""present"" with my education.. I felt a lot of pressure from my family to just get it done ASAP, & while I don't regret it, I feel sad because I just wasn't ""with it"" & grounded enough to know why I was there, get guidance from my profs, & consciously use that education to find a suitable job that reflects my degree. To be fair, I did do some things - I completed a fully funded undergrad thesis on spider monkey conservation in Ecuador. But even with that experience, I wasn't REALLY ""with it"" enough apply myself & make it as good as possible/get as much mentorship out of it, etc. I've had a lot of shame for everything I DIDN'T do during my education, & for what I haven't done since. I recognize that I've been in my own way, & I'm trying really hard to move forward & figure out the best course from here.

  
Since graduation, I moved to Canada (from the USA) & did various odd jobs - was a canvasser for an environmental org & assisted with donations management, worked for elections Canada, & for an art store. After 3 years, I moved back to the states & have done various science illustrations for a museum & art commissions. However, I have yet to hold a full-time job & be 100% financially independent, & I owe a lot of that to unaddressed mental illness & coming from an upper-middle class background.

  
So here I am \_ over 4 years later, back home & living with my sister because I didn't make options for myself. I've been applying for jobs that look appropriate for my education level in the city I'm in, which is pretty small so I'm sure I need to expand my search. I even got offered a Spanish teaching job at a middle school, because I was considering that as a career but ultimately decided against it because I'm not certified/have absolutely no experience, & would've had to teach 3 classes. I also would've had to complete a masters at the same time, since this state requires you to have a teaching license.. It just would've taken absolutely everything out of me & it's not what I REALLY want. Honestly, my sister talked me out of it, & I think my family has talked me out of a lot of things over the years. I think I've allowed their opinions to influence me too much, & I think in some ways they enable my dysfunction. I think they instilled a belief that I was incompetent as a child (when really I just had adhd & an anxiety disorder that weren't diagnosed), & there's a lot of trauma surrounding my toxic upbringing.

  
I recognize that I come from privilege & that my circumstances have helped me so much, but they've also kept me stuck in many ways. I'm so fed up with feeling stuck, so I've been trying really hard to figure this out. But I feel like I don't have any ""hard"" skills. I DO have VERY strong interests - mainly in ecology/environmental conservation & art. My gift is definitely art, & I often wish that skill was more rewarded by today's society like programming or engineering, but that's not the world we live in so I'm trying to do something more practical & pleasant enough. I'm also pretty good with people, but I don't think I have the stamina to be a K-12 teacher.

  
Since getting treated for ADHD the last few months, I've started explore skills I can develop while looking & am also looking at potential grad programs, since I do miss university. I've familiarized myself with Photoshop & Illustrator, & want to become more proficient in Adobe creative suite. I've also started teaching myself QGIS & am wondering if it'd be useful to learn R for data visualization. I know very well that this is all over the place, but I do hope there's people here that can relate to my experience & perhaps offer some guidance!

  
I often feel very ashamed for not having figured this basic shit out by now, but I do believe the mental health stuff has affected me more than I realize. So while I've looked very fine this whole time since the bipolar stuff was stabilized, I've had a really hard time focusing on one thing for more than like a week at a time, & also balancing multiple priorities. I feel very dysfunctional & often wake up with a complete identity crisis, like there's no sense continuity/congruence in my life. I'm addressing these things more diligently while also figuring out this career stuff & getting financially independent (about damn time!).

  
I think the overarching theme that connects my interests is visual science communication. I've talked to full-time science illustrators & gotten the sense that most got degrees in medical illustration, which I think would be difficult for me as I'm VERY squeamish. Other successful, full-time editorial illustrators that I've connected with got BFAs, & I think their education really helped them with the fundamentals & getting their foot in the door. At 18, coming from a family of scientists/not artists, I didn't even CONSIDER getting a BFA. So it seems like I'd have to teach myself everything on my own & keep networking with the right people to land a job in that field. I do like self-teaching, my biggest obstacle is just identifying the most important skills/subjects & sticking to them with diligence & faith that it's relevant.

  
I've looked at getting an MFA, a degree in animation or graphic design, an MS in Geography/Ecology, EVERYTHING, hoping to go back to school, specialize in something, & gain some clarity. If I could imagine my dream job, it'd be a graphic designer/illustrator for a museum or journal like Nature or NatGeo, working to convey environmental topics to the public. It seems like those jobs are becoming more contract/freelance, & perhaps threatened by AI, so it's scary to just go for it & trust that it'll all work out. From talking to professional illustrators, I get the sense that the fear around AI is overblown, especially for the science-illustration crowd, but still. It's SCARY. & perhaps I'm just afraid of accepting that this is indeed the correct path for me & not looking back. Or perhaps truly DECIDING is the scariest thing, as if I've just gotten so comfortable in this miserable limbo that it's hard to imagine myself on the other side.

  
What do y'all think? Anyone here a graphic designer, illustrator, GIS professional? Or even a life coach??? :'D

  
TLDR;

  
Lost. Tough life stuff has led me to a place of confusion & indecision, & I'm trying to see through my mental fog, choose the best course, & focus on the skills I need to get there/find appropriate jobs in the meantime.

16g4dh3,"Started a new job 3 weeks ago, now I have an offer for a job I’d rather have.","I know there are a lot of these types of posts, but mine has a twist that I really need help weighing for this decision.

I interviewed for a job I was moderately excited about (Job 1) and just before I was going to interview for the job I was more excited (Job 2) about, Job 1 gave me an offer. I asked them for time to make a decision and then interviewed for Job 2. During this interview, I felt I barely met the qualifications and figured they would not offer me the job as someone else could be more qualified, so I accepted Job 1. Three weeks later, Job 2 calls me back with the offer.

Here is my dilemma: Job 1 is a contractor for Job 2, meaning my roles at either employer directly interact with each other daily. How does this play into possibly quitting Job 1? To what degree would I be burning the bridge and making it awkward to interact. 

Additional info:
The pay isn’t that different between jobs
Both are relatively small departments
I have not interacted with Job 2 in my new role yet

16g3n7e,"Low offer at a place I really fit, what to do?","I'm a motion designer and recent graphic design school grad with 3 internships under my belt. I've been in touch with a small agency (\~10 employees) since March on and off, and when they announced they were hiring in August, they reached out directly to me. Today, I had an in-person final interview, and after, the owner of the company gave me a clear verbal offer of a 50k yearly salary.  
I thanked him, requested some time to think it over, and asked to be sent a formal offer in writing. In this state, the average salary of this role is closer to 60k starting. I love this firm's work, and feel like it would be a great kickstart to my career, however with the cost of living in this area (I'm relocating for this role), I'm not sure what to do.  
Do I counter offer, mentioning the cost of living and the skills I'm bringing? (they have no one in office who does motion design, I would lead any motion projects going forward) I feel like even 52k yearly would make living easier in the city.  
Or do I find a place further away from the office and take the train in? (I cannot drive due to disability, but can use public transit)

16g3f6w,"23F stuck with shitty company, quit job and move in w/ parents or stick it out?","I (23f) am just about at my wits end with my current company, being overworked to the bone. Not in a literal sense, as I work in a corporate setting at a desk job doing a combination of business and people operations. But definitely in a mental and emotional sense. 

Some context: I'm a young professional that's been with the same Midwestern-based company my entire ""career."" I started as a management trainee with this company and they kind of took the flexibility of that and ran, meaning I'm doing anything and everything form HR (payroll, accounts payable and receivable, hiring & onboarding) to industry compliance, management (2-3 direct reports), sales, and beyond. I don't think I'm compensated well enough but my salary has increased $10k+ in the span of a little over a year, which is a decent amount of increase and not something necessarily achieved easily at many other companies. I'm not sure I could sustain this rate of increase, however. I've tried broaching the subject of being compensated for some of the additional responsibilities I have but to no avail. Benefits include decent PTO (10 - 20 days) and 401k with 4% match immediately vested.

I want to leave so badly. The work isn't rewarding and it drains me to the core. It's not the industry, but the company I'm with. I get home from work and have no motivation or energy to enjoy hobbies or the outdoors. I grew up on the east coast and I'm blessed to have my parents still living there and willing to welcome me back into their home. I've expressed my frustrations to them and they've told me they'd love to have me find a job closer to home and live with them.

Financially, I'm very okay. I have a $10k+ emergency fund. My current lease is month-to-month, so I can terminate just about whenever. If I do end up quitting with nothing lined up, I'd love to take advantage of the intermediary time with no obligations and travel a bit, probably roadtripping and hiking in the U.S. for a month or two. This is the perfect time for a roadtrip, too, as the weather in the U.S. isn't too hot nor too cold yet. While I'd feel stressed quitting without anything lined up because of the uncertainties of the job market as well as my own personal long-term financial goals (having a net negative month is not my style at all) but it'd simultaneously be very liberating and do wonders for my state of mind and body.

However, I also worry what kind of impressions it'd give to future employers that I have a track record of quitting after a little over a year with my first and only ""career"" job and then also taking a month or two off. Will I have a hard time finding a new job after having taken this trip and moved back in with my parents? My parents do live in an area with a decent job market, but the job market in general is hyper-competitive these days and I worry about my credibility as an applicant.

I could instead quit my current job and immediately jump into job applications with the hopes of securing a new position within a month or so. Yet I hear horror stories of people going months and months applying to hundreds and hundreds of jobs without success. I don't want this to be me. And thus that brings me to the third option, to just put my nose to the grindstone and spend my early mornings and evenings applying to jobs while staying on with my current company until I find something new.

Reddit, what do you recommend?

TLDR; should OP (23f) quit job with a midwestern company that overworks like crazy to travel for a month or two and then move back in with parents in east coast USA HCOL area to resume the job search, should OP quit job and move back in with parents immediately without traveling, or should OP stick it out at current company until she finds a new job",dldmsdud,1,0.6700000166893005,13,1694457767,2023-09-11 18:42:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16g3f6w/23f_stuck_with_shitty_company_quit_job_and_move/,9,2023
16g3b7q,How to handle possible charges on background checks,"I got an interview for basically the exact kind of job I went to graduate school for.

I'm pretty confident in my ability to get this job but since it's for my state government, I'll have to pass a background check if I'm hired.

16g2qdd,Is Industry or Academia better for me?,"Just a brief background of myself first:
I recently finished my Bachelor's degree in engineering. I really enjoyed it and I plan on doing my master's in the near future. Academics have always been my strong point and I really excel in it. Summa Cum Laude, top of my class, valedictorian and many awards in engineering.

I like the ""school-life"". I worked in the industry for about a year as a technician and I don't really like the culture (maybe it was just the company I worked for). But I know there's a lot of potential in the industry. More rewarding work, higher compensations, a sense of fulfilment and working with diverse cultures.

I'm 23 years old. I know that's young but I maybe have an opportunity to become a lecturer at the university (starting off at cert courses and diploma) given my academic background. But I've heard that the life of an academic isn't very rewarding or fulfilling. However, there is a lot of freedom. Lenient hours, flexible schedules and a sense of being respected.

This is why I'm torn between deciding what I should go for - industry or academia. The clear benefit of industry is the higher salary. The clear benefit of academia is the better work-life balance. Both of these things are very important to me.

16fyxnf,What would you guys recommend for a career path/progression for maximum pay potential for an Automotive Project Engineer?,"
Im 24 years old with a BEng in Mechanical Engineering and I recently passed the 6 Month mark (probation time) at my current job as a junior project engineer for a major automotive company in Germany. Plan is to move to the US (SF Bay Area) sometime in the next two years with my girlfriend (US citizen).

I really love what I am currently doing and I have a lot of responsibilities as well as a lot of leadership tasks which positions me well for a management position later on (which is what I would prefer). However I am kind of unfamiliar with the timeline I should expect and the roles I can apply to. Moreover, I work mainly in battery systems testing; does that mean all my future roles will have to do with that? How much can I pivot or be flexible when applying to different jobs? Like there are positions where I would fulfil most of the requirements (running large scale projects basically) except the technical knowledge part (like 3 years experience needed in aerospace industry/aerodynamics/ADAS etc.). Am I basically pigeonholed in the Automotive industry now and specifically in Battery System Testing and Validation?

I also eventually want to move into consulting but I dont know when I would be able to do that or how. Eventually i will also be pursuing an MBA but I dont know exactly when. 

Its very annoying because I had always thought finding the first job is the hardest part and then you can just move up the ranks but that doesnt reflect well on your salary since its much better to change jobs if money is important to you and tbh it is important to me.

Any thoughts here from you guys?

I switched into a biochemistry major last year after I took a chemistry class and loved it, and I recently tried switching into chemical engineering but I was denied because I needed a B in Calc 2 to switch into the major and I got a B-.

I've become more reflective on how I've grown my career too. My conclusion though is that I've put very little effort into personal career growth and even thinking much about it. I've been pretty lucky in getting to where I am tho.

For me, I do my salaried job. I give work 7-9 hours a day, whatever it takes (I do work hard). But the more I think about it, you need to dedicate more time to push your career along these days. Whether it's taking more education, doing pro bono/open source work, networking with others, maintaining a mildly active social media presence, or just taking focused time to strategize. It adds up.

Here's the thing I'm stuck on. I'm just wondering about the effort that people expend to move their careers along. So if you've done a good job of growing your career, how much extra work/time commitment did it take? Is it a few hours a month or a year?

I'm at a crossroads in my life, and I could really use some advice and insights from all of you. Currently, I have a job that pays me around 95k a year, which sounds great on paper, but I'm extremely unhappy with my life as it is.

Here's the situation: I've been offered another job opportunity that pays significantly less, maybe around 55k a year if I'm lucky (probably closer to 40k as it’s part time) However, it comes with some perks that make it very tempting. It would allow me to move closer to my friends, and it feels like a chance to hit the reset button on my personal life.

Here's the kicker: I have a substantial debt on a credit line totaling 30k, which is weighing heavily on my mind. I'm worried about making a mistake by taking the lower-paying job, given my financial obligations.

I'd love to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation or has some advice to offer. Should I prioritize my happiness and personal life over the higher salary? How can I manage my debt effectively in this transition? Any thoughts and experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated.

16fwdir,Seeking Career advise in Finance,"Hello everyone, I recently turned 23 and I'm seeking guidance on how to navigate my career path within my current company. To give you some context about my journey so far, I initially started my career at a small accounting firm at the end of 2021 where I gained valuable experience in auditing and accounting. However, after a year, I realized that accounting wasn't my true passion. This realization prompted me to explore new job opportunities, and my main interests were in investment and equities as I love looking at markets and I love the idea of working with clients. So this eventually led me to my current role working as an accounts assistant at an investment bank in central London. It is a huge Canadian Bank and while this position still involves accounting, I accepted it with the intention of exploring different careers once I had settled in the role.  
In my current role, I am on the back-end of the business where I handle a combination of accounting and analytical tasks, including managing bank expenses, analyzing data to identify cost-saving opportunities, and utilizing technology and coding for automating processes. I regularly meet with the CFO to discuss ideas and show statistics, however the role overall is not very challenging and does not have the best progression, and to re-iterate, I want to stay away from accounting and move more towards other areas of finance. Having now spent 8 months in this position, I've become aware of numerous roles within the finance field and various departments within my bank. My primary goal is to transition into a front-office role that involves revenue generation or is something to do with investment where I can pursue the CFA qualification.  
I'm considering several front-office options, such as the trading floor, debt capital markets, equity finance, and corporate banking. Additionally, there are numerous other opportunities within capital markets and global markets. So can anyone provide any advice or tips for what’s the best area t move towards?

4. UX Writing: I'm wondering if I could transfer my Hospitality skills and focus on content for training service industry staff or related roles.  
Which of these paths might be the best in terms of market saturation, the fastest way to achieve a better salary, and long-term career prospects. Maybe should I try studying multiple paths and merging skills?

16ftjs5,Any advice for leaving the only company I’ve really worked for after a decade?,"
Hey Reddit community,

I'm (early 30sM) at a turning point in my career and could use some guidance. I've been with a large FMCG for nearly a decade, and being someone who has always been labelled as high-potential has meant I’ve had the opportunities to  work across three continents. Currently, I'm based in New South Wales, Australia, and have been here for the last three years. However, I'm about to make a big move to Chicago (not work related). 

Lately, I've been contemplating making a change. I want to work somewhere new, where I don't have a reputation to uphold, so I can leave work at work and have a better work-life balance. This change is essential for me because, in my latest role (which is the highest level I've reached so far), I didn't feel set up for success at all. I struggled with imposter syndrome for a while, and it took a toll on my health due to the immense pressure. Sort of feel like this isn’t the company I joined anymore, and it’s not “fun” for me. Lots of the things that used to set it apart are now no longer differentiating factors at all. Thinking it’s time to flee the nest. 

It's not just about the money, but I do also feel like I’m currently (and was previously) underpaid. I’m making around 180,000 AUD with a 20% bonus, despite being in high-pressure roles for almost a decade. I want to explore other opportunities where I can work on my terms and feel valued for my contributions.

I'm nervous about this step because I've been told repeatedly by others at my company, usually those more senior, that my current place is one of the best places to work. It's a big leap of faith, and I'm wondering if anyone here has any advice or has been through a similar situation. How did you make the transition? What were your experiences?

I appreciate any insights or advice you can provide. Thanks in advance!",Aggravating_Fee1634,6,1.0,1,1694433917,2023-09-11 12:05:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16ftjs5/any_advice_for_leaving_the_only_company_ive/,9,2023
16ftfcu,Please help me figure this out...,"I've been feeling uneasy in my work environment for a while now. I trained for 4 years to get into a software developer role from a lead analyst position, and I eventually succeeded 4.5 months ago.
My manager appointed me on a salary significantly more than I expected and said I'd be undertaking management duties because that's where I have experience, and I guess because my interview personality impressed him. Mind you there was no mention of this in the role advertisement and I specifically moved into this field to get more into the technical side of things and run away from the managerial side, which I felt was not my strong suit. I have the same role title as a buch of colleagues who just perform technical tasks.

Ever since my appointment he's been treating me with a mixture of condescension but setting me up to fail at the same time. E.g. I get assigned the most high level, poorly defined tasks that require a lot of exploration and experimentation yet any questions I have go unanswered or the answers provided shed no light on the matter / are underinformed or offer unrealistic solutions. My colleagues on the other hand get very clear work items to deliver, e.g. ""automate running of such and such script"" or ""generate model outputs.""

A few times where I informed him of something he would not take it at face value and asked me to show him the code and explain, as if he couldn't believe I could possibly be right. At the same time my colleagues can just give a high level verbal update and he's okay with that. One of them speaks way too fast and has a heavy accent making it difficult to understand, but again, is never asked to repeat or questioned.

However what seems the worst to me is that he has our director's ear and I'm pretty sure he's been passing on some shit about me. When I attended a meeting with the director in person, he was really impressed with me. I was in the org only 2 months or so at the time and he wanted me to already deliver a presentation to the entire department to show them my problem solving approach. I prepared a presentation and everything, but two weeks later the presentation was cancelled never to be rescheduled again and I hardly get any more face time with the director. My manager is adamant that no one should go over his head and speak to the director as he is the gatekeeper, so they have meetings every week, sometimes multiple times per week while the rest of us can only speak to the director when the boss chooses. I find it telling that my director went from having lots of respect for me to treating me like any other employee despite my having no contact with them over a period of time, yet him talking to my boss every day.

I mean, I could go on ad infinitum in terms of examples. Recently during a workshop I was the first person to complete a task and got the best score. My manager just walked passed and said : ""ah yeah you've probably just copy-pased some code from xyz."" The fuck?

On top of that the place I work at is giving me weird vibes. Everyone talks about the work life balance and what an amazing organisation this is, but I constantly get emails from people over the weekends and see people showing green on teams late into the night every work day. I had one of my colleagues become a teams ""status police"" on me and interrogating me why I was appearing as green at such and such time but when he messaged me I didn't respond. 

I said I wasn't on teams and not sure why my status was green, thought that would settle this but no, a few weeks later he'd take on the subject again, insinuating that I'm up to something fishy.

I guess what I'm looking for is a third person's perspective on the matter. Is this normal and I'm looking too much into things and should just let go? Would you say that workplace dynamic is common? I'm getting really fed up and would have been looking elsewhere but can't at the moment for personal reasons.",ZookeepergameNext967,0,0.5,1,1694433569,2023-09-11 11:59:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16ftfcu/please_help_me_figure_this_out/,9,2023

16fmpum,Graduating from Computer Science in January - Little Passion for Software Development,"Hi all,

I'm 23M and I'm in my final semester of Computer Science at a Canadian university. I'm set to graduate in January with a relatively high GPA and 16 month internship experience as a frontend software developer currently working part time as I was offered an extension for this same internship.

I believe I stopped learning or advancing my knowledge as a developer at this internship around the 6 to 8 month mark but continued and have accepted the extension for the sake of having an income and the potential for a full time offer in this rough job market.

Since my 2nd year of this degree, I have put in effort to learn web development alongside the regular curriculum by learning Javascript, HTML, CSS, SASS, Git, and have some experience with OOP in Java from University classes I have taken. However, I just can't see myself continuing to learn the endless plethora of technologies that I still haven't learned or used and then grinding leetcode questions just to even have a shot at an entry level job in this market, only to be outcompeted by dozens of other candidates who religiously worship programming and do not feel the anxiety and depression I feel from being stuck to the computer and a desk for every breathing moment.

Simply put, I don't have the drive to navigate this insanely competitive job market and stand out by dedicating hours and hours to further learning to even have a shot at landing a basic job, even after completing a whole degree and internship.

I applied to this major in high school since I did not know what other degree would get me a job - business was too vague, health sciences or biology related degrees would require further education beyond undergrad, nursing involved working with bodily fluids, illness, and disease which I was not comfortable with - so it was either accounting or computer science for me, and I chose the latter since programming did seem interesting as well. Little did I know back in 2018 what monstrosity the 2023 job market would be.

With a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, some internship experience as a frontend developer with the potential for a return offer, and no drive to subject myself to hours of additional screen and desk time to have a shot at an entry level job as a software developer, where can I go from here?

I'm not sure *what* my passion is, but being outdoors and doing something physical definitely boosts my mood and makes me happy. Is there a job that will get me outside, not be back-breaking work, and is in high demand? Something I could potentially use my CS degree as a stepping stone for, or even head back to school for for at most 2 years?

Is a complete career switch even before beginning my career unwise?",RegularStudent17,1,1.0,0,1694409341,2023-09-11 05:15:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16fmpum/graduating_from_computer_science_in_january/,9,2023
16fmahu,Annoyed at manager who ask too many questions/commits to things without thinking,"I’ve been in this company for 2 years, my manager has been here for 7 years but has only been transferred to my team this year so he is 8-9 months in. I work in marketing/CRM for 2 markets in the FMCG space, which has slightly different ways of working but generally everything between regional/country teams are the same. From our countries side, things are more complicated which leads to longer timelines, I generally don’t say ‘YES’ to things immediately and prefer to get alignment from all the working teams first.

I’m getting annoyed wit my manager as he asks A LOT of questions, most of them relating to the processes between regional/country - something that I feel he should be familiar with considering he was managing another country to begin with. While explaining, he is challenging the processes set by REGIONAL with even more questions. Conversations with him are super long as well, where discussing on a simple campaign gets derailed to other campaigns and takes more than an hour.

The biggest gripe for me is that he agrees to things before checking in with the working team or considers the timeline for things. Like why do you agree before thinking?

16fjoa0,Development in my arts career,"Hi everyone, over the past few months, I have been mulling about the development of my career. I feel I have reached a point where I need to jump to another job but I am not sure if that is a wise decision. 

To begin, I'm 27 and I have started working since I am 24. I have gone through several different jobs, from working as sales at an ad agency, store manager of a bookstore, marketing executive for a multinational company and recently I have shifted to work for the arts industry. The change of jobs might seem odd but I wanted to try different things before jumping into my passion in arts. 

In arts itself, I started as an intern, project manager, content creater before becoming a full time gallerists. Because my career experience has been very broad, I am able to acquire many different skills from project managing, public relations, sales and even art handling. 

The reason I want to change job is because my current workplace is facing financial issues, my claims have not been paid and I am worried that this situation will persist. I like where I am working, but I need to move forward as well. However with this breadth of experience and skills that I have, I am not sure where to go forward. I want to stay in arts, but probably do a more behind-the-scene work such as in the technology or logistic side. If you have any idea, please help to guide me :) thank you!",fermentedideas,1,1.0,0,1694399966,2023-09-11 02:39:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16fjoa0/development_in_my_arts_career/,9,2023

Since starting proposal writing I’ve gained a lot of weight and my chronic anxiety has gotten much worse. 

I started with this company about 4 months ago after being laid off from my previous job.

But I need another job fast because I am in a toxic work environment, and I fear that I could lose my job any day. But it has been hard to find another job, and all career experts recommend a completely public LinkedIn profile showcasing the perfect candidate to hire. 

However, is telling the world where you work safe? For example, when I start a new job, I plan on not listing it on my profile, or if I do, listing it for connections only because I fear someone from my current job contacting my new employer and sharing insufficient information with intentions of making my new job fire me. I get anxious and overthink, so my fears may be unnecessary. After all, nobody has ever told me a story of whether LinkedIn hurt them, but it could.

16fgqzd,Pursuing a Career in Medicine with an Economics Degree,"  
  
Hey everyone,  
  
I wanted to share an interesting question I've been pondering lately. I'm currently studying economics in highschool, and our curriculum is quite focused on the basics of economics, including terms, theories, and some simple math. However, this curriculum removes subjects like biology and physics.  
  
Now, my passion lies in therapy, and I've always dreamed of becoming a therapist or a doctor specializing in therapy, somewhat like Dr. Isiah Friedlander from GTA V. I know it's an unconventional path, but I'm determined to make it happen. I've heard that some countries have unique admission policies for medical schools, which might consider applicants from diverse academic backgrounds.   
  
I'm wondering if anyone here has insights into whether it's possible to enter a medical school anywhere in the world with an economics degree? Additionally, I've heard rumors about countries like Russia, Cuba, and Senegal accepting students with different educational backgrounds. If anyone has information or experiences related to this, please share. I'd greatly appreciate it.  
  
Moreover, if you have any suggestions, tips, or advice on how I can prepare myself for such a transition, I'm all ears. I'm truly passionate about therapy and want to find a way to pursue my dream, even if it means taking a less traditional path.  
  
Looking forward to hearing from you all and thanks in advance for your help!",i0e_z,2,1.0,0,1694392044,2023-09-11 00:27:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16fgqzd/pursuing_a_career_in_medicine_with_an_economics/,9,2023
16fgd54,19 yrs old - need advice,"Hello, I’m struggling on what to do with my life. I was in all top classes in school until something bad happened. It’s not an excuse, life is hard for everyone but I have somewhat decent GCSE’s and a basic shitty BTEC in Art & Design. The thing is that I’ve spent years trying to get my maths. 

My family kept asking me for years about it. I know I shouldn’t of but I didn’t pass I got 2 marks off a pass and I told my family I passed before I even looked at my results. They think I’ve passed and been wondering where the pass certificate is. I know I shouldn’t of lied but I didn’t want to look stupid, I spent hours and hours studying. It hurts so bad.

I may sound narcissistic and pathetic but my sister is only a year young than me and she’s perfect. Got an apprenticeship, a-levels, easily passed maths. She was even first to get a job before me. I love her so much but it hurts so bad. She worked her ass off, I’m not lazy but shes always known what she’s wanted to do.

I also have a part time job at some sad greasy fast food place. I’m genuinely so lost, I don’t suffer from mental health but it’s starting getting to me now. I barely do anything. I’ve applied for better things but I always get rejected. 

I spend my time trying to better myself by hiking, the gym, cooking, painting.. but it isn’t helping the career situation. 

I might try:
Nursery, support companionship for elderly, nanny, nursery / primary school cook, gardening, floristry. etc

Currently learning to drive. I have experience in volunteering with children at rainbows, brownies and summer schools which involved catering, cleaning and supervising.

I feel like the only honourable skill I have is patience, being nurturing and creative. I’m also considered well liked and easy to talk to.

I know I shouldn’t of lied about the maths, maybe I am a fool. I might apply for level 2 apprenticeships to see if they’re interested. I don’t know what to do. If all else fails I could always go back to college but then I would have to get maths. I use to be getting like 6 in maths, i dont know what happened. I’m suggesting things which I have mostly already tried before. I tried a 2 yr animal management course it was so shit, most people dropped out which isn’t common for people to do in my area. It was a level 3.

 Prior to this I was working in hospitality and media related work. I did everything from purchasing to journalism and content writing. It was hard, but I enjoyed the daily challenge. I needed a more direct communication style, and that just was not the office culture. Whenever I would be trained in a certain task, I'd get two conflicting sets of information and need to take whichever one felt the most correct. 

The job is dull, and the pay is low, but what I kept telling myself is at least I'm here. Not stuck at my parents making minimum wage in the South. I feel all of my tasks can be done by anyone with an attention to detail, and I just can't produce the quality they expect in the time needed at the first cut.

I feel very alone. My family is willing to give me a loan, but with student loans coming due I can't afford to live here. I have an EU citizenship, but moving to Europe would be costly and unrealistic in the 2-3 month window. I know I am good at writing and research, but very few jobs like that exist which are not self-employment situations.. much fewer exist in the public sector, even with provisions to hire the disabled like myself.

I’ve had a few different jobs in the industry already, local, OTR, and now on a dedicated regional run, and I’ve struggled with all of them. I really wanted to make it work, so I thought it might have just been the job I was working, or the type of work that it was, but at the end of the day I still wasn’t enjoying it. My position now is with an awesome company, with an easy run, and great pay, but I honestly just don’t want to be driving anymore for work. I know the grass is greener where you water it, but I almost feel like I’m forcing myself to try and like it when I ultimately don’t. I’m just worried that I will get stuck, since my pay is good, and I have good job security. I know it’s tough starting out in trucking and it takes a few years to get used to things, but should I stick it out, even if I hate driving for work? I feel like it’s time for me to look for a different job. Is there anyone out there who has experienced the same feelings, or anyone who has transitioned out of the industry into a new field?

I would love to transition to an architect-level role again, but I worry (maybe incorrectly) as though the problems I work on in my current job are simple compared the challenges of big tech; I feel that to succeed in big tech, I need to take a step back into a developer role and grow more technically. However, the issue is that I haven't truly worked as an actual developer in years.

16fcygy,Concerns About Toxic Manager Ruining Future Job Prospects,"Hi everyone,

I have a question about applying to a new job when I've had terrible experiences with objectively bad employers in the past. For context, I had a very toxic boss at my previous job who placed me on a performance improvement plan that contained blatantly false information. When I refused to sign it initially, she said ""Sign it or you're fired."" Due to my need for a job and the obvious power differential, I felt like my hand was forced. This toxic dynamic was present throughout my time at that job, despite having very positive and productive relationships with my fellow co-workers (all of whom also felt similarly toward this boss). 

Fast forward to my current job application. Part of the application requires me to consent to this company contacting past employers and asking about my performance. My concern is that this toxic boss will again provide blatantly false information that will hinder me from getting this new job.

I am wondering what kind of information past employers are legally allowed to disclose? If they are legally allowed to disclose specific information about performance, how could I best handle this in the interview process, assuming it doesn't get me disqualified in the first place? I do have multiple references (one of whom is a former supervisor at my current job) that I am sure will give positive and supportive reviews. But I am concerned that all it will take is one negative comment from this toxic manager to ruin my chances. I was able to avoid this issue for my current job because they didn't check references and knew I had the relevant experience.",Sufficient_Arm_1328,8,1.0,5,1694382739,2023-09-10 21:52:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16fcygy/concerns_about_toxic_manager_ruining_future_job/,9,2023

16fc3s4,Advice for a burned out Med Tech?,"Tl;Dr - I want to leave my job within the next 12 months, but don't know what fits my life goals. Help? 

I (28 F) am mentally ready to leave my current job. It's becoming increasingly more demanding with the working hours and expectations of the staff and I can't justify the cost to my non-work life anymore. If my current job didn't become more restrictive and demanding, I could have seen myself staying on for years to come. I find the work fulfilling, I like my coworkers, I have a boss that is a good leader (though she's making poor decisions for staff happiness lately, not entirely her fault).

Hard skills are almost all in laboratory work, a very specific lab for my current job but I have general experience from before this position and high level work that I've been involved in for the last few years; also good with Microsoft Excel (high level spreadsheets) and I'm becoming more proficient with Adobe Creative Suite software; I have experience with supply chain and inventory optimization.

Soft skills are highly organized, strong attention to detail, handles high stress situations well, good with time management, I can organize a team to handle chaos, I'm good at calming people down (anxious coworkers and hospital patients alike), I try to optimize work processes for simplicity/ease of use and efficiency. I'm helping my spouse get their business off the ground, but it's far from being able to support the both of us. 

The problem: no clue what's next... 

I don't see a future in this field - the career ladder is finite and will include off-hours/holiday work or shift rotations, which I'm not keen on. Or laboratory management, which seems like hell from all angles. I'm also beginning to hate the hospital beaurocracy.

Dream conditions:
- M-F, day shift hours
- remote eventually
- good pay ($80k+ in a moderate COL area)
- mentally stimulating, problem solving, not sales
- work-life balance (I want to be around for my family)

Fields I've considered:
- data analytics (healthcare or not)
- accounting
- freelancing for project management and advertising/SEO for small businesses (basically what I'm doing now with my spouse's business)

Any thoughts on fields I should consider?

16fb9s7,How does one excel in the work place?,"Hi -  
I post this question to ask for your advice as someone who wants to move up!   
So I recently started a job as a receptionist at an international private club.   
The managers have come from over seas for the opening of our branch, they have alluded that there is a lot of room for growth.   
Some of them (the overseas managers) started where I am now and the other as a waiter.   
My question to you guys is, how can I excel and ensure they give me a raise?   
Tomorrow will be my second week that the new branch has opened but I don't care.   
I was thinking about talking to the person in charge and giving them some tips nd advice on how they can improve the training process, assisting with translating power points (from English to the native language).   
Little things to improve the intense 5 day 9 hour training process with little things like;   
1. Ask people to move spots once we are finished with one topic and move on to the next.   
2. have 2 minutes where we close our eyes and listen to classical music to relax the brain.   
3. Give everyone a juice box or a piece of fruit or a small candy, as sugar helps wake up us.   
4. Do some hand or body exercises to help wake us up  
Some thing like this to break up the information.   
And then have them email it to us because it was really a LOT of info.   
**Question:** Is there anything I can start doing like this to show the employers that I want to move up rank in a year or so; what would you appreciate?   
What should i start thinking about in terms of office politics?

16f6wab,The emperor wears no clothes: no sales strategy,"Posting this for a friend:

My subsidiary has recently merged with another and my lean and mean division is now working closely with our much larger counterparts in the other division. At the top level, we are providing most C-level leadership whereas they are providing Director-level leadership and most mid-level management. 

I am a national sales manager that sells a product that supports a product sold by the other team. In other words, a decent share of my total sales are dependent on the success of their sales effort.

In the past six months I have discovered the following about our counterparts' sales strategy which is at odds with ours:

1. There are no territory sales plans or strategy to promote the product I mentioned. Given the dozen or so people on the sales team, it’s a Sisyphean task to keep them focused. I have no authority over them. 

2. Reps are being asked to data mine information that could easily and cheaply be purchased at 20% of our cost of labor, saving hundreds of hours that could be better spent… selling?

3. Reps are solely measured on the number of phone calls and emails they send; management doesn't seem to know there is emailing software that links to a CRM and that you can pay people to call and make appointments. One Rep was recently celebrated for making 500 calls a week…we don’t sell manufactured products, but market a highly specialized B2G consulting service in response to RFPs. Math doesn’t add up.

4. Marketing strategy is purely exhibiting at conferences, where the conference draw is a basket of chips and some brochures. Again, we are a B2G business that responds to RFPs…

I found these to be huge red flags. I met with the sales manager on the other team responsible for these tactics, and in an info call showed him the plans and data we use on our side. I discovered he was promoted as a subject expert and has no management or sales experience. He is a prickly, arrogant man to be frank, and I can see that I will alienate him if I push further asking about how his team works. I tried to say something to my boss, who comes from that division, and was basically brushed off. My worry is that a good portion of my team's sales are dependent on the growth of that teams's sales, and I don't see a viable five year plan down the road.

What should I do? 

I could go over my boss's head, as his new boss comes from my side of the business and will take my concerns on board.  But that would mean war. 

Option 2 in the mess of this merger: I could probably get away with ignoring the incompetence, hoping for the best, keeping my head down and taking my paycheck. I do love this company and beyond the above dynamic, they treat me well.

Or Option 3: I could leave.

I believe this whole proposition could fall apart in the next five years due to mismanagement on this other team, and those are my options.

So, you need backstory here to understand. I am an ukrainian refugee, moved after 2022 in Germany. I can speak ukrainian, russian, English (about B2) and learn german B2-C1. I dont have any work experience, or a degree, since i am really young.   
  
I have studied in Ukraine, but left my university, since i did not like it. I really want to get german citizenship. I like videogames a lot and learning some different stuff like languages, i read a lot about random stuff.  
  
My dream is to become fully financial independent, somekind of remote job probably (home-office or ""digital nomad"" style, idk), but i am really stressed with a choice, i cannot make a decision about my future job.   
  
My previous education was recognized as ""realschulabschluss"" (like middle school degree) , so i cannot go to any university (unless i do some extra studies, which i dont want to, because it takes a lot of time) but i can go to ""Ausbildung"" (job schools, college etc, dual system).   
  
I really like playing computer games, used to organize some small different things (in school and etc), had some experience with online sales. I also finished a special ""job choice test"" from jobcenter, which showed me that i should become a translator or software developer, or game designer or any kind of salesman in CS or IT (from things i could potentially like)  
  
So i need an advice which way should i choose. I definitely need any kind of education (or at least skills in tech) and I really would like to get an education in Game Design or Game Development but i am not sure if i can get a job offer after that...  I can also try to get in IT like a developer. But which way is the most ""secure"" and fast to become financially free and then have chance to become a remote worker? Also which choice can have a good salary and be a fast way up through learning?  
  
Any thoughts are welcome, especially people with gaming or tech jobs. Everything helps. I would also be glad to get in touch via DM for some personal help if you have. Also i wished to get help with understanding what jobs are in IT, except of software engineers. Also have some fears of ""being too stupid"" for game development and/or tech area. What are chances to get a job offer in gaming or software developer area? Is it possible to workly remote as a game designer/developer?

16f0cch,Any career advice for someone who just doesn't like anything?,"I'm 32, I've been working in restaurants over 12 years. That's my only experience, and it's just simple hibachi stuff, nothing like real cooking, so I couldn't even transition into a real line cook job even if I wanted to. I don't. 

I have an interview for a line cook position this week but I know I'm going to bomb it because not only do I know absolutely nothing about cooking, I actually kinda hate food. Especially the kind of fancy rich person fru fru food that gets served at real restaurants where the line cooks make enough money to afford to pay rent by themselves. It's just not my scene. I don't go to restaurants (or bars, I don't drink at all). I don't have a favorite food. I eat food like people put gas into a car: I take the cheapest shit I can get at the most convenient time and place, I don't fantasize about what gas station I'm gonna go to or go out of my way to pay extra for the special spicy gas. So with no passion for food, competing against actual cooks for a role in a real restaurant that serves people who actually like food, I stand no chance.

I also kinda hate everything about our society, so other jobs seem just as awful if not worse. Buying, selling, marketing, advertising, it's all bullshit. Capitalism is a disease and the products it pushes are poison. I'd rather not have anything to do with any of it. I literally only work because I have to pay rent, and I only have to pay rent because some rich person already bought everything around me before I was even born and wants to charge me 3x their mortgage to rent it from them. Which kinda sucks when you think about it, like, imagine my labor produces 100 in value, my boss takes 90 and gives me 10, then the landlord takes 5, car and bills take 4, and I get 1 for food. What motivation is there to actually want to work in such a situation? People who say stuff like ""I like my job"", are you just lying so you don't get fired or bring the conversation down? I must be missing something.

I can continue doing my current job, but I hate it also, and it only makes just enough to afford my bills and rent and offers a terrible work life balance and no benefits. I'm just wondering if there's anything out there that you'd recommend to a person like me who reads every job description like he's reading a cancer diagnosis? And I don't mean that lightly, I mean seriously; Imagining myself doing literally any job makes me feel sick to my stomach with anxiety and depression. I feel like no matter what I do, it's just going to be something I don't want to do but I have to do it for money. How do I be ""happy"" with that?

What could I possibly transition into that won't make my chest hurt just thinking about it? I never graduated high school and I have no skills.

16ezmi0,The emperor wears no clothes: no sales strategy,"My company has recently merged two divisions and we are now working closely with our counterparts in the other division. At the top level, we have a mix of leadership from the two divisions. I am a national sales manager that sells a textbook that support s a curriculum sold by the other team. In the past six months I have discovered the following about our counterparts' sales strategy:

1. There are no territory sales plans

2. Reps are being asked to data mine information that could easily and cheaply be purchased

3. Reps are solely measured on the number of phone calls and emails they send; management doesn't seem to know there is emailing software that links to a CRM and that you can pay people to call and make appointments

4. Marketing strategy is purely attending conferences, conference draw is a basket of chips and some brochures

I found these to be huge red flags. I met with the sales manager on the other team responsible for these tactics, and in an info call showed him the plans and data we use on our side. I discovered he was promoted as a subject expert and has no management or sales experience. He is a prickly, arrogant man to be frank, and I can see that I will alienate him if I push further asking about how his team works. I tried to say something to my boss, who comes from that division, and was basically brushed off. My worry is that my team's sales are dependent on the growth of that teams's sales, and I don't see a viable five year plan down the road.

What should I do? I could go over my boss's head, as his new boss comes from my side of the business and will take my concerns on board. In the mess of this merger, I could probably get away with ignoring the incompetence and hoping for the best and keeping my head down and taking my paycheck. Or I could leave. I believe this whole proposition could fall apart in the next five years due to mismanagement on this other team, and those are my options.

16eyt7s,Is approaching people for work too forward?,"I am a contractor/sole trader but not a very confident person. 

I am currently contracting to a company and the boss’s method of feedback is to pretty much blame everything on anyone except themselves. And I think/know I’m losing confidence there and possibly making mistakes because of this. 

I’m also one to stay with a position out of misplaced loyalty. These people owe me nothing. 

I have been lucky enough that most of my work has come via word of mouth (small town location) or via social media. 

I know they only way for me to get away from this position is to replace it and that I need to be more confident to do that. 

Is it considered too rude, forward or desperate to approach a company offering your services?? 

Has anyone got any advice for doing so when you are a person with little confidence??

16etihi,MBA or MS?,"Career Guidance Needed

29M. I have been working in a Oil & Gas Public sector in India for past 5.5  years since 2018. I recently got married and my wife is a prosthodontist. She works in a state government medical hospital. Due to erratic shift duties, extended work hours of almost 13-14 hrs daily without any weekly off, remote location of posting and mundane nature of job, I am unable to cope with the work culture of my job. Although me and my wife have been staying together,  this also is jeopardising my marriage life as we have very little time for each other. With no hope for any growth here, I feel like I am going into a downward spiral and my efficiency is sharply declining. The job is mostly managerial and involves a lot of manual paperwork with outdated technologies. I am a B.Tech graduate in Mechanical engineering. Also my job has a transfer policy every 4 years to anywhere in the country. But my wife will always be within the state. It will be very difficult for us to stay together once I get transferred from here. The pay is decent for both of us although not as high as in tech field. wanted to go abroad for Masters in Mechanical but don’t know after experience of 5 years in a managerial position, how that would be feasible. I am unable to decide where should I switch to. Should I go for MS abroad now? What are the job prospects after MS and which country would be good for dental practice so that me and wife can stay together?

In a store close to my house to save up for a car and other things to start to build a life and career. within the year of me being out of high school I managed to save up and get a 2010 Honda with cash. I also managed to get into a relationship and a minor car accident that i now owe 2,500 on.(random facts but all comes together) I also started going to trade school for hvac (9,000). Currently I’m still in school and have 2 months left about. I am lucky I guess you can say because I got to into a apprenticeship with a company. This whole time I have been working, going to school, and gym to try and better myself now that I’ve started working in hvac as a apprentice I have done nothing but that work!! Hvac techs work long hours I am currently making the same as I did  when I was at the retail store. I have no time to spend doing anything else I work more then 60 hours a week and it’s only going to get worse once I finish my apprenticeship we typically work 13 hour days 5 days a week and are on call every other weekend me as a apprentice I am not on call but I know people who have worked 12 days straight 10-12 hour shifts each day you make good money after 4-5 + year’s experience up to a 110,000 a year but at what cost I’ve been thinking of switching careers because I want a family eventually and to be able to see them but still support them. I’ve looked at a couple things like cop or barber. But one you put your life on the line and the other is very risky meaning you might not make enough money too live now a days.

16eppqv,Entry Level Geotech Job Criteria,"Hi everyone,
I was offered an entry level geotechnical engineering job (Job A) back in January with a reputable consulting firm in my hometown. The job pays 66k and with the sign on and end of year bonuses I will be paid 75k in a HCOL. It was the first job I was offered, I liked the team, and I liked the benefits including comp time pay and hybrid work options. The job is in the mining sector and I can expect to participate in field investigations and evaluate drill log data as an entry level engineer. Personally, I don't really enjoy computer-based work, and I'm not that interested in soil mechanics or drilling, so I had some hesitation about the role, but at the time I mostly just wanted to return home and be with my family after experiencing some serious college burnout. Because of the cost of living, I plan on living with my parents for awhile. I have not started working at this job and I won't begin until December because I had an internship at a different company that I wanted to explore. Job A was aware of this and allowed me to defer my start date to compete the internship.

Turns out I really liked my internship, and I was just offered a job with the internship company. Job B pays 81k base and 106k with bonuses in a MCOL area. The role would be a lot more hands-on and active and is more of a project management role. It would be an industry position as opposed to a consulting role providing support to a number of major mine sites. When not on site, I could work remotely. The company is also very well-known and there is significant upward mobility in the position.

Here's the kicker: I would have to relocate for the second job. I don't like the location I would have to relocate to and I think it could be detrimental to my mental health to live in this location without the strength of the support system I have in my hometown. Also, if I reneged my acceptance to the first job, I run the potential of burning bridges at a company that I might want to return to in the future. On the other hand, I like the second company, I'm excited by the work, and if I end up not liking the first job, I would likely regret not persuing the second offer.

16eof1n,"As a chef, Stay cruiseship or Landbase?","Hello everyone. I've been working in cruiseship industry for 6 years now as Demi chef de partie. 32 years old, Single but planning to get married soon - from Philippines.

Earning $2k per month tax free. Free food, accomodation everything for 6 months and then 2 months of vacation - and repeat. 

(Additional information -  We work 13 hours every single day without dayoff(Yes,not even once) for 6 months. Working with 350+ cooks so promotion is way too slow. And even if I get promoted(which is on the way, it will only increase my salary by $800) - one main factor is: We get treated like shit by management unlike on other hotel department.

Compare to other hotel department like Waiters, Room Services or Housekeeping we earn the lowest - By $1k-$3k difference.

Im so confused right now on what to do. Burnt out(like most of my passion in cooking are almost drained.) Most of my collegues are either left to try on other department or applied landbase.

I work really really hard. Im always positive on work - smiling laughing even on most pressure and stressful times. Most of the time a ""Yes man"", a team player. Maximum patience.. Come early finish late type of guy.  Its just .. lately Ive been comparing myself on what others earn vs the effort Ive been doing on job. At my age - I feel like I need to decide and take action as soon as I can otherwise I will regret it.

Here are options Im choosing with.
1. Stay and push for promotion (I hate this one)
2. Change department and start from scratch. (Might take another year base on vacancy of the company)
3. Go landbase as same field. (Reluctant on this because of taxes and cost of living - couple of years before I can go home)
4. I am open for suggestions.

Disclaimer: The company that Ive been working for is amazing, they give a lot of benefits and perks - might be the biggest company in Entertainment industry(you know already for sure). (Thats why its really hard for me to decide) Its just the chefs on the management level are assholes - the system and how shitty they treat the cooks here compare to other department.

I apologize if it sounded more like a rant. But - people who worked in cruiseship industry will understand what I mean especially on galley department.

16ed3mj,"Got thrown under the bus by my boss, now what do I say when I'm asked about what happened during the department meeting?","I'm a few months into a new job, and it's been a challenging with my boss who seems out of his depth, doesn't communicate effectively, and hasn't provided clear direction. Last week he and I were (I thought) in agreement over the direction of ""Project Vulcan"". We discussed it verbally multiple times, I updated him daily (verbally in stand-ups), and I emailed him with everything. During a critical time when he should have been more on top of it as head of the team, he was forwarding emails from his boss to him, to me without any additional comment, leaving me to handle everything. I wrote back to him in these emails what I was doing, but he never followed up. Well the shit hit the fan and he pretty much left me to deal with explain what happened and fixing everything. He might have been more careless than deliberately throwing me under the bus, but I feel like I did everything I thought I was supposed to and kept him updated on everything, but he didn't step in as a director and correct or change anything, and I feel like I'm on my own.  
Now he says, ""we're going to be asked about this during the department meeting this week"". Since I've been speaking during these meetings, I'm going to have to be the one who speaks to this. He and I already talked about it, and I sent him an email with all the changes, dates, impacts, etc. so I don't know what I'm expected to say about it. I thought he and I were aligned on what I did, and I did what I thought I was supposed to, but I can't be like, ""we were both in the loop on everything, but he didn't read his emails or step in and override my decisions"". 

  
I'm extremely wary because last month another teammate was recently fired for not growing their skillset, despite our boss not providing adequate guidance, feedback or opportunities for growth/training. Not saying this person is blameless, but some alarm bells have gone off for me.

  
Since then I've been in CYA-mode, making sure to email him on everything, even as he pushes for calls.

16ecdxr,Which Bootcamp Specialization for a Career in the Space Sector?,"Hello everyone,  
  
I'm a recent physics graduate with a strong interest in the space industry, specifically space exploration. I'm currently enrolled in a fully-funded software engineering bootcamp with three specialization options:  
  
Data Engineering: Focuses on data acquisition, analysis, and database management, including Apache Spark for machine learning, along with a Data Engineer Associate Certification.  
  
Data Analytics: Involves extracting insights from data, creating data visualizations, and effective communication using tools like Tableau and Power BI, with a Data Analyst Certification.  
  
Cloud Engineering: Encompasses the design and management of scalable cloud-based infrastructure, vital for data storage, analysis, and processing in the space industry, along with an AWS Cloud Practitioner Foundational Certification.  
  
I believe specializing in Data Engineering, particularly with Apache Spark, aligns best with my interests in data science, machine learning, and robotics within the space sector. To gain practical experience and explore different areas in the industry, I'm actively seeking internships abroad in space/aerospace companies via Intern Match. My goal is to secure a graduate job following the internships and bootcamp. If necessary, I will pursue a master's in Space Exploration Systems with an international placement next year, if I fail to get a graduate job by then.  
  
I'd greatly appreciate your insights on which specialization you think would best launch my career in the space sector, given my background in physics.  
  
If anyone within the space sector can offer advice on breaking into this industry, I'd love to hear your insights.

16ec3xa,Help me help my brother,"It’s a bit of a strange situation but bare with me as I explain.

Context -
My brother is 30 years old, nice guy who has loads of great qualities like honesty, kindness and loyalty. He left high school with below average grades (busy drinking and partying- he was a typical ‘popular’ guy in HS) and did not go to university. Since he graduated HS he has literally done nothing. He has played video games, watched tv and that’s about it. So it’s been over 10 years of inaction, not progressing or building skills. 

Last year I think he kinda realised that he needed to sort out his life and he started a part time uni degree (1 day per week) in the tech field and also started driving lessons. However, he failed out of his degree so is back to doing nothing all day everyday. I was especially worried about this as I can imagine it’s a hit to his confidence. 

He has some waiter experience but LITERALLY nothing else. He still lives with my parents and in my opinion they don’t push him enough and try to ignore the problem. I have suggested he needs therapy or psychiatric help but was laughed off. Over 10 years of nothing is not normal and I wish they would take me seriously.

I am extremely worried about him. I know that on paper he sounds like some loser but if you knew him you would like him, he’s not a bad person. 

Please does anyone have a suggestion of what career path is realistic for him? 
He is wasting his life, no dating, no social life, no job. I would really like to come up with a plan for him. Not something complex like in tech but something manageable for him. I don’t mean to imply he’s stupid as he isn’t but after years of doing nothing it is setting himself up for failure if he rushes into anything. I want to figure out a career path that is realistic and stable.

Any help would be appreciated.

I just want him to be okay.",Consistent-Manager-1,1,0.5699999928474426,21,1694282148,2023-09-09 17:55:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16ec3xa/help_me_help_my_brother/,9,2023

I started a TAFE (like college) course this semester but its genuinely the least interesting class I've ever taken, I like doing painting and drawing so I took a visual arts course but its nothing like I thought it would be and we don't do either of those things. I have been looking for a job non stop for YEARS and applying to pretty much every ""no experience required"" job I come across but have had no luck. Only 2 places I applied at have ever called me, and one ended up needing 3 years of experience and the other required me to have a full driver's license (I only have a learners). I have kinda stopped going to TAFE because its just such a pain to get there for such little pay-off since I am not learning a single thing or getting any good experiences out of it. And frankly I don't really have the money to spend on food and transport either even if it is only 2 days a week.  
  
As you can imagine I am not feeling good about how I am not doing anything with my life and my parents aren't happy about it either. I genuinely feel so lost because no other TAFE course sounds interesting to me, when I was thinking about applying at first the visual arts course was the only one that caught my eye and now it turns out I hate it. I have horrible social anxiety so I have been avoiding customer service jobs but even if I search for those too I haven't found any opportunities that suit me, and I have NO idea what career path I want to take because I don't feel like I am good enough at any subject or enjoy anything enough. I really need advice on where I can go from here because I need to find something as soon as possible since technically, it is actually illegal for me to not be doing education or work full-time.

The reason why I am posting in here is because a few people have made comments about me having a 1st class degree but am doing an apprenticeship (for significantly less pay than minimum wage, but I can live off it because I don’t make stupid financial decisions and have savings). But the reason I am doing this is because I cannot get a job working with children without a childcare related qualification or experience, but this apprenticeship has both of these, yes it is a lot less pay but as I said, it is manageable. I can’t help but think people are judging me (family included) for making this career decision.

16e5bti,Transitioning to DS/DA from an undergraduate degree in CSE. Need advice!,"Hello all,

I hope this post finds you all well and thriving in the world of data. I wanted to share my journey and seek some advice as I embark on a career transition into data science, specifically analytics. Perhaps some of you have been through a similar experience or have valuable insights to offer.

A few months ago, I completed my undergraduate degree in computer science and engineering, and I've been passionate about diving into the world of data ever since. However, there's a challenge – the field of data science/analytics isn't as prevalent where I currently live, and I believe that pursuing postgraduate studies abroad, specifically somewhere like the UK or Australia, could provide the best opportunities for my career goals.

So, here are a few questions I'd love to hear your thoughts on:

1. **Choosing the Right Course**: When it comes to selecting a data science program, what should I be looking for? Are there any specific universities or programs in the UK or Australia that you would recommend?

2. **Analytics vs. Data Science**: I've heard discussions about analytics-focused programs versus broader data science programs. What are the pros and cons of each, and how should I decide which path to take?

3. **Career Opportunities**: For those of you who have made a successful career out of data analytics, what are some of the key trends or industries where data analysts are in high demand today?

4. **Skill Development**: What technical and soft skills should I prioritize developing during my postgraduate studies to excel in this field?

5. **Networking**: Any advice on building a strong professional network in the data science community? Are there any conferences, forums, or communities you recommend joining?

6. **Internships and Projects**: How important are internships and personal projects in securing a data science role after completing my studies? Any tips on making the most of these opportunities?

7. **Work-Life Balance**: Maintaining a work-life balance can be challenging in demanding roles like data science. How do you manage this aspect of your career?

Your insights, personal stories, and advice would mean the world to me as I embark on this exciting but somewhat daunting journey. I believe that hearing from those who have already walked this path can provide invaluable guidance.

Thank you in advance for your wisdom and support.",tyr1699,1,1.0,0,1694264813,2023-09-09 13:06:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16e5bti/transitioning_to_dsda_from_an_undergraduate/,9,2023

16e24w8,I think I should quit…thoughts?,"Hey All, sorry for the long post but I am in need of some untainted/unfiltered advice on my situation. 

I’ve been working for a custom electronics manufacturer for going on 9 years in February. My Dad was a minority owner of the company and ran the engineering department, i work as our project manager and would collaborate and have meetings and lunch with my dad daily. We did that for my whole career at the company and he unexpectedly passed away at 60 on Christmas of 2021. Obviously losing my dad, best friend, role model, confidante, etc makes even being at the company hard but I have so much time invested that I didn’t want to start over somewhere else. 

As time has went on there, upper level management has not attempted to even fill my dads role. They just awkwardly leave it for everyone to kinda figure it out. I’ve been hopeful that this was going to turn around but the majority owners son is now taking over and he is AWFUL. Shows up maybe 20-30 hours a week, stirs shit up and leaves the cluster for us and just passes blame. We were extremely innovative with growing internal capabilities but since my dad died and other key employees have quit and they also have not been replaced, idk where this place is headed….on track for our worst year yet currently. 

I have grown a side hustle I’ve been working on for the last 7 years into finally a revenue generating sustainable success. I’m on track this year to make ~$30k in profit off of $50k in gross sales(my best year yet). My wife is fully supportive of me going all in on my business and I should…..but I’m scared to be honest. I worry about everything. The only debt I have is an awful decision to take a 401k loan out a couple years ago when we got our first house….this is the only reason why I’m still at the company. The plan was to borrow, then when the house value grew, refinance and pay the loan off. Well this was before the market changed after covid. So we got a 2.7% interest rate…..I can’t justify refinancing and getting a 5-6% rate now. It feels like a jail sentence lol. I have cash reserves if I were to quit and grow my side business but I can’t stomach giving away a huge chunk of it to pay the loan off- ($18k remaining).

Do you think I should keep my head down, grind it out the balance of this year, see if raises/bonuses are even happening. If they are, get the bonus, then quit and pay the loan off using that and make up the difference? 

Keep sticking it out, growing the side business until the company shits itself out of business? 

I’m just not happy at all being there as I love innovation and growth potential (not just monetarily). I do have local fall back companies that have told me to come work for them whenever I want. Why am I so scared?! Can someone please kick me in the ass here lol?

I initially accepted with the expectation we would be averaging 45 hours a week as thats what the gm told me. In the time ive been here weve only hit 45 once because the main machine caught fire causing us to have to stop, leading to a 12 hour day that saved the week. 

Prior to the trial i told the gm i cannot take a pay cut to go work for them and he said he wouldnt expect me to. At the prior company, i got paid a daily rate of $290. At 32/hr averaging 45 hrs would put me at a daily rate of $304. I haven't been seeing the hours and it feels like i have actually taken a pay cut to start working here. 

After being here for 30 days, it seems they have a hard time finding good help. they already told me that they are looking at me to lead the working crew under the foreman as he wants to transition to the site work side of the company. I dont even have a full crew to do the job i constantly have to do the job of 2-3 people. I am plenty capable and i don't complain, i have no issues with the work. People there longer than me already see me as a lead, i like the people and the work environment. Just slightly unhappy with my pay rate the dream rn would be to be at 40-45hr, i would like to be at 38 but no less than 36.25 as that would match my pay rate from the old company while working 40hrs no overtime.",Sharp_Secret6346,0,0.5,0,1694243170,2023-09-09 07:06:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16dz2rd/is_it_too_soon_to_ask_for_a_pay_raise/,9,2023

I feel like I can't do this no more and the cost of living is insane, thinking about switching to something else I thought of trucking but diabetes had a different opinion ig so now thinking about trades but ppl been telling me that its tough and I would handle it since most ppl start at early 20s or they're in a good condition not like me.

I'm in a management position but I'm pretty much the fixer that everyone relies on. I have far too much on my plate and the stress is literally killing me. I've developed some health issues recently and I'm having a hard time managing it all. I'm finally in a spot where I feel like I can confidently say that I'm giving too much. I am not lying or exaggerating when I say that I work SO hard and I don't slack off. I'm just not that kind of person. I hate to compare myself to others but I see all of these other people get VIP awards and trips and I can't help but feel resentful. Ultimately my company doesn't care about me because I don't work overtime and actually use my PTO. Is that just how it is? I don't get it. I'm not very good at sticking up for myself or asking for things. How do I use any of this as leverage to ask for more money or something? I just don't know where to start.

16dwhmx,"I hate my job, my boss is the most annoying person I’ve ever met.","Title may sound dramatic…but hear me out. I work in tech and I have had a couple companies where I was successful in a sales role and had such a good experience. I left the happy situation I was in  because I was being underpaid and was denied a promotion and a raise (right at the beginning of the tech decline) but did not stick it out. It was remote that transitioned into a 2x a week hybrid role. Which was totally fine and frankly amazing bc of how awesome the office and culture was. 

Fast forward to the job I took to make more money…they said it was hybrid and then right after I joined only my team was required to be in office EVERY DAY. Every other team in any office is 2/3 home office schedule. It’s all because my new manager is a complete control freak who insists we’re in our desks from 8-5 every single day. I’m sorry but this is 2023 and we are all adults. We can do the same work from anywhere but this guy is obsessed with micromanaging us to the very second….

This shitty leadership has left me even more depressed and frustrated. I was selling a bunch at my old company but this new job their market is stagnant and it’s tough sledding. I’ve been told to lie to customers, make up statistics, and do anything to get an opportunity. My manager has 0 filter or professionalism in the office (at the end of the day who cares because we’re the only ones there) but what really did it was I left on a summer Friday at 4:20 (no one but our team in the office) because I had worked though lunch. He asked where I was going and I said I worked through lunch and I was leaving….keep in mind: 

1. Made the most calls out of the entire team. 
2. Did not go to lunch and worked from 8-4:20 strait. 
3. Did everything else this future divorced cuck said for the day. 

TLDR: I’m waiting on a decision from a fully remote company’s decision. My current boss is one of the worst humans I’ve ever come across do I just tell him to pound sand and hope I get the new job or get outta there regardless.  

Text to team after I left at 4:20 on a Friday afternoon after working through lunch: 

“Team - you are never allowed to arbitrarily change your core hours to accommodate anything outside of work without speaking to me about it first. We are 8-5. If you need to leave early for something I am very lenient. Probably the most lenient MGR you Will ever have. But please don't take that leniency as a weakness. 8-5 M-F no more excuses.”

16duo5e,Am I overreacting or are there better jobs?,"I really need someone else’s perspective as I’m at the point where my mental health is so bad I can’t tell what is up or down. 

I’ve been working at my job for about 2.5 years as an entry level accountant and I can’t tell if I’m overreacting and all jobs are like this or if I should move on?

Am I wrong for having an issue with these things?

- Have spent the majority of the two years doing other positions along side my own with little help or support from management due to turnover

- The team members hired to replace the open positions don’t have the necessary skill sets and I frequently have to train/help them. One of them started 6 months after me and always refers to asking me for help because it’s “faster”

- I’m constantly given things above my pay grade and receive no support from upper management. Ex: I’m an accountant (this is my first accounting job) and I’m being required to handle/edit/write/and distribute contracts to new customers. I have no experience with this and can’t get any help on something as small as a scope of work

- Management is never held accountable and it’s caused a lot of complacency and gaps. Whenever there’s an issue nobody takes initiative and I’m told “we’ll somebody has to do it” so that means me

- Problems rarely get fixed and I’m having to fix everything as I go along. Escalated problems are always dismissed

- I feel like my needs are frequently overlooked. By management in terms of my professional growth and by everyone on a personal level. One of my coworkers is incredible selfish and is constantly expecting me to prioritize her and drop what I’m doing but she won’t even address me or look at me when I come over until she’s finished her work

16dufdf,Is it worth doing med?,"I’m in allied health and I earn a fair bit (250-300k) as I run a clinic (physio). 
It’s busy, the constant trying to get staff in a shortage industry, paying a lot to keep them and making very little on staff because the rate we can bill (government funded scheme) hasn’t budged in 6 yrs. We get accused of gouging when we start charging for things we didn’t before (like travel, KMs, notes etc) but we do that because we can’t keep up with the wage increase when the billable amount hasn’t moved. 
I’ve just finished post grad in my field and now can work in Neuro, Pelvic and Paeds which I do because I get bored with one stream. I’m so frustrated with the limitations of my profession,  having doctors disregard our assessments and letting patients get so sick they end up hospitalised because “what would a physio know?”
Honestly every year or so I think about doing med. I decided against it at uni, because I wanted work life balance. But I have the kids and the house now, I’m 35. Would I be nuts to leave this high paying situation and pursue med because I want something more cognitively challenging? Is it really worth it, would I get what I’m after? Am I too old?
Physio was so easy. Masters was so easy. And here I am wondering what next. 
I’m in Aus. Allied health is in massive demand because of NDIS. I could focus my energy growing that, and probably earn more. But I’m still frustrated with how simple our scope is.

16dt9wf,Returning to job market after long illness,"I've been fighting a rare cancer since 2019. It has been a whirlwind of surgeries, radiation, chemotherapy, rehab, more chemotherapy and now finally...something of a glimmer of hope at the end of this.

When I was diagnosed, I was in 16 year remission (I had fought the disease in my early 20's). This recurrence came in the form of a nasty, extremely aggressive tumor reaching from my vena cava, all the way up to my left kidney and into my lung — this was all a surprise.

Prior to getting sick, I had started my own design and branding shop. We were just starting to take off when two things happened: I got sick and needed emergency surgery, and of course a little later, COVID.

Now, it LOOKS like I'll be able to start working again, after nearly 5 years of this shit.

The experience has left me with a significantly changed body, damaged confidence, nerves, and chronic fatigue. Some of these side-effects will resolve, some won't.

I'm sort of living in this grey area, where I don't know when / if the disease will simply come back, and even though my current treatment is responding well...that can always change — it has been difficult.

All this is to say that, career-wise I am struggling to identify what's next for me. Technically, I've been running my own business since 2016, but that has become more challenging and not as rewarding as I would like. In an attempt to pass the time during chemo, I started working on a [dumb t-shirt brand](https://terribletees.co) and even sold a few.

This entire experience, the stress, treatments, financial strain on my family and I has left me gutted...and just wondering where to start picking up the pieces. I loved my career, I loved working on brands and making things...I'd really like to fall in love with it again. But sometimes...it feels so out of reach. That I will start building, that I will get back up and just be knocked back down again.

16dqimm,Hours Cut! Help!,"Help! I've found myself in a weird grey area!  
My entry-level job recruited me a year ago and I signed on to my role with the agreement that they would be flexible with my school schedule. It's been a year and I've asked about pay raises a couple of times, each time being met with hostility. The first time was when I was given extra work, the second time was after my first annual review. I had my year review and no talk of a raise and when I questioned that -- it resulted in a meeting two weeks later with my boss and the director of operations notifying me that my hours would be cut. Apparently, they didn't like my tone and they think they're doing me too many favors by being flexible with my schedule. For the record, I didn't have a negative tone. I speak directly and openly and that doesn't always get received well by people who dont handle confrontation well. I digress...  
The good news is that I'll be graduating from college this winter and I'm already on the job hunt. The bad news is that I'm only allowed 3 days of work per week. Usually, despite my school schedule, I fit in 4-5 days -- so my schedule isn't too difficult.  
I'm curious if this is retaliation. Does anyone have insight about what I can do? I asked in the meeting if I was being punished for asking for a raise and they assured me that's not the case. However, cutting my hours means less money and less money has a negative impact on my livelihood. Call it what you want, this isn't a good thing.  
I must also point out that I've got nothing but positive feedback in all my quarterly reviews, I'm always on time, and I'm super friendly and communicative. I live in a moderately HCOL area and barely get by with my hours as is. I dont get holiday pay or bonuses -- which is my fault for not negotiating. Regardless of my understanding that my bosses aren't my friends and they dont actually care about me, I've been a reliable part of the team and it's a huge bummer that I'm being treated like this.

I didn't do super great in school (3.33 gpa) so I can't really pursue medical school. I wouldn't mind pursuing jobs that aren't directly related to my degree, but I also have no idea what potential careers I could get with it. 

The higher paid the better, and something that doesn't involve too much patron interaction would be ideal. But I also wouldn't mind going back to school for something like nursing if there's a way I could fast track that by already having a degree. 

I was working on a masters, but never finished it (was missing around 4 classes for a masters in medical sciences). 

I currently work as a PSR (clinic front desk person) and due to awful management I really hate it. The constant patient interaction is also really exhausting, since i have autism, but i think i could deal with it if management wasnt so bad and i got paid better.

Pretty much I'm exhausted from managing children every day. I used to work in hotels and miss it terribly, but I need the monday-friday lifestyle. So, since I have a degree and Math and another in Theater I decided to teach. 

In the end, I just wish there could be a job I could make a living out of talking to people. In hospitality I was a job coach and absolutely loved it. I love doing presentations, running from department to department. I was only there for about 2 years but I was quickly promoted into job coaching for front desk and concierge. When I was in theatre I was organizing the props department as a semester activity and then for the next two years they just asked me to head the dang thing and manage the TV shows renting our props.

I love people, I love public speaking. I love math and organizing. I just want to claw my face off at the idea of sitting behind a desk and seeing no one. I hate the idea of working from home. I love my kids but I'm tired of my job being 18 different things. The best schools to work at I can't afford to live near so spend at least 2 hours on the road every day. 

I'm 31 and have only experienced three interviews in my adult life. Mostly because for every single one I'm offered the job on the spot. Apparently people like that I'm bubbly and have a large personality. I want to leave teaching, I want to work with adults again and not ask the 16yo timmy to get whatever the fuck that is out of his mouth. I just...have no idea what to do.

Any advice?",SplodinBones,2,1.0,7,1694215769,2023-09-08 23:29:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16dpva8/jobs_for_the_organized_extrovert/,9,2023

My current company has been in talks with a business that was supposed to buy out our company, but a deal was supposed to be made months ago and no one has heard anything about it.

I recently applied for a job not thinking I'm going to get it, and long story short, I got the job. This job pays 20% more than my current role. It's a good job and I would enjoy it - I've been feeling a bit stagnant at my current company for a while.

However, I'm scared that if I leave my current job, then the buy out will happen and I'll lose out on a lot of money. I have absolutely no idea what the shares would be worth. But I'm also scared that I'll reject this job offer (which is a really good job), only to find the deal falls through with this buyout, or the deal goes through but it's for only a small amount of money.

16dogzl,"Not sure where next: Environmental Science Career shift after BSW, MSW, & some PhD Coursework","I am a former community organizing social worker with a bachelor’s (BSW), master’s (MSW), and some PhD coursework in social welfare (and electives). My PhD coursework took me in the route of climate and environmental science. Now I want to change careers, but I don’t know where to begin. Help!

I’m disappointed because I’ve built a career, but I’m also not surprised I feel this way. I wanted to be a marine biologist as a kid but was told to choose something “more practical” by my parents (and because I “wasn’t good at math”— since learned this is gendered). I’ve been miserable for years, but felt a lift of that misery writing about Anthropocene in 2022. The Ph.D. program is not something I have any interest in doing anymore, and have since left. People are okay and all, but animals and the earth are where my heart is.

I have spent from 2008-2022 in social work school or as a practicing social worker/ community organizing. However after I finished the above-mentioned publication in 2022, I realized I only wanted to focus on environmental science. But I don’t know where to begin. 

Every website is a mess. Including college websites. I would like to work with plants, animals, wildlife as a whole, forests, the ocean, etc. If I’m not great at the math needed, I’ll get a tutor— but I was great at PhD level stats.

I did not learn the fundamentals that are needed for any of the paths I’m finding for an ES degree. I’m worried I’ll have to start from scratch. So SAT/ ACT/ full undergraduate degree again. I don’t intend to pursue a PhD at the time. But maybe a master's if need be.

Questions I’d appreciate any assistance with:

1. Would I have to start from scratch? SAT/ACT and the full bachelor's degree?
2. Would it be possible to have credits from my bachelor's or master's degrees (or PhD school coursework) transfer?
3. Are there online degree programs with local fieldwork? Or are they all in person (I have children)?
4. Any suggested websites to help hone in on specialization?
5. Any suggested websites for the best accredited undergraduate programs?
6. Any suggested websites for the best career options for ES degree holders?
7. Any advice?

A tall order, I know. But please feel as if I may have found the right path finally.

If the employee quits now, they get insurance through end of month. If the end date gets back dated to when the leave of a sense started, they could risk insurance being back dated to end in August or risk the employer clawing back money for September insurance.

16dmtid,Should I tell a company I’m interviewing with about an untapped market opportunity they are uniquely equipped to fill?,"I unfortunately have to be vague with details here, but I am two interviews into the process with a startup company that is still very small but well-known. They have been growing steadily for several years and have already reached profitability, but based on the nature of the business, there is a ceiling for growth. I discussed this with my latest interviewer.  

The role I am interviewing for would support a new product the company is launching, which does seem interesting, but is nowhere near as interesting as their main offering. Still, I’d be pretty stoked to get the role and support it.  

With this in mind, I am intimately connected with a niche community that still makes up a larger portion of the population than the company’s target audience. This community is vastly underserved and the company’s primary offering aligns perfectly with the needs of this community. Current market offerings are 10+ years out of date in technology and the one or two newer entrants to the market don’t offer what this company could offer.  

What’s more, it seems to me like it would be fairly easy to adapt the company’s current offering to include this community, from a technology perspective. Being intimately involved with this community, I am confident it would take off extremely quickly. What’s more, I think it could also tie in nicely with the new product they are launching.  

The reason I wouldn’t go about just making this product myself is that brand equity plays a big role in it. There’s nothing particularly complicated or novel about the tech, but the business model and implementation that surrounds it which has garnered trust in the market. This company is perfectly positioned to offer it in a way that no one else can.  

Should I mention this to those interviewing me? Or should I wait to get hired first? If I do bring it up, should I be open about what this subset of the market is, or is there a way I could use it as a bargaining chip? What I don’t want to do is give them the idea and then they give the job to someone else. Especially because the market itself is not immediately obvious and members of this community keep themselves relatively hidden, even from family and close friends.   

It’s probably worth mentioning that I haven’t been actively looking for a new job. I’m quite happy and on a pretty good career trajectory where I’m at. The main reason I applied is because I see this potential, sought the company out deliberately, and they happened to have an opening for a role that I am well qualified for.  

Also, the company size is < 100 people. So it’s a place where the idea isn’t likely to get muddled in corporate noise and red tape. I know it would be considered if I put it forward. At the same time, maybe it’d carry more weight if I get in and prove myself for a few months first? I’m really torn on what to do and how to approach this.",anonminusq,1,1.0,2,1694208516,2023-09-08 21:28:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16dmtid/should_i_tell_a_company_im_interviewing_with/,9,2023
16dmp11,Job scope change- request salary increase,"Ive been at a new job for around 7 months. I left a previous job to join this company because it aligned well with future goals. The scope is drastically different from what I thought it would be. I’ve reached out to others with the same title and it seems like I’m doing 60% more work than peers with the same title due to the account I’m on.

I had my first review 3 months after starting , and voiced my concern to manager asking for a compensation adjustment to meet the scope. They said I was too new (basically no). After my 6 months evaluation, I  got exceed expectations and I’ve even conducted training for others and often referred too as a senior analyst in executive meetings. Lots of time I’m the analyst that gets what is considered “difficult” and my work is highly trusted.

I raised to my manager that if they were referring to me as a senior analyst if it was an official title change. They said no. During my most recent evaluation I got exceeding expectations, and have managed to meet 2/3 my accounts savings goal since starting. I brought up a compensation adjustment to my manager and was basically told that increase is off seniority and if I wanted to promotion it’ll be at least 2 years.

I keep  detailed documentation of the value I add. After my most recent conversation with manager I feel like I’m chasing a dangling carrot.

I learned that I’m making ~20% less than a coworker who started at the same time with same level of education and professional experience.  Although we have different titles we basically do the same thing and I find myself often train training them.

16dmair,Should I apply for a job that I'm not qualified for?,"I've been with my current company for a little under a year and I have about 5 years of post-college professional experience in total. I think I'm recognized by some at my company as high-performing and competent. 

A job was just posted at my company, and it is the type of job that I am aiming to have in about 3-5 years. The problem is, this job will likely require 10+ years of experience and the hiring manager will probably favor candidates who are older than I am and have more experience with leadership. 

All of that being said, I genuinely believe that I am capable of succeeding at this job in spite of my young age and lack of experience. And even if I don't get the job, the interview will be an opportunity to express my interest in this type of job and learn more about what they are looking for in a candidate. And there is a very small chance that they also think I'm capable and offer me the job. 

So I'm thinking about applying. But I'm worried about potential blow-back from my application. For example, they might think I'm arrogant and think too highly of myself by applying for a job that I don't meet the qualifications for.  And I also don't want them thinking that I'm not happy in my current job or am looking to leave. And, finally, I'd definitely be rocking the boat a bit by applying to ""skip a level"" in the hierarchy and that might not sit well with some people and turn into gossip.

16dlrqm,Choosing between government vs industry offers?,"I'm a recent college grad and I'm really grateful to be in a position to decide between 2 data analyst offers (1 in a state government agency, 1 in a small startup) after many months of job searching. But I'm struggling to decide which to take. My long-term goal is to go to law school (am applying now) and to try to become a professor (yes I know it's a crapshoot).

State Government
- Pros: The work aligns exactly with what I want to do in law school. Could make useful connections for the future. And hopefully make a positive impact? Very good work-life balance, vacation, max 40 hours a week. 
- Cons: Pays less by $40k. In-person. Possible bureaucracy and dysfunction - there has been a lot of attrition in the agency since covid.

Industry startup
- Pros: Pays way more (see above). Fully remote. Opens the door to better career options in case the law thing doesn't work out (the market for lawyers is trash). Probably less bureaucracy as it's a startup. 
- Cons: Working up to 60 hrs/week. Work is OK but not sure I'd want to do it for more than a few years.

Another concern is burning a bridge with a potential employer if I leave for school after only 1-2 years. Not sure how problematic that would be...

16dkisy,Made a Huge Mistake at Work - Do I just quit? How do I come back from this?,"

A long story I will try to condense as much as possible. I work at a small-ish (75 person) advertising agency as the only agency communications manager. I handle our company’s social media channels, LinkedIn, website updates, press releases, awards entries, corporate events, etc.

I started in this role in October 2022 and it has been a huge learning curve. Handover document left to me was not in good shape, I have virtually no personal life to keep up with work projects. I am often working 9-10pm and weekends to keep up and definitely am not compensated enough for my efforts. I have requested and made my case for an assistant or coordinator to help me with the workload.

The real problem: our biggest awards entry of the year had a deadline first week of August. We had 20 individual entries going at once that I was working on alone. In the middle of everything, I was having a health issue that happened to hit at just the wrong time. I was working many nights till midnight to try and hit this deadline since late June. I was in contact with a rep at the awards company who said they would be extending their deadline due to others still working on entries but didn’t say till when. They closed it before I could finish and although I begged them to reopen it up (we were paying $20k for these submissions) they won’t.

I had a panic attack. This was my biggest project of the year and I feel like a failure even though I killed myself for it. I’m terrified to tell my bosses that we won’t be able to enter this year. They will be so angry and I honestly don’t know the outcome: I could be put on disciplinary action or let go. I already know I am unhappy there…do I put in my notice now before I tell them? I know that seems dramatic but I can’t even imagine what going forward will look like for me.

My boss sent me an IM telling me to meet them in a conference room.

I walked to the conference room and sat down. They came in 30 seconds later and said  
""I regret to inform you, but your position has been eliminated""

Long pause..... ""Haha! I'm just kidding!"" Longer pause..... ""It's a joke.... You know that it's a joke right?""

  
I was honestly appalled and did not really say anything else. Then, they proceed to give me a 5% raise and they shook my hand.

This caused some internal grief for me and I started  talking to some different supervisors within our department. Eventually, I talked to a canary who told their boss. The canaries boss is the same ""rank"" as my boss.

16dhqzk,When to quit and take PTO?,"I want to give my two weeks notice on Monday but there are two problems:

1. Usually there are 3 of us working together (me, tech 1 (my boss), tech 2). Tech 2 started their new job last week, and finding/hiring a replacement takes 2 months (huge background check), so my boss is absolutely burried in work, he really needs me to be on top of things. If I leave, it takes 2 months to find a replacement, and my boss is all alone. Ik it shouldn’t be my concern but I have an amazing boss who gets lots of pressure from his boss, I would hate to do this to him

2. I have 4 days of vacation left, if I don’t use them they won’t pay it out afterwards. Idk if I ask for vacation time first (which my boss would probably not approve given the fact that were only 2 people rn) or give my two weeks then ask for vacation time, or if it’s better to leave it

I have absolutely no interest in this job, just needed some money after uni, I really wanna quit on Monday (I’ve been doing freelancing so im gonna do that full-time now) but it seems so hard to do.

16dhjmt,Fired after a PIP. What's my takeaway and how do I address this in my job search?,"So to set the stage, I've been working at this company for 10 years.  First job out of college.  I was often rated as an excellent achiever by my manager and promoted twice to the highest level of my job category.  A few years ago, I was moved under the group supervisor I had been working with.  We had what I thought was a good personal and daily relationship but each performance review started getting worse, mostly due to a long-term project taking too long to complete.

It all culminated in a PIP earlier this year with the goals to improve attendance (I did as soon as it was brought up as a problem), bring up my cross training to 70% (I expressed concern that the timeline was very short with my other responsibilities but managed to reach it a week after the PIP due date), and finish out two instrument qualifications and work instruction prep that I had been working on.

The last bit was especially frustrating as there were multiple steps that needed to be reviewed and signed off by the various stakeholders.  I was finishing my plans and reports but certain people were taking weeks or months to even give feedback despite following up and letting my supervisor know.  The end of the PIP rolls around and I'm told by my supervisor and the plant manager (my original boss in between them was excluded) that I'm not meeting the requirements of the position and prepare for consequences.  I argued that I felt I had improved and was being held up by forces outside my control and to consider a demotion over termination.  A week later I was unceremoniously fired.

I've received words of encouragement and recommendations from my first boss and some other co-workers, but I'm wondering how I should address this in my job search and what I should be learning from the experience.  Do I even need to say I was fired, or can I say I was laid off?",PhoenixReborn,37,0.8600000143051147,55,1694196227,2023-09-08 18:03:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16dhjmt/fired_after_a_pip_whats_my_takeaway_and_how_do_i/,9,2023
16dhjkz,Should I start looking for a new job?,"My company has been firing a lot of people over the last few months, mostly because of poor performance but also one was let go just because they had nothing for them to work on and didn't want to keep paying their salary. My manager assured me that I'm safe and that they want to hire more people like me, but I'm finding myself in a position now where I basically have nothing to work on. One project is put on hold because of negotiations, another isn't set to start for another couple weeks. Despite the reassurance, I'm starting to worry that I'll be next.

In addition to all of this, the company is moving in a direction that no longer matches my skillset, so I'm not sure what I'd even be able to bring to the table in the future.

Also, I started 2 years ago and am making less than the average starting salary.

The problem is, I work in tech, and the job market is shit right now. Should I trust what my manager said and stay in my role so as not to lose my spot in a competitive market?

I'm a 28 year old that is currently working in a sales job. I get paid decently but I have ambition to do more and make more money. I have about 7 years experience in my current industry and about 3 years in my sales job. I don't hate sales but I was sure that I could make more doing something else. I recently started going back to school and just finished a liberal arts associates degree. I think I want to go forward and get a buisness bachelor's degree but I'm not sure what to do. I like the idea of a marketing degree but I'm not sure how lucrative they can really be. I thought about finance and accounting too but I'm not even sure what kind of jobs are available for people with those degrees (other than accountant lol). A lot of people say CS is the only field worth going in to but i really don't think I'm book smart enough to get threw the program and I'm not sure if I would enjoy software development. 

The other issue I run in to is the prospect of starting over at a lower wage. I do okay now but I dont want to take a step back. I make about $55k now but all the entry level jobs for these paths (other than cs) seem to start quite a bit lower.

I didnt realize this until I started my carriers in North America.

I know the RULE of dont discus, Religion-Politics-Money in the workplace, you are expected to be professional and focus on the values your company and just work.

I honestly feel this is a backdated view, being said that,

I often found North American, takes your view on Liberalism or Conservatism very seriously, you are immediately seen as RED-flag and your future in that company is over.

I honestly find this is very much Stone-Age mentality.

The culture I come from, discussing Politics, Money, Religion had zero to no affect on friendships or carrier, but I guess every culture is different.

Do you agree that there should be room for open discussion any-where after all 1/3 of our entire life is work the other 1/3 is sleep and the remaining 1/3 is me time.  


Finally I would like to ask, do you treat your colleagues or friends differently for their views do you stop promoting them, is views that much personal to you?  


I honetly feel, it should not matter what a person believes in as long has his decision does not harm himself or others. I am talking about compasison!

16ddrei,Career change in mid 30s?,"Hey everyone,

I have spent the last 10+ years working in Finance as an analyst. Currently situated in Eastern Europe.

My current employer is about to be acquired by another company and there is a 90-99% chance that our team is going to be laid off. As I am updating my CV and getting ready for another job hunt (changed companies \~2 years ago) I am thinking whether I shouldn't think about a career change so I am looking for some advice/recommendations from people who have walked that path.

The reason for that is that there are quite a few people in our team and the job market for Analysts in my country is rather small so there is a fair chance that I will be out of a job for 6+ months (I have savings and will probably get a few months wages on exit, so that wouldnt be much of a problem), but since I will be hunting for more than a few months I started thinking about other opportunities, outside of Finance, so Im just curious:

Has anyone changed careers in their mid-thirties? 

How hard was it? 

What area did you change into?

Do you regret it? 

As I currently have no idea where to relocate - are there any careers that can I can transition into with 3-6-12 months of preparation that have the chance to pay off 2-3 years down the line?

16dcs2w,"Accepting a leadership director role, sometimes I wonder if it's best to be in a less demanding role?","I'm accepting a director position at a new company, which is not all too different than what I currently do. I'm currently Associate director at my current company, however, the company I work for has been acquired so there's a ton of grey area which led me to find another job. 

My current company had a great culture, and I had revenue share incentives in which the new company (who bought my current company) took away and didn't give me a raise - I still do feel bad for putting in my 2 weeks but it is what it is. After about 2 weeks of searching, I found this new gig which is exciting but has a lot of responsibility. I'll be head of a department, and overseeing up to 7 people and helping improve processes, and sticking to budget/timeline SLA's etc. The new company has a lot of incentive bonuses which seem feasible for me to hit based on rev goals with the team, and any projects that I am managing. It will be quite a big pay increase if we hit these goals, which can net me $160k/annually - although bonus goals do concern me as it's not promised I'll see those; my salary will essentially remain the same as my current company.

I guess my main concern is the amount of expectations leadership roles have. This new role has me managing more people, more work, etc and relearning a new process at a new company. It's all things I can do, I just worry about stumbling or failing, etc. Sometimes I think how much better it would be to just be under the radar and not managing people. I'm a good manager, but it always sucks when someone else's mistakes are also your mistakes. 

Thinking about all the expectations with accepting roles like these is always scary. I feel like I'll do great, but there's always a voice in the back of my head that says otherwise. I've been in leadership roles since 2019, and never get offers from other companies to be anything other than in management anymore. I'm 28 with a high school diploma but have tons of experience - I'm always managing 30 - 40 year olds which is an interesting dynamic.

Anyways, I think it's really positive.. I'm just nervous.

\- Accepted new gig

\- Scared of not meeting expectations

\- sometimes wish I was in a more 'under the radar' position

I wake up with anxiety every single day and recently had to call out because I had a really bad anxiety attack. I am not sleeping at all. It was also revealed to me that at some point the clinic had several different positions which were filled but as people left, they decided to condense all of those job duties down into my one position, so it is literally only just me. They hadn’t even revealed to me that I will have to be working 12 hour shifts on multiple days throughout the week, which is not doable for me because I am a student which we talked about in my interview. I have even had to let go of some of my hobbies because I am not finding the time to juggle everything throughout the week.

she is aware that this is my first job & has given me very little training & expected me to be able to work 8 hour shifts day after day. i feel so stuck. i know i should try push through the week to get used to the job & get to know it better but my experience so far has honestly given me no desire to continue.

16d6jia,I need to stop helping other people,"I am currently working in a well paid job (the highest paid job I've ever had) that is extremely draining.

I do my best to help them. They have no idea how hard I work, they just know that I cost a lot.

Yet I am stuck in my own life. I have no partner, I barely get to see my friends (I'll see them a few times a year if I'm lucky) and I'm exhausted all the time. My home is a mess. I don't have any energy or motivation to clean and I'm hardly at home anyway. I barely get any sunlight.

I feel like I'm helping other people achieve my dreams but my own life is slipping away.

I'm doing this for money, but starting to wonder if it's worth it. I don't know how long I'm supposed to put my own life on hold.

16d4y97,Could I try to get a ‘pay rise’ while waiting on a conditional offer?,"Details:

I got a conditional offer for a new job for 3k more (lol I know shit but at least it would allow me to live slightly more comfortably).

Been in this job for 5 months almost passed my probation and every 1:1 I’ve had I got great reviews and scoring, so alway 100\100.

Now, I hate this job as it’s not for me as someone with ADHD, the team is toxic af and also I am paid very little. 

I’ve been trying to get away for 3/4 months but only just received an offer, unfortunately it’s a conditional offer based on if they find me a client to work with, which means I could wait months before accepting this job/could not get this new job at all. 

Should I say something to my current job and ask for a promotion being that I received an offer for 3k more? I’m a bit hesitant as if they say no to the promotion I could not start immediately with the other job so it could sound ‘fake’ and I would have to stay in an environment where they judge me as a liar.",wereturtlerich,0,0.33000001311302185,17,1694162060,2023-09-08 08:34:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16d4y97/could_i_try_to_get_a_pay_rise_while_waiting_on_a/,9,2023

16d31wq,I wasted another year,"Looklike i have wasted another year should have studied rather then doing job.

I m22 just graduated in June 2021 and started preparing for government exams. As per parents advice & society.

Then, based on someone's reference, I received a private desk job offer cleared interview & selected
November 2021. 

The job was not hectic, assistant type or deo type i say with okish pay & have  mental peace, but just far from home. (4 hours of total travel time +9hr work), I tried to study while working but  didn't work, and after 4 months, I left studying for exams. And started enjoying life.

I am entitled until January 2023. Then my contract was not extended, and I was laid off from my job.

Now all i have to restart again.
I hv come again where i left after graduation.

I got depressed as I hv started earning and was not in mental state to take money from my parents for my expenses.

And I also feared from the job market that I would get a job or not, as previous job experience doesn't count anywhere and there is a 1% chance of getting a government job due to excessive competition.

In know people who started preparing for government couldn't secure one and are now jobless at the age of 28 and hunting for private jobs.

So i decided to go in aviation as refered by some people in society working in aviation so. I interviewed and got selected in one as a fresher with decent pay. I was happy; it was near my home and required less travel time, but it's a rotational shift job. (I've been working the night shift for four months now. 2.5 hour total for travel and 9.5hr shift)

I didn't study but filled out at least three government exam forms and couldn't give them due to the company policy of no leaves in the first 3 months of service. My exam registration fees got wasted being a Gen/OBC, and I didn't try to take leave forcefully as I knew I couldn't clear an exam without studying.

But now, in August, I was again offered simialr job as earlier one. Again i cleared interview & willing to join, but the joining period is one week. The i couldn't decide And I lost it.

My current job was good for the first 4 months, but after started getting workload my mental peace is started getting destroyed and then I decided to resign within 6 months, so last month is August to resign  but after losing to join offered job, I fell ill and got depressed, 

and now I don't want to continue my current job now. I've passed my 6-month probation period. As per company policy, I am on probation until I get a confirmation letter. Even after passing 6 months.

Now I've given resign, and they are not accepting my resignation and telling me to give 3 months notice. I told them I am on probation, and on probation, employees have to serve a 1-month notice period. They are not accepting it and saying you are not on probation as you have completed six months.


I have decided not to continue working the night shift because I got underweight, couldn't eat properly, and didn't have enough time to eat and do other work.


Today, many government opportunities are coming, and I want to fill them and start studying again. As my parents and I personally want a government job now, 

Some of my friends whom with i started preparation for govt jobs got selected and living tension free life (job security)
And getting more pay. Less work
First they got jealous and now i got 😅

I've lost all desire to work in the private sector. And I am not enjoying life as much as in my previous job. What's the point of earning if you can't enjoy your life and spend life in tension and anxiety given by your job?

At last mai ye soch ke pagal hora hu ki mai kese bhul  gya k august mai resign dena tha.jb soch rakha tha dene ka.😭

At last i have to say corporate mncs shows young fresher that their life is set after working here but reality is different as most corporate workers say u became bandua majdoor of company u cant take leaves without giving proof 
Notice period
Work load 
Choti choti galtio pr warning letter termination letter no job security
Dar dar k kaam kro 

And my friend who selected in gov job i hv been to his office he's just getting salary just for putting attendance &.  getting more weekoffs + govt holidays.

 Now 1 have 2 options 

1: Should I leave without giving notice period? And start studying & focus on health 

2: or if i couldn't get 1 month's notice, should I continue until November, then give my resignation, complete 3 months notice, and exit with 1 year of experience and forget everything & then restart from scratch.

I last i hv to say i just want mental peace ryt now.",A29476,1,1.0,0,1694155316,2023-09-08 06:41:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16d31wq/i_wasted_another_year/,9,2023

16d2utn,How to quit remote internship after 1 week,"Applied for a remote internship about 8 months ago thinking I wasn't going to still be at my current job (contract position I love). New internship (started last week) is incredibly disorganized and I realized I don't have time for it anyway because my contract work is really ramping up. Not planning on putting it on my resume and I do not want to be stuck there for 2 weeks.

Is an email enough? They know I have a second job. Just to say like ""upon self reflection, I've realized that I don't have the time or means to deliver what this internship demands. It would be irresponsible of me to continuously put your internship second to my preexisting responsibilities, and while I'm grateful for the accomodations that you all have made for everyone's schedules, I can't say with full confidence that I will be able to contribute to an acceptable level.  Thank you for accepting me into your program and I wish you the best of luck with the rest of the talented interns you've selected. Please accept this as a formal notice of my resignation effective immediately (insert resignation date here). Thank you for the opportunity and best of luck for the future""

It's not a demotion either, not as far as pay and position are concerned, but the department is more focused on certain aspects of the job I currently have, and those aspects are my least favorite part of my job now. The question is not should I accept or refuse, but rather, HOW do I refuse? I have a measly 3 days to tell them my decision, but the friends and family I've spoken to give conflicting advice. Should I just tell them up front that I quit? Or should I accept, and quit later? The second option feels disingenuous to me, but obviously I've got bills to pay. And as far as notice is concerned, I've been burned in the past by that. One job, I gave notice (verbally only, my mistake) only for them to fire me later that same day.

16czz9k,Choosing the Right Career Path?,"Hi guys! I'm feeling a little bit lost career-wise right now, would appreciate some pointers.

**Little bit about me:** I'm in my mid-20s, took on project management leadership roles in uni, did case competitions and marketing/advertising as well. Joined a healthtech startup upon graduating, then joined a media/marketing company which eventually led me to transition into independent content creation. Money is VERY good, brands are actually reaching out for paid content, but I see this as a for-now thing and I'm terrified of the lack of security in this industry. So I've invested in it as a sideline (also now co-own a production company).

Now I feel like I want a full-time job that'll put me on a good trajectory for the future. I've received a lot of offers from industry friends, who want me as an onscreen talent, PR, or whatever, but my top two are things outside what I've done so far:

**Option A:** I received a Product Marketing position offer from an up-and-coming tech startup that's well-recognized in our country. People say the culture is amazing, and Glassdoor reviews are stellar. Luckily, I was chosen for the one slot out of 200+ applicants after my pitch,  so there's that. The benefits also seem great - as well as the people who I'll be working with (it's an all-new team that I've had some talks with). 20-minute commute once a week, the rest are WFH. I'm a pretty sociable guy so the culture is really selling to me. 

I'm passionate about marketing, consumer insights, and the product as well. I have a feeling I'd thrive more naturally here. 

However, the pay is average, and the job is well within my comfort zone. I know that if I do leave the industry and come back when I've decided to be sure about it, I may still get the same or even better opportunities.

**Option B:** This is the riskier bet: an offer as an Associate at a Boutique Management Consulting firm. I've always looked up to this career, even in my case competition days. A lot of my top competitors back then ended up in MBB. I never thought I'd get an offer from that industry, but here we are.

For some reason, I enjoyed doing the tests and case studies for this more than the GTM plan I had to produce for Option A. The pay is 20% better, and my contract states that every hour over a 40-hour workweek is billable to overtime. It's fully remote - and the people I know who work here say that it's a demanding but fulfilling job. Most employees working in this company have been there for 2+ years (based on LinkedIn), which is a good sign IMO.

I'm also very interested in the field. Just never considered it 'cos I always thought it was ""above me"" or something. So if I do join, it's going to be a lot of GROWTH. 

How often am I going to get an offer for an industry like this, right? However, the cons are the notorious work-life balance differences, as well as my social self probably wilting in a Full WFH arrangement. Also, at the moment, I have no desire to give my life up to the MBB lifestyle. So I'm thinking that this career could be my perfect exit back into a higher position in tech or so.

16cvrt7,My manager told me that my observation that they have been late or calling out more than usual “hurt their feelings.”,"I generally have a pretty good relationship with my manager (I am a Team Lead and have meetings with them often) but I know they don’t seem to take feedback well so I have to super sugarcoat it. Unfortunately, this can sometimes mean that they don’t see the feedback as a serious or urgent issue and therefore don’t really do anything to change their behavior. 

In the last month, they have been more than a few minutes late to almost every shift and call out about once a week. They actually haven’t worked a five day week since July. It is common for managers in this industry to be contracted to work 55 hours, im pretty sure my boss hasn’t hit 40 in weeks. 

I brought this up at one of our leadership meetings, and they said that because of issues in their personal life, they are at max capacity and can’t take on anything more. The issue with that is that many things have begun to fall through the cracks at work and I find my boss seems to think of me as a stand-in manager when they’re out (which is more and more often), despite the fact that I am not a manager- assistant or otherwise and make only $2/more an hour while they are salaried at >70k. 

Furthermore, they told me that it hurt their feelings that I pointed out their hours and that they felt I was “holding them to a higher standard than the hourly employees who are sometimes a little late to clock in.” 

None of my hourlies are as consistently late or calling out as much as my manager and despite my manager not denying this, they are clearly very upset with me for bringing it up. 

Should I just start job hunting? I like most other aspects of the job and am recovering from being let go with no notice from my previous job so I’m really trying to establish longevity on my resume.

16cv8pz,"Want To Change Careers, Don't Want To Back to School","I am 48F, no degree, but twenty years experience in Mortgage post closing. I also have ADHD and find myself extremely unmotivated in my current position (document QC). It's just staring at pdfs all day; it's the worst. So I'm looking at two different careers that I can move to with just a certification: Project Management or Data Analyst. The thing is, I see both careers having the same problem as my current one, them being understimulating.

The question I have is:  is there another career I can get into with a certification that I'm guaranteed to find a job in, but would be mentally stimulating? I lean towards web design and starting my own business. I also don't think I'd mind doing that as an employee. Is that a feasible career path right now? UX or UI by themselves don't interest me.

16curw9,"25yo, 7 years as a diesel mechanic and considering changing careers. Pay cut, uncertainty, and letting down family makes me hesitant.","I went to a trade school for diesel trucks at 18. Since then, I’ve worked in a few different jobs fixing different equipment. I currently have a well-paying job with a good pension plan.

The more I work as a mechanic, the more I realize I don’t want to do this for a living for the rest of my life. I don’t enjoy it like I did when I was 18 working on my own car. It’s never fun or rewarding for me now. I’ve considered changing careers in the past, but I’ve been entertaining the idea more seriously recently. 

Obviously this is a very scary idea after spending the first 7 years of adulthood invested into this career path. I have a student loan I’m still paying and ’ve spent $20k+ on tools. Part of me sees these things and thinks it would all be a waste of time and a money to completely switch careers. I know my parents would not approve at all and I’d probably never hear the end. Another part of me says I’m still so young, why wait? 

I’m considering pursuing music (sound engineering) or culinary arts. The thought of taking a huge pay cut while pursuing one of these paths kills me. I know there’s probably no way around it, but it’s still a factor that makes me hesitant.

I’ve been told several times that I’d be a good teacher, and I’ve thought about it often. 

Some things to consider however:
I wouldn’t want to be a math or science teacher specifically (although I could teach a few classes if necessary). I’m pretty good with English and social studies, as well as the other classes (depending on what they are of course). I have social anxiety, but I’m working on it.

16crvpq,Advice in medical office jobs,"Hi, F32. it's been a month since I've moved from Miami to tampa and for the life of me I can't get hired. I get call backs and interviews, up to a second interview and then nothing. I'm running out of ideas on what else to do.
 
Before moving I worked in a wound care office for 5 years. I coordinated referrals, patients and nurses, basically managed the whole office for a while before they hired more people to help (it's a small company). during COVID, I took an online coding and billing course, hoping I could get some coding experience in an environment I was comfortable in. 

I completed it by the skin of my teeth bc the teacher SUCKED, she had no idea what she was teaching. I ended up learning bc of the schools tutor ( professor was so bad I had to double check my tests bc she would give me a 68, not explain why and after I had the tutor check my test I would get an 85...) 

after the year in school my class went from 30 students to 5 (including myself) the final semester was supposed to get us ready for the certification, but we were all so clueless that the new teacher we had, had to basically crash course us remaining students. I did coding for my office with the biller, I even memorized the prep book, I thought I got it. 

Anyways I didn't pass the CCS, I was like 20 points from the mark. I have ADHD and I ran out of time...

I've tried to get receptionist jobs, referral coordinator jobs, coding, billing, anything and I get nothing. I would think that having the coding knowledge would make me desirable. 

I was thinking of taking the CPC instead but it's not with AHIMA and that means I would have to pay another 300 for membership, pay 400, for the test, get the specific prep book that's like 250, and I have to re Buy every coding book (CPT, ICD10 and PCS)  I have for the test because last years, isn't acceptable anymore (even though it's the same shit) each book is another 100 dollars. 

At this point I'm so frustrated, felt like this was all just a fucking waste of time and money on a class that did nothing for me bc I didn't end up with my certification and I NEED that certification to get a job even though I know how to code. I feel like I have this useless knowledge that I thought would help me find something better and stable. 

Btw I know it wasn't smart to take the CCS right out of the program and should have done the CPC since it's easier. But since I spent so much money on this program I wanted to just get it over with and get ""THE"" certification because CCS is apparently more desirable. I also have a bachelor's degree. 

Any advice would be great, I don't know what else to do and now that I've moved I don't have the funds to take the CPC or retake this course with another school. I'm about to just abandon the idea of being a coder.",thatonegothunicorn,1,1.0,0,1694123853,2023-09-07 21:57:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16crvpq/advice_in_medical_office_jobs/,9,2023

16cqwtj,Is it a good sign or red flag that my manager wants to hire someone with a similar role that reports to me?,"In a my team meeting it was randomly announced without notice to me we have head count for a new hire to support my role.

For some reason I always feel threatened when this happens and think ""just give me raise instead and I'll do more"" or ""they want to quietly replace me"".

Are they trying to phase me out for someone cheaper? 

Or is this a good sign they think I am management potential? 

Should I ask for a raise?

I have managed contractors since starting, but not full time employees.

Is this technically a role expansion that might require a new title or pay bump?

16cop48,Doing three jobs at once?,"Hello Everyone,

I started my first graphic design job at this marketing company 4 months ago, so I’m fairly new. Everything has been smooth sailing and chill. I get my work done and respond to emails fast. They tell me I do a great job, and I really do a great job.

Then out of nowhere my bosses told me to create a work log for me and the guy working under me. I’m pretty sure they asked to see how busy we get. We pretty much get work from art requests from the sales people in the company. After they saw me getting about 3-4 hours of down time everyday, they asked me to be a “team player” and help warehouse people bc they’re bock logged right now. Of course, designing is still my main priority. I’m gonna have to assist them in my down time until they hire a new person who can do the job. 

The help isn’t that complicated, all I gotta do is email follow ups and that’s it. So I thought it’s no big deal I’ll do it. Few weeks later, one of my boss NOW wants me to do a CSR training which is Customer Service Representative. Pretty much what the sales people do. And again I’m gonna have to assist sales people now until they hire a new person who can do the job. 

I’m not sure what to think or do about all of this. I didn’t sign up to be a sales person nor do warehouse work. Is this justifiable? What do you guys think?

16cod7k,How do you really make a name for yourself in the working world as a generalist?,"I have an environmental studies degree. I currently work in IT as a database analyst but I’ve done everything from social media management to technical writing to being a park ranger. 

I have ADHD and I’m just stoked on everything. It’s hard for me to stay focused if things aren’t constantly shifting. Simultaneously though, I get overstimulated and burnt out a bit more easily than the average person so I still need a work place that somewhat respects work/life balance. 

Every year or two, I get the itch to try out something new. But even if it’s somewhat adjacent to my current position and skill set, I either get lowballed or passed over completely. I try so hard to make a case for the directly related and transferable skills, but it has not helped me get offers that at the very least match what I make now. Even a small pay cut would be fine, but I’m being offered positions that sometimes pay up to 15/hr less than what I make now which is not financially tenable. I’m in my 30s and can’t afford to completely start over. 

I’m working on some Google certs that relate to my skills and interests and am also in the process of applying for grad school (online programs so I can keep working). In applying for jobs, I’m using premium to reach out to hiring managers directly. I’m also bookmarking companies I especially want to work for and in addition to applying for what’s available, I’m sending my resume and elevator pitch to their recruiters. I’m reaching out to recruiters at staffing firms in my industry areas as well. I figured it can’t hurt to get my name out there as much as possible. 

Is there anything else I can do to set myself apart? I’m thinking in terms of ways I can brand and market myself as a generalist. Could that help? Or just anything that will help me stand out as someone with a variety of different experiences. 

Obviously it’s hard to give specific advice about exactly what I’m looking to move into for my next job, but I don’t want this to be too much longer. Essentially I’m interested in being a data analyst or eventually a data scientist after I finish grad school. But with my environmental background, I’d love to work for an environmentally focused startup. Maybe an environmental consulting firm if they’re financially sound enough to pay a living wage. 

Even though what I currently do involves a lot of data analysis, that’s not strictly what I do and  the market seems highly saturated with would be analysts at the moment so I’ve found it difficult to set myself apart.",Archimediator,0,0.5,2,1694116086,2023-09-07 19:48:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16cod7k/how_do_you_really_make_a_name_for_yourself_in_the/,9,2023

16cntkr,So I turned down a job interview...,"...and now I'm ruminating. I've never done this before, and it's left me feeling a little off. Maybe because it goes against the grain of the accepted wisdom. Maybe because it means I actively chose to remain in a job that has me burnt out. Maybe I got it wrong.  
  
They replied to my withdrawal and offered their regrets, saying they agreed I might not have been what they were looking for but they thought I might bring a lot to the role. Very nice of them but I turned down for two reasons.  
  
It's all well and good someone recognising my strengths. Promising in fact. It doesn't equate to accepting what I won't bring to the role.  
  
In a government setting, fairness is the name of the game. That means the job is predetermined and I was invited to be assessed on what I don't offer. Even not in that context I'm not sure there's any benefit to convincing someone they don't know what they want.  
  
Obviously it's nice to be in this position and I'll eventually learn to live with my decisions, but it doesn't feel great. I wondered if other people had similar experiences. Did you convince an employer to hire you instead of what they set out to hire? Was that a good thing or a bad thing?

16cnl2u,Is it ever a good idea to tell your manager you’re interviewing at another company/firm?,"I’m considering telling my manager that I’m interviewing for a job at another large global firm, similar to mine.  

Because I want them to be prepared for my departure - I’m scheduled to run a lot of projects over the next few months, including acting as my manager when she’s goes out of office for four months.  

I also want to leave on as good of terms as possible, and want to give them an opportunity to counter.  They probably won’t be able - the pay, title and position are all significantly more.  But it would be ideal if they could.  

Furthermore, they’ve been good to me - created a role where I thrive, handling projects I pointed out we needed, giving me tons of autonomy to build it, and giving me tons of recognition, visibility and potential for growth.   

But I know one cardinal rule is never tell your boss you’re leaving until you have an offer letter because you’ll be judged and besmirched you if you stay.  

I have a great relationship with my boss - we talk about a lot of things most employees / bosses don’t.  I know she would appreciate the heads up.  Though I’m not stupid and know it’s possible it ends up used against me. 

I would say something like, “I don’t want to leave but I have this potential offer I had to explore given the tremendous opportunity.  I would much prefer to stay here, but if I end up leaving I wanted to be transparent in hopes for giving you time to prepare.”

At my old school I was a history major and an astronomy minor. Now I am an astronomy major but my new school has all these gen ed requirements that make me have to retake some courses and I can’t graduate in less than 3 years. At my old school I was enough credits ahead that I could graduate a semester earlier if I wanted.  But since I have to take half the credits for my major/minor at my current university to graduate from here I have a long ways to go.

I also have taken a lot of credits relating to a environmental/natural resources track. I really like animals and have considered zoology, ecology, and wildlife biology. I am not too far in being close to getting a B.S. degree, as I only have taken one semester of biology and calculus 1.

Anyways I am so lost on what to do. I am close to getting a B.A. degree, but worry that it will be a useless achievement and present me with career options of none I would like. I don't want to be a lawyer or teacher. I also want to make enough money to support myself and my girlfriend who I intend to marry. She thinks I will hate any job I get and I should choose to do something that at least will make enough money.

I got econ/MBA education and a pretty pragmatic, highly analytical yet creative mind. I love having a lot of comms on my job, dealing with people, it feels extremely satisfying to help others with info/connections to other departments, or just participate in high level meetings having a lot to add on strategy and info I got throughout the company, make sure everyone is appreciated and having fun.  
  
I love problem solving, especially when it demands a lot of analysis, splicing the data I have, finding insights and how to really make all the dots connect. I also always have an urge to improve the processes and imperfections I see or feel within the operations. Most business cases I get I crack super naturally as if I feel like all the actually relevant info is always highlighted by default.

Made a new account because I’m aware that my boss is on Reddit. 

I’m current in a mid-senior position at my organization which is a fairly large European company. 

My boss is this quite experienced but extremely lazy. He’s earning a really good salary and doesn’t quite have any intentions of moving out anytime soon unless it’s a very well compensated promotion. My problem is that he doesn’t do any work and dumps everything on me. He knows I’m good at my job and diligent because I’m waiting for a promotion so I won’t mess things up which allows him to relax and collect his cheques. 

I can’t really call him out on it because of his seniority but I’ve also seen him do a few shady things that would normally be against company policy but could perhaps be explained away with the right connections.

There is the possibility that some action could be taken if I report him and of course this really small chance that I get his job if he goes.

16cio3o,Does a job like this exist?,"I'm not particularly good in any one thing and I really don't know what I should study/what my goals are and what career I want. So I just envisioned which kind of job could suit me and i'm wondering if a job even exists like this lmao i'm assuming not -> I was imagining like a job where there is a lot of team work and coming up with solutions and like generally creativity and planning. Kind of like a lot of easy and more ""superficial stuff"" with like a wide range of tasks like more like promoting something like lets say some product so like taking gorgeous photos of the item, planning posters for it and decorating a space where it will be show-cased. I don't know like surrounding yourself with coming up with ideas for this thing and planning pretty things for it. I feel like i'm going to get no answers and also like this isn't an actual job haha. But like I don't want it to be too advertising heavy like studying econ or not too social mediaa heaavy so i constantly have to know every current trend and follow everyone on social media and be impacted by that toxcicity everyday. And I want something artsy/creative involved but i'm not good at any physical arts like painting and I don't want to specialize in photography either. Nor do I want to do a super focused degree on graphic design, instead like have a job where a bit of everything is involved of the things I just listed, you know? So I can make things aesthetic and add my own ideas but work with others but also always have new projects not always surrounding the same things so you always come up with new ideas. This is so vague i'm sorry, although I don't think anyone will answer anyway HAHA.

16cilvw,Do I have a case for unemployment?,"6 months ago I took a consulting job. I’ve been working well with them until 3 weeks ago. The work dried up and I’ve been asking for more to no avail. I’m responsible for logging my hour appropriately. So for three weeks I billed my client what I worked and the rest of time spent went to “bench” (its fulltime w2 with a 40 hour weekly commitment). 

For two weeks they paid me appropriately with bench time. This week they rejected my bench time and removed it from my timesheet. I’ve asked for more work but they won’t commit to 40 hours billable, and they want my 40 hours availability but I can only bill for 10 this week. Plus they are now saying they won’t pay the other 30.

Do I have a case for unemployment due to reduced hours? Do I have a case for a complaint to the department of labor for non payment?

16cgg5g,Looking to Change Careers / Get out of Graphic Design,"36M Here. I think I'm having a mid-life crisis. I've been web / graphic designer for over 10 years now, and I'm feeling extremely burnt out with my career / day job. After doing this much time in design, I've become so burnt out and frustrated for many reasons. I think I hit a salary cap and in my current position there is zero room for growth. If I stay here, I'll always just be the graphic designer. I'm more ambitious than this and I really want to find a career where I can make 85-100k.

I'm not sure I want to continue with design career wise and pursue art director or creative director roles. I'm wondering if any other designers out there have realized that the income potential for designers hits a wall, and transitioned to different more lucrative careers? I was thinking about getting back into more specialized web design, AI, or maybe a complete pivot to something that's not a desk job. I could also revisit my LLC / Freelance with the intent of starting my own creative agency.

You should know I've also become extremely bitter about working for my current company, as we worked full remote for 2 years and have since RTO. I'm not going to go down the rabbit hole about all of the reasons I hate this, but financially it costs me a lot of money (gas, time spent commuting, etc).

Over the past 6-8 months, I've probably sent out over 500 applications, maybe more, for remote design gigs in the 70-90k range. I've only had 3 or so interviews in that time (one of them I went through 5 interviews, it came down to me and another candidate, and they selected the other. Very disheartening). On a high level, I do not like how competitive graphic design or design in general has become as a career...I'd like to find something niche in high demand where they are clawing to get me to come work at the company as opposed to the opposite.

Any thoughts or insight? Would be appreciated. I'm also investigating career coaching in my area. Thanks in advance.",Lastraven587,2,0.75,3,1694094756,2023-09-07 13:52:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16cgg5g/looking_to_change_careers_get_out_of_graphic/,9,2023
16cg7av,27 year old insurance processor needing a change,"
Hi all, I am 27m and I'm currently working as an insurance processor at an ever growing larger insurance agency based in the US. For the most part I like my job, I came from a retail and manufacturing background and the difference in type of work is nice and I do enjoy the challenge of learning something more detail focused. But I would definitely say this is not what I want to do for a career. I originally went to university for about 2 1/2 years for a degree in computer science/software engineering. I really liked it for the most part, I thought coding was pretty fun it was like learning a new language that I already kind of understood plus I've always liked working on computers in some way shape or form. Long story short a lot of life stuff happened and I let my grades slip so I just dropped out so I would still have the opportunity to return without having to appeal bad grades. Cue all these years later and I never went back, part of me would still love to return and finish out my degree, but another part of me thinks I just wasn't cut out for it, or I'm just plain stupid, it's important to note that I was also average to relatively above average in the grades area in primary school. I can tell I still love computers and tech in general but the thought of going back or even just starting to plan for it fills me with so much anxiety that I get overwhelmed and just stop focusing on it. In no way am I making excuses but I could use some advice or if someone has felt similarly how did they overcome this negative feedback loop? Anything would be helpful as a lot of the people in my life, minus my GF, didn’t go to college and don’t understand how stressful these decisions can really be.",obscuremuffin,2,1.0,0,1694094136,2023-09-07 13:42:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16cg7av/27_year_old_insurance_processor_needing_a_change/,9,2023
16cfmjz,Can someone give me some advice on what I should do?,"Back story: I have been with this company for about 5 years. Everything has been great up to this last year. I started as inside sales. Within year I accepted a position as a Sales Executive for their sister company that is across the country. Moved my family and my career really took off. Fast forward 3 years, I unfortunately was faced with possibly having to move back home. I talked the CEO and explained the situation and that once my lease is up, 10 months from the point of conversation, I may have to move. Wasn't certain at that point in time. He asked if I could accomplish my job duties remotely with flying out every month for a few days. I agreed that this was possible. He mentioned why pay rent for the next 10 months when it would be cheaper just to break our lease, move back home and carry on with my role remotely. I talked to my wife and we agreed on taking that route, broke our lease which was not cheap my any means, and moved back home.  
  
As soon as I moved back home EVERYTHING changed. My hours increased from 40 to 50 hours, I was taken off salary and my role went from a Sales Executive to a Customer Service Rep for the parent company. Thankfully they kept my ""salary"" the same but it is now hourly based on 50 hours per week. Problem with that is any time I take vacation, time off, or have a holiday off I lose money as I lose the overtime. I have lost thousands of dollars because of this. Taking a week off work cost me nearly $600. The job as Customer Service Rep is way to entry level for me. I need to be able to use my brain and have a role with a sense of accomplishment. I had that, but now I am a damn robot answering phone call after call with no sense of meaning behind it. I am not opposed to working 50 hours per week, but a mind numbing 50 hours in customer service is brutal. This also does effect my work life balance as well. If I would of known that this would be the outcome, I most definitely wouldn't have broke my lease and would have explored other options within the 10 months I had.  
  
I have been trying to find a new job, but working from 6am-4pm makes it difficult for interviewing. I have been on a handful of interviews, but how many ""appointment"" excuses can I make before red flags start going up. I explained this frustration to my manager, but nothing was done. I can take the issue further up the chain but that is a slippery slope as termination is a real possibility with employees who are ""unhappy"". If I lose my job, my family can potentially lose everything as I am the bread winner. I feel very stuck. I am getting desperate and this is effecting my mental health. Any advice would would be very much appreciated.

16cetj2,Feeling totally lost in my late 20s - am I destroying my career by taking an employment gap?,"I’m 27 and have a professional degree in a well-respected field, and aside from a couple internships during college, I’ve only worked 2 different FT jobs after graduating. I got laid off after the first one and eventually quit the second, but I absolutely hated both. 

Getting laid off from the first one felt like a breath of fresh air. I was going to take that time to step back and reevaluate if I really wanted to continue in this career path (with my husbands blessing to do so, especially as we were 1 month from our wedding when I got laid off), but I let a recruiter pressure me into taking a very similar role at another firm, which I was told if I didn’t take (and start 2 weeks before the wedding) that they would pull the offer and I wouldn’t find anything else. My husband was hesitant, but I thought it was the responsible thing to do. I ignored so many red flags from this job. 

I left that job earlier this year, and now I’ve spent the last few months, well, unemployed. My husband and I traveled all summer, and now I dedicate all my time to a business I’m starting and a class that I’m taking in a totally different field.

The whole unemployed, employment gap thing still gives me anxiety though. I’m incredible in my former field, but I’m terrified that if I go back into it that I will be depressed and anxious and want to quit yet again. Part of me would rather not reattempt to try again in case the cycle of job hopping just continues.

Am I wasting this part of my career? I know the grass isn’t always greener when it comes to working in other firms in this industry. I just don’t know if I’m making an extremely stupid decision by not going back to work full time (part time is REALLY hard to get in my industry, but I would if I could).",tulipfiona,5,1.0,6,1694090421,2023-09-07 12:40:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16cetj2/feeling_totally_lost_in_my_late_20s_am_i/,9,2023

16cdhrf,Don't know what to do next,"I finished computer science and engineering a year ago. I chose that degree because I love music, art and technology and I felt I could make a career on interactive media or videogames, or perhaps artificial intelligence. Due to my final project on shaders and graphics, I immediatly got recommended by a professor to join a project he was doing with a local company, for an electrical engineering graphics engine.

A year has passed and I have been looking for a new job for months because I don't like the way the company operates: 

* In the R&D department our opinion does not matter but we have all of the responsibility
* There is not much organization, projects are a bit chaotic.
* Everyone earns low wages, almost the minimum in Spain, despite the highly specialized work we do
* I have to commute almost 90 minutes one way to get to the office, when my job could be done online

Coworkers are great people, and have complained about these issues in the past several times, but managament does not change their mind.

I'm working with technologies no one seems to care about unless you have 5 years of experience in those and more. I work with C++ and OpenGL, Unreal Engine is also a common requirement in job postings but I only know Unity. I am trying to work on side projects with Unity in my spare time to make a portfolio and break into the games industry but I progress very slowly.

There are a few junior jobs abroad but I can't move because of my partner's job here and family. What should I do? Quit my job? Maybe change to more demanded technologies like web or data science? I do like data science too but I don't have experience so no one is going to give me a chance anyway (even having a degree in Computer Science). Study a masters? Keep up with my portfolio?

My previous manager moved to a different, smaller company. We've been talking and I think it would be a great opportunity to move to this company at the beginning of next year. I want to wrap up some important projects at my current company.

here's a bit of the job description from the job advertisement:  
  
As Finance Assistant, you will look after all finance related data for several branded \[locations\] across our portfolio. This will include overseeing the purchase ledger, setting up new vendors and processing invoices, and daily revenue and banking reconciliations. From time to time, you will be asked to support with other key processes within the wider finance team such as month end reporting.  
  
To be successful in this role you will ideally be \[Language\] speaking with working knowledge in local accounting functions although full training will be given. However, we are looking for experience processing volume data. This role would suit someone looking to take their first step into finance and offers the opportunity to develop your skills and progress further within our finance team.  
  
It mentions the salary will be just above minimum for where I live (UK living wage) and full time.

16c8ve3,"Operations Manager looking to progress. Certs (PMP, Lean, Prince2, MBA etc) and other routes.","Hi all,

I'm UK based and currently an operations manager (considered part of the senior team, and I held a head of department role previously at a different company) with about 12 years post uni (business degree) experience, mostly in management across various industries (services delicered to public sector, insurance, HR managed services). Working on a lot of long term b2b contracts. There is potential for a nominal step up at my current organisation but this seems to be continually delayed so in the meantime I was thinking of doing some certifications to reinforce some of my skills. I have a Level 3 Certification in HR but dont think that really counts for much and my career hasn't nor likely will be traditional HR.

My next goal would be to obtain a Head of Dept role with a view to get to C-level eventually, COO or CEO.

From my research so far I've identified the following that seem relevant.

PMP - My role involves a lot of programme management but I have never had formal training on this, just experience. Would be good to obtain some tools and understanding to bolster this and others seem to say this is the defacto certification  in PM. PMI have confirmed via their live chat I would be eligible to apply for the exam.

PRINCE2 - Similar to the above, quick to get and well recognised in the UK. Would be more to appease recruiters who ask for it without knowing what it really is for. 

Lean Six Sigma - Not working in manufacturing or planning to but I have had an interest in lean methodology. I seems less and less people recommend this but interested to get more thoughts based on my situation. I found one thread where a few people were recommending a company who offered Six Sigma and Lean cert exams for a £200 to £400 only and if all you wanted it for was a CV filler and academic understanding this would be sufficient (up to green belt, black belt seems excessive for the industries I'd do in to and the lack of project would he a big issue).

Six Sigma Green belt - As above. Interesting in LSS for the Lean then this for the Six Sigma. 

MBA - These also seem to be on the decline and from what I've read are more about networking than learning. Seems also anything that isnt Oxbridge or LSE is not worth it. However at a 95k price tag I'm not sure if I can justify it either. Anyone got any UK perspective on this as most MBA discussion is US based.

Certified Scrum Master - I'd like to add some Agile to my CV and given I lead the projects and had some exposure to agile at a previous company i worked with wondered if this would be a way of doing it. Any other suggestions welcome!

Questions I have are
1. What do you think of the above list. Any ones you would/wouldn't recommend?
2. Are there any others I could look in to?

The other job told me ti give them about a week to see if I made the round for the second interview. Both jobs seem interesting and like something I see myself doing but I was leaning more towards the environmental job that told me to wait about a week.(so basically still not a forsure that I got the job but I really hope I get it.) should I say yes to the fire alarm job ? Or should I risk it and wait for the other job. Or any advice you guys can give me.

The role is an entry level role(i am the principal engineer in my current role), but i applied cos there arent many options in my home country....

But now..what do i do? Do i go ahead with the interview knowing that the team leader is one of the guys who i didnt get along during our studies? I am a bit scared he might bully me during the interview, or if they hire me. He will also enjoy the fact ill be beneath him. But i would also like to stay in home country. I dont know what to do.

Trying to limit the info I provide to avoid doxxing myself. I am a risk engineer, living in a very large midwest city.  
  
I am currently making a lateral move internally from middle market P&C to our complex property team. I requested pay review as part of the lateral move, and I was told no.  
  
Based on feedback from several colleagues and managers who have worked with me, I seem to have a strong skillset, ability, & engineering background for the property side of the business.  
  
I get hit up a LOT from our competitors for MM P&C roles, but not so much for complex property.  
  
I am in the final stages of the interview/offer process with a competing insurance carrier, middle market P&C. Verbal statement of an offer today, and I think there is a real chance for a 25-30% increase with this job offer. I will update when I know more. That range is what I typically hear from competing firms.  
  
Long term, I think I do want to pursue complex property, especially given my education, skills, background, and location.  
  
The curveball is that both companies are large reputable carriers, good reviews, etc. However my current company is a little bigger, and might have better training for complex property.... MAYBE..... I also don't know that for sure.  
  
Option 1: stay, continue with lateral move to complex property at same compensation, say nothing about competing firm offer.  
  
Option 2: bring up offer (once boxes ticked, background check, etc.), try to get current firm to match it, and continue with complex property at new, higher salary (ideal situation, but has its risks)  
  
Option 3: Move to new firm, hoping for a switch to complex property at some point in the future.  
  
In the linked crosspost, it seems unanimous to take the complex property route, but I'm frustrated with my pay based on what I hear from the market. No I am not hungry, broke, or on the brink of homelessness. But I do not want my compensation to fall behind as I continue to grow.

16c2mwu,Advice on making a big jump to a project management role?,"I'm currently a wildlife biologist/ NEPA specialist at a company I'm fairly happy at, coworkers are great, work is sometimes boring but manageable, etc. The only catch is there aren't really any benefits. I don't get PTO outside of 4 holidays and while I do have the opportunity to contribute to a 401k they don't match anything. The pay is OK at 47k. It's definitely lower than I could get elsewhere but I took this job to be closer to family with ailing health. I am about to get a cert that would vastly increase my qualifications and what I could get paid elsewhere.  The only catch is I'm a contract employee so they can't give me a raise beyond the standard 1% bump they do every contract negotiation. 

My previous job was in private consulting and absolutely awful. The boss would regularly scream at employees, never approving ""unlimited"" PTO, constant unpaid overtime, nights and weekends (85% travel with anywhere between 14-21 days on and 2-3 days off). This was my first job out of college and I spent close to 10 years there which given me some issues related to jobs and what I expect to be normal and professional behavior. I'm hesitant to leave what is now the best work-life balance I've ever had but will definitely be taken advantage of with this new certification.

My current boss just got promoted and will be moving out of our department and I'm worried their replacement will tank what makes this job good. An old coworker heard and is trying to poach me to join him back in the private consulting game as a project manager at a new company he just moved to. This would almost double my current pay but I am worried it will just dump me back into the ""work nonstop, you have money but now have no time to live"" game. I know it's not going to be equivalent field to field and that money isn't everything, but is anyone here in a PM role that can shed some more light on these types of positions? My old poacher coworker told me this new company is way different, especially if I could set boundaries early but I find that hard after a career of ""do this or you're fired.""",Sheisallnose,1,1.0,0,1694050439,2023-09-07 01:33:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16c2mwu/advice_on_making_a_big_jump_to_a_project/,9,2023
16c2kdv,"Contract role ends in about 3mo, baby due in 2mo. Employer doesn't know and I have nothing lined up yet.","I struggled to find work for a bit, but landed on a contract role covering for a team member's paternity leave for about 5 months. There are no benefits beyond a little PTO, but it's a great remote position at a recognizable company in my field that will be a fantastic resume booster at the very least.

Ironically, our own baby is due a month before the contract ends. 

I made no indication of the pregnancy during the interview process for obvious reasons, and given the contract is at-will, I have been planning on telling my manager once it would stop making sense to cut losses and hire someone else. Well, I think I'm about at that point, as I am a couple weeks into heading the first project of my own. Though my intention is to use up the handful of PTO days in my contract following the birth and then finishing out my contract, I want to give plenty of heads up about these plans in case of an early delivery.

However, while they have made no explicit mention of this being contract-to-hire or the possibility of extension, my manager and team PM have made comments about future projects I may work on (that seem unreasonable given what's left of my contract), have made comments about documentation I'll be glad I did ""in a few months,"" and have offered to fly me across the country for a company on-site shortly before my contract expires. I've been applying and interviewing for other roles to start after this one, but would prefer to stay in this role permanently if it's an option. 

So, how do I navigate this situation?

- On the one hand, I'm afraid that as soon as I tell them about the pregnancy, my chances of being hired will plummet before they are even discussed - or worse, my contract will end early - as I doubt they want to immediately pay for parental leave, nor will they want to defend why their progressive, generous parental leave policies don't extend to new hires or contractors.

- On the other hand, I don't want to blindside my manager/team with a week off that I clearly knew was coming.

Do I bring up the contract extension before the pregnancy? Both at the same time? Am I being too paranoid, or should I be careful about when and how I lay my cards on the table?

TL;DR: Contract is 3 more months. Baby coming in 2. Don't know if company wants to hire me and afraid how this news will affect that.",throwitawaynow23,0,0.5,0,1694050254,2023-09-07 01:30:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16c2kdv/contract_role_ends_in_about_3mo_baby_due_in_2mo/,9,2023

16c1okx,How to repair mistrust with manager?,"Bit of a long story, sorry about that 😅(repost from r/careerguidance)  
  
So there's a changing of seasons, so a lot of people had been getting sick, including my own team & myself. I work in a hybrid setting, so when people didn't show up in office but was still remotely online, a lot of times it was revealed that they were sick and didn't want to pass it onto others. Half of team were sick, so I assumed it was probably just the sickness going on.  
  
I happened to be in office with my manager and they seemed to be sick, was sniffling, blowing nose, tissues, asked around for cough drops and was coughing a bit. That was my assumption since a lot of others appeared that way. The next day, it was just one other coworker that appeared in office and they seemed confused as well that nobody other than me in the team showed up for in office. I say my thoughts and state perhaps that half of our teammates might be sick, since they seemed unwell the last time we saw them. I mention that our manager yesterday also appeared unwell and even left earlier than usual.  
  
Now there were a couple times in that day when I was asking for remote assistance on some issues, people tend to ask 'how is your day?' I mention that it was a bit strange being in the office since almost no one in my team were here physically & they might be sick since they seem unwell the last time I saw them.  
  
At the time I just thought of it as answering a 'how is ur day' question to my remote teammates(who weren't as sick, just happened to be remote), as well as a former teammate I happened to chat with in person. It was only today(a week later after all the above) that I realized from backtracking everything and looking from an objective 3rd point of view, that it seemed like I was purposely gossiping almost like malicious rumors. My manager approached me in our usual 1:1 saying that they were confused so many people messaged them & hoped they felt better soon. And that if I wanted to socialize & connect with new people, I shouldn't gossip & talk about other people's business. That it isn't the way to connect with others.  
  
I honestly wasn't using it as a way to connect with others & new people, the only people I talked to was my teammates & former teammate since I'm not comfortable with talking to people in a business setting. And I had been expressing to my manager in prior 1:1 meetings asking about how to socialize better, so I know it only made me look worse. I think it made it look like even though they were genuinely giving me advice, I backstabbed them with gossip (even though I honestly didn't mean to.)  
  
Edit: My manager has also spoken about how they know that there is a group chat among the teammates & that we chat a lot. I replied that I'm actually not in the group chat(my teammates do know that I know they have one, but havent invited me to it), so they'll able to ask questions in a group setting while I have to do it individually which is why my questions are more funneled to the trainers\[another piece of advice I received today was to reduce the amount of questions I'm asking & to have more trust in myself, hence why I replied with this\]. But this seemed to have no effect/made this overall situation look worse(based on their expression)  
  
2nd Edit: I did tell them that it was mostly offhand mentions & I didn't expect it to grow. they replied saying: well, it did. & I think I only made the conversation worse  
  
I know that even without malicious intent, I still need to own up to my mistake & I know that trust is most likely lost. I don't know how to make it up to them or to repair the relationship. Any advice on that?  
  
Background: I only had about 7 months of work experience after graduating college, 1 month with a small clinic that I ended up quitting because of the environment, and then I moved to this job & am currently 6 months in. I know that compared to most adults, I'm naive & am making a lot of mistakes in the corporate/business world most likely. From what I do know of the adult world, you need to be careful of who you talk to & what you talk about. I've always tried to be on the cautious side & guarded, but lately relaxed more since people seemed to sense the guardedness & in turn it resulted in me being more lax with my words. I genuinely want to learn how to navigate the corporate world better.

16c12i1,How do I stop being insecure about my job?,"How do I stop being insecure about my role?

I’m 26M international worker in US. I’ve been working at a company for almost a year now. In the one year, I’ve been recognized twice for the work I do. 
I handle the most profitable channel within the team that had to be shut due to multiple incorrect details. Because of this, the team took a hit and I had to bring the channel back under tight timelines. Due to my work, I got recognized very often - but - everyone within the team constantly saw and this and tried to get a piece of the pie due to how valuable this channel is by the means of “oh let me help you you have so much going on I will take over”. My manager and I don’t get along well. My skip and I do. My manager also is a poor worker and has had multiple people complaining to my skip that the work doesn’t get done. My skip knows this and has acknowledged it, but no action taken on him so far. 

My manager, also is more inclined towards my coworkers as opposed to me. I’m a bit more work focused so I don’t generally ask about personal life and stuff. Due to this, I feel, and some level of recognition I receive v/s him, there’s some level of dislike for me. 

With this channel project, I handled all the work, but I can see slowly that my work is getting delegated to others in my team to lead. I don’t quite understand why, since I received recognition in front of the company over this work and multiple times by other teams and my skip.

16c0vgb,Is Relocating From The Bay Area to Japan Career Suicide?,"TLDR: I'm trying to convince myself to relocate temporarily to work in Japan for a few years, but everyone I've talked to has told me not to do it. I will move back to Canada after I am done working in Japan.  
This might sound crazy, but I am in a good position right now with my career and I feel very lucky to be able to be where I am. For a bit of context, I am Canadian and I was fortunate enough to relocate to the Bay area and also receive an H1B visa through the lottery. In the eyes of my colleagues who are also in tech, I've already reached the end game.

However, even with all these things considered, I still feel the urge to fulfill my dream of working in Japan. I've done my research to a certain degree and I've seen the pros and cons. I've also went to Japan recently to get a feel for the country. I felt like maybe if I went there first then my opinion would change but it didn't. 

Maybe I'm short sighted and ignorant, but I don't feel the pressure of this culture of ""grinding"" and saving money or moving up the corporate latter. All this talk of having a family, settling down, buying a house doesn't really worry me and I'm tired of hearing it. It feels like I'm just following a plan that's been laid out for me by someone I don't even know. Those were the reasons I got from other people to convince me to stay in the Bay.

16c0mtk,Never received a performance review,"I worked at a company F500 as a contractor and I was never late on submitting any reports. These reports are heavily regulated reports that need to be churned out in 30 calendar days. 

Anyways a position opened up with the company (well three positions actually),  because the entire team quit do to our toxic manager. Anyways I’ve since moved on (2 years) and found myself laid off. These positions are still open and available and I believe I have both the niche expertise, education, and experience for this role considering the fact that these exact same people were the one to train me originally. 

I found out today from a recruiter that the toxic manager told her that I had performance review issues and that’s why I am not being considered for the role. 

Two questions: 
1. As a contractor they do not have any sort of performance review plans with us. Usually what happens is they directly reach out to my manager who placed me in the role to complain. But since my time there I had never had any complaints. 

2. Retaliation: this particular manager was confronted by me and my manager for inefficiencies in his process and he had no rebuttal. So I got to do things my way as I had no time to waste on his way. I feel that I am being retaliated against because I’m not really a kiss ass type person. But I also feel regardless of this idiots views I should not be denied employment either. It’s quiet unfair. 

Is there a way for me to get these performance reviews to review myself? And what happens if there are no reviews or documentation about my time there? 

Any ideas? TIA",Iquitdepression,1,1.0,6,1694045115,2023-09-07 00:05:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16c0mtk/never_received_a_performance_review/,9,2023
16c0b5q,Can a CEO mandate when I take time off? (Either PTO or Sick Leave),"I work at a small non-profit and was approached by my direct supervisor a few months into the role that I (paraphrasing) ""shouldn't be taking time off during in-office days instead of remote days"" because everyone needs to prioritize in-office days, even if they are for doctor's appointments. When I first started, that stressed me out so I had become more aware of when I took off, but then I came to realize that no one else had been given that warning and no one has been taking that into account. I had then learned that my direct supervisor doesn't really care about where I work or when I take off, but the warning came from my CEO, who really wants us all to be in-office.

I am now a year into my role and since then, we have been mandated to come in three times a week instead of two. I am also scheduling my annual physical but the appointments are only on days that I have in-office work. My question really is, can my CEO mandate when I take time off generally? Is that an HR concern (not sure if I would even want to go that route)? I am confused if this can be enforced, but I have gone to a point where I don't really care and it frustrating to feel like there's a double standard placed upon me.

16bzp6e,Can someone with more career experience tell me how cushy my job is? This is my first salaried position out of college.,"Hello!
Without revealing too much about myself, I work in a lab, I make $75k plus a 10% bonus. This is about 20k higher than the local average for my job title. It has 401k, 3 weeks paid vacay, plus 1 week off company wide between Christmas and New Years. Health, Vision, Dental. Ive been there 50ish days. 

**Pros:**  
+ Once I was trained up I basically am able to get all my work done in like 3 or 4 hours on a normal day. I also automated an annoying part of my job with macros so that contributed to it.  
+ Super good break room (good coffee :D ) and frequent catered lunches. I mean I really go to town on that break room. I fucked up like 9 mini Kind bars today alone.   
+ Not micromanaged by my boss, shes really more of a coworker. As long as I get the work done.  
+ Nobody cares when I show up because of the nature of the job, as long as I get 8 hours in a day.  
+ The company has been getting huge fat Biden-scented checks from the Inflation Reduction Act, so we never are starved for resources to do our job. 

**Neutral:**  
\= I have a set amount of work to do every morning, it can pick up or slow down. On super easy days its like two hours of work. But it can take up the whole day and one time I stayed like 10 hours. I have ADHD and work slower naturally so the fact that it doesn't happen more is astounding.  
= Commute is like 30 mins each way which isnt bad I feel. 

**Cons:**  
= Gotta be at that hoe 40 hours a week and im still getting used to it.

16bz2fu,Any advice on pivoting away from a career in technical theater?,"finding a career to pivot to after over 12 years in technical theater?

My partner and I are moving in together and it’s really driving home to me how little I make, what terrible hours I work, and how I’ve grown to hate my career.
I’m 33, I went to school for a bachelors in theatrical design and production, and right after school got an apprenticeship that I wanted at a well regarded regional theater.  12 years later I’ve worked my way up from apprentice, to stage hand, to head carpenter, and now to technical director.  I oversee the entire technical staff, I work many nights and weekends but often have weeks where I only work 5 hours a day to balance this out, I just struggle to make ends meet still and do not have enough time to take on other work.  I make 47,500/year and am fairly certain the company could not afford to pay me more.
I’m not in a position to go back to school, but I’m realizing more and more that this career path is a dead end that burns people out, and in a dying industry to be honest.  I have my union card and occasionally take other work at rock shows, etc, but this so hard to plan for and always terrible hours as well.
I have a wide range of skills but am a bit of a dilettante; I never had to learn much drafting or CAD otherwise I would try to bank on that, I’m a decent carpenter and metalworker but not skilled enough that I think I could easily pivot to a non-theater trade.  I have a lot of experience with theatrical rigging, ropework, operating heavy machinery, lifts, etc, as well as managing a team of people, and unfortunately am very used to an environment incredibly relaxed workplace with a ton of freedom despite the many demands.
Any advice for a career option that would not be insane hours, wouldn’t require too much schooling or training, and would easily beat my current salary?",ibenry101088,1,1.0,0,1694041236,2023-09-06 23:00:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16bz2fu/any_advice_on_pivoting_away_from_a_career_in/,9,2023
16by37h,Should I quit? I'm completely lost,"I'm 23(F) i would like to start with some back up. I was stuck at a horrible job for three years. My boss was a micro controller and even tho he never complained about my job, he had this awful habit of pretending to know what we did every second of the shift asking for impossible goals. It was extremely hard for me to find another job because I wanted to work from home (I live in Latin America) and my best chances were to work with US based companies. When I left that company I was so depressed and felt burned out and then I got this offer from a relative's friend who needed someone with my experience since it's the first time he would have a remote worker. 

Everything was great at the beginning. I didn't had problems that I did have at My previous job such as having to wait weeks for my paycheck, being micro controlled or being stuck at meetings the whole day. But this only lasted for a few weeks and now I can't help but see my boss having some habits that my previous employer had. Now he has become more controlling and he has this habit of being just mean. There is no reason to be pissed and they have complimented my work performance a few times but still, he is mean to me. He asks for insane amounts of work and pretends that everything can be done in ten minutes, he assigns me tasks that I'm not qualified or trained to do and then gets pissed if I ask for help or any clarification. If I don't complete everything in minutes he starts calling every five minutes until I'm done and that just makes it harder for me to complete the tasks being interrupted all the time. He calls me at my lunch hours and if I don't answer he gets pissed. He forgets to tell me about urgent tasks and then calls me with insane amounts of work like 30 mins before my shift ends forcing me to work extra hours I'm not getting paid. (Also it's important to know that there is a time difference so is not that I'm not willing to work a few minutes more and leave after five but for my country it is almost 8 or 9 pm sometimes when I can finally leave)

I am doing like twice what was included in my original contract. I never cared because I had enough time but he just keeps adding and adding more tasks that are not related with what they hired me to do and I don't have enough time to do them. I'm the only employee and its obvious that the company is understaffed. When I was hired, there was another person starting on the company at the same time but then they fired her and instead of looking for someone else they gave me her work too. Every day he adds more and more tasks and he doesn't even consider the time that everything takes to be completed. Now it takes 90% of my time to complete additional tasks and work from other departments and just 10% to work on what they originally hired me for but he somehow expects the same results that I had when I had 100% of the time for the tasks in my contract.

Now I'm not happy wit this job but I am not sure if I should quit. This is the best paid job I've ever had and I know is almost impossible to find another job with the same salary (I make $5 per hour and my best salary before was $3.5). I know in dollars it is not that much but for my country is a decent salary.

The money is the only thing that makes me consider it because honestly the schedule, the amount of work and the way my boss treats me makes it harder and harder for me to continue everyday. I didn't had that much time to rest when I left my previous job and I think that has a lot to do with the way I feel now. This job is better than my previous one but still, is not enough, I am not happy and I don't know what to do.

I also can't just quit because as I mentioned a relative recommended me for this job and I don't want to cause her problems. If I quit, I need to give them enough time to hire someone new or else the company will have a lot of problems cause they won't have no one to even answer the phone. But I'm really stressed of having to continue after informing them I will quit, I fear they will treat me even worse (I know it's common on the US to let them know in advance but in my country you can just quit and leave the same day)",EmmsBai,1,1.0,1,1694038913,2023-09-06 22:21:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16by37h/should_i_quit_im_completely_lost/,9,2023

16butls,Been stuck in a toxic work environment for over 5 years and now the job market is crap.,"I stayed with my company so I could finish my degree (tuition reimbursement), also didn't realize how toxic it was, now I have my degree as of about 1.5 years ago (bachelor of IT with specialization in web development), my tuition reimbursement contract ended maybe like 6 months ago and now due to toxic work environment I am now left with not only no career confidence but not even being confident calling my strengths my strengths, and not even knowing of any accomplishments that I have aside from ""top 10%-20% of the nation for overall performance"" since I work at a call center. I also don't really have access to any hard numbers that can illustrate actual business impact so now that I'm trying to apply to IT and web designer roles, I try to write my resume and its wordy as hell because I'm trying overly hard to communicate the right things. I also have been in therapy for years and because of the destabilizing work environment I'm in, therapy is only partially effective at best. I also realized I've been in severe burnout for at least a year if not longer. Supervisors at my job are even telling me that maybe I should take a continuous leave and go on short term disability but that isn't enough to cover my bills, not to mention all the mental health supports I now realize I need.

Bottom line is, I'm trying to leave this place ASAP, without having to just quit without a backup, and am struggling with that because I feel like I suck at everything because that's all I'm really told at work is how I suck. I get I'm supposed to know what I'm good at and what my accomplishments are on my own, but that's damn near impossible when I'm told on the regular all these different ways in which I suck. Do you think it's possible for someone going through severe burnout to position themselves in such a way that will allow them to get hired? I want desperately to leave this place but don't want to be unemployed.",shredflamespdx,7,1.0,3,1694031613,2023-09-06 20:20:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16butls/been_stuck_in_a_toxic_work_environment_for_over_5/,9,2023
16bul9g,Traveling photographer. Remote work? In Media? Advice much appreciated!,"I am looking for advice on finding employment in media.  I am a photographer and videographer from California but I'm currently in Japan, on month 21 of a hopefully never-ending exploration of Asia.  I am very interested in pursuing work that would allow me to continue traveling, taking pictures (I've produced about 2,000 in the last two months here), and producing video content.  I think the most stable, reliable, and consistent work that I could count on would be a salaried position within a media company and my position would be one where I am producing weekly stories through text, photo, and video.  I am more than capable of producing high quality content, in whatever form the company may want and I am confident that I would be successful in an interview.  Not to sound full of myself but looking at what is commonly produced on TV or online publications, I know that I can do just as good if not quite a bit better than that.  
BUT I have no idea how to go about finding an actual job.  
Who do I contact?  How?  What do I say?  
I'm in Japan, probably going back to Thailand next month, so if I'm contacting anyone in the US it could literally be anyone from San Diego all the way to NYC, not exactly region specific, which doesn't help narrow it down any.    
I would be really grateful for any advice you can offer.

16bt7sz,Caught my Colleague Using a Mouse-Mover After Months of Poor Performance. Would You Speak Up?,"Title. Virtual work. Caught a colleague of mine using a mouse mover, after months of frustrating work performance. Management is not involved in our work very much, and there's also quite a gap in knowledge between management and staff (analytics team, manager has no analytics experience). The employee has, for months, ""underpromised, and committed"". A 2 hour task he quotes will take a week. A 2 day task he quotes will take a month. Our backlog of work is very light. Management doesn't have a clue because they don't have the technical ability to understand how easy the tasks are. Rinse, repeat. He then boasts directly and loudly to management about how ""he works long nights and weekends, 50+ hour weeks"", when, in reality I have confirmed that he is at his desk for 20-30 hour weeks, consistently. 

He, for hours in the middle of the day, miss meetings and IMs, all while appearing ""online"". Then, suddenly respond to all my IMs, send out a flurry of emails, and reschedule any relevant meetings he missed, with the excuse ""sorry, was heads down on something important"" (he wasn't and never is).

More than anything, it is frustrating because he is the highest-possible level analyst in the company, makes $250K, and is supposed to be my ""mentor/coach"", but obviously leads a terrible example. He is retirement-age with 40 YoE (10 at the company), and has basically told me he is just going to coast and do the bare minimum into retirement. I think he is almost daring management to fire him so he can collect sevrance/unemploymenet.

Question is, given this behavior, would you speak up and say something? Or is this a ""not my business""-type of thing. Important to note that we are a team of 2, supporting a team of 15 others, so very often our work is dependent on each other and his underperformance directly affects me often.",Professional-Age-331,1,1.0,0,1694027990,2023-09-06 19:19:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16bt7sz/caught_my_colleague_using_a_mousemover_after/,9,2023

16br9ym,How to find out which career/job suits me?,"Hey all,

I'm (29F) getting more and more demotivated in my job. It's a bit uncertain as well where the company I work for will go. Let's say it may collapse, so trying to find a direction before this happens.

I lately realised that I've always looked at what's on the market, which vacancies are there and if I might fit in. And for the parts that doesn't fit, I would be willing to learn or adapt.

Now, I want to take the time to discover in which role and company I would really fit. I can't use my whole potential, as I'm not in my interest field for example. 

But I'm not sure how to find out. I have quite some interests, but don't have the study (and obviously no experience) background for these. I have a bachelor's degree in tourism industry, but since I'm living together with my boyfriend, we don't live closeby a tourism area.

Just want to ask... ➡️➡️ How can I find what of career/job I want? 

I did some quizzes online (lol), and an online tool that tells you which studies are most suitable to your interests and reachable to your capabilities. But I don't really agree with the results (these studies don't seem interesting to me). I wanted to see which workfield/sector could be interesting.
I'm planning to go to job fairs too, but that's just showing me what's on the market again.

I've been thinking about studying again as well, but I don't feel good about the high costs, so many years no income, study stress, and the uncertainty if I will fail.

16bpzzi,What to aim for when I move back to the US in four years,"Currently living in Central Europe and making some long-term plans with my husband, who will be able to quit his job in 4 years so we can move wherever we want. As of now, we're leaning towards the US. By the time we're able to do so, I'll have spent a bit over a decade away, and I'll be 34. 

Assuming I stick with my current job, my main resume item will unfortunately be ESL teaching. Maybe it would count for something that I've already been working in the same school for 5 years, and will possibly continue for another 4 before I start applying anywhere. Aside from that, I work as a wedding photographer - pretty low volume, but I've got a solid portfolio now and I'm proficient with my camera gear, including more complex stuff like off camera flash as well as Lightroom and Photoshop. I also do my own marketing, put together my website, and wrote all of the copy for it. 

I don't want to teach after we move, but am pretty open to other suggestions. My education is in the humanities, so I'm a solid writer and strong researcher. I'd also be happy to find a career related to photography or graphic design. However, since I'll be heading into my mid-30's, I don't want to make any impractical moves. What would you recommend focusing on to have the best odds of landing a solid job? I feel like everything I'm good at is on shaky grounds right now, especially for people just getting started - writing because of AI, photography because of the 'photography is dead' mantra that's been repeating for eternity. But as I said, I really don't want to resign myself to a lifetime of teaching.

16bpzio,How do I tell my boss that we're understaffed because they refuse to pay minimum wage?,"Ok so, I work part time as an assistant manager at an over the counter food place. It's a local business, having been ran by the same 2 people since it opened decades ago. It's also pretty damn popular and we're in the middle of our busiest season. Last month about half of our employees quit and we are unable to remain fully staffed given the owners want to stay open seven days a week. One of them, who normally doesn't even come into the store normally, had to work an entire shift alone because \*nobody\* was able to work Labor Day (as a side note, they didn't tell anyone we were going to be open on Labor Day until 3 days beforehand. The irony of doing this on Labor Day is lost on them.) The reason for everyone quitting varied from person to person but one of the main factors was that they pay new hires below minimum wage because of a legal loophole. 

We haven't been able to hire enough workers to stay open the hours that they want and we're incredibly understaffed during the busiest times of the week and they don't seem to get that nobody wants to work here because they don't want to keep up with minimum wage. Just today a new hire quit on their first day because of this and there are no signs of the owners budging on this.

Personally, I get paid pretty decently because I've been working there for a fair bit of time while getting my degree and the owners seem to like me decently well (not that they can afford to dislike any of their employees right now) but I'm tired of doing so much extra shit for no extra pay because they can't hire anybody.

16bek4l,Which path for med school? Nursing or no?,"Hello! I have been thinking for the last few years about attending med school and decided a few months ago after some shadowing that it's the direction I will be going in, even though I'm a little older at 28. I was hoping for some advise of these prospective paths I could take. As a quick note, I only have an AA and I work as a software engineer and will need to keep working full time until I'm able to get into med school.  


Path one:  


Attend WGU nursing BSN(Already in process), followed by a post bacc program during which I could work as an RN full time. This is my preferred path.  


Pros: I'd be getting a ton of hands on clinical experience during the post back while being able to work full time, I'd really like to attend a post bacc regardless of which path I take due to the increased chance for med school admission they tend to offer, it may be slightly easier to get into med school coming from another medical profession?  


Cons: This path takes up to 2 years longer than needed due to the post bacc, WGU does pass/fail grading so my GPA would default to 3.1  


Path two:  


Pick history degree back up, followed by a post bacc program.  


Pros: 1 year shorter, would technically not need the post bacc(Although I still want to do one), will have an actual GPA(Could make getting into post bacc easier)  


Cons: Will have an actual GPA, will have to balance getting clinical/volunteer hours with school and work rather that work counting as clinical, will still be a software engineer for longer which is very time consuming and unpleasant for me.  


I would love to hear some opinions! I know that taking a detour to become a nurse is often not encouraged, but given that I plan to take a post bacc no matter which route I take it doesn't add much time on and would be a great safety net, not to mention the amount of patient interaction I could have! Plus, it might make year 3-4 of med school slightly easier.",Cen-Zen,1,1.0,0,1693988580,2023-09-06 08:23:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16bek4l/which_path_for_med_school_nursing_or_no/,9,2023

I don't plan on continuing here because I just can't stand the culture and the people. But it's a career I originally thought of actually building (not exactly something I passionate about though) but now I'm having second thoughts.

Right now I'm not so sure if this isn't the career for me, or I just got unlucky with the company. I'm thinking it's the former since my interests were always ""not a feasible choice"" (yep, it's art). Anyway, I decided to suck it up the first few months but as it is, I'm still unhappy with how things are. Now, I'm planning to look for a part time job while upscaling my skills for a different career path.

I don't know if it's a wise choice, especially since it seems to early to decide? But then again isn't it better that as early as now I have an idea of what I want and what I don't want? But I'm scared that making this choice may make an impact on my career prospects? Certain factors to consider though, I just graduated last year from a pretty reputable university so I've might not struggle much if I ever decide to hop back into that career path. Money isn't much of a problem for me right now too cause I've saved up from the past months and my parents are still somehow supporting me. Still, what am I to do??

16b7ehf,What are good career alternatives to law school?,"I recently graduated from college with a major in History, and had previously planned to attend law school. After a difficult final semester, I decided I needed a gap year in order to collect myself and realistically not fail law school within the first few weeks. However, after considering it more, I am not sure law school is the right direction for me. For one, I have a solid LSAT score and mediocre GPA, which I expect would land me in a T30 law school. With that being said, I do not want to be thousands of dollars in debt if it is not the right path. Along with this, I struggle with public speaking. It is certainly my biggest weakness academically and it is an essential skill for law students to have acquired. An ideal job for me would be one in which I could work mostly alone or in small groups that pays decently. While I enjoyed my major, I do regret majoring in History since it does not seem applicable to any job that I would want. I am particularly exceptional in reading, writing, and logical thinking, however I do not know where to apply these skills.

I will soon be graduating with a BA in Philosophy, a BA in Anthropology, with a minor in Counseling and Applied Psychology and a certificate in Evolutionary Medicine. 

Unless something absolutely atrocious happens in my last semester, I will be graduating with strait A’s. Untarnished 4.00 GPA. 

At the risk of sounding full of myself, I’m a pretty smart person. 

Professionally, I’ve been in leadership roles in every career I’ve held—though that has only been for a movie theater, a coffee shop, a shipping company, and a cannabis manufacturing lab. (Also with a handful of second jobs I held simultaneously for increased income,  many of which I was also offered leadership positions). 

But I would really like to aspire to a role that pays $100,000+/year. (To be honest, I’m not even sure if this is naive). 

And yet at least my current company doesn’t seem to recognize my potential, and has been pulling the ’ol carrot-and-stick routine with me for years, for a position that averages at $53k/year. 

Then how king will it be waiting to move up again?

So I’m reaching out to y’all here to poke your brains. What kind of job should I be looking for?

I’m interested in working with people. Otherwise, I just like to work hard and solve problems. But that’s basically the jist.

16b45v9,Marketing Strategy / Manager,"Hey all,

I was laid off from a small website development agency about a month and a half ago. I was the lead digital strategist for 2 years and my role included UX research, SEO, marketing recommendations, data & analytics etc. for web clients. I was making around 75k a year. 

In the past, I was a marketing manager for a b2b SaaS company for 2+ years and I oversaw all marketing efforts, data and analytics and product/client marketing. I was laid off during Covid. 

I also was a project manager and data & analytics manager at a ppc agency for 5+ years before that.

So all in all I have almost 10 years of marketing experience, working on the agency side, SaaS and lastly web development service side. 

I had 3 interviews and a case study with a SaaS company for a role that would’ve been in the 100k range but missed out on the role at the very end. 

What I’m struggling with is, I’m more of a marketing generalist / strategist at this point, so I have experience in ppc, email marketing, social etc. but I haven’t executed on those campaigns in years as I’ve been on the strategy side.  So I’ve been applying to more managerial roles, customer success roles for SaaS companies, or higher up strategic marketing / lead marketing roles and I’m struggling to get interviews. 

Any advice would be amazing, I’m starting to worry that I may have to go backwards in pay and title just to get my foot in the door. If that’s the case, I’ll do what I’ve gotta do.

16b31cy,"I need strategies on how to manage up a new boss, what has worked for you? He struggles with moving pieces and connecting the big picture.","I'm 2 months into a new job. My boss has been with the company for a few years but was moved into his director role last year, he didn't have direct experience with the type of work our department does. A year into this role, he seems very uncomfortable with having authority. He doesn't seem to be able to grasp moving pieces or how things connect. I also don't think he's actually listening to me when I talk either.

I'm still onboarding but every time I try to get clarification on stuff in the weeds or big picture, he won't give any direction or decisive answers (ex. when X happens, we need to do Y). And then I feel like I'm getting different takes on department priorities from the finance team and my boss's boss. It's like no one is aligned. Although misalignment seems normal for most companies, I feel like my boss isn't stepping up to what he should be doing as a director.

I'm dealing with a fire right now. Basically ""project poodles"" need extra attention on something, so I told my boss I was going to do X,Y,Z and these would be the impacts. I told him verbally and in writing multiple times and he's always like, ""okay!"". But then his boss and stakeholder reached out to him, and he keeps forwarding the emails to me, when it's stuff we talked about and it's really on him to communicate this up to his boss. I'm annoyed because I kept him in the loop on all this, but it feels like  I'm on my own. I want to be like, ""none of this is a surprise, I told you multiple times I was doing this and what the impacts are and possible solutions. If it was the wrong approach, you need to tell me that"". And to make it more complicated, our finance team was looking at the numbers and said the changes were positive. I keep trying to loop my boss into these conversations, but it's like he keeps skirting around. I don't think he's trying to throw me under the bus, but it feels like all this is being fully put on me.

I like the company and the rest of the top management team so I want to try to put together solutions. However I don't think even meeting with him to align on direction and strategy would be productive because he doesn't seem to retain the information we've talked about and he gets flustered easily. 

At this point should I stop trying to align with finance and just focus the smaller moving pieces? I'm not sure how to get through to him on some of the things I speak about. I try to give the takeaways, what's happening, next steps and recommendations and he'll respond with ""yeah!"" but he doesn't seem to remember what we talk about. I think a lot of the work is over his head.

Before she was hired, we used a shared service to do certain tasks since we share the same building. Now that we have split off from this company and moved to the other side of the building/hired my boss, she is now in charge of a certain task. 

She has no clue how to do this task, but has put it on my plate. I have a received no training on how to do this very specifically done task. The person who was doing it before my boss was hired, gave her instructions but they aren’t correct.

I’m really the type of person to only ask for help if I really need it. I much prefer to find solutions on my own and keep to myself. Apparently my boss knew the written directions were not correct but chose not to tell me that. When I came to her for help she told me I need to be more resourceful..

She then proceeded to tell me she went ahead and did it this once for me and that in the future I need to be more resourceful. Im genuinely confused on what to do, because she told me she doesn’t know how to do this task yet she went ahead and did it for me..? Meanwhile I’m asking her to teach me how to do this and she apparently does know how and can teach me, but won’t? 

She told me to ask the previous person to teach me, but the previous person works for a different company and has made it clear as day that she won’t be doing that and it’s my bosses job to teach me.

I am overall pretty happy with the company I’m working for, but should I say:

1) I feel like I don’t have a path toward promotions or a raise (with excellent yearly reviews and small pay increases (more like cost of living adjustments at 3% annually)

2) I feel unsupported by the company and out of touch with the larger company goals because no one takes the time to share them with me 

3) I feel like my small department and team are left out of the company culture and camaraderie

We’re a well known company with about 5,000 employees worldwide. I’m a manager with a team of 4, and have been with the company for four years. My responses will undoubtably be shared and discussed between my direct manager and HR.

16azde0,Trading vs. Consulting,"Hi all.

  
Last summer I did a Sales&Trading internship at a large investment bank in London and got a full-time offer for a cash-equities trading desk. After the internship, I started working at a management consulting firm in Milan where I do mostly risk management projects. Now the starting date of the trading job is approaching and I need to decide whether to take it or just stick to consulting. 

  
Here's my issue. I've heard that trading gives you a very specific skillset that is hard to transfer. So, if I don't like it, I will find it hard to change jobs at the end of the analyst program. What do you guys thing? Any advice/feedback is much appreciated.

  
FYI: I'm not enjoying the consulting job that much and ideally I would like to work in IB. However, I didn't go to a top-tier school and didn't study corporate finance. I studied stats which is good for both risk consulting and trading but not IB.",Ok-Turn-3403,1,1.0,0,1693946224,2023-09-05 20:37:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16azde0/trading_vs_consulting/,9,2023

16ayhk5,Should I ask for more pay?,"ShouldNot sure if this is the right place to ask this and if it isn't let me know! But I found out my work wanted to make me a key holder for their premises. They never asked if I wanted to be a key holder or even proposed the idea to me. I was just told that I will be getting a set of keys for the different buildings.

I have checked one of the buildings once before while being in the area purely as I was 5 minutes away and I wasn't busy when an alarm went off but nothing quite to this responsibility of being constantly on call if anything happens. I haven't spoken to them about this yet so I don't know the full responsibilities yet. But from the sounds of it I will be the one the alarm company calls when our alarms go off out of hours. To which I will need to go in and check the building and the entrances before locking back up and activating the alarm. I am also assuming I will need to wait around for a repair company if a door is kicked in or a window is broken as well as deal with emergency workers if the situation requires it.

I am by no means a member of management or even a team leader so it's not something expected of my role and I don't know of anyone at the company who is the same level and is a key holder. It is also a financial institution where cash is kept on-site in a safe if that makes any difference.

So should I ask for more pay on top of my basic salary due to the additional responsibilities? If so how much? I am currently living about a 10-30 minute drive from all buildings but I might be moving to where this will increase to at least 40 minutes away. That's if I am even at home when called so fuel costs can go up even more than they are now travelling to work. I expect to be paid overtime for the time that I am travelling to the site, while I'm there and going back as well as fuel costs. But I am not sure if that's a fair compensation or even its considered generous.

If someone could assist me on this that would be great! And if you have any follow-up questions I'll do my best to answer them.

16axzw4,Should I change jobs?,"Let me start by saying, I LOVE MY JOB. So thats why I don't really know what to do here. My current employer wasn't giving me any wage increases so I went looking for a new job and found one! Benefits look ok and room for increases in the future, or so they say. So I put in my 2 weeks and now my current employer has come back to match the pay I was offered with possibly a little more if I negotiate.

New job is in a new industry. Old job is a property I have worked at for 11 years and really love it. But room for growth is most likely going to be limited after this increase. I currently have 4 weeks vacation where I work because of the length of time I have worked here where I would be dropping to 0 weeks for a year then 1 week after 1 year and 2 weeks after 3 years. 

Either way in the short term it's a 20% increase in pay but I'm not sure what to do. Move onto the new job with no vacation but the possibility of more pay in the future?

But I currently am employed full time and at 1.5 years in am burning out more and more. I’m starting to realize the reason why is I don’t align with the companies ethos and values at all. But I took the job because I needed experience and had no other offers at the time. 

Now I’m searching for other positions and I’m focusing in on hard and fast requirements I have as well as my wish list and am realizing if I just apply for all positions that align with my current job title, I may end up in the exact situation I’m in now. It could take longer to find something with this approach, but maybe the end result will be favorable in comparison. 

Specifically I’m applying for positions at companies I’m interested in. But I’m also reaching out to folks on LinkedIn who work at some of these companies in roles of interest to me and asking for their advice to get my name out there and see what sticks.

16ax0pm,At what point in sales do you throw in the towel?,"Hello everyone! 😁 I have been a car salesman for about a year now, and before that I was selling insurance. Both of these jobs promised me making over 100k/year in my first year. The insurance job was at about 29k after my first year, and I quit to move to insurance. The car sales job has made me about 45k over the past year, and I am debating another move. It has not been through lack of effort, I just live in a small town where traffic is low and sales require lots of effort to obtain. I am wondering what other options there are out there to make a decent income as a 22 year old with no further education after high school. The main reason (other than being unhappy with pay and the overall the ups and downs of sales) is the hours. I work about 55 hours a week and being 22 I feel that I am spinning my wheels trying to get rich when I should be enjoying my 20s. 

Just wanting to hear some outside feedback on this situation. I’m not sure if I am being over dramatic, or if I should consider a career change. Bonus points if you are also in the auto industry and can add some insight into what your experience has been like.

For context: I will start uni in a week and I have to choose between software engineering and biotech majors. I'm in the EU (Spain). Not a prestigious university. I think I want to study biotech because I have always liked chemistry, biology, CS and labwork. My second option is software engineering (closest thing to CS in Spain).  
Here in Spain salaries are sad, but biotech is especially bad (even though the undergraduate programs are highly competitive to get in).  
Ideally I would want to work in research and emigrate to the US to get paid a decent amount of money. But I'm especially concerned about my choice because the job market for biotech doesn't look especially good, some people say its going to be an emerging field but idk. And visas don't seem easy to get.

My proficiencies:
 I took an intro to programming class in college, but have really only messed around with an arduino board time to time on that end. It seems like something I could learn rapidly as tech both understanding hardware and software come to me very easily.

The work was hard and the hours were long but god damn it you feel alive on that iron. I loved what I did but it is hard to make a living with all this inflation, even union wages can’t keep up.

I decided I needed to switch it up, construction is a very feast or famine industry so during one of the famines I decided to leave the union and go to a coding bootcamp. Fast forward to now and I am making two times what I would make as a journeyman ironworker from home as a software developer. I am so thankful for the life I have, I bought a house, my wife and I are comfortable and we have a savings. I could be laid off right now and be fine for 6 months. 

This weekend I did a project on the house (check post history) and it felt so good. I loved being tired and seeing something I built with my hands again. Now that the weekend is over I am staring at lines of code and just resenting it. Like yeah I am making double what an ironworker with overtime could make and yeah I am doing it all from my bedroom, but I am unfulfilled.

16aujd8,Looking for Direction as Event Manager.,"Hello All need some advice on what educational direction to take. 

Currently working in hospitality as an event manager making 70k in a HCOL city. I like my job, but I'm unsure of long term if I want to stay in events or move to general Hotel management within the next 10 years. I'm 27F BTW.

Currently hold a political science BA.

Fell in love with hospitality about a year ago, but I feel so behind my peers who either have hospitality degrees or have been in the industry for 5+ years. 

1. Stay at current job, no edu, (potentially) get promoted to director role in 1-2 years and hit at least 90k salary

2. Pursue Event Management certificate at ver reputable local school for $3k. <1 year to complete

3. Pursue hospitality certificate at ivy league  (online). Looks to be about $5-$10lk depending on program.

4. Pursue MBA through WGU. This will be the biggest cost and time investment. But will give me more flexibility career wise in the long run.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!",brokennook,1,1.0,0,1693935187,2023-09-05 17:33:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16aujd8/looking_for_direction_as_event_manager/,9,2023

I’ve been in contact with a possible job since June. This was something I contacted them about - there was no application. I had my first interview (with the boss)  in June and she was talking like I had the job, telling me what I would be doing, talking about pay and where my desk could be. She told me she would get back to me in a few weeks. She did get back to me asking for my certifications and transcripts and said she would again be back in touch. I followed up and She was back in touch in July and said she wanted to hire me but needed a few weeks to clear her schedule to train me since I would be working directly under her (the boss). I followed up again after a few weeks and she was back in touch in August and asked me to have an interview with the manager. I had a interview with the manager august 22nd and it’s now September 5th. I thought it went extremely well but I need to know if they really want me or not. I just don’t know how to follow up and put it nicely. There’s only so many ways to word a follow up (and I’ve already followed up many times) I REALLY want to work there. I like the people and flexibility that would be offered and it follows my career path (which it’s really hard to find a job in my career path in NY).

16audis,"Advice for answering ""Anonymous"" Employee Satisfaction Survey","Can anyone help me come up with good ways to answer these? 

Not an ounce of me believes the survey will actually be anonymous... the internal legal department (aka owner's best friend) is having us answer in a Word doc and email it back to him, so I'm trying to come up with creative ways to answer these questions that won't result in retaliatory behavior from management. It's a small family-owned company and feedback is not generally taken well. This is a mandatory survey, I have to submit something. Kissing arse in all my answers is just too obviously going to be fake. The company has tons of issues. None of which will probably change, unfortunately, but if I could sneak in some honesty here and there, without offending anyone... that would be neat. Before anyone asks, I work here because of the flexibility. I will not find the level of flexibility anywhere else, and I desperately need it right now until we can get reliable childcare. It's so flexible that nothing ever gets accomplished, no one is held accountable, etc etc... doesn't fit my type-A personality type very well, but it's obviously a major benefit. 

1. How would you describe the management of the company?  *Honest answer:* Poorly organized, hands-off, a bit apathetic, very selective as to when they actually want to manage or provide input. 
2. Do you believe that the company's officers listen to your feedback and suggestions? Please elaborate. *Honest answer:* Not at all. Feedback is usually ignored, but when it has been acknowledged, the issues are dismissed only to come up again at a later date as even bigger problems. 
3. What required corporate processes make your job more difficult and/or less efficient? *Honest answer:* The complete lack of processes. 
4. Have you been provided the tools necessary to adequately and efficiently complete your job? If not, please elaborate. *Honest answer:* No. Zero direction and/or training was ever provided. I learned everything on my own through Google or trial-and-error experience. 
5. How would you describe our company culture to one of your closest friends? *Honest answer:* Non-existent. No team building, little interaction from owners, no company events, no reviews, acknowledgement, and/or feedback. 
6. What concerns to you have for the company? *Honest answer:* Longevity, given the ongoing financial issues with cash flow.

16atygl,33 year old Civil Servant with Big Dreams (still... 😅),"I am a 33 year old man living in the Los Angeles area. It might seem like pie in the sky, but my goal is a stable 200k (or thereabouts) job not requiring more than 50 hours a week of my time so that one day I might own a home around here. 

The honest to god truth is that I have never really had a completely clear idea of what my life should look like career wise. I have done okay for myself simply transitioning from one job in public service to another, capping at 80k before leaving to pursue air traffic control.

Since flunking out of ATC training, I am attempting to reenter civil service as an engineering paraprofessional, but I am also trying to figure out where my life is going long term. I am probably a year from finishing a B.S. in business administration with a focus in information technology management from a somewhat lowly Cal State. I have about 8 years of administrative work experience in the public sector with about five of that being paraprofessional construction/engineering. I could probably manage six figures in the next few years just based on my experience alone, but there isn't really a clear path forward in engineering beyond that without a degree and license.

Since my business administration major encompasses a focus on information technology management, and since my salary aspirations transcend that of a senior professional in my field, I am wondering if anyone has any advice on how I might leverage my degree and perhaps my experience into a job in tech. I have dabbled with programming before, leaning some elementary ruby and javascript, but hardly scratched the surface (the most impressive thing I managed to do was make a very ineloquent sudoku solver).

I am not sure what type of development would best apply to my field of study. I guess I am seeking advice on where to start based on my degree and my experience. Any other advice on where I might go with my career is also welcome.

I'm currently employed as a mid level UX designer at an agency in the UK and have a degree and three years of experience. It's coming up nearly a year here but I'm just struggling a lot recently..

- I was hired into a design team of three, a junior and head of design. The junior designer was made redundant in march and now the company is 'rightsizing' 6 people, including the head of design, so by November I'll be flying solo.
- the company culture is toxic and the Glassdoor reviews prove it, 6 people have left this year on top of the 6 being rightsized...this is a company of 30 people.
- I feel like I follow briefs from project managers and then comes design review internally and I've missed the mark completely! I've followed the brief but the output is still wrong and it's really affecting my confidence now it feels like good week bad week ect. 
- I took this job last minute as I was stuck and I took a lowball offer (which was a massive raise from my junior designer role), but looking at the market rates, £33k a year for a mid level UX designer is super low.
- I've applied for around 50 relevant roles and I keep getting rejections. The market is really tough right now. I've made it through screening interviews at maybe 5 companies now but never get passed this.

I was a super confident designer before I started this role but the processes, management structure and lack of recognition are really getting to me now!

It’s frustrating because the rep often doesn’t realize I had emailed and only answers Sam’s questions/comments and I have to reiterate my questions to get the answers I was looking for. My understanding is that proper email etiquette would be for Sam to await a response from the rep before chiming in with additional questions. They could email in reply to the next email we receive from this outside company. Am I wrong?

16ar9q5,What should I get a master’s in/what field could I move to?,"Hi all, trying to keep this short and sweet but I apologize if it gets wordy. 

I’m a 2nd year teacher and realizing that education is not for me. I sort of fell into it because I didn’t know what else to do. I currently have a bachelor’s in linguistics and a teaching certification and am looking to do grad school. My original plan was to go for speech language pathology but I’m hearing from SLPs that the field is a mess right now due to low pay and crazy hours so I’m thinking that might not be for me. I’d love to hear what people think might be a good path forward for me / a good career to look into switching into.

I don’t mind teaching but my biggest issues with education are as follows-

1. Intensely rigid schedule - taking a sick day is a big problem and often creates a lot of work for me to do while I’m sick, but also very hard to request a day off whether for personal or travel purposes. In my experience when I’ve had to call out sick I have to create an alternative lesson plan and guide a sub teacher through it so I end up working anyway and can’t really rest to get better.

2. Constant work outside of work - always something to do at home (my dream is to have a job where I leave for the day and I don’t / can’t do anything work related at home)

3. No real advancement - I can’t move beyond my job title and pay raises often only come with a change in responsibility 

4. Very early start time - I have narcolepsy so this is very challenging.

So my ideal career would have a bit more flexibility, would not require as much work outside of work, would have at least some advancement to it, and wouldn’t have an early ass start time. I wouldn’t mind working late.

Iv been here a little over a year now and feel like I should have never come back, I just find the work kind of boring and not really my cup of tea. Emails, phone calls, meetings, bullshitting people…just doesn’t really seem like it’s for me.
    I feel really stuck in this position right now because going back to HVAC feels like my only other option, I do miss throwing on work boots in the morning, working a hard days work and learning a skill but beating up my body daily, risk of injury and health hazards just makes me feel dumb for leaving where I’m at to go back to that. My brother also works for my father, he seems to like it more then me but I know he’s looking forward to the future and me and him eventually taking things over. Which would be awesome in a way but I can’t help but feel unsatisfied with the position I’m in. I think most of what I don’t like about it is the feeling like something is being handed to me that I don’t deserve, I have this urge to not do the family business and go do my own thing. I just feel like I’d be walking away from so much opportunity that I’d be stupid not to stay.
Sorry for such a long post, but any advice from people with similar experiences would be great thank you!",helpabrotherout38,2,0.7599999904632568,12,1693926804,2023-09-05 15:13:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16aqw7b/should_i_leave_my_fathers_business/,9,2023

16aqjl0,SaaS sales to Programming,"Hi, everyone. Right now I (M28) work in enterprise partnerships for a SaaS company (insurance field, 3 years of experience over all in SaaS sales, though in different verticals).  I'm interested in either leaving my current gig or finding one that marries sales/client-side work with something more technical/IT-related. I don't mind the work that I do, but it's not something I can see myself doing long term for a few reasons: quota pressure & the stress that comes along with it, lack of intellectual stimulation/monotony, & possible limited remote job prospects compared to other fields.   


I've considered fields directly related to sales that are better in terms of work-life balance & stress, though they're equally monotonous, like customer success, account management, etc. They aren't out of the question. However, I'm interested in other avenues, too. The most obvious role that combines both of my interest is sales engineer. In my company, at least, they present and interact with clients, and are important to pushing a deal, but they aren't bound to quota. Beyond this, I'm not sure what's out there.  


I double-majored in Math & a humanities, so I've always liked data. Thus, something in data was one of my first thoughts. From what I've read, though, data science/ML usually requires extensive education (minimum BS, MS is typical, & PhD isn't uncommon). So, I'm not sure if this is feasible, as I can, realistically, only do a bootcamp + part-time internship + personal projects, as I have a family to feed. I don't really know all that's out there in the programming world, let alone what might fit my criteria.  


So, my questions are: what are some fields that could combine what I mentioned above? Has anyone made a similar switch? What are the most realistic/practical ways to break into any field like this given my background, experience, & situation?   


Note: I know that without a degree in CS it's going to be harder, & that it's going to require a lot of initiative on my end. That's not a problem for me, as this isn't something I'm going to be doing in the near future.

16apvoz,"I want to change my career, am I taking the right decision?","Hello everyone! 

I’m 21(F) graduate in Hotel Management. I did this course because I wanted to be a chef but destiny had some other plans. I had planned what all to do in future pretty specifically but none of that happened. Some or the other obstacle made it difficult for me to start my career on a good note.

I didn’t work full time in hotel after graduating for 6 months due to some reason. Then I joined work in F&B department and left in few months due to medical issues. Then I joined as a trainee in kitchen (finally my dream to become a chef was going to be a reality!) but because I had gotten the habit of being in the restaurant, interacting with guests and not being in the kitchen, I couldn’t really enjoy it so left that for a job in F&B which is in really good hotel but whatever has happened has made me hate myself and this industry. I just can’t seem to go ahead and give my 100% which this industry needs. 

As of now, some of my friends have completed an year of work, some have gone abroad, and some have left the industry. I feel like I’ve run out of time and that has made me want to leave this industry and do something that will not make me hate myself. 

I know that it’s never too late to do anything, but I can’t take this mentally anymore. I keep comparing myself with others and keep feeling guilty about not doing anything good for my parents yet. 

So what I want to do now is to be a language teacher, most probably an English teacher. That is something I’d have done if not HM. My question is, how do I begin? I’m 21 years old and graduated. What course do I have to do to become a qualified teacher for either school or college? What is the salary to be expected in various organisations? 

Can someone give me some insight on this matter?

I don't plan on continuing here because I just can't stand the culture and the people. But it's a career I originally thought of actually building (not exactly something I passionate about though) but now I'm having second thoughts.

Right now I'm not so sure if this isn't the career for me, or I just got unlucky with the company. I'm thinking it's the former since my interests were always ""not a feasible choice"" (yep, it's art). Anyway, I decided to suck it up the first few months but as it is, I'm still unhappy with how things are. Now, I'm planning to look for a part time job while upscaling my skills for a different career path.

I don't know if it's a wise choice, especially since it seems to early to decide? But then again isn't it better that as early as now I have an idea of what I want and what I don't want? But I'm scared that making this choice may make an impact on my career prospects? Certain factors to consider though, I just graduated last year from a pretty reputable university so I've might not struggle much if I ever decide to hop back into that career path. Money isn't much of a problem for me right now too cause I've saved up from the past months and my parents are still somehow supporting me. Still, what am I to do??

I’m American, 33 years old. I earned my degree in nursing and worked as an RN in the US for 6 years. It was good for me in the sense that I learned a lot, but I knew early on that I didn’t want to do it forever.

At 29, I moved abroad to my husband’s country (in Northern Europe). I was happy to leave nursing behind and try something new. I’ve been working as a receptionist, and it’s okay, but it’s just a job. We would like to move back to the US eventually, but to do that, I need a more stable career. And I can’t do nursing again.

I’ve recently been diagnosed with a mild form of autism, which has answered a lot of questions for me and made me realise why some things work for me and other things don’t. I feel more confident in trusting my instincts now, and I know what I need is a job that doesn’t require me to be a social butterfly.

I’d like to get into archival work. Universities, museums, etc. I like learning and I like organizing. I like peace and quiet and being able to hear myself think. 

It’s hard finding universities where I live that offer degrees in English for what I would need. Like a Bachelor’s in history. I can speak the language here to an extent, but not nearly fluent enough to pursue a degree. So I am considering American universities that offer degrees 100% online.

16afwt7,Requesting a Raise After One Year: Is This Approach Effective or Should I adjust it?,"TLDR, just listen here: http://sndup.net/m87z

I've been working at a small business for a year now and have developed a professional relationship with the owner. Initially hired for a graphic design role, my responsibilities ended up not in design but ended up as management and customer service.

While I believe I've grown and contributed significantly to the company, there have been some bumps along the way. One major client was lost, and there were a few learning mistakes that had some costs attached to them, though these issues haven't persisted.

Below I've drafted a letter requesting a salary adjustment, considering my achievements and the additional roles I've taken on. Before presenting it to my boss, I wanted to seek the collective wisdom of this community. Do you think this approach is effective? Or should I consider a different strategy, given the context?

3. Changes in Insurance: The growth in my income now requires me to shoulder the costs of health insurance.

4. Increased Personal Expenses: Various personal financial obligations, such as loans and rent, have risen over the past year, challenging me on my current salary.

5. Potential Need for a Second Job: Financial pressures might make me consider another job, which could affect my performance at [Company]. I'm dedicated to maintaining my present performance and believe it's in the company's best interest.

Given these factors, I kindly request a salary adjustment to [$5 increase] per hour. This revision would better reflect my performance, the economic landscape, and my personal expenses.

Thank you for considering my request. I value being part of the team and am fully committed to our shared success. I'd appreciate a chance to discuss this further when suitable for you.

16afsui,34M lawns to counseling related,"Hey I'm 34M and mow lawns on my own,  its fine but I cant do it full time due to sun and it feels below my skill level. Eagle scout and a  bunch of leadership trainingg as an adolescent. 

BA from 2011 in psychology, worked in caregiving, libraries and had  energy work training thinking I'd go to grad school for counseling and never did. 

AAS in Carpentry 2018, was doing natural building for  3 years but there was no money in it so i went back to landscape. 

During  last  few  years  I have done a  ton od  audio, video recording  talking out my story and  listening to it back. Drawing  on notecards, making  meaningful artifact reminders in aluminum and wood I can put up to establish personal culture/creative traction. I've done a website for this work but  not sure how to share it in a monetizable  way. Seems like  it would  hep to have some  sort of  credential, and if possible  not call myself a life coach. And  not be 200k debt for grad school. 

People pay me well for fine landscape. Otherwise my credentials are BA, AAS, various energy work and subconscious certs, and what I've written (so far 3 unpublished books).

I want  to do something more impactful than landscape, in a  communicating  helpful role that pays at least as well.

Should I contact a consultant on how to start a business? Get an extra credential... Write more.. is there  a community I should join of a human potential, new age or  pagan variety that  would want me to train as a spiritual leader?

I recently received a job offer from a company that I had interviewed with a few weeks ago. The HR representative that I had been working with called me to extend the verbal offer, but mentioned it was their last day with the company before referring me to another HR rep.

I passed the background check and gave the new HR rep a call to ask when the formal offer letter would be made available, but they mentioned that the offer letter would only be made available on the first day. They stated that they typically don't send offer letters since candidates could use it as leverage to negotiate higher salary with their current employer. They said not to worry, and just come in on the first day.

I haven't given my notice with my current job at this point since I'm not sure if that is normal. I'm bit hesitant to do so since the only confirmation that I have is a verbal offer from someone who isn't with the company anymore. I only really know the salary they offered, but nothing about benefits, etc. Does this seem like a red flag?

16ae1mt,Feeling lost quarter life crisis. Career suggestions?,"I’m 25f and feeling extremely lost and like I’m running out of time. I worked in animal control for 4 years. I really loved what I did at first, but working for my local sheriffs office and later on the police department, I saw a lot of corruption and was treated differently compared to my male coworkers. I was also targeted for trying to speak up about the malpractice I witnessed. The pay was also not a liveable wage. I got fed up with it and changed jobs. I’m at a job now that allows me to take classes. Just finished my basics and now I need to pick a degree path.

I’m not sure what to pick. I loved getting to work with animals and do rescue operations. I liked investigating cruelty cases and gruesome attacks. I was great at getting people to speak openly with me which often lead to confessions. I loved that I could actually help people and animals until the departments made it difficult.

I was planning on becoming a game warden but a bachelors degree is needed and they don’t make great money. They also might deal with more hunting/fishing regulations instead of wildlife rescue. I was also considering becoming a detective, but my local departments left a bad taste in my mouth. I’m afraid I will see more corruption in other departments and become a target for speaking up or even worse is that I may be too afraid to speak up again. I have no idea where to go from here. I’m getting older and feel pressure to pick a career or degree quickly.

I’ve always had an interest in studying psychology, big fan of Carl Jung’s work, but I’ve heard from many people that it’s not a great major for careers. I’m interested in gruesome and morbid things but I can’t see myself going into medicine. I also had an interest in studying law, but I don’t like the public speaking aspect.

16adq8p,"I’ve got an okay job that doesn’t require much of me, but there’s zero chance of advancing. And I’m bored and can’t see myself doing this for the next 30 years.","Hey all. I need some advice on job hopping. 

I’ve been with my current job for the last six years.  It’s basically data entry. Easy peasy. It’s on a hybrid schedule that isn’t set to change anytime soon— I work from home Mondays and Fridays, in-office Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. I legit LOVE (most of) my coworkers. I hate going into the office when I wake up, but once I’m there I don’t really mind (I wear a hoodie and jeans every day). I make $21.55 an hour.

I’ve been there for six years. Yearly raises of about $0.50. I’ve had a couple “give me a raise or I walk” raises in there too. I just tried one of those recently and they told me nope. I said I had a new job lined up, and they didn’t want to offer me anything to stay.

Now, a family member can easily get me into her company. It’s not at ALL what I went to do though.   It’s also a 6% pay cut starting out, but fully work from home. But she promises me that the raises come very normally. So, less money and potentially more stress. But with the potential to move around. 

Pros of the current job:
- I’m established 
- I like my coworkers for the most part
- It’s easy as hell and I can do three hours of work and coast the rest 
- I don’t have to use a phone, it’s all email.

Cons of the current job:
- There’s literally no advancement
- I’m bored
- I feel stuck 
- The company doesn’t want to offer me money to stay right now, so I worry they won’t offer me raises going forward 

——————-

Pros of the new job:
- Fully remote, I can move out of my shit-hole state with a job if I want
- I can take some money out of my 401k if I were to quit to fund my debt and the move if I needed
- There are apparently (according to my sister) way more opportunities to advance 
- Raises that happen at least every six months
- It’s not very busy but I still can’t work on my own time like my current job  
- I can move around and work wherever 

Cons of the new job:
- I swore I’d never go back to a call center.
- It’s less money out the gate
- I’ll lose touch with my friends
- Schedule sucks in comparison",KentuckyFriedChonker,6,1.0,3,1693886720,2023-09-05 04:05:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16adq8p/ive_got_an_okay_job_that_doesnt_require_much_of/,9,2023
16adm7z,"I NEVER wanted to go into politics, but...","For as long as I can remember, I wanted to go into medicine and become a doctor and help people. I got my degree in biology and chemistry, finished and did well in all of the required and optional prerequisites, shadowed in hospitals, did published research...then COVID hit, which derailed quite a bit, and somehow I ended up in a quazi-management (the actual definition of my title...) position in a community college with some responsibility for ~200 employees (it is semi-relevant to my original goal, as it's 'health professsion' related education).

I'm in a high enough position that I now know about all of the BS that goes on, but none of the influence necessary to change anything, and that is BEYOND frustrating.

And I now know that my optimism in those in executive/leadership positions (that they'll 'do the right thing') is completely misplaced; for the most part, they WON'T do the right thing and just make moves to further their career.

I voiced this frustration to my boss and we spoke about now my union is particularly weak and how we were both frustreated with self-interested people, and he pretty much told me to get into a decision making role if I didn't like how things were being done (my BOSS told me to get into union leadership). I stared at him a little slackjawed when he said that and responded with, ""I didn't exactly anticipate a political career...""

I've now reached the uncomfortable realization that if I want to have the impact that drove me to want to be a doctor (helping people), that I need to go into politics.

Being a doctor right now is limited by the education system, laws, and healthcare regulations.

How do you change those things? Healthcare admin/executive? Still limited by laws and healthcare regulations. Get into healthcare policy advocacy? There's no changing laws there  unless you have millions to throw around (anyone with millions is going to be one of the self-interested people).

It all circles back to politics. Someone needs to do the right thing, and boy do i get upset when people don't do the right thing or protect people in need.

What do they call this? A reluctant leader? I'm 26 YO for heaven's sakes, aren't there any well seasoned adults able and willing to step up? No? Well...then I GUESS I will. Having a conciousness and caring about other people is going to be my undoing.../s

16aczp0,From a B.S. in Biology to Tech Career Advice?,"\~ Very long-winded, but if you read through any bit of it know that I really appreciate it! \~

**\[TLDR; Summary at bottom\]**

I recently graduated with a BS in Human Biology. I spent most of college going through the motions and cramming for exams, but never really thought about why I was doing it. After some consideration, I realized that neither healthcare nor grad/PhD school was where I wanted to end up in the future. I am currently working as a junior specialist in a behavioral research lab at my university, making $51,300 yearly on a 1-2 year appointment. I enjoy my work, which involves interacting with and mentoring undergrads and high schoolers, learning from postdocs and the PI, using VR to study psychology, neurobiology, and cognitive sciences, coding in C# and R, and attending symposia. I have demonstrated soft skills such as teamwork, mentoring, attention to detail, and delegating tasks, as well as hard skills such as behavioral experimental design in Unity C#, VR experimentation and troubleshooting, and data analysis using Excel and R. I am particularly interested in tech and product management, but am not sure if it is realistic for me to transition into the tech field given my background. I am seeking advice on how to gain more experience in tech, whether it would be feasible for me to jump straight into the ""tech"" bubble itself or to pursue a career in biotech before transitioning, and whether a master’s degree if that would help me get my foot in the door. Any suggestions, comments, and words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

In summary, I'm at a point in my life where everything feels so uncertain career-wise. I know I love tech and would want to work in that field someday, yet I'm not sure if the steps to take there given my academic/biological background is tangible or realistic. I'm hoping to use these next 1-2 years to figure my life out, and begin making the necessary steps to gain more direction, experience, and overall drive/motivation. Thanks for reading!

**\[For Context\]:**

I just graduated with BS in Human Biology, magna cum laude. Most of my peers and colleagues are going into a health-related field (medical school, pharmacy school, dental school, optometry school, etc.), while only few are going to grad/PhD programs. I spent most of college just going through the motions, cramming and studying for  hours just to get the immediate satisfaction of passing the class... but in the midst of everything and covid, I never got to think about ""why"" or ""what"" I was doing this for.

After very late consideration right up until the middle of my 4th year, I realized neither healthcare nor grad/PHD school was where I wanted to end up in the future. I couldn't see myself being that immersed, dedicated, nor inspired into the world of healthcare despite its high salary once you make it, and how tired out grad/PHD school making only $34,000 after the recent strikes (I attended a UC, so I have witnessed and currently witness grad school students being exhausted). Don't get me wrong, I'm interested in the research component, but the long schooling on these ""slave-wages"" especially in a high cost of living region like Southern California makes me stray away from that. I also didn't get a chance to do internships during university, covid and focusing my priorities elsewhere. Overall, I'm not particularly ""fascinated"" nor ""super passionate"" about biology itself, but I wouldn't mind if it mixed in other things, like technology.

**\[Me Currently\]:**

I've worked in a behavioral research lab at my UC for 2 years as an unpaid, undergraduate research assistant (RA) for class credit. I'm continuing as a junior specialist (essentially a lab/project manager), set out to make $51,300 yearly (\~$25/hr), on a 1 year appointment or 2 if I decide to stay. 

I like what I do – interacting and mentoring undergrads and high schoolers (all RAs), learning from the postdocs and PI, using behavioral experiments involving virtual reality (VR) to study the intersection of psychology, neurobiology, and cognitive sciences, getting experience coding in C# to make a ""VR experiment"" (game) and soon R to do data analysis, attending symposia, etc. Most people in my position use it as a stepping stone to go to graduate/PHD programs, but despite how much I like what I'm doing now, I don't see myself in that position in the future. I'm both a ""manager"" in the sense that I manage RAs, ongoing projects, making sure things get done, etc. but also I'm a researcher as well, where I'm working on that VR experiment \^ to hopefully get a paper published. If I do that, I'm looking at 2 years of staying in this position.

**\[What I like/enjoy, and am good at\]:**

At work and as an RA, I have lots of demonstrated soft skills (teamwork, mentoring, attention to detail, delegating tasks/following up on them, building a more tight-knit and cohesive team) and some hard skills (behavioral experimental design in Unity C#, VR experimentation and troubleshooting, data analysis using Excel and R). I particularly enjoy teamwork, working in both big and smaller teams on a project, mentoring, and not being an ""expert"" of one thing but have general knowledge of lots of things, so this role was essentially perfect for me to further develop those skills. I love having that higher-level perspective on things needed to get done, know the general steps to piece the puzzle together and building the team necessary to do that, and find joy throughout this process. Friends, colleagues, and mentors tell me I have really good people skills (leading without authorization, conflict mediation, being empathetic, emphasizing the ""how"" you say something is more importantly than ""what"" you say, being friendly/outgoing and wanting people to feel more comfortable, etc.) and all of these things come really natural to me.

**\[Why tech specifically (broadly)\]:**

I'm really excited when I read, learn, and experience new features are being launched/deployed. Think about Apple's WWDC's and their beta testing stages, product and feature launches, and kinda being in the realm/knowledge of the latest and greatest tech. Particularly, it's how certain features where I'm like ""wow, I wish this always existed"" or ""wait this is really cool/gamechanging."" Which, was partly the reason why I chose to work in a VR/behavioral lab (how we can use VR, a still up and coming tech mainly used for gaming, to study certain skills and behaviors in a neurobiological context.

I'm not too too keen nor proficient on coding (I've attempted to learn python and C# - still using and learning C# -, but have gotten stuck in tutorial hell and it's personally really difficult for me to bring coding fundamentals, and turn it to something tangible). Out of boredom I tried HTML, and I like it so far especially since it's a very visual process. I hear HTML is only the starting step, and web developers use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and so many more tools and frameworks nowadays to get something up and running.

I've been watching lots of videos on product management in tech, and it seems like something I'd be interested in doing! Yes, while I'm not formally trained in CS, business, marketing, nor have any internships in related fields, it's something I'm curious to learn more about how I can use my experiences and background to at least bring me into the tech field. As of this moment I'm also looking at UIUX, again calling back to that visual component. I'm also open to many other pieces in tech (again, sorry for being broad), but the **one** thing I don't see myself is being a full blown software engineer, just coding left and right 24/7.

**\[Advice I'm hoping to receive\]:**

* Is it realistic for me to transition into tech, especially considering my background as a human biology major and any ""real"" work experience as in an academic, neurobiology/cognitive sciences lab, without internships nor current experience outside of academia?
* How can I get more experiences, especially now as a post-grad? I'd be totally okay with pursuing a masters after my 1-2 year appointment as a lab manager if that's the main way to get my foot in the door
* I've thought about firstly getting a career in biotech, (utilizing my degree), then after I make better money/gain more experience, try to transition into tech then? Is this tangible?
* Any other suggestions or advice in my position/if you were me? I've been really digging myself into a hole lately and thinking that I can't do this, so any words of encouragement would also be great :"")",AspiringScienceType,5,0.8600000143051147,1,1693884496,2023-09-05 03:28:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16aczp0/from_a_bs_in_biology_to_tech_career_advice/,9,2023
16acya4,Have a killed my career opportunities within my industry?,"Strap in…
I’m in sales in a niche field of life safety. Have been in this industry for 10 years and would say I am one of the younger guys in the industry. 

What brought me here to post.. well over the years I’ve been poached by well known local competitors. Each time I’ve taken the time to interview, listen to the job offers, but I always turn them down. All for the same reasons, due to lateral moves as well as loyalty to my current place. It’s mom and pop, owners always around, money is great, hours worked are low, but the stress and the work load are heavy. It being mom and pop everyone wears multiple hats especially in sales. 

I always said I’d only leave for a specific role in the industry with a Fortune 500 company. About a year ago I left to a completely different field. I can say I was eager for something new and extremely burned out. I will say I was stupid for leaving as I couldn’t live off the pay cut leading me to began the job search again. I was offered my last job back, with negotiations in my favor and I returned. 

Well the specific job I said I’d leave for finally was offered on a golden platter, almost too good to be true, it felt. Well I turned it down. Due to having just returned to my OG job the loyalty played a role and how could I leave? I felt it was me not being a man of my word by leaving again. 

This left me going crazy in my head thinking, have I committed career suicide by denying multiple job offers? Are my chances done at some of these places if I considered leaving? 

This all has hit me as the regret for returning has begun. The burnout is real, I tried the idc I’m here for a paycheck, but my role doesn’t allow me to not care. I have to see it all from A-Z.

I work in tech and honestly, every offer has been good to me. I wo t to get out of this habit but feel very out of the loop about how it's done. 

I'm expecting an offer within the next 48hrs, might be via email or over the phone. I know for a fact that I'm the only one they're talking to. I didn't apply, I was reached out to directly, emailed three times before I finally gave in and responded. In my first reply, I asked the range but intentionally didn't comment on where my thoughts were on it. The max end was only about 10K more than my current salary. My would be boss is doing all the work himself and is more or less in dire need of the hire.This is a specialized role in a specialized field and the company was founded by a handful of ex-FAANG (if that matters). And lastly, they know I'm in talks with another company. They even moved my final interview up a week trying to scoop me up before the other company does. 

I don't want to lose the offer, but I feel like I have some good leverage.

_The question(s):_
- is it customary to present a counter offer on the spot if over the phone or in the first reply if via email? Or is it more of a, ""Thanks for sending this over. I'll have a think and get back to you""?
- Do you go straight for a bump to the base? Base and sign on? Or just a healthy sign on?

16aa04t,Leaving a remote project for a good career opportunity that's hybrid? Project lead saying that more days on-site may be required in the future,"I'm in tech consulting, and my boss asked me to interview for a role on a different project. It sounds like a fantastic opportunity - I'd be in a highly visible position and taking on some challenging work to migrate the client's data from an on-premise environment to a cloud environment. I'm very early in my tech career (1 year in) and it would be good experience. It's currently hybrid 2 days a week.

My only hold up is that during the interview, the lead said that the role may be required to come in more often in the future - up to 5 days a week. It has to do with the white House pushing federal employees to come back to the office.

Having remote flexibility is really important to me. I want to request that there's an agreement on my working model before proceeding. Also, they're hiring two of us, so I don't understand why both of us would have to be there every day.

Something like:

""To clarify, I understand that the situation will evolve. I would like to have an agreement on my working conditions before accepting the position. Could I ask that there is an agreement that this position as a software engineer remain hybrid as the situation evolves? I am happy to negotiate on the number of days, going up to 3 down the line should the client need me there more often.""

Does this sound like a reasonable ask?",Bnerna,0,0.5,1,1693876084,2023-09-05 01:08:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16aa04t/leaving_a_remote_project_for_a_good_career/,9,2023
16a9z97,I'm a 25-year-old that is feeling a little lost...,"I feel at a loss in my career. I have what I want to do, then I have what I think I should do!  


**WHAT I WANT**

I really want to be a full-time video editor, hopefully work my way up into television/tv shows. Currently I've really enjoyed editing YouTube videos for a few friends, and a few clients. The issue is that I don't make enough money to support myself, and I also loathe most jobs. Many of them leave me feeling hopeless. Almost as if I've giving up my purpose. We all deal with that, I'm sure!

**WHAT I SHOULD DO**

The big issue I face with most jobs, is that they don't give me any sense of purpose. The few jobs that I have enjoyed were either moderately social, independent, or creative. The problem is the job market is competitive and always will be. So, my options are to stay broke... or start a trade. That is what I think is the best for me at this point. 

**I've considered the following options:**

* HVAC
* Electrician
* Truck Driving

Of course, my real goal is to use this opportunity to go back to creative work, while also being okay with not. In the end I feel like this will give me at least, a **stronger direction**!

16a6y6o,"I will be a master grad soon at the age of 22, but I'm worried about not getting a good enough job. I need some help? TW: Mental Health.","Hi, I've just handed in my dissertation as of over 2 weeks ago, and I think I'm spiraling into a mental breakdown or an almost quarter-life crisis I guess. I live in the UK and I will hopefully be graduating soon with a good grade of a minimum of a 2:1, in work psychology. My next step is to get admin or HR job until I figure out what I want to do next. 

However, I'm coming to realization of money being tight and borrowing it from parents, after my student loans. I don't think I will get the job I want. I may have to work in other sectors such as retail or hospitality, which is the worse case scenario for me. Look if I sound like a brat, please tell me but don't be too mean about it, okay. I just don't think my ego will physically and mentally allow me to work in those sectors. I feel like I'm taking a step back in my life and I'm worried about what my family would say. I know friends who have been stuck in retail forever and want to get out but there market is so limited. 

I know I would be compared to my siblings who have jobs, and I know my job experience is limited, but I was hoping my two degrees would be enough for even an entry level job. With everything I have applied to since the beginning of the year. I feel depressed, deflated, my confidence has crashed, and I just feel like if I don't get a job within a year of my officially graduating, I see no point in living in life. Which is what I'm feeling, and have been feeling for a while. 

I am not sure what I am asking for on here. If it is advice, or the confirmation of my feelings. I know there are others that may feel the same as me, but I see other people doing better than me and I just want to die. I don't want to be here. I'm trying and I don't know what to do. And I know when it becomes the end of this year and I will get pestered by my family on why I am still unemployed or if I bite the bullet and go into retail or hospitality. I know I will break, and it will hammer in that I'm not good enough, nor smart enough to get what I want and need. And all the stuff that I have experienced throughout my higher education years would be worth it. 

I'm sorry if this is confusing or too dark and messed up to be in this subreddit, but I'm lost and I can't talk to family or my friends. They will tell me stuff that I want to hear or tell me I'm wining about nothing or invalidate my feeling (that's more of my family btw).

16a5iie,Is it time to quit and move on from my senior management startup job?,"Is it time to leave my senior management startup job?

Hi All! I’ve been pondering on this topic for a while now and need some feedback on what my next steps should be. I have been working for a tech startup in a geographical area in the US with lots of other similar career opportunities for over 2.5 years. It’s been a fun job so far. I’m in charge of managing 2 teams and have been able to work some cool technologies. It was a breath of fresh air after working in R&D for about 7 years at a Fortune 500 company. But recently, I am feeling growing turbulence in the company due to missed targets and nepotism from the executive management. Plus I also feel that I can make more money than what I’m making right now. 

Because of all the reasons I’ve mentioned above, I have been thinking of moving on for a while. However, I keep thinking of the teams I created and feel a sense of loyalty to them. So it’s been difficult to move on. Plus I’m also debating the next project I want and how to go about looking for one. I have been working on a specific project that is not yet completed which also has been preventing me from feeling like I can leave the company, as I’d prefer to follow through with it, but yet I also want a role with a wider scope and it seems the best way to do that is move on. I would appreciate any insight or suggestions. Let me know if there are any questions as well in order to give me proper suggestions.

16a4lce,Should I apply for the competition?,"I posted this before and had gotten people’s opinions. Now my new question is, should I apply for the direct competition since they have the same position as mine currently open and their company is doing better financially? 


Previous post: 
The backstory is that we just got done doing annual reviews about a week ago. i asked for a raise or title change since i am severely underpaid for my position and have taken on a boatload of responsibilities outside of my job description. I make 40k and work in entry level marketing. he rated me with exceeding expectations. when i mentioned the raise, he told me that he'd love to give me the raise but because the company isn't doing too well, a significant raise won't be possible and he says his hands are tied. I knew that the company was in a little trouble but had no idea it was this bad or I wouldn’t have asked for the raise. we also had lay offs a few months ago and luckily didn't get let go, but there is another round of layoffs going on right now and he said that he was barely able to save our team from someone getting fired. that made me very uneasy to hear. we have a strong relationship, so he told me that he'd understand if i wanted to find a job elsewhere due to the pay, and that he'd even give a glowing recommendation. at one point, he even said that he could talk to friends at other companies to see if they'd need someone like me.

my fiance thinks i need to take him up on the offer to have my boss talk to his friends about job positions and that I need to start applying elsewhere. my fiance thinks that if i stay, i run the risk of getting laid off and he thinks that my boss did me a favor by unofficially warning me... i'm conflicted because i love literally everything about my job. I'm only one year into the work force (besides 3 years of prior internships) so I don't have much experience, yet I feel lucky to hav such a great work environment, boss, benefits, etc.. sad but l'm thinking I have no choice but to look for another job.


TLDR: I’m severely underpaid, work far beyond my job description. boss would give me a substantial raise if he was able, and warned me about more potential layoffs even after one prior round of layoffs a few months ago. the competitor has a job opening for what I do and I’m thinking of applying.",Annabananassssss,1,1.0,2,1693862784,2023-09-04 21:26:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16a4lce/should_i_apply_for_the_competition/,9,2023

There's a person, let's call them Sally, that I work with often. We have different roles, I'm a senior, she's a mid. She knows things about my job, and I know things about her job. For the past year, she constantly keeps on undermining my expertise by questioning my decisions without an end. I can give her an explanation, and she will still question it. It's gotten to the point where I have to back up most of the decisions I make with a quote from an industry leader or scientific research. My workload is quite big, I don't have time for this.
The worst thing, for some odd reason, she has a great relationship with one of the C-levels, who is our direct manager. They make decisions without me, or back up each other with agreeing on something that is completely wrong. That C-level was also one of the first people in the company (around 100 people now), and he knows jack shit about my position.

When I approached the C-level saying that I am sad my side of the story is not being seen, I was told that “It's so sad that you don't know how to communicate with Sally"". He’s a gaslighter to another level.

To give you a little background, I have a Bsc in Economics with specialization in Finance.

  
I was wondering how much value a Masters degree adds, if any. I have no experience apart from being an ""IT and Administration Support"" at a start-up, so I maybe it would be beneficial for me to interrupt my studies and work.

  
When applying for jobs (Finance assistant, Junior Financial Analyst, Junior Accountant, etc.),  90% of advertisements only required a Bachelor's degree, but most turned me down right away. My university is (I believe) known for having a good Finance programe.

  
I know its hard to judge or give any advice without seeing what my CV looks like etc., what I would mostly like to ask, do you think it would help to maybe get some sort of a financial certificate? Or certificate of being able to use a software? If so, what kinds of certificates?

16a2idv,Job References,"My wife is in the hiring process with a new company. She is in the final stage of the process, and HR has asked her for references, specifically from her current manager. However, she does not feel confident about sharing her manager as a reference at this stage. Firstly, she wants to see their offer. Secondly, she's concerned that if she tells her current manager she's seeking a new job and doesn't end up taking the new job, her manager might change their attitude towards her until she finds a new job.  
  
I suggested to her that she should tell HR that she can provide references from her previous employers and current colleagues, and she's willing to provide her current manager as a reference once she sees their offer.

16a1sj2,"Manager said ""stay tune""","Hello Ridditors! Looking for some advice/opinion.

I am 37f working for federal government in Canada. I've been with the same department for 3 years but took 15 month maternity leave, been back since January 2023.

Before I left the team, it was a good team of knowledgeable coworkers but since a lot of good talent have left the team. My manager started a few months after I was hired and was new to the role. I thought she was great until she gave me an unfavorable rating for my performance review. I let her know I was not happy and rating was unexpected. She used something I mentioned to her as my own development goal as the reason. I advised her she should have discussed this prior with me and before giving me this rating. I was on maternity leave at the time so that was that.

Now that I am back to work, I have expressed interest in a senior role within the team as I have prior experience in the role and with so many changes on the team I was 1 of 3 most senior people. She dismissed me and said she already had someone in mind and hired from outside but said opportunities would come along. Although I was upset, I kept it professional. 

Now, a few weeks ago it was announced a senior coworker is moving to a new position within the company. I scheduled a call with my manager expressing interest and presenting my prior work experiences as well as my contributions to the team. She acknowledged that she wanted me on the team and does not want me to leave. She also acknowledged it would be good transition for the team given my knowledge and so many new people on the team.

However, she said:° the position would be a competition open to everyone in the company (umm okay). But in the same breath, she said she needed to fill Bilingual roles as we are short and I am not Bilingual and she said ""stay tune"". Keep in mind she has 3 positions to fill within the team (2 Bilingual and 1 English based on people that have left). I said okay if that is the case, I will have to look out for myself career wise (look outside this team), she agreed.

A few days after our discussion I applied for another position (senior role) because I felt so uncertain and wanted to keep my options open. Is it unreasonable to expect my manager to promote me (or even another coworker on our team?). The last 4 hires on the team have been external candidates. She now has 3 senior positions to fill and will not promote atleast one coworker. It is frustrating!!! Her excuse is HR wanting to keep position as a competition given there is another team within the company who will be out of jobs. But I think she could fight to promote people within her team.

This is more of a rant then anything. But thoughts.....?

169yx2t,Should I stick with Software Engineering or try for Nursing(CRNA)?,"29 year old Software Engineer, trying to decide between staying a Software Engineer or attempting Nursing with the goal of being a CRNA, any insight?

Current: Jr Software Engineer, making base pay of $62k per year in a Florida city remotely (this is all before taxes). Currently have a AA degree.

Software Engineer:

Path: Enroll in WGU comp sci program to earn my bachelors degree. No further steps.

Cost: $6500 per semester in loans. Length of time: 2 years. Can stay in my current job (program is self paced and online)

Salary outlook for Software Engineer: minimum of $60k starting salary, going up to the $200k range. 

Pros: It’s easy because I’m already here. I semi-enjoy coding. Can work from home (which I would love), semi-flexible hours. Potential to make $250k+ apparently?? Some say over 500k, but I’m doubtful.

Cons: Job is less secure, and I’m not necessarily happy. Not unhappy either, just unfulfilled? Also, I may never reach the point where I make $200 K, or even something close to that.


Nursing:

Path: Enroll in a traditional BSN program, should take about two years. Work as an RN, for 1 year, until I’m able to get a Job in the ICU, work there for one year then apply to CRNA school. 

Cost: $200k+ or so in loans since I will have to take out loans for COL+tuition and working isn't allowed in CRNA program. Length of time: 5-6 years?

Salary outlook: starting salary of $80-ish k as RN, then 200-$250k if I’m successful at becoming a CRNA. Can go higher if I get into private practice. 

Pros CRNA: Will be closer to what I’ve always wanted to do (anesthesiologist), great job stability, consistent and steady pay, ability to work two 24 hour shifts and then have five days off.

Cons CRNA: Can’t work from home, not much additional potential for growth after graduating as a CRNA(not sure I would need it though), huge amount of debt, may still be unfulfilled(not an anesthesiologist), people leave the nursing field often due to the treatment of nurses, I am an older person, and maybe too old for this?",CenZen,3,1.0,4,1693850225,2023-09-04 17:57:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/169yx2t/should_i_stick_with_software_engineering_or_try/,9,2023

Turns out a new UNIQLO is opening up in the mall 10 minutes away from my house.  UNIQLO called me up when I got off work last week and offered a full-time position, I told them I would need weekends off for my 2nd job (not the College somewhere else) they said the full-time role requires weekends but they'll contact me back for when they open part-time positions soon.  At first this should seem like a fairly easy switch way shorter commute, less dangerous as the college I'm going into downtown and sketchier areas, rough Winter's also coming and more pay (have to check the part-time position to make sure it's the same) but some things I've considered when weighing the 2.  I've definitely noticed my team at the College 90% seem like great people and great co-workers, I've vocally made a point to other people in the past that nothing beats a good team in my experience and the opposite can be detrimental.  There's definitely an individual I've taken more of a liking too and it's just nice being around people you are attracted to even if I don't end up mixing work with relationships.  If you're late you can just text in saying you'll be late X time and no penality is given whatsoever everybody does it almost everyday.  Probably most importantly the work itself is the easiest job I've ever had, this however is a double-edged sword as once the school start season is over I don't know if my shifts will be as consistent.  If I take the other job it's a clothing store so that would probably mean going back to the rigamaroll of never being allowed to be ""bored"" constantly rushing to cover cash, clean the floor, or customer service for hours straight.

I was overjoyed when I landed a job in an MNC, thinking I was set for a stable career. However, my luck seemed to take a turn for the worse. Months went by, and I still hadn't started my job despite completing their pre-placement training.

My computer science friends got onboarded swiftly, leaving me waiting. Frustrated, I decided to enroll in a Data Science course for self-improvement. To my dismay, the course mostly covered basic concepts that didn't align with industry needs. They promised placements post-course, but now they've added delays with mock interviews.

Meanwhile, my MNC offer remains in limbo. It's been 1.2 years since I graduated and 1.8 years since they made the offer. I reached out, and they said onboarding might happen sometime in 2023. My course is over, but job offers are scarce. I'm a fresher from a non-IT background, making my resume easy to discard.

Despite having a strong GitHub portfolio showcasing AI and ML projects, recruiters seem fixated on the CS/IT degree tag. 

Back at home, my family doesn't understand my situation. They view me as a failure and can't comprehend the challenges I face in the job market. This has led to frequent clashes at home, adding to my emotional burden.

Returning home after completing my course, I've fallen into a cycle of unproductivity. I haven't worked on any projects or even revised my skills. It's as if I'm trapped in this self-deprecating pattern.

169vaid,How did you choose your profession?,"Hi all - new to Reddit here.

I’ve been struggling with deciding what type of job I should pursue. I’m considering jobs that related to my undergrad, as well as positions that are unrelated and only require a bachelor’s. I’m passionate about what I’ve studied, but I’m not sure I’m cut out for it due to competition. I have strong interests in other fields as well, which has pulled me in different directions.  

I’d really like to just bounce around careers, but I know that would be inefficient and is unrealistic overall. I’ve been told taking personality tests such as the MBTI into account can be helpful. 

Right now, my only motivator is money. I need to pay off student debt and I want to be comfortable financially. Success I’ve seen from peers often appears to be a result of happenstance. 

Some questions I have: 

Do you work in the field that you studied?
Does your personality type positively correlate with your career?
How did you increase your luck in the job market?
What are the best post-grad entry-level jobs?

169v565,Leave for a new opportunity or stay and risk being laid off?,"I have a dilemma and could use some advice. A couple of months ago, I found out that at the company I work for, the budgets are being cut and there will be layoffs across the org.  It’s a very large company and layoffs are still a secret, I know about it due to the nature of my role. Feeling that I could be targeted, I updated my resume and started applying. Lo and behold, after 3 rounds of interviews, I received an offer. It’s the same line of work but different industry(that I don’t prefer and know nothing about), the comp is similar, they offered 3% less than I currently make, but I am trying to negotiate higher. Benefits are not as good, but decent. I liked the hiring manager and level up manager. Despite not knowing the industry, my skills are a great match for the role, down to specific software. The role is hybrid, as my current role, but further away (1 hour commute vs 30 min now).

 If it wasn’t for possible layoffs, I would probably stay. I get along with the team and like the work. It’s hard to tell the likelihood I would be laid off. I make the least on my team for the role, but I have less tenure than my peers (still fairly long), my performance reviews in this role have been average.  I can’t get a good read from my manager. I am extra paranoid because I have been laid off in the past. I will get a good severance if I am laid off (about 4-5 months).

169uzqj,Early 30s ex(?)-teacher trying to figure out what's next,"**Background:** I'm in the US. I have a BA and and MA in a world language. Ended up relocating across the country to take a teaching job, got an M.Ed., became fully licensed in the language + English language arts. I really thought that was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, but after six years, I ended up leaving because, at the very least, I needed a break - turns out that constant lockdowns due to school violence plus being verbally abused and sexually harassed by teenagers takes a toll on your mental health. Also, I was recently diagnosed as autistic, which suddenly makes some things that I struggle with make a whole lot more sense.

I took a job in student services at the local university, but it came with a pay cut, worse hours, and a longer commute, so this probably isn't sustainable long-term. (Other than that, I like the actual job okay, it is way less stressful, and does have the perk that I can take classes for free on a part time basis.)

My spouse works full time, but I'm the main income in our household. No kids. No major debt other than a mortgage and a small amount in student loans (if it matters, my school was mostly paid for by scholarships and stipends - I haven't just been collecting degrees while carelessly accumulating debt).

Our city is currently experiencing a major spike in cost of living, plus seeing pretty significant effects of climate change, so we've been strongly considering relocating back to the Midwest within the next 1-2 years. 

**The question:** I really don't know what to do from here. The options I see:

a) Try again teaching high school somewhere else. A number of states have teaching license reciprocity with ours, and my license is still valid for the next few years. But I worry that it might be just as bad/worse, and that I'd struggle to get out again if so. Might have a better experience if the school/district was smaller or in a different environment, e.g. suburban or rural?

b) Teach adults in a non-college capacity - ESL, adult literacy, GED, something like that. Might require additional certifications depending on the state. (I've taught high school ESL classes before but don't have the official endorsement.)

c) Find a similar or better role at a different college/university. 

d) Something else entirely?? I've been browsing other threads in this sub and looking at suggestions for career changes that don't require a lengthy time commitment to get into, but I really am at a loss here. On the one hand, I like working with people/students, but on the other, I have a hard time with office politics, and sometimes am blindsided by interactions turning sour when I thought they were going perfectly fine (I struggle with tone of voice and facial expression). Maybe I'd be better off trying to transition into a role with less interpersonal contact? Something WFH? A trade?

I am currently a 2nd year business major so it’s time for me to choose an emphasis (management, marketing, finance, accounting, etc…). I plan on mastering in supply chain management / operations and logistics, therefore I thought an emphasis in management would be the most suitable. However, people keep telling me that management is a really general degree and that I would struggle to find a good job, and that it’s better to choose something else as an emphasis (finance, etc…).

169t97b,Should I inform my boss? (Breast cancer diagnosis for my mom),"To keep a very emotional discussion simple: my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer on Friday. She already lives with me, and it’s just her and I when it comes to family in this world. 

I work in the consulting / SaaS space. 

I think I should inform my boss of this situation. My boss has always been an incredibly understanding person and I believe she would treat this the same way. I’m not asking for leave or anything at this point, just giving her a heads up that this is what’s going on. I also want to explore potentially adding my mom as a dependent to my health insurance, just so she has the best coverage possible in the (likely) scenario she won’t be able to keep working full time during treatments. 

I mostly want her to know because I’ll be busy with doctors over the next few months. I want her to know my calendar will suddenly be filled with things for outside of work (even during work hours), and hopefully that leads to less projects / clients during the next few months. I will be requesting no more travel through the end of 2023 (I only travel about twice every quarter anyway so this wouldn’t be a huge deal). I do work from home already so no accommodation needed there. Also, this in no way is going to be easy on my mental health. I’m hoping work becomes a distraction, but my mom is the most important person in my life and I can’t imagine being my happy / willing to jump in on extra work self over the next few months. 

I am also keeping in mind, at the end of the day, I work for a business. As we know, business has been slow the past year. There have been layoffs at my company. I’ve been kept safe, and as the most senior member on my team don’t feel like I’m anywhere near the cut line. However, this information could lead them to thinking I’m a pretty expensive employee that isn’t working the same amount anymore, and could let me go. 

Do I tell management / my boss about this, or keep it to myself? What’s the safest route here? I really can’t deal with any more surprises at this stage.",Its_fine_for_now,3,1.0,3,1693837197,2023-09-04 14:19:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/169t97b/should_i_inform_my_boss_breast_cancer_diagnosis/,9,2023
169t72d,Is it time to start looking or is everything fine?,"I need advice on whether I should start looking for a new job or if I’m just being paranoid/scared?

I am 23 and am an office administrator. 
My job recently laid off 1/5th of our staff. After the people were laid off, all remaining staff received an email saying their jobs were safe, and they have nothing to worry about.

Included in the layoff was my manager, who I loved having managed me dearly. They were very honest and approachable and it’s difficult to find a manager who is of the same mindset as in “fuck this job(fuck all jobs) but also let’s do this job the best we can”, they were an amazing manager.

We also were in the middle of union negotiations, and some of the people laid off were in the union and I already had a sour taste in my mouth because of management, and how they’ve been acting in our negotiations, but on top of that abruptly firing employees is crazy. 

I am also getting some inklings that some processes are going to change in a way that I think it’s less efficient, so I don’t think I’m not going to be a fan of the way our company is moving, plus my manager being fired, I now have a new manager, who I don’t think I will like, + two of my other coworkers friends also being fired. 

Things have yet get to go into full effect yet (the people who are laid off have been laid off, but I have yet to experience the new changes & my new manager) I’d like to know if I am being too quick in my rushing of thinking to find another job?",The_Annes_Meow,2,1.0,5,1693837052,2023-09-04 14:17:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/169t72d/is_it_time_to_start_looking_or_is_everything_fine/,9,2023
169t4nm,Is it time to jump ship?,"I have been working for a SaaS tech company, CompanyA, for 7+ years after moving into tech from an unrelated, regulated profession. A little less than a year ago, the CEO offered me a new role in CompanyA, but it is not what I expected, and there are other frustrations that are making me think of jumping ship. I am looking to get some perspective and feedback.


There are a lot of good things about working for the company, like great vacation time, an excellent health insurance plan that I need to pay for an expensive ongoing medication, pay is fine, and the company trusts me to do my own work and generally leaves me to my own devices since I have worked there so long and I have been promoted several times over the years.


However, there are a few things eating away at me that are making me consider leaving. 


First, this new role was supposed to be in charge of launching in the US a localized version of a different company, CompanyB, that CompanyA acquired a few years ago in another country. After acquisition, CompanyB and its 10 or so employees continued to function like its own company within CompanyA.


In this role, I was supposed to blend product management and traditional business scaling skills in that I would design the new localized product and work with a developer to get it launched, and then work on growing the company by hiring folks for the appropriate teams to sell and grow it here in the US. Late last year, I left my job on the US leadership team of CompanyA to take this new role. I previously led a customer service department of 30+ people, but felt like I was pigeonholed into addressing one specific aspect of a business, so I liked that the new role would allow me to learn about growing all parts of a business. The new role had a slight increase in pay. I was to be part of CompanyB, which had 10+ employees all working in the country where the original product is located, but I was to work totally independently from that team.


A few months ago, the CEO decided to absorb CompanyB in the other country into CompanyA in the other country, and the product I had been enticed into developing is now just another feature that CompanyA offers. I don't know what this means for my future, and after talking to the CEO, he doesn't either. I think he'd be content with me just working behind the scenes as basic product manager for my product for the next few years until and IF my product ever gets permission to launch as a standalone product. I've already had to learn a coding language over the past few months and do a bunch of the work to develop this product myself to due to the CEO refusing to hire a dedicated developer to work on my product (another thing that was told to me at at time that I was considering the role). I get that money is tight and that the CEO now doesn't want to fund the launch of a new company in the US, but this still leaves me in a spot where I'm doing very different work in a very different context than what was advertised to me when I changed roles. For the sake of my resume and telling a good story about this, I know I need to stick it out through the launch of the ""feature "" I have been working on, which will happen by the end of the year. While I don't think the CEO planned all this (he is not great at long term planning), that doesn't make me feel better because I now feel trapped in a job with uncertainty as to my future and frustration that I'm not going to have the chance to do what I was told when offered this role. 


A few other things are frustrating me too. When I took this role, I was told that in addition to my salary, I'd be eligible for a bonus paid every 4 months. Everyone in the company gets their bonus on this schedule. The CEO decides my salary and bonus, but I don't report to him (I am the only person in this 200+ person org that doesn't have a manager). I only see him once every 5 weeks or so for a product check in. Since I took this role, the last time I was eligible for my bonus, the CEO either forgot about me or decided to not say anything about my bonus, hoping I'd forget. I did not forget, and had to chase him down for weeks to get my bonus. It ended up taking an extra 2 months to get this bonus after my incessant badgering. He said I'd be paid in lime with everyone else the next time bonuses were distributed. Well, here we are again; I have again been forgotten about/ignored and am now having to pester him for the bonus. Again. This is very frustrating. Messing with my comp is a big problem for me.


Communication is terrible, and I went from being a leader in CompanyA to having no idea what's going on other than what I hear in standups. I don't have 1 on 1s, I don't have a team, and I just feel like a complete outsider. I go into the office once a week just to connect with other people, but it's from a social standpoint and doesn't make me feel connected to the company itself.
I was led to believe that I would be a leader of CompanyB in the US, but the CEO and his right hand person are making big strategic decisions about my product without even involving me and just informing me after the fact. I see no indication that this is going to change.


Finally, CompanyA's finances seem to be in a risky spot. CompanyA laid off a good chunk of the workforce earlier this year, with a focus on cutting non-revenue-generating roles. It's now in a position where it is charging the most compared to any competitor in its space and can't afford to drop pricing. I'm worried that I'll be caught up in a future layoff, and that the financial conditions won't allow me to build the US version of CompanyB anytime soon.


I am basically looking for a sanity check from this community. I recognize that I am privileged to have a job that pays well and leaves me alone, and that it is human nature to want more and be dissatisfied, but I've been really upset about these things for months and I don't think it is going to get better. Would I be crazy to look for another job after I launch this product?


Thanks in advance for any advice you can provide.",BlueSeptemburr,1,1.0,1,1693836894,2023-09-04 14:14:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/169t4nm/is_it_time_to_jump_ship/,9,2023
169t249,What should my next move be?,"So I recently lost my stepdad and had to move to another state for a fresh start. I immediately landed two jobs (Super 8 front desk and Dollar General cashier) and was recently approved for a apartment. Both jobs are super easy, it just sucks when I have to do both on one day.

Super 8 is easy for the most part. I work mornings and I basically just take care of breakfast do laundry and check guests out. However the owner/manager does NOT promote anyone and does not give raises. One person has been working there for 12 years and recently asked for a dollar raise and was denied. There's no room for advancement.

Dollar General however is in desperate need of management. One manager was in a car accident and will be out 6 months. One was fired and another was sent to a mental hospital. I have only been working there for 3 weeks and already they want to promote me too closing store manager. If I go full time manager it comes with a $1 something raise which pays more than super 8

I'd like to do full time with Dollar General but then I'd have to quit Super 8. Super 8 is dead end but it's a $11 a hour job and besides a few difficult check ins (the owner has different rates for whoever checks in) it's really easy

I just don't want to quit Super 8 and then things not work at my new position at DG. If I quit Super 8 there is no going back. The owner does not rehire former employees. 

Any advice?",runeboyz7,1,1.0,0,1693836721,2023-09-04 14:12:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/169t249/what_should_my_next_move_be/,9,2023
169sxlf,Advice please...am I expecting too much from management?,"Hello Ridditors! Looking for some advice/opinion.

I am 37f working for federal government in Canada. I've been with the same department for 3 years but took 15 month maternity leave, been back since January 2023.

Before I left the team, it was a good team of knowledgeable coworkers but since a lot of good talent have left the team. My manager started a few months after I was hired and was new to the role. I thought she was great until she gave me an unfavorable rating for my performance review. I let her know I was not happy and rating was unexpected. She used something I mentioned to her as my own development goal as the reason. I advised her she should have discussed this prior with me and before giving me this rating. I was on maternity leave at the time so that was that.

Now that I am back to work, I have expressed interest in a senior role within the team as I have prior experience in the role and with so many changes on the team I was 1 of 3 most senior people. She dismissed me and said she already had someone in mind and hired from outside but said opportunities would come along. Although I was upset, I kept it professional. 

Now, a few weeks ago it was announced a senior coworker is moving to a new position within the company. I scheduled a call with my manager expressing interest and presenting my prior work experiences as well as my contributions to the team. She acknowledged that she wanted me on the team and does not want me to leave (as I have shown interest in another role). She also acknowledged it would be good transition for the team given my knowledge and so many new people on the team.

However, she said advised no promotion and the position would be a competition open to everyone in the company (umm okay). But in the same breath, she said she needed to fill Bilingual roles as we are short and I am not Bilingual and she said ""stay tune"". Keep in mind she has 3 positions to fill within the team (2 Bilingual and 1 English based on people that have left). I said okay if that is the case, I will have to look out for myself career wise (look outside this team), she agreed.

A few days after our discussion I applied for another position (senior role) because I felt so uncertain and wanted to keep my options open. Is it unreasonable to expect my manager to promote me (or even another coworker on our team?). The last 4 hires on the team have been external candidates. She now has 3 senior positions to fill and will not promote atleast one coworker. It is frustrating!!! Her excuse is HR wanting to keep position as a competition given there is another team within the company who will be out of jobs. But I think she could fight to promote people within her team.

This is more of a rant then anything. But thoughts.....?

169gpmx,How do I make a career change?,"38(M) that has worked hard to get where I am today as a hotel General Manager. I am originally from South Africa and first came to the states in 2009 working in F&B throughout the country on an H2B visa. Got my green card in 2016 through sponsorship through my old job and I became a US citizen in June. I currently work as a General Manager of a 91 room full service hotel in Long Island New York, but to be honest I am tired of NY and have had enough of the hospitality industry. I make good money ($155,000 annually but have realized that isn’t even that good in NY) I am married to another South African (we both got sponsored our green cards through the same company and met in the states) and have 10 month old twin boys, but family life is something that has really become important to both of us. My wife and myself have had the discussion multiple times about getting out of NY and me finding a job that has a better work life balance. We don’t have any personal commitment to NY such as relatives etc. so we are open to move anywhere and my wife is in catering sales so it will be easier for her to just carry on with her career path. I’m at a cross roads with my career because I have gotten to a point in the hospitality industry where I am burnt out and just over the industry. 
I have extensive F&B knowledge and hotel experience with managing P&L’s, leading large teams up to 250 people, managing costs and driving revenue and have a diploma in hotel management, F&B management and culinary arts. 
So this is where I need some advice.

What industries can I use my General Manager skills in? (Not really looking to get into sales) 

Is it unrealistic for me to push for my current pay grade in a different industry?

Any recommendations on states to consider where the cost of living is better than NY (I understand the cost of living is not what it used to be just trying to get a better understanding of where I should be looking, also spent a lot of time traveling up and down the east cost for work when I was on the visa, lived in Florida, New York and Maine.) 
What would the pay scale be in other states to be in line with my NY salary.

Can anyone recommend some recruiters who I can connect with ?

Thanks to everyone that can help me figure some of this stuff out.",Top_Gur9896,2,1.0,3,1693797743,2023-09-04 03:22:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/169gpmx/how_do_i_make_a_career_change/,9,2023

169ftul,Join Gartner or stay in current company? (Sales),"Hi guys, I am looking for some wisdom from the masses. ATM, I have received an offer from Gartner to join their MSE team as an Account Exec and am in a dilemma as to whether I should make the leap or not. The following summarize my considerations:  
  
Current Company (currently here for 2 years): Sales Exec for a FinTech, covering Southeast Asia.  
  
Pros: Good support from Sales Director (am in the good books), opportunity to manage the entire territory on my own, good pipeline, lots of opportunity to connect with key industry prospects.  
  
Cons: Product is pretty much in a shit-state - we're getting battered by competitors, overpriced. Our core product can't be sold temporarily because of a security breach. Lacklustre communication from upper management, entire company lacks a proper structure in terms of knowing how to utilize BD/Marketing. They seem to acknowledge our ridiculous pricing structure but haven't received any insight into how they are going to address this. Universally, my colleagues all agree the product management team are pretty useless. I'm also somewhat overworked, having to pull long hours some days up till pretty late in the night. The reason why is I am now managing the entire region after one dude got fired for being complete trash (100% justified) and another resigned.  
  
2) Gartner:  
  
Pros: This is from an outsider's perspective - lots of opportunities internally to progress/grow/learn. Gartner has been consistently growing the last few quarters, the MSE space which I'm offered is high-growth as well. Better work/life balance (from some people I've spoke).  
  
Cons: Really, the only con right now, is that a) The base salary is about 400 bucks/month lower than what I'm currently making. b) I don't know if my future manager will ever be as good as my current. My manager right now heavily supports me and speaks well of my performance. Hence, I would feel abit guilty leaving him when he told me I'm primed to succeed.  
  
Personally, I am a little burnt out/jaded? by my company as I have very little faith in the product.  
  
Should I make the leap to Gartner? I really need your wisdom. Thank you all!",devvader,1,1.0,0,1693795116,2023-09-04 02:38:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/169ftul/join_gartner_or_stay_in_current_company_sales/,9,2023

Right now I'm struggling to find a job which is really discouraging. Ive had at least 5 interviews and lots of phone screenings to no end. I've reached to final stage interviews only to be ghosted and no response after. I feel even stupid rescinding 1 of my offers early on during college just because I thought I could find something a lot better. Hell I'm even applying to entry level retail roles just cause I need a job anyway I can, and basically I have a lot of retail experience just from working in college.I need health insurance too to fix health issues that I will eventually need surgery, and that requires a job. I live with parents so no paying rent and I have a decent amount saved up. So I don't need to worry about bills per say, but more of just feeling like a loser not working. Also, moving back with my parents is an adjustment because I just don't have any real friends now, and spend most of my time alone which is draining. 

My question is, is there any fields that I can break into now with my degree, that's kind of business unrelated in california? what is there truly out there for a person with a degree? I've been applying to management, sales, marketing jobs which obviously I'm open to. But what else is there out there that I can even try? video editing? Blue collar jobs? What's out there that I'm unaware of? I just need an opportunity, I don't care what it is really, just that its impactive, creative, motivating, and even physical like blue collar work. I was thinking about getting my real estate license which Im really passionate about while I settle down for just a regular full time job either restaurant serving or retail, saving more money while I slowly navigate.

The day came, and when I checked, I had not received a raise at all. When asked, the reason was because we have ti have been employed for 6 months at the end of the quarter, and I was hired a few days after January first.

 I was… not happy. This is not written anywhere in company policy, and my manager has been talking about my raise for 6 weeks. I basically told my manager that I felt devalued and lied to, and that the company must not really care if I leave. Soon after, I had a meeting on my calendar with my director. I met with them, and they explained that it wasn’t in the budget to give raises to people in their first 6 months, and asked me what else they could do for me. 

After speaking to other trusted employees at manager levels, they told me that they have seen other high performers denied raises and bonuses for the same reasons, and that this company is very firm on this 6 month rule, which appears nowhere in writing.

169bidg,Skill I can learn or certification I can earn in months that could help me get a job with at least 50K salary?,"
I like tech and I hope to become a software engineer some day.  I was going to college for a CS degree, but I had to pause it because I can't pay for college right now. I had a car accident a month ago and I lost my car. It ruined my plans to study since now I need to buy a car and then I need to save money before I can continue my studies or make a new plan. 

Also, I'm not able to get financial aid because with my current job I only have enough time to take one class at a time. In other words, I was paying out of pocket. 

I'm a full time teacher. When I get home I always need to spend time planning lessons and preparing for the next day (my time in school is not enough). This is why I'm not comfortable with handling two classes at once. But if I did, I'd have enough credits to get financial aid. 

I don't want to be a teacher though. This has been a placeholder until I can get a job that I want. The problem is that it's very difficult to switch jobs as a teacher. I'm under contract from August to May and even if I could resign at any time without any repercusions, I wouldn't do that to my students. I like them and they seem to like me. 

So my plan is to try my best to become employable in something tech related or something that pays more by May 2024. 

I live in the US. My salary is 45K a year, but I get to take home 32K. I'm willing to relocate anywhere or work remotely. In fact, I'd be very happy if I could work remotely. I experienced it during the pandemic and enjoyed it. 

I only know programming fundamentals in Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript. While I figure out what I can do, I'm doing the Odin Project to continue my programming studies. 

I'm good at Math, understanding computers and I enjoy problem solving. I speak Spanish and English. 

The job that I'd switch to doesn't have to be in the tech industry. I just need something that allows me to escape the educator world and to earn more than what I'm currently earning. 

TL;DR: I'm a teacher that doesn't want to be a teacher. I'm interested in the tech industry. I don't have the money to pay for a college degree at the moment because I need to buy a car after a recent accident. I was actually going to college for a CS degree but had to pause it after the accident since I need to buy a car (I can't get financial aid). I make 45K a year but only get to keep 32K after taxes. I want a job that allows me to make more than that and do something not related to teaching. My skills: I'm fluent in English and Spanish. I enjoy working with technology and computers. I'm a quick learner and I enjoy problem solving. I'm good at Math. I've only learned programming fundamentals in Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript. At the moment I'm doing the Odin Project to continue learning more about programming. My goal is to do something that can greatly increase my chances of landing a non teaching job by May 2024.

169b5fv,How far should I be expected to bend over backwards to get my foot in the door?,"I think I probably know the answer (very far), but I just wanted a second opinion on it.

I'm trying to do a little sideways career shift. I want to still do what I've done for years, just in a different industry.

When I interview for high level positions, I don't make it past the first round (I pass HR). I get it, moving up and sideways isn't going to happen.

I think I've only seen 1 mid-level position and it wasn't real because they head hunted someone from a competitor.

I've had a few very positive early career interviews but they always go to a previous intern or someone's first promotion within the company.

Recently after losing a position to a internal promotion, I was offered their previous job (0 years experience required). At the same time I was told not to expect to hit the top of the salary bracket for the position...

The feeling I get is they're comfortable going with the lowest bidder - What am I supposed to do with that? Given the hours they're talking (salary) about I'm not sure I'll even get them to match an hourly internship.

If I do take a lowball offer to just get my start, I'm afraid that I suddenly have a new base level of what I was being paid before (completely discounting the years of previous experience I have).

I'm not trying to exceed the bracket that HR gave me on the first call, but given my experience I think I should comfortably fit into the top end. I can also bet there is someone without any experience that will happily undercut me...

169aldr,What to do now?,"Hi all,

I’d love some advice/input on my situation. I will preface this by saying that I already feel like a big screw up, so please be gentle if you can. I’m sorry this is so long. 

I’m (37F) an EA with 12+ years of experience as an admin. A few years ago I was able to break out of the admin role and into a project manager sort of role - I excelled in this role and really impressed my managers. The issue was the this role was a contract assignment and I really needed a perm role, well I was recruited by a smaller company for a similar role (smaller team, more focused projects etc), I took this perm role and it was huge boost in pay and in responsibility. All went well for a few months and then I started struggling, my manager tried at first to be supportive but they were also a bit of a micromanager but didn’t quite know how to effectively manage the situation (if that makes sense). They took a lot of things away which didn’t help the core root of what I needed (I was trying to put a system in place where there wasn’t one and was struggling with enforcing it). Looking back the role may have been a bit more than I could chew and I see that now  - after a few months I was put on a PIP that was basically setting me up to fail. It sucked, I took an offer that gave me time to find a new job while still employed just not working. 

I looked for a job in this type of role but my confidence was pretty much shot and there wasn’t much out there - so I ended up looking more for an EA role, which I found and got the job. It was a huge pay cut (30k) and increased number of days in the office but I really felt that I needed to take it because after 60 days I had barely gotten an interview. Now with this role and  Because of being in the office more my oldest child (elementary aged) now has to go to a before and after care program a few days a week and my youngest is in daycare full time (which she was before but since I was being paid more it wasn’t as big of an issue). This brings me to my point, what do I do here? I can’t keep working this job permanently because quite honestly we are barely breaking even as it is and now with the added expense of extra childcare it really just is the icing on the cake. I don’t think they’d agree to cut down on office days because they are actually looking to increase them eventually.

 I’ve started thinking about working an overnight job so that we can cut childcare out completely and put my youngest in a preschool a few days a week (significantly cheaper and I could sleep during that time) but there isn’t a lot out there for my role and on top of that, do I really take an even bigger step back from my career and have to try and get back into when my little one is in school full time in 2 years? I’m also looking into virtual assisting and picking up other odd jobs but on top of all this I’m in school for my undergrad right now so it’s a lot and I don’t want to leave school because I’m afraid that will lead to an even bigger issue finding work in the long run.  My spouse has a great job and is working on advancing(and is moving up!) but with the economy the way it is, we both need to be working. 

I also really feel badly if I do end up leaving this role - everyone is super nice and I really hate job hopping. But I don’t know what else to do. I’m feeling desperate at this point and am feeling stuck.",Severe_Emu_7714,4,0.75,3,1693780586,2023-09-03 22:36:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/169aldr/what_to_do_now/,9,2023

So I’m an EE who works at a big utility company. I was hired straight out of college and worked my way up to Senior Engineer by age 29. I am now 30. I’m a high performing IC with good people skills. I enjoy mentoring junior engineers and do see myself being a manager eventually. I don’t want to go all the way up to director but can see myself going up to Senior Manager (second tier manager). Money is also another incentive as well as good comm skills. 

Next year I will have nearly 10 years experience and it looks like an Eng Manager role is going to be opening up in my department. Questions:

1. Do you think 10 yrs is enough as an IC whose made it to Senior Eng level (31yrs old) or should I keep holding it off as much as I can?

2. I told my boss I’m interested in being a manager and he told me about this upcoming opportunity, but if I end up changing my mind next year and not applying, does it look bad? I think he also told his boss that I’m interested. 

3. I’m good at my current job and I enjoy it for the most part, but I’m nervous about leaving my comfort to something new. I know eventually I won’t have the same comfort in my current role as people start retiring and I get delegated to some of their tasks…

1695vgf,How is the radiology tech career path ?,"








I've been going back and forth constant doubting and overthinking, like is it good career path to choose or not. Have I made a wrong decision or something. Because I don't even have backup plan.  It's been months since I've talked with my advisor as I don't get any of my concerns resolved. It's very frustrating and overwhelming going back and forth. I'm just feeling like a failure in college at the point. It's been 3 years in community college like it's too much. Majority of people already transfer to University to pursue their degree while working a job or doing internship. I'm here sitting like a homebody constantly worrying and stressing but no action has been started. I don't want to be perfectionism but due to my age, I feel like taking risks or making mistakes then getting behind once again feels like I'm going to commit some crime. I feel absolutely down whenever I get reminded about my age and where I stand in life. Constantly getting compared and judged with people my age group.

1695jxx,Looking to pivot to a mid-high skilled career with labor shortage and employers desperate enough to get you a visa. Advice needed.,"Hello guys,  
  
I have been trying to break into the game development industry for a while but I think it might be much easier to just win the lottery. So, I am doing some research into other kinds of careers. For starters, I'm searching for jobs/companies that are desperate enough to give you a good salary and a visa due to labor shortage (I am Mexican, so the visa part is important in any country outside my own).  
  
As you may have gathered, I am thinking of changing careers, hopefully still using some of my existing skills but I am open to getting a license, diploma or another master's to get the remaining skills I need. I'm trying to pivot quickly, so marathonic studies like medicine or nursing are off the table.  
  
I would be grateful for any heads-up or recommendations regarding jobs/industries/companies that pay well and have a relatively lower barrier of entry.

For now I’m working at my parents family owned restaurant for this semester while looking. 

My big question is whether I should state that I’m working here on my resume. I go to a college far from home (Virginia tech) and most jobs ask you your address. Should I say on my resume that I’m working at my parents place or should I not mention it at all? That would make them assume that in at college but my address would give it away that I’m not there.

1694fhy,Product Manager in med device looking for advice on next steps?,"Hi, I'm a 32 year old working as a product manager for an ortho medical device company that I've been with for nearly 4 years, PM for 2. I am fully remote and travel back to HQ around once a month. The company is relatively small (<1,000). Salary is 95k +10k bonus. Boss has said promotion in 2024 is almost certain to about 115-120k. 

My question is: I have advanced in the interview process for a very large med device company (>30,000). Recruiter said base pay of 130k is in their range, fully remote as well and probably less travel. The concern I have is on a personal level I am less interested in their products/space, but the level of structure and opportunities to build skills could be immensely beneficial for the next phase of my career. 

On one hand, I have the current company, people, culture I know and like, but it is unclear as to what my next steps are for career advancement, skills and overall path. Versus a path that offers more structure, more money, but a less dynamic product space.

16931xf,Realizing I need a new job but struggling to take the steps to leave the job,"I have been working in a research assistant-type role (at a University, for a research group led by a professor) for a few years now. I have felt like this job is full of a lot of pressure for some time now but have really been overwhelmed in the past year and have been coming to terms with the need to find a new job. I don't have much of a life outside of work, to be honest.  


One new career I have considered is teaching, however, I've been doing a lot of reading about the pros and cons of this career and have been overthinking it a lot... Another challenge with teaching is that I would have to go to teacher's college for 2 years and so would lose out on saving up money for those two years (I would work part-time but would still miss out on saving up for, say, a house). So with a teaching career, it's the fear of financial insecurity that's holding me back, along with fear of the unknown. I was accepted into teacher's college in a province in Canada (won't name the province) but I ummed and ahhed all summer about whether I wanted to attend or not. Now that I've pretty well decided not to attend (haven't given my 2 weeks' notice) and they are starting the courses next week and I am reading about it, I am regretting that decision and wishing that I was attending...  


In regards to other potential careers, it's the fear of the unknown that's holding me back from even applying. I applied to one job and got an interview but totally did not prepare for the interview because I was occupied by responsibilities at my current job, was just generally stressed, and procrastinated preparing.

I have been letting minors get day passes and didn’t think that they would need to be 18 since memberships you can be as young as 10. But it’s a liability because day passes you don’t need a signature meaning the gym is liable not the parent. I feel awful and sick to my stomach because I have been having similar situations like this. It doesn’t seem to be a big deal at first glance but then I think of lawsuits, injuries, and a bunch of minors showing up on the system.I feel like a failure.

1692kew,Time for something new,"Hi There, looking for some two cents. I have worked at the same company for just over 10 years. I started there right after college. Two years ago I interviewed around and found myself with a job offer for about $30k more. My company ended up matching and I stayed. Now two years later I am finding that multiple companies are very interested in me due to a talent shortage and offering about $20-$25k more in compensation. However the job offers are essentially lateral moves. I like where I am at now and I make a comfortable living so the money will not change much. That said, it would take me 3-4 years to make up that salary difference. Also, my arrangement at work is great where they stay out of how I manage my work. The one current negative is that I  really have more on my plate than I can handle at my job now which  tends to happen as you accumulate tasks over the years. So part of me thinks hey more money and less work somewhere else might be a nice change. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Did you stick around or go try something new?

16926xs,New Employer Bait and Switch: Is This Legal?,"Hi there netizens. In (temporary) lieu of a lawyer, I (36F) am here to pick your brains over the weekend to see if I can gather some scraps of info and make a decision. 

**Is it legal to keep a healthcare employee like myself on site 9-6 M-F on per unit pay after all units are complete, or when there are no units to complete at all?**

**History:** I graduated in 2023 and just landed a job working in the healthcare field. My new degree warrants 55K to 70K salary per year. I've been interviewing and had fantastic success so far, in my mind, as I've had 5 offers from 6 interviews so far. I'm obviously over the moon, because I'm in my 30s, was on the struggle bus basically all of my 20s, and school was HARD. One of those offers was from a company an hour and a half away from me, but the environment and pay sounded so incredible that I actually took it. 

**The job, as presented:** $40 per hour session, 6-8 patients per day, full time, 60K - 80K per year, with mentorship, paid training, an office, and a role in a brand new program ready to hire. I've been training for 3 days. 

**The other shoe:** On Friday, I was given my caseload. It was 4 sessions. PER WEEK. I was shocked. Further, I learned only 4 to 8 sessions per week were currently available. I am required to come 9-6 regardless. There are plenty of prospects, but no firm timeline, besides ""soon!"" though there is a very good outlook for growth (I agree with this). I stated my concern. My immediate supervisor told me ""not to panic"" and said ""it was only my third day"" and that I would eventually have a full caseload. 

**Impact:** It costs me $23 per day to commute. I'd get paid under $40 per day, so my profit works $1.88/hr that first week, $4/hr not factoring in the commute. I will NOT do this even for one week and I  am planning to give the company two options. 

**My proposal:** I come in two days a week, and leave when I'm done or I move to an hourly wage commensurate with my role if I must stay on those days. I can add days when we have more patients.

**The caveat:** I don't really know if I want to work for someone like this if they are breaking the law; thus my question above. I have questions. Is my employer presenting the job to me as full-time, but classifying me as a contractor privately and then withholding that knowledge so that I will stay on site the entire day? My ""clock in"" is the start of the session, in the computer system, so there's not even a record that I was there so many hours. If there is a law, I want to have it in hand on Tuesday. 

Any advice, experience, or information greatly appreciated!!!

1690onz,Changing university degree,"I’m 23 years old and I just finished the 3rd year of my degree in Mechanical Engineering. I went for that degree mainly because I wasn’t 100% sure what I should choose and my dad went for the same degree.


After a year of working as a CAM software consultant/implementation specialist (so technically working in a field connected to my degree) I feel like not much that I have learned throughout these 3 years (at least that’s the case for my uni) was of any use. Adding to that, a lot of my work felt like IT/CS work instead of mechanical/machine engineering (aside from onsite testing whether the CNC code generated by the CAM software worked correctly).


As a hobby I was always much more interested in CS but was too scared/unsure to change my career. In general the work that I currently enjoy in my job and something that I would see myself doing happily in the future is almost exclusively related to computers/programming.


Technically it’s just half a year, but I can’t stop the feeling that I will just waste even more time doing something, that will be completely unrelated to my interests (or even my current job).

168y1h7,A coworker won't stop with sexual/toilet humor and it annoys me. How to handle it graciously,"Let me explain. My coworker apparently spent way too much time living with his mom, and now tries to set up independent life at the age of 29 or so.  He is younger than me, but he definitely gives a vibe of being 16. He also (to put it mildly) kind of sucks at his job and generally, I turn my blind eye on it (he sucks, and this means I apprear better to the boss than I would've otherwise). Either because he's bad at his primary responsibilities, and/or because he's experiencing late growth, he tries to compensate it with being overly outward and chatty about everything. 

From what he talks about (i.e. girls, asses, tinder, luxury cars and accommodation) -- I think his main goal overall is either to try to hook up (I think he's not very successful) or to find a significant other. Or both. I don't care, i just mind my own business.

But lately (either to try to impress other co-workers or whatever is the case) most of his conversations are just sexually suggestive crap, like humor about some girl's ass being accidentally grabbed, or having to miss an important meeting because of menstruation. Again, maybe he just find it funny because he's growing up too late, or maybe he thinks that everyone (or least, I) enjoys it and thus would consider him valuable, he just keeps doing it.

It doesn't really affect my career, but lately, I find myself hoping he's not at the office, so I don't experience second-hand embarrassment and it's just annoying. On one hand, I can report him to someone, but the other co-workers don't seem to mind as much as I do, and I don't want to cause a racket (we are a small branch of a big company). On the other hand, maybe I should just suck it up

168uscu,Anyone have experience with Right Management?,"When I was laid off, my company provided a professional career coach/resume company named Right Management for a couple of months. My experience has been mixed.

As far as I can tell, the resume they helped me write is decent. However, nobody will give specific advice for my particular situation. 

Is it typical for a career coach to tell you to Google answers to pretty much any question about looking for jobs? 

I haven’t looked for a job since the last millennium. Back then, we printed copies of our resume at Kinko’s and hand-delivered them to companies, usually without even knowing if they’re hiring. Needless to say, looking for work has changed a bit since then and the inability to get a straight answer from these supposed job search experts is annoying.

My time has run out, and I’m still not even sure what types of jobs I should be applying for. My previous position was with a company with an extremely niche - i.e. tiny - market, so similar jobs simply don’t exist. 

Anyway, has anyone else had experience with this company? Should I be searching out different career help? Or am I just on my own to muddle through?",MartiniBrodeur,1,1.0,4,1693741206,2023-09-03 11:40:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/168uscu/anyone_have_experience_with_right_management/,9,2023

168slwp,Should I leave a comfortable job for career growth?,"I (30m, 6 YoE) am currently working in a pretty comfortable position with barely any stress. I have been working remotely supporting an outside contractor so I have tons of autonomy, I am mostly in auto-pilot and can procrastinate a lot, this would be fine for some time but it gets extremely boring. 

Salary is good and we get yearly raises. However, I don't see any possibility of career growth in my company and I'm not interested in joining the contractor. Once the support contract is over I am not really sure where I would fit in my company (they would find me another position but I am not sure I would enjoy it). Training is extremely lacking and no social interaction with my colleagues. 

I have been offered a new position in a pretty exciting company in a different industry, they offered a 20% salary increase, lots of training and a very well-defined career plan. Schedule, holidays and WFH are pretty similar. 

The position seems good but I am afraid it will be much more stressing. Switching would also mean having to move to reduce commute time.

I am scared I will regret switching companies and miss my current comfort. However, I also feel like switching is the smart move professionally and for more engaging work.

168shzz,Advice on changing job M25,"Hello everyone, I need some advice.

I've been working in maintenance for a large state-owned company for 4 years, and for the past year, I've also been a permanent supervisor. In a few months, I'll be transferred about 45 kilometers away from home (one way, so 90 kilometers per day), and the idea of this commute, coupled with my shift work, doesn't thrill me. Additionally, the stress from my role and the job itself has been weighing heavily on me, especially with the mandatory overtime that comes with my shifts (fortunately, it's paid).

Now, I've received a job offer from a small but stable company near my home, about 15 minutes away, with no shifts (weekends and holidays off), and the opportunity to specialize in assembling industrial machinery. Of course, the salary would be lower, but I'll consider it once I receive the offer.

I have many doubts about leaving my current company, mainly due to the security it provides. While my current salary is decent, it's low for my position. Additionally, the distance I'll have to travel, along with the shifts (including weekends and holidays) and mandatory overtime, are concerns.

I'm very torn about what to do. What scares me is that by leaving my current job, I might end up earning less for a while, and I worry that the small company might close in the next decade, even though I think my experience will be in demand in this industry.

168ot9e,Unsure of my future?,"I (18F) can’t really decide what I want to do in life. Right now I just started college with a major in Fine Arts of Digital Arts, with the aspiring goal to become a Graphic Designer. For some reason, with this, I believe I can pull off (or at least desperately want to try to?) being a website designer, logo animator, and photographer.

For Photography, I think it’s something I’d minor in for my second semester and try to progress separately. What’s mainly haunting me is the web design and logo animator aspect of my dreams. To be a Website Designer, Id have to delve into some math and science courses as it’s part of being a Computer Science major I believe. I’d love to get into it but I also don’t think I’d be smart enough? I talked to my advisor and it would basically be Computer Science with a minor in Digital Arts or something. Not only that, but I’m just worried I might not be good at it. And then what if I decide to go for that major but still want to do logo animation and such?

I have so many interests which mainly center around the art and design field. I just can’t decide which to pursue. I feel that once I have a set goal for it, it will be too late. I have so many dreams but they feel unobtainable, especially if these are all things I want to pursue at the same time. 

I posted this in another career related reddit form, but i’m just worried about how to go about handing my dreams while being realistic about it if that makes sense?

168nj1i,I need help finding a path for my future career,"I'm 28 years old and my work experience is primarily in call centers. My current job is at an in-house financial call center. I've been working in a non-voice role, handling chat support and correspondence for almost 4 years now. I can't help but wonder if these experiences would be in demand if I decide to work abroad, but based on my research, it doesn't seem likely.

Don't get me wrong, I've learned a lot working on the phones with customers, improving my soft skills, and I truly appreciate working with people in this industry because it's not easy. I don't have any issues with my current company; they pay well, and I mostly work from home. Since I moved to a non-voice queue, assisting our front-line voice associates, I have some free time, and I thought about upskilling, given the abundance of free online resources nowadays.

In my current company, I can actually apply for internal job postings in various fields like IT, HR, data and devops, QA, RTA, and we have other roles, mostly related to voice queues. What I'm really interested in is system troubleshooting or possibly data science, even though I know the tech job market is quite competitive.

Recently, our company decided to open service desk positions and started training the first batch. Associates from the voice queues might have a chance to transfer laterally to the service desk if they have at least an IT or technical support background. I have two years of technical support experience, dealing with ticket handling and basic troubleshooting, and I enjoyed it. I'm wondering if this could be a good career change for me, starting in an entry-level IT position and going from there. I tried programming and coding, but I don't think it's for me.

I feel regretful because my dad sent me to a good university abroad to study mechanical engineering, but I had to drop out during my third and final year due to financial difficulties caused by my mom's ICU bills, her funeral, and other expenses when we had to bring her body to our home country. To make things worse, my dad lost his job too. So, after my visa expired, I returned to back to my home country and started working in call centers. It's like going from riches to rags. It's been 7 years since those events, and we recently lost our house due to default and foreclosure, so now we're renting.

I apologize if this got too personal, but I wanted to share my perspective on how I can turn things around, considering how much we've lost.

I knew at my current job I was undervalued, over worked, and promises of career advancement were regularly broken. Although I LOVE the people I work with, my old director just didn't have the backbone to make a case for me. He's since been let go.

Now, new director - I've heard great things, and it sounds like he has amazing plans for the team - but he's only just taken over, so it will take months before we see any real change, or for there to be an opportunity for me to get a promotion. Nothing is certain.

Meanwhile, after applying to only 3 jobs, I got an offer: government job, $24k increase to what I make now... But it's an 18 month contract. Although they said there are often opportunities and other roles available after, I'm a single income household and am already living paycheck to paycheck. Again... Nothing is certain.

Both are risks - do I stick with what I know and put faith in new leadership? Or do a cut and run to the new job, and hope my work ethic and skills are enough to keep me employed?

168hm6d,"Unsure of new ""IT"" job","I was unsure of where to post this, so please recommend a different sub is this is the incorrect one.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I received a job offer for an IT position (level 1 support) that I found on Indeed. This will be my first official job in IT, as I am still in college. Before starting my bachelor's program(IT and cybersecurity), I was in a short bootcamp for software development, as I was interested in becoming a developer. After not being able to find developer positions/ much less get interviews, I decided to begin pursuing IT, mainly security as it interests me more. While I'm in school, I also need to be able to support myself financially so I decided to study for the A+ certification over the summer so I would have a better chance of getting a helpdesk position.

&#x200B;

Honestly, I did not take the time to 100% digest the job description before (just saw IT Specialist and applied) and did not notice that the job description specified that they were looking for someone who is familiar with coding. After I got the interview invite, I noticed this and was excited because I want to work on development projects. I researched the company and was excited. In the first interview they started it off by telling me that the position would primarily be developing apps for their warehousing systems using a low code environment, in addition to level 1 support as needed. The office I would be working out of only has about 15 employees and the rest are on project sites. 

&#x200B;

My issue is that I'm now second guessing myself and feeling a bit of imposter syndrome and I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to deliver. Of course I don't exactly know what to expect from the platform they are using other than the details of the project they have already told me. In the interview when they asked me about my experience with coding I didn't lie, I simply told them about some of my personal projects and what languages I used. I guess I'm worried about being the only ""developer"" (or IT in general) and I'm just worried about doing things the ""wrong"" way.

168hdly,Torn Between Two Career Paths,"This is my first time posting in this subreddit, but as the title says I am torn between two very different career paths. Wanted some outside perspectives and/or advice; I understand at the end of the day it is my choice but it’s hard to make decisions that are so life changing and I appreciate any comments that help give any insight or clarity. 

The first path is the one I thought I’d always take. I graduated from a good school with a bachelors in genetics and genomics. Then I applied to some very competitive masters programs for Genetic Counseling. The problem is, I didn’t get into any of these programs. I believe it was a combination of not having competitive enough GRE scores (I did not study as much as I should’ve) and not having laboratory experience as all my upper division courses were done online due to Covid. I didn’t take these admissions as seriously as I should’ve, didn’t apply to as many schools as I should’ve. Not getting into any of these schools made me feel inadequate and discouraged, I have mostly given up on this path but have recently been thinking about reapplying. Genetics and biology have always been a passion/interest of mine. However, part of me is worried that I am not smart enough to go back, that I am too old, that the admissions office would wonder what I’ve been doing these past few years.

The second path is what I am currently on. When I was applying for graduate school, I started working at a new and growing drive through coffee chain. I quickly got promoted to manager and about a year and half later, am now getting another promotion to regional manager. I currently make around 70k and will be making around 80-90k. This company is great, the people are great, but it is a very stressful job with not so great work/life balance. If you asked me 10 years ago what I wanted to do with my career, it wouldn’t be this. I’m worried I won’t find fulfillment with this path, but I can become financially stable and support a family. Also just bought a house with my boyfriend, and without this job I am not sure I’ll be able to pay half the mortgage. 

Money isn’t happiness, but money can be stress. My boyfriend and I would like to start a coffee shop together one day no matter what, start a family, own a house etc. but I find myself always being drawn back to a career as a genetic counselor, occasionally regretting that I gave up so easily. Also, going back to school would be to go back in debt. Which is scary and would be a sacrifice for a few year but could payout in long term satisfaction and work/life balance. I am very torn between these paths, I am scared to fail again. Also, I haven’t told my boyfriend yet as he’s stressed for money and starting a job with the coffee company I work for now. Anywho, comments, advice, anything to get me thinking more would be greatly appreciated!",Denalsballs,3,1.0,4,1693697468,2023-09-02 23:31:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/168hdly/torn_between_two_career_paths/,9,2023

168g6za,Which field should I pivot to?,"I’m currently looking into transitioning to a different career. In the past few days I’ve been looking at different options such as: Product Management, Product Design and Business Analysis. I’m not too sure of which one to go for, and I don’t want a situation whereby I decide to go full steam ahead on one of the options, and have second thoughts halfway through it.

Just to give you some context, I’m in my late 20s and currently work as a governance professional (also known as company secretary). I’ve been doing this for over seven years now and it pays really well, as I make over £60k a year. However, I’m finding it quite repetitive and a bit boring to be honest. I don’t feel like I’m adding much value, and my role within the company is always just taken for granted. Other than the soft-skills that come with dealing with Board-level executives, I feel like I’ve reached a plateau from a technical skills P.O.V. There’s also so much admin to it (e.g. planning and sending invites out for board meetings, checking availability for board meetings, drafting minutes, doing filings at companies house,stock exchange announcements etc.).

I’m someone who has a great deal of attention to detail, I’m highly independent but can also work within a team. I’m not much of a people’s person, I find social interactions very draining, but I can cope with them a as I can be adaptable. I wouldn’t say I’m extremely passionate about any specific topic, but I enjoy delving deep into matters, doing research, and communicating findings/suggestions. 

Has anyone successfully transitioned to any of the above fields? What’s the best route I can take to make a career transition to any of the fields mentioned above? Given my profile, which field do you think would suit me best?",InterFlora969,1,1.0,3,1693694494,2023-09-02 22:41:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/168g6za/which_field_should_i_pivot_to/,9,2023
168fwnq,Micromanager hell,"I have 7 yrs experience as a marketing manager. I've been at my current job for 6 months now. It's me and another lady. She's the director, I'm a manager, and it's just us.

  
Right after I started she acted threatened by me. Immediately she began micromanaging me.  
She told me to copy her in on every email I sent, hovered over every project I worked on and wanted to be involved in the tiniest details of everything, she'd come in and overcomplicate every project to the point where it was no longer viable, she was constantly concerned over details that weren't important, and would constantly ask for updates or redo my work for me. 

  
Part of my job title is 'social media manager'. I've been here over 6 months and haven't launched a social media plan with posts yet because she won't let me. The pages are dead.

  
I finally told her I felt like I was stuck in intern limbo and that I'd like more autonomy. She backed off a little, but not completely. 

  
After another month with little improvement, I asked her why she wasn't letting me do my job. She said it was because I did certain things wrong, which isn't true. I've worked very hard for the company and have a lot of experience. At that point I was angry. Not only was she not letting me do my job, but now she was acting like I was at fault. I asked her what was wrong with her and said she was miserable to work with. She went to HR and played the victim, saying I verbally attacked her. 

  
HR acted like I was the problem, even when I told them I was being micromanaged and wasn't going to do it anymore. The CEO wasn't help either. He did say that it was time to give me more freedom, but that we needed to solve this ourselves. 

  
The sad thing is I like the job otherwise. It's just her. I can't breathe at work. I don't know what to do other than quit.",ErinLee99,3,1.0,10,1693693775,2023-09-02 22:29:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/168fwnq/micromanager_hell/,9,2023
168eacf,Just looking for some advice,"Hello,

I am a 20M in the UK currently working in customer services (call center work - full time) nearly going to 10 months at HSBC. I am also a school leaver with no Uni education (highest level of education I have is A-levels being ACC/112 UCAs points)

I am interested to get into Private Banking but I can see most of the entry-level PB jobs require university degrees. Can it be doable to progress into PB without a degree with enough experience?

I also want to know if there is some professional qualifications to get me into the field? I have heard from some people that I connected with that the IAD level 4 would be the qualification but would there be other qualifications that could be worth looking into? If not and it's only just the IAD level 4 that would be useful, I would like to know all of your experiences in terms of studying for IAD level 4 while working full time and some tips if i were to pursue that qualification.

If anyone was wondering why i have not thought of the apprenticeship, I did think of that route and applied for apprenticeships for 2 years but it did not work out with myself either going to first or final stage interviews or assessment centres in which I am terrible at group tasks.

Any sort of advice would be much appreciated.

1687r4g,"Overseas assignment gone wrong, where to from here?","First thing, I appreciate I’m in a pretty lucky position overall for a lot of reasons. But ultimately I’m not feeling good about where my career is at right now. Any advice or insight from similar experience will be welcome. Also this is long so see TLDR at the bottom. 

So I joined my home country office of this company a few years back in a managerial project management role. Things went well on the whole for the first few years, I had developed great relationships including with many members from the company’s country of origin. All was going well and I was nominated for overseas assignment. We held online calls with the team at global HQ and it was… exciting. 

Covid hit. The assignment was delayed every three months for 2 years. I worked in my regular job throughout and always felt like there was nothing to complain about, although the constant waiting was unsettling. Anyway I finally came out here in ‘22. 

Warning bells were everywhere from day 1. The tasks list I’d been given previously didn’t match with the tasks actually allocated. The guy who sponsored my assignment wasn’t even working there, meaning politically I was just a sideshow. There’s more, but essentiallly it was a depressing mess. A new boss back home was upset I wasn’t there anymore (because it wasn’t his idea), so that connection became strained too. But towards the end of the first year things seemed to improve and, foolishly, I decided to stick it out for the second year. I was thinking along the lines of not wanting to give up. 

Now deep in the second year there’s almost nothing for me to do in the assignment country. I’m studying for a diploma in my spare time to keep me occupied. I’ve realised that I’m here just to be here, for somebody else’s reputation, but there’s nothing in it for me. My boss back home seems to be unhappy with my performance on that side and a new hire is settling in to my old job (though I’m still doing the ‘complicated’ side of that role). Despite that I feel like they will expect me to stay with them when I return but I no longer want to, there’s no opportunity to progress and I feel like it’s over. 

In addition to all that, my folks are losing their independence and I have a vulnerable sibling. I’m getting more and more guilty about being here, and feel like I should relocate inside my home country when I get back so I can work closer to them. I’d like to set up my own consultancy though I expect that to be tough and risky. But I do feel I’d like to try it out. 

The big question is do I walk away when I get back? I can’t quit now as I’d have to pay back all kinds of expenses incurred if I quit during the assignment period. 

TLDR: Overseas assignment has sucked, but I’m trapped in it until halfway through next year. I want out and to move on. Have you been in a similar position? Any advice?",Holeysweaterguy,1,1.0,1,1693674207,2023-09-02 17:03:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1687r4g/overseas_assignment_gone_wrong_where_to_from_here/,9,2023

168513v,Writing was Supposed to be Fun,"I studied creative writing and literature in college, and I've had a handful of writing gigs but I've rapidly noticed a pattern: writing for others is kind of soulless. I've been policed on the tiniest of things, asked t follow templates so specific, it's like they want a robot to do it. 

I love writing. I really do. Writing plays, poetry, fiction, even essays. But trying to make it my job has been miserable. So I've been focusing my writing efforts of trying to create a manuscript, something I can get published. This, of course, is not really a reliable career, not unless I become Rowling overnight, which I won't.

The thing is, so much of my time and effort has been dedicated to writing, that now... I'm kind of at a loss. I have some acting skills, but acting also isn't something you do half-heartedly, you have to live and breathe it if you want to get any sort of profit out of it. 

I can't afford to get another degree right now, and I have to share a car with two other people, so working from home would be ideal. I keep applying to stuff, but I'm feeling kind of hopeless. Kind of useless. 

Before you say that work isn't always supposed to be fun, I know. Of course I know. But it shouldn't feel like I'm choking the spirit out of a lifelong passion either. Maybe I could teach some of my favorite creative skills?

the one thing I worry about here is not being able to support myself or my eventual family that I want.  
Currently I am a soccer coach and I run a side hustle coaching/private training business. . In the summers I can pull in about 300 a week and during the school year about 150 but its not super consistent.  
I could also work a skilled trade, I wont be as ""happy"" or ""fulfilled"" but I think in the long run owning my own business could bring a lot of satisfaction and fulfillment. I also could go the union route and that would provide the finances as well.  
I have a bachelors degree in environmental studies and a minor in political science and am 27 years old. I could never find a job in the environmental field but am not totally against it.  
I am very personable, I can talk to just about anyone, I am also very physically fit.  
any advice?",swellian23,1,1.0,4,1693665799,2023-09-02 14:43:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1684a9u/teacher_vs_skilled_trade/,9,2023

&#x200B;

Got my first job in PR 3 years ago and have always hated it. Don't even know how I managed to hold on to the job so far. Burnout hit me hard a year ago - I'm now slowly getting out of it, but I'm still low on energy and feel like I can't handle the increasing responsibilities and stress anymore.

&#x200B;

I do have an idea of what I want to do next - I've been wanting to switch my career to UX/UX writing, which I find very interesting and much more suited to my skills and personality. The problem is that I just can't apply for jobs. 

&#x200B;

Every time I sit down to write a resume, my brain goes blank and says ""I don't have the energy for this. I wouldn't be able to function properly even if I got the job. I want a break."" But as much as I want to drop everything and get on a plane somewhere, I'm afraid that it would hurt my career. Maybe I do need a recharge, but maybe it's just a fear of moving into a new career, something I just need to get over.

1680vlk,Should I do a masters degree in mental health counseling or in school psychology?,"I know that there are pros and cons to both and that it depends on what I want to do but I find both professions incredibly rewarding and I just don’t know which path to take. Right now I am a teacher and I feel like I am drowning in stress. I do like the school setting and I like working with kids, so I thought that School Psychology would be a great fit because I can work in the school setting and also I hear that it has a good starting pay and I also would have my summers free. However, I think that I would be bored since the job is focus on doing assessment. I thought of pursuing mental health counseling because of the flexibility, mobility and line of work. I like to help people and I thought that maybe I could be as cool base therapist but I see that the pay is not very good. I am mentioning the pay because it’s a big aspect for me. I know that I want to live a comfortable life and as a teacher, I have struggled financially. This would be my second masters degree so I already have a loan from my first masters degree so the salary is important. I like the mental health counseling option because I think that maybe with a certification I can be an art therapist or I can just work it out variety of settings. However, I worry about my mental health during this career and about the fact that not necessarily, I will find a high-paying job in a School as opposed to school psychology. I also thought that I want to do a doctorate in psychology after so I could have eventually anyways, the opportunity to counsel. Maybe I can do this masters degree in school psychology, and then a doctorate in psychology.

Company A - 3 years (bank)
Company B - 3 years (industry)
Company C (current role) - 1 year (bank)

Note that when I was leaving Company B, I did have a promotion offer to stay with them, however ultimately ended up deciding on C due to the perceived notion that it was a good step in my career/more responsibility/slightly better pay, etc. a year into the role however, I found that I’m miserable and was much more comfortable in industry.

167w8fb,"Got a job offer while HEAVILY pregnant, start date is 6 weeks before I give birth... how to disclose it?","Throwaway account because it's a sensitive topic.

So this is the timeline: At the beginning of 2023 I applied to a coding bootcamp and I was accepted. A company sponsored my place with the promise of a job offer if I completed the course correctly.

After being accepted I found out I was pregnant. I didn't disclose anything at that time, it was early in the pregnancy and I thought I was under no obligation to do it.

The bootcamp will finish by the end of September, I have done great so far. The company just sent me a conditional job offer letter and my contract, stating that my start date will be Nov 1st, as long as I pass all their background checks.

The problem is that my due date is mid December. I understand that I won't be entitled to any kind of paid maternity leave or maternity allowance and that's fine, what's important is that I really don't want to miss this job opportunity because of my pregnancy. This is my dream job and probably a once in a lifetime opportunity for me. I am almost 40 with no relevant experience in the sector, so I know that my chances of finding another job are almost none.

So how should I approach this with the company? Should I accept the job offer letter now and disclose my pregnancy when it is time to sign the real contract? Or should I disclose it now before accepting the offer?

I would be really happy to work from Nov 1st until I give birth (the job is mostly remote anyway) but I know that the company is not likely to employ me for just 6 weeks, are they? As much as I want the job I know it won't be possible for me to just go back to work a week after giving birth, I will need some time to recover. Maybe I should tell them that I'd be happy to come back to work after 3-6 months of giving birth?

I also don't know much about work law in a case like that, I am not aware of my rights and their obligations as a potential employer so I feel in total disadvantage when it comes to negotiating this. I'm in the UK 

I have to send a reply to their offer this week and I just don't know what to say and how to disclose everything while still showing interest in the position. I would really appreciate any opinions on this!

For clarification, even if I don't take the job I am not liable for any of the costs of the bootcamp.",Pacific_Blue,1,1.0,1,1693640444,2023-09-02 07:40:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/167w8fb/got_a_job_offer_while_heavily_pregnant_start_date/,9,2023
167w4j3,How to improve as a Dev?,"This is my first year as a back-end java developer. 
Before getting my first job I taught myself programming for around 3 years.

Only learning to personal projects that thought me some very great basics of it. 

The company I'm currently working has a great team. 
Almost all of us work remote. 
My manager is great and doesn't bother me about dead lines, he is a very great manager, which I was very luck to encounter.

**A little about the job:**

Currently at my job I work mostly developing small features and solving bugs 

We use a proprietary implementation for Microsercices architecture, that is somewhat great and easy to use. 

The proprietary implementation itself is somwthat big, and there is virtually no documentation at all about it, just the absolute basics , like for example, which microserves where developed and what are they for. 


The code as well has no documentation on it. 

**About my concerns:**
Recently I've been worried how to progress in my career. 
Although I work a while in the company. Since the begging all the guidance I had was as well the most absolute basics and now everything is for me to figure out by debugging, no docs to read. 


Sometimes the flow of code gets confusing and many bugs aren't testable because of burocracy constraints.
And that's put me really down... 

Anyway.

What I'm looking for is way to be a better developer in that sense. 

Microsercices are hard to debug and sometimes, because of layers and layers of abstractions, infer where the code will flow next isn't really obvious. 

I know that it's hard to give any meaningful advice knowing so little, but honestly anything could help.

167w0ce,"Just got a new job and haven't even started, now I'm looking at applying for another one closer to home.","  
I work as an enrolled nurse for the last 18 months. I had to put myself through school, after my divorce. I have no help, and I'm on my own, and child support is a joke. I'm currently studying full time to get my bachelors in registered nursing, so this will open up more opportunities for me, and help pay the bills and feed my kids. My kids and I lived through bad DV and have been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and anxiety. It's a daily battle to say the least.

  
Anyway, I was casual at the local hospital on the medical/surgical wards, and wherever they needed me to fill in. I was doing 50+hours a fortnight, but that got cut down at the beginning of the year, this was due to newly graduated RN's being hired, a bunch of politics going on, and mismanagement. I couldn't go permanent even though I asked multiple times over the previous year, and was told to wait until mid year to see if any positions became available.

  
So I decided to apply for a casual position at the mental health unit in the hospital, it's in the hospital, but it comes under different management and section, so it's a separate part of the health system. I hope that makes sense. I also applied for another EN position in a town an hour away (I applied for both of these places in January). Here in country Australia, it's common for towns to be this far away where I'm from, and the city is 6 hours away. Casual seemed to be the only thing that was going, so I thought I could juggle them all to get my hours up to cover bills, and still be able to study. 

  
I ended up getting a casual position in mental health in February, and love it there, but it still wasn't enough shifts. I would fill in about every 3 or so weeks for a week or two, then nothing for a few weeks. I didn't hear back from the out of town hospital, until June, when they called and I got a casual position there, and then in July a permanent position became vacant. I ended up accepting a permanent job there when the positions became available, but it's in the aged care part- I'm not keen, and have worked in aged care before and hated it, but a job is a job right now, and I couldn't turn it down. I'm supposed to start there 4 days a fortnight starting next week (4th September), but I was filling in in mental health the past 2-3 weeks, and there will be an EN position vacancy coming up and it will be 8 days a fortnight. Now I don't know what to do. I ended up missing the ad for the EN's on the wards, since I was on placement and I had no internet, and hearing how things were, I didn't know if I wanted to go permanent with all the BS that was going on and how the nurses were being treated. The duty managers have only called me in for 4 shifts since the end of January, but apparently this has been happening to a lot of the casual nurses, since the hospital is trying to use up all their money and hiring agency nurses to fill in, instead of the casual EN's. So that pissed me off, I've been so willing to work there, and let them know when I'm available, and I didn't hear anything from them.

   
I love the people that I work with in both places, I have sat down and done a list of pros and cons for both places and cannot decide. If I do apply for the job in mental health, I will most likely get the position, I have been asked to apply for it by one of the unit managers in mental health, but I feel like I will let down the people at my out of town job if I apply and get the mental health job. 

  
The pros of working in the out of town job are: I enjoy it there; more money per hour, since it's classified as a remote hospital (but it's only 4 shifts); people are nice and very friend, have made me feel very welcomed; I can work in the accident and emergency; I can juggle 4 shifts a fortnight better with uni; I can still work in mental health if they need me.

  
The cons of working in the out of town job are: it's in aged care, not where I really want to be, but it's a permanent job; travel time is adding 2 extra hours each shift; petrol money will be at least $250 a fortnight, extra petrol money if I pick up more shifts; it's 100kms away; it can be dangerous driving on the country roads in the dark, which I will have to do on most shifts; I don't know if 4 shifts a fortnight will be enough to cover my bills now; some nights I will have to stay over and will have to pay for accommodation; leaving a job I just got, and feeling like I've let down people; my kids aren't coping that well with me being gone even as a casual worker there.

  
The pros of the mental health job are: I also enjoy it; less travel time and distance, the local hospital is only 5-10 minutes away; less money spent on petrol; people are nice and friendly there; less money per hour, but it's 8 shifts a fortnight; I can be home for the kids more; not as physically demanding; can do uni work on nights and late shifts.

  
The cons of the mental health job are: I won't use a lot of my skills I've learned- it's more mental based; I can't work on the wards as a casual on the medical/surgical wards or anywhere else in the local hospital; I would not be able to work out of town, due to how many shifts I'd be working; less money per hour than the out of town position (but it's more shifts per fortnight); it may be harder to juggle uni with 8 shifts.

  
Moving is not an option for me, and going part time for uni isn't an option- I just want to get it over and done with by this time next year. My mum is also very sick and so is my dad now, and one of my children has been diagnosed with an ED, is not doing mental okay and I'm very worried about this child in particular, becoming more depressed and withdrawn, and another child of mine isn't coping very well with me being gone. I wish I would have thought more about applying for this permanent job out of town, instead of jumping in without really thinking about it.

.  
I am a people pleaser, and I would do everything to please the exhole when we were married because I didn't want to upset him, and I feel that I'm still that way. I feel like I'm not good enough and have to do what is expected of me. My exhole would make all the decisions for me- even down to what I would wear, who I could associate with, and if I could call my family or not, and for how long. So even making small decisions is very hard for me. I don't want to let down the people at my new job that I haven't even started at yet, if I apply and get this job in mental health. I'm feeling so torn about this, I want to do what is best for me, but I don't want to disappoint people. My parents think I should stay at the job out of town, only because it's 4 shifts and uni would be easier, but I don't know what's going to be best in the long run while I'm at uni, and dealing with family issues. I have struggled financially since my divorce, and I'm tired. I really don't know what will be best for me and my kids in the long run.",HopefulAcacia2023,1,1.0,0,1693639634,2023-09-02 07:27:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/167w0ce/just_got_a_new_job_and_havent_even_started_now_im/,9,2023
167vt66,"As a politician, how can I be okay with helping all victims of crimes, not just good victims but bad victims as well?","A bad victim to me would be someone that intentionally mistreats others with there words and verbally abuses them or physically abuses them.

Also, a jealous boyfriend who displays jealous, controlling, psycho behaviors when he is at the bar with his girlfriend. Like if any guy even gets near her or he sees her talking to them he gets very controlling and confrontational. This guy actually comes close to or is ready to fight with people who get near his girlfriend or talk to her. This guy is starting a fight or is willing to start one because he is controlling over his girlfriend.

I have personally met a couple of bad men like this in bars who have tried to or were looking to start fights with me over their girlfriends. Also, verbally abusive people at the bad high school I went to. I would consider these people as bad victims for sure and I wouldn’t feel as successful helping them.

Now if these jealous boyfriends who start fights with men at the bar and these verbally abusive people were in a different situation and became the victims of a major crime like a mass shooting, terrorist attack, etc. How am I suppose to help these people successfully like I would other good victims?

Even though they didn’t deserve to have what happened to them I still would consider them bad victims because of their past behavior. I wouldn’t feel successful helping them as I would people that were actually good victims.

Also, bad victims would also be murders, rapist, robbers and terrorist to me as well. I wouldn’t feel as successful helping these people as good victims to. Also, I feel like bullies sometimes are bad victims because sometimes people actually kill themselves over being bullied.

How can I help these controlling jealous boyfriends and verbally abusive people as well as criminals when they become the victims of crimes just like other good victims?",WayShowWaters,0,0.5,0,1693638902,2023-09-02 07:15:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/167vt66/as_a_politician_how_can_i_be_okay_with_helping/,9,2023

I work in a big hotel chain in Australia but mostly just customer service and I believe if I stay longer, I won't be able to get into the actual marketing itself because they are different kind of Marketing.

167ugc1,Which offer would you move forward with?,"Almost 8 months ago I accepted an offer as a new engineering graduate with Job A. I had a lot of reservations about the job, mostly being that it was primarily a desk-based role, and after going through college during COVID when everything was remote online and I didn't have a car to go anywhere I was, quite frankly, burned out from computer work. I also was concerned about the way that projects were assigned in the company- in order to get work, you have to ask for it, and as an entry level engineer I'm concerned that it will be hard to get work (and get paid) since the main office is in a different state and I don't know my coworkers that well. On the other hand, the job allowed me to stay in my home city to be near my friends and family, which at the time was all I wanted to do. Also, it provided a lot of time off, which sounded good as I'd spent so much time on school that I no longer found enjoyment in the things I used to love. It represented an opportunity to learn how to have a good work-life balance, even if I wasn't necessarily doing work that I enjoyed. I liked the idea that with their payment system, if I worked enough overtime I could take several months off a year to pursue one of my biggest passions/hobbies- volunteer work and travel. Additionally, the team bent over backwards to provide me with the offer, even when I initially declined it and later changed my mind (I was very confused and stressed and did not behave that professionally).

Over the summer, I worked an internship with company B. I ended up loving it. The work was simpler and less intellectually stimulating than the kind of work that I would find at company A, but there were a lot of young people working there and the tasks kept me active and working outdoors. I found out that I actually really like engineering when it's not on a computer all the time. I also found the company was a great place to network and take on leadership roles. I felt like I was a valued member of the team. Sometimes I felt tired due to a long and early commute and the lack of flexibility with remote options, but the outdoor component and the ability to easily socialize offset those negative components.

Company B is going to move forward with an offer on the next few days and I am completely torn about whether or not I want to reneg my acceptance at Company A. The issue is that Job A is the exact kind of role that I'd eventually want in a few years, and I really don't want to burn any bridges, but right now Job B is calling to me a lot more simply because I enjoy the work so much, am familiar with my team and get along with my coworkers, the job has a lot of prestige, and I'm young and don't have anything (relationship, pets, etc) tying me down. If the offer at B is in the location I expect, I also have some curiosity about moving out of the town I've lived in my whole life and trying something new. 

Here are some more details:

Job A
-Consultancy in my home town
-3% 401K match
-Employee owned
-74500k annual gross pay with bonuses (excluding 401k). Base salary 66500.
-Extremely flexible work hours; lots of choice in projects
-Considered one of the best consulting firms to work at for the type of work done
-3 weeks PTO; 7 holidays
-Flat, free market structure (not many opportunities for change in title)
-Comp time over base hours; can either take extra pay or more time off
-Can work from my parent's house and not pay rent; within biking distance to office

Job B
-Industry position with a company I interned at over the summer
-Work is extremely fun and enjoyable (outdoors, less technical)
-Location in small town/remote area in a different state (pop. 10K), 2 hrs from nearest airport
-Structured system for promotions every 2-3 years
-Predictable work hours; 5-4/9 schedule
-Large, publicly traded and extremely well known company in industry
-10% 401k match
-100000-114000k annual gross pay (excluding 401k) Base salary 80k
-3 weeks PTO; 10 holidays
-Rent is probably about $800-900/month",War_Wild,1,1.0,0,1693634157,2023-09-02 05:55:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/167ugc1/which_offer_would_you_move_forward_with/,9,2023

167qn1i,Making the most of Stanford?,"Hello! I’m a incoming freshman at Stanford University. I am pretty undecided on what to study, but I feel pressure from myself to make the next four years pay off in the future. I honestly worked so hard during high school and now I’m very grateful to have an amazing institution at my fingertips. 

Computer science is obviously huge at Stanford, and I find it very interesting. I used to want to do CS, but the fact that I’ll likely code addictive platforms doesn’t sit well with me. I respect it, but I just can’t wake up everyday to work on a screen 24/7.

The other option is becoming a surgeon. Honestly, I feel like it’s my calling. Maybe that’s crazy to say and maybe it’s ignorant to believe I’d be a good fit. I know I have a lot to learn, but everyone around me says I have the personality and dedication of a surgeon. I want a career that gives me energy even when it’s stressful and nearly sucks the life out of me lol, and practicing surgery seems like it’ll do that for me. My holdup is the risks involved. What if something happens and I’m 200k+ in debt? I don’t want to be stuck. The commitment just scares me honestly. Also, I value sleep and try to get at least 6 hours a night and from what I’ve heard that’s like a miracle if you’re a resident. 

I don’t know I just feel pressure to use the education in the best way possible, and I know I’ll have to explore when I get there. Does anyone have any career guidance or input?

167pa99,Struggling with Power Dynamics at Work - Need Advice,"Hello fellow Redditors,

I work as a Product Marketing Manager for a tech company, and I’ve been navigating some challenging dynamics over the past year. I wanted to share my experience and seek feedback or advice on how best to handle the situation.

Last year, when I was in a role focused on digital content and optimization, I would regularly suggest data-driven changes for our site. However, these were frequently overshadowed in favor of external consultants. This frustration led me to transition roles, hoping for a more collaborative environment.

However, in my new role, I’ve been grappling with ongoing challenges from a senior member of the content and communication team. There’s a palpable power imbalance that’s been affecting our interactions. My efforts are often met with pushback, with one of my articles even going through over 250 edits!

A noteworthy development is the recent onboarding of our new CMO. They have consistently praised my work, recognizing its significance. What’s more, they’ve also been vocal about the apparent shortcomings of the content team under the said senior VP’s leadership. While this acknowledgment from the new CMO is encouraging, it seems to be adding fuel to the already strained dynamics I’ve been experiencing.

The icing on this convoluted cake? The content team’s recent insinuation that my article might’ve been AI-assisted – an entirely unfounded claim. Especially when considering our company’s clear inclination towards and investment in AI.

With the complex layers of power play, intensified by the new CMO’s perspectives, I feel a bit lost in navigating the situation. Has anyone been through something similar? How did you handle it? I would greatly appreciate any insights or advice.",Winter-Feeling_,1,1.0,0,1693618230,2023-09-02 01:30:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/167pa99/struggling_with_power_dynamics_at_work_need_advice/,9,2023
167omct,First week on the job and I already had my first crying session. Bad sign?,"I go into this new company, motivated and with fresh eyes. I was stunned to see everything so outdated. Lots of printed paperwork when it can easily be available on our portal (there's literally two rooms full of boxes and cabinets of paper).. Im experienced- having worked in larger companies with larger resources. Im not used to this. Looking to make an impression, let's be real, and help because I do enjoy that- I look all around at the things that can be worked on, improved on. First week I'm already being vocal with my ideas which - big mistake, I know now.

I sat down with one of the directors in a different dept (im a manager), and she's explaining her role and the role of her team to me. She tells me she's trying to digitize things, and I eagerly offer my services. I tell her I'm excellent at creating fillable PDFs (which I am- I freelance as well and I love doing that) and that I'd be more than happy to help. I even offered to assist on cleaning out all the old files we don't need when she mentioned working on that. Maybe it was my approach who knows, because she took that as me telling her what to do, got upset, went to our superior and expressed her frustrations. I know because after a sit down with her (I saw her go into his office), our superior calls for a meeting for all the directors and myself (only manager), and it was a bs meeting about a whole bunch of nothing he probably made up that morning just to really say- stay within your role, no one is bigger than anyone here. Things are currently being done to fix things around the office, etc.

I'm not an idiot, of course that was directed at me.

Am I wrong?? I was just trying to help and just because I touched your ego, you get upset? She's a boomer- I'm a millennial. So I should've seen why she would take my advice as an insult to her work.

I’m good at a lot of subjects and arts and am learning my 4th language but I still am not sure. 
    
    I’ve always had a special interest in maths and physics and natural stuff. I thought about med (surgery, dental school, dermatology…) but the years and debt are not worth it. I’ve also considered astrophysics and aerospace engineering since I’ve always liked doing researches about it but I’m not sure.
 
    I first started learning coding at school when I was about 14 and was quite good at it but never considered it as a job. But seeing how rewarding the tech industry is, I thought about becoming a software engineer and learned a good amount of html, css and Python and plan on learning more like JavaScript because I was told starting early is good. 
  
     I’m still not great but I do enjoy it fairly. 
What made me really interested in software engineering are the problem solving (math), building, and creativity it takes to make websites and apps and even the art into making those appealing to the user.  

    That being said, I still can’t help but think there might be other careers that are more suitable for me and I’m horrified by the idea that I might not like what I’m doing after it’s too late.

167j2s7,How do I pivot from NP management into Business Management?,"Hi all,

I (27y/o F) have been working in the nonprofit environmental sector for about 6, and have worked as a manager, coordinator and director for approx. 4 years. I have decided to leave the industry for the meantime to pursue higher pay in another industry. My interests include project management, business management, accounting, and human resources. 

I plan to eventually get my MBA, which would not only push me further in the NP industry but would also fill in my knowledge gaps in private business operations. Prior to completing my MBA, I am interested in finding a job (not quite entry level) in business that would help boost my resume for when I have my degree.

I'm curious what job titles I might be qualified for? 6 years of full time work, 4 years of director-level management, with a bachelors.

If anyone could brainstorm some ideas for me, that could really narrow my focus a bit. Thank you!",Ok-Persimmon4097,1,1.0,4,1693602316,2023-09-01 21:05:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/167j2s7/how_do_i_pivot_from_np_management_into_business/,9,2023

167haim,Stuck in bartending > bad car accident > now unemployed and struggling to find work,"I'm a mess of a case.  For the past 5 years I have been stuck in restaurant work/bartending.  I have an MFA and BA in Acting (I know..) and an Associates in communication plus 12 university teaching credits under my belt.  Been trying to break into acting roles while securing a teaching job since moving to LA but to no avail.  Bartending is a lot for me.  Extremely ate nights, lots of physical work that beats up my body, tons of drunk people with unpleasant personalities, no social life because the only time off is when everyone else is asleep or working.

Well, back in March I was in a bad car accident.  No real serious long-term injuries, but some bad burn scars on my hands and legs.  I was out of commission while recovering for a long time and lost my bartending job (right-to-work state).  My hands kinda hurt still so I can't go back into tending bar anyway without serious discomfort (I've tried at home).  I have no car so I'm trying to find remote/WFH opportunities but I'm having so much trouble.

I just wanna get back on my feet.  Is anybody looking for somebody who is a good communicator, customer service rep, teacher?

167ha71,Didnt get job because I seemed uninterested?,"So I’ve been looking around for a new job and I keep failing the interviews. This job was a data center technician role for AWS and the first interview it was a group interview with 2 managers and they both asked me about 3 questions each. I never did a STAR interview before so I was nervous and caught off guard with some questions.  A couple days later they denied me but left feedback to my recruiters that “If we had one more spot available we would’ve chose you”. So a week later my recruiter got me another interview with AWS for the same role but a different location. I showed up a hour early, prepared, read my notes, etc. This time it was 4 managers and just me. They asked me around 8-10 questions each. I thought the interview went way better then the precious one because I answered using the star method. Come to find out today my recruiter told me I didn’t get the job and they left the feedback to my recruiter “lack of energy and drive so they were under the impression you were more so just there vs actually interested and wanted to be there”. I also had a interview two days ago with apple and it was also a STAR method interview and I thought it went good but apparently not because I got denied. Next week have 3 interviews but none of them are using the star method so I hope it goes well. Very discouraged and sad. I have social anxiety so hearing that I seemed uninterested just hurts my soul. Should I try to take a few shots before a interview next time? I’m not even a drinker but I get more social.

167gvav,How many job hops before you start limiting your prospects?,"Conventional wisdom is you get one ""free"" pass to job hop one time in your career. Maybe that was a bad fit, etc. I burned that one pass after getting RIFed in May from a job I'd only been with for 18 months. My job before that, I was with for 3+ years. In this economy, I had to take a terrible, toxic job to pay the bills, but as I've already burned my one freebie card on the RIF, I feel like I need to commit to this job for at least 5-10 years, if not the rest of my career. My question is, in everyone's experience, how many job hops have you been able to get away with realistically, and if/when did people start seriously questioning it?

In kind of a bittersweet mood because I'm about to embark on what may be the final vacation of the remainder of my life - and I'm only getting it because I negotiated the dates before I started. We don't really do time off at this new company; you get ""unlimited PTO"" but they make it so hard to use that the average employee takes about 8.3 hours per year (that's *hours*, not days). Since this is now my ""forever job,"" consequently, I'll never get PTO again.

167god7,I am at my wits end at my job,"I work in events. I've been here 7 months, I've worked for this company before in a different department at a different location several years back.

* I was never trained on anything. I asked a coordinator about this a few days ago and she confirmed that the training here and the communication is just non-existent. Several people have come in and out of my position, many only lasting a few months.
* I asked my boss if she could go over a few things with me, maybe if she had a template or a checklist to share, she told me ""It's just common sense""
* She has never prepped me for any meetings. I was supposed to form a document and take it to our weekly staff meetings, she never told me this. A coordinator brought it up to me after 4 weeks of working here.
* During meetings is the only kind of ""training"" she gives me. She will pick apart my projects and it's very embarrassing and also rude to the other staff because they are busy and it ends up being a long meeting. They have even mentioned it to me themselves that they don't like that she does it, it makes everyone uncomfortable.
* After asking this, she scheduled me to work 3 days of her event, serving food. This is not in my job description, I politely declined. She got very upset and retaliated, blowing up my phone on a Saturday I was out with my family. She made it seem like my job was being threatened if I didn't work her event. So I compromised with her.
* Later, she put me on the schedule to work the other manager's event, didn't even ask me. It was for a Friday night until 12am. I said no. I tried to compromise and said I would work a lunch, within the time that is my typical work schedule. She said fine and gave me 2 lunches to serve food. They were chit chatting in her office together while I was out serving food.
* I noticed they take at LEAST 1 PTO day a week and when they do come in, they're only here for about 4 hours. I printed out the events for this month: I'm working 13, other manager is working 3, my boss is working 1. Next month: I'm working 9, other manager is working 2, my boss is working 1. I am exhausted.

I have gone to HR about the other manager screaming at me. I have also gone to HR about the serving situation and in his own words said it sounded like ""hazing"" and when I said no ""retaliation"". So he is aware. I think I'm going to go in next week and start a file because the uneven work load is completely unfair.  
  
TLDR; My boss is a domineering person who has been with the company for 25 years. She is known to not be collaborative and difficult to work with. She makes me work in other departments to serve her events and when I decline, she retaliates. We now have very uneven work loads where I am working 95% of the projects coming in while she and the other manager take multiple days off a week.",Southern-Reaction-38,1,1.0,5,1693596751,2023-09-01 19:32:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/167god7/i_am_at_my_wits_end_at_my_job/,9,2023
167gksw,Is it a bad decision to quit my job without another job lined up right now?,"I know this is ultimately my decision but I just want to hear from some unbiased people because I have quite a lot of opinions from people in my life. 

I graduated in 2018 and have been working in marketing / project management since then. I got a job at a good company in 2021 and now I’ve been there two years. 

Unfortunately though in these last few months I’ve been having issues because of a few of my coworkers. 

Firstly my manager helped me get the job and we are family friends outside of work (my significant others family member). But to be frank, as much as I like her as a person, she’s a bad manager. She discourages me from asking important questions which can be very frustrating. If I don’t ask questions and I do something wrong, she’s disappointed with me too. In our line of work, sometimes mistakes happen. I’d like to think I probably make around the same amount of mistakes as she does but whenever she makes a mistake, a lot of the time she plays it off but if I do, she makes sure to lecture me about it. I can be a bit sensitive but I’ve never really worked with someone who makes it feel as personal as she does which can be very demotivating for me.  

In addition, I have one person I work with who’s essentially in my same position who’s extremely incompetent. He constantly makes large mistakes and leaves work unfinished for others to have to pick up the slack. Probably 90% of our “shared” work actually ends up being my work because even if I ask him to do it, he figures out some reason that he can’t. He has many other issues that would take awhile for me to detail here but the issue is he’s hard to work with and incompetent. 

My manager is fully aware that he can barely do his job since I’ve been vocal to her about my issues with him. We’re not held to the same standards at all and when I voiced my concerns she told me “you should just keep doing it and maybe you’ll get a raise eventually.” When I asked her if she could be more transparent if it WOULD equate to a raise she told me she “can’t guarantee anything.” 

Also just to add this, I don’t want to go above her head with these issues because I feel like this would almost definitely strain our relationship both at work and outside of work for understandable reasons. 

This brings me to my job search which has been ongoing for the past probably 5 months? I’ve been applying on a semi regular basis and I’ve had multiple interviews but nothing has worked out yet. It seems to me that this field is pretty saturated and there’s not a lot of work right now. Even when I do find something that seems to be a good fit, a lot of times it’s not a competitive salary that I would be looking for with 5 years of experience. 

So I’m tempted to just quit so I can focus on doing more applications. I have some savings but I want to travel this coming year so I would need to work to pay bills still and my plan is to work as a server in the mean time since I have those skills and it’s pretty easy to get hired. 

Why I’m leaning towards quitting even though I don’t have something lined up is lately because my mental health has been taking a hit from this. It’s hard not to take my situation personally especially since my manager is not a random person but actually someone I know outside of work. I’ve been crying multiple times a week for awhile now and because this has been building up it’s harder and harder to be okay with my coworkers attitudes. 

It would be nice to have a break from stressful corporate stuff and just chill out at least for a few weeks or a couple months but there’s also no guarantee of when I’d get a new job so that worries me a bit. 

Is it dumb to quit this job with the market looking bad right now? Or do you think it’s worth it in this case? 

Thanks for any advice really appreciate it.",Ilikehamburgerslol,0,0.5,1,1693596528,2023-09-01 19:28:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/167gksw/is_it_a_bad_decision_to_quit_my_job_without/,9,2023

I think that’s absolutely crazy cause i’m only going to be gone for 6 days and we have multiple people that can cover my position while i’m gone. I work at kinda like a mom and pop restaurant but i really don’t understand how i can’t have my hours back when we have a lot of people that work.

I worked hard to have an expertise in international trade. I kept learning and learning on subjects I was curious about. I am very much career focused and I sacrificed a lot for my independence. I got finally offered a position in mighty Europe a year ago and relocated here. But only to learn that the company was seeking to use me for the bad. They scammed me and when I wanted to quit, they said I had a contract. So I waited for a year, adapted to very little pay and kept improving myself.

After 1 year of a job search, I finally landed a role. I was given a start date of 7th Aug (1 week post my last interview) and signed an offer letter. Suddenly, the HR emailed me saying my start date has to be delayed by a couple of days. Cue 4 weeks later and I did not receive a new start date. 

Every week the HR would reassure me that I still had the role and there was an internal delay. 

I finally got exasperated and decided to have an F2F. Today I learnt, that in order for me to join, they need 1 final signature. Unfortunately the CXO is being investigated for fraud. Hence my offer is in limbo, because there is nobody to sign it. 

Does anybody have experience with this, what should I do? I really like the role and I see this helping me in my career. Any advice is appreciated, I'm lost and scared.

167epq1,Starting to feel depressed and overworked. How to overcome this?,"

I am starting to feel depressed as I am overworked and overwhelmed with a barrage of tasks at work. Even after work I think about the things left on my plate. I don't seem to enjoy things I used to do anymore. I used to love my alone time but now I can't stop thinking about work and it bothers me a lot. 

 Even my colleagues are starting to burn out also. Employee morale is at an all time low in our team. Other teams have been witnessing mass resignations. People are wearing many hats to fill in responsibilities. Timelines are delayed.

I just moved into this company two months ago after my friend referred me here. My previous company was boring and no opportunities for growth but pays me way above market value. My current company has a lot of growth opportunities but the things to do keep on piling up. I took a paycut to be here and I regret it so much. Everything is urgent. Stakeholders are bugging me but I'm also putting out the fire from adhoc requests of my manager and skip level manager. I already communicated this to my manager but I'm getting the opposite response. He gave me more tasks despite the pressing matters I need to finish. I did not like that he didn't inform me I have to present to the skip level manager the findings I had. I was caught by surprise. We had a 1:1 meeting two hours before the big presentation but never informed me about it. I looked like a fool because I wasn't prepared. I think this heavily affected my skip level manager's impression of me. 

I am on the verge of thinking of resigning also but I'm afraid my short tenure will be bad for my CV. This company is also good for my experience history.

What should I do to overcome this? Thank you for your suggestions.",ramenmaster2021,3,1.0,4,1693592215,2023-09-01 18:16:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/167epq1/starting_to_feel_depressed_and_overworked_how_to/,9,2023

Not knowing what I wanted to do in college most of my time ended me up with this major. I don’t dislike the major at all, but I’m aware of job prospects not being great with it alone. For this reason, along with my parents wanting me to, I’ve decided to go to graduate school to pursue a degree in Business Analytics to become a Business Analyst. I have no prior knowledge or experience with tech and I’ve heard having a Masters makes you stand out more anyways. My only main worry is that I may struggle with learning features of tech like coding, but I still feel like this is my best path going forward. Any thoughts?

167bbwa,Possible new employer left a proposed editing suggestion in an automated email. Should I tell them?,"Two days ago I did one of those awkward pre-recorded phone interviews for a job, and after completion I received an automated email about next steps.

I'm wondering if it would be off-putting to light-heartedly email them to let them know about it, or if it would be appealing and possibly show an attention to detail.

1679inq,Advice for weird work situation,"I have a great job, with one of the best managers.

I travel a lot, i have flexibility on where I work and if I need anything, I get it no questions asked. Salary is normal and I have a nice car.

Recently I have been assigned a small position of power. I have some colleagues reporting to me now. When I was promoted, i got a raise of 300 dollars which I thought was a bit pathetic, since I work a lot and now I have people reporting to me.

I couldn’t help but checking a bit of my colleagues out and I was a bit shocked. 
It seems that in my function I am the least paid. and it was even worse before that little raise which I thought was pathetic. I was also quite irritated to find out that another team member that came from another department is a lot less paid than I am even. Highest paid colleague makes more than 10k more.

I know that this can happen, even though I was there before all of them and have the most experience. I decided to keep my mouth shut and not say anything. I thought that I could have been accused of snooping around, and to be honest I genuinely am quite happy at work.

Fast forward to recently, I found out that in one of our HR platforms (we have several), the team no longer reports to me.

I wrote a mail to my boss about something not totally unrelated and played dumb, asking why this happened. He brushed it off pointing me to HR.

HR replied about that unrelated bit and ignored this issue. I specifically replied asking about this issue and I got no reply since.

All this has made me suspect that they did this on purpose. To hide that I am under paid rather than level things up.

Now I don’t know how to behave, because I don’t know if I am in the right here, and I have a good job. But feel really betrayed and offended by this. Am i right to feel like this or?",Old_Chipmunk7927,2,1.0,7,1693580440,2023-09-01 15:00:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1679inq/advice_for_weird_work_situation/,9,2023
167850q,How can I work remotely as a Socio-political Writer?,"Hello everyone ✌🏻 First post. I appreciate that you decided to take the time to read this!

I'm a blogger (32, M from Bahrain), with plenty of articles on different socio-political subjects. One of my articles was recently published on the official page of ""Atheist Alliance International' - which is quite flattering; given their size, history and UN recognition. 

However, I'm not particularly keen on monotizing my own blog, and I'd rather find a separate job as a socio-political writer and researcher. Remotely.

To achieve this, I prepared a statement letter and pursued up to 12 Coursera certificates, while applying to haundreds of job openings from a verity of different websites.

Primarily: LinkedIn, Indeed, Upwork and Instagram.

More recently: Wellfound, Contra and WeWorkRemotely.

I mostly applied to (International / US) companies, NGOs, Non-profits, media centres, think tanks, etc

Still no luck, though. The only responses I got were: 

1. Standard rejection letters.

2. Scams.

3. On-site jobs in my home country (Bahrain), which I no longer live in. I moved to South America last year, and I'd like to stay there. 

What should I be doing instead?

Thanks!

Here is a rundown on all my qualifications:

Bachelor's Degree: 

Logistics & Transportation.

Coursera certificates:

2. Social Norms & Social Change II - UNICEF.

I hope you're all doing well. I've been pondering something lately, and I believe this community is the perfect place to seek guidance. It's clear that traditional education rarely teaches us how to become financially successful or wealthy. It seems like this knowledge is hidden away, mostly accessible on the internet.

I'm eager to learn from your experiences and insights on how to start the journey towards financial prosperity. Here are a few questions I have in mind:

1. **Steps to Wealth**: What are the crucial steps or strategies one should follow to build wealth, especially when starting with limited resources?

2. **Educational Path**: Are there specific fields of study or resources you recommend for gaining the knowledge and skills necessary for financial success?

3. **Essential Skills**: In your opinion, what are the key skills or qualities that someone should develop to increase their chances of becoming rich?

4. **Language and Communication**: Do you think there are languages or communication skills that can provide an advantage in the pursuit of wealth? 

I truly appreciate any advice, personal anecdotes, or recommended resources you can share. Let's help each other on this journey towards financial well-being!

1671u8y,How to bring up that the job/role was not as described?,"Started a new job a few months ago. I was told I'd be owning certain tools, systems and processes. However any feedback I have about said tools and systems is almost completely disregarded. I'm not even given the full permissions I need in said systems that I need to do my job and have to reach out to my boss to get her to do what I need done to finish requests. For one critical system Im supposed to be owning, Im not even invited to important meetings to discuss it. 

The job was sold to me as being the system owner who would shape the technology the team uses, and it just feels like my boss needed an order taker to handle the things she didn't want to do. Meanwhile, she wants to dictate how I even handle those requests, going as so far as building things out and saying finish this. Even when I flag what they are doing won't give us valuable insights or if the recommended practices around something necessitate a different tool its ignored. 

I'm honestly livid about this situation, as I left a completely WFH job with good health insurance only to end up in a situation no better then the one I left. I honestly want to bring this up, but I'm not sure what's the best way to word it. I don't want to be fired in this tough job market nor do I want to rush to the office to be in a chair at exactly 8 AM only to have nothing to do until my boss graciously assigns me a task because I can't be trusted to be more than her glorified shit taker.

I like my team and the job scope has been alright, but career progression would undoubtedly be slow given the nature of the company. 

Recently I was offered an internal promotion to another team, the scope would be different but still touching a bit on my existing job role. I'm largely hesitating as I am still attached to my current role (despite some grievances, I wouldn't say I'm unhappy), but the experiences the new role would bring be beneficial too. 

I am wondering how anyone makes a decision at a time like this? I've spoken to a few of the team members and their experiences have been positive as well.

1670ddm,Pivoting career away from tech/desk job?,"I currently work as a data person, I say person as it’s been very broad ranging from engineer, scientist, to analyst. At times I really enjoy learning about modelling and I enjoy coding. I think I prefer software development programming to data engineering as I enjoy feeling like I’m creating features that others can use. At other times I struggle with the idea of sitting behind a desk 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, I can’t help but think is this it? I don’t want mobility and strength to suffer over a 40 year career and while I exercise I think I’d be better off moving constantly throughout the day.

I am really interested in the environment and wildlife and also nutrition. The problem is I’ve worked with people who have pivoted from things like ecology to data science and they prefer it now. Which makes me wonder: have others pivoted the other way? From a desk job in tech to an outdoorsy job and enjoyed it?

I don’t a great salary but it is enough. I don’t want to go back to Uni and retrain either so I understand my options are limited there. Maybe an option for me would just be to talk this out with a therapist or something and work on incorporating movement throughout the day, even then I struggle with just staring at a screen for so long.

16702t3,How did you guys make the jump?,"So for context 28M just graduated college (took some time off failed out of school the first go and went back two years ago)

During that time I worked manufacturing jobs and managed a couple of retail stores. Usually 30kish jobs the manual labor could get in the 50s if I worked over time some years.

I got hired at a bank for a pretty decent paying Customer service role. 50k which in my area I'm in the top 15% salary wise. Been there about a year now, and I love the company, love my boss, don't hate the work.

BUT 

I just don't see a high ceiling here. I could get into management or a specialized department but even then I'd be in the 80k-100k a year range.

166z095,Is this career development or am I being taken advantage of?,"I’ve been in my role for three years, and there’s a relatively clear next step in the hierarchy. Generally, people tend to get promoted to the next role after a few years. 

I have asked my employer what I can do to earn a promotion to the rank above me. They’ve told me I have to “de facto” act as that rank, however I’ve already trained several people and taken on work that has traditionally been given to the more senior role. I am struggling to pinpoint what more I can do, but every time performance reviews roll around and I enquire about progression, they keep giving me the same reasons. You need to be more active in helping people, act like the senior role, etc.  At this point, I’m actually doing more than what those in the role above me are doing. I’ve seen people doing less being promoted above me. Part of me wants to continue trying to earn it, but part of me thinks that if there was any intention, it would have happened already. 

Realistically, what are the chances they’re seriously invested in my development versus just taking me for a ride? Is it normal to ask employees to act in a senior role before potentially considering promotion? Part of me also feels as though I’ve been doing higher level work at a lower wage, am I actually just being taken advantage of?",Ambiguous-Insect,1,1.0,1,1693548513,2023-09-01 06:08:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/166z095/is_this_career_development_or_am_i_being_taken/,9,2023
166xyxt,Ignored Red flags and now I’m in a career crisis,"I’m having a dilemma. I’ve been job hunting for over a year now. I’m a fairly recent graduate with very little relevant work experience. I did do a paid internship while in college, but unfortunately even with making connections it didn’t land me a full time opportunity post graduation. That company said it was due to budget cuts more than anything, which I’m led to believe since they laid off over 1/3 of their company right after my internship concluded. 

Since I’ve been job hunting I’ve gotten very desperate for more stable income. I’ve been working part time retail since April, and as someone who has minor physical disabilities it has been extremely taxing on my body. So I got a little desperate and made a post practically begging for an opportunity on LinkedIn. Strangely, it did work, however, the opportunity has come with nothing but red flags. To start, it’s a long term indefinite contract position. The hours are not really guaranteed, but my boss told me they could guarantee me a minimum of 25 hours a week. This was already way lower than what I needed since I needed full time employment but I was struggling and took the opportunity anyway. I was made aware during the interview that I would need to purchase my own software because I’m technically a contractor, which is annoying but whatever. The pay is below the market rate, and I was not informed that I would basically not be eligible for benefits. The way they hired me was through essentially a staffing agency I guess? And that agency has been nothing but a nightmare. They don’t answer emails, they got my job title wrong in the offer letter (and won’t correct it), and every link on how to submit time properly is broken. 

I received a call from another company this week asking if I’d be open to an opportunity I’d put in an inquiry about several months ago. I told them I’d just taken this opportunity, so I wouldn’t be available for full time. However, after having a meeting with other contractors today I’ve been informed that I can technically choose my own hours entirely with the company I’m contracted for. I re-reached out to the company that called me yesterday to see if they’d still be up for a chat/interview because the red flags just keep pouring in with my contracting company. The other contractors say some weeks they can swing 30-40 hours but many weeks they can only manage to get 10 or so and that is definitely not enough for me to even really consistently pay off my car on. 

My boss guilted me in the interview saying they don’t like people who stay short term (she mentioned feeling disappointed in someone for leaving after six months). If I can swing this full time opportunity I definitely think, despite it being technically a lower hourly rate, it would be in my best interest to take it sheerly because it’s stable hours. Since I can pick my hours at my contracting company would it be reasonable to cut down my hours to a few hours a night throughout the week? I’d of course talk to my boss and make sure that would be do-able before stringing them along, but it would allow me to stay and make decent relationships there for at least a few months.

My boss is fairly well known in my industry and I’m absolutely terrified id be black balled if I quit within the first few months (or if the other company finally decides to pick up the pace, a few weeks.) I need consistency in my finances as the instability is destroying me mentally. I don’t want to lose a good title and possibly good relationships from my contractor but at the same time the employment isn’t necessarily stable, I get no benefits, holidays are not paid, and I am not eligible for PTO. 

If I stay with the contractor I have to also keep my retail job meaning many days I’m working 8AM-11PM. I’m exhausted and I don’t know what to do. I know it’s too soon to be so discouraged, but I feel like I was a little blindsided by this contract opportunity. I’m very new to the professional industry so maybe it’s my fault I didn’t ask enough questions in the interview about benefits and things, but I’ve never worked for a company that didn’t compensate holidays if their business is closed. 

I don’t want to ruin my reputation in my community but I’m also terrified of unstable income with no paid days off for the foreseeable future. 

Maybe I’m just overwhelmed because I just started this week and it feels like all this information is just being absolutely dumped on me but my bosses pre-hire guilt trip, and her status, scares me. 

What should I do? I’m definitely planning to stay and say nothing until I have a formal offer letter from another company, but that could be next week or many months away. If I were to get another opportunity quickly I’m not positive I’d be trained enough in this position to be able to effectively work on my own in the evenings since the company largely runs 8am-5Pm and I’d be working probably 7pm-10PM. Would it be worse for me to stay and possibly not do my job well or stick it out and just do my best? Any advice here would be greatly appreciated. I started the contract position on Monday and have been trying to stay calm but I am beyond stressed.

TL;DR: I took an opportunity because I was kind of desperate and chose to ignore red flags and now I’m terrified of potentially leaving because my boss has power in my field.",Mobeans88,1,1.0,0,1693544973,2023-09-01 05:09:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/166xyxt/ignored_red_flags_and_now_im_in_a_career_crisis/,9,2023
166xvh2,Complicated story with my lay off situation,"There’s a restructure happening at my work and I have been let go few months ago (mainly due to the incompetence of the manager handling this decision). I’ve been told I need to hand over my work in a month and the rest garden leave. Month passes by I have no one to hand over my work to and last day of my employment they ask me if I can stay one more months. I agree if I get a bonus. They agree.

Another month passes by and it’s again the last day of my employment and they come up to me with an offer to stay 3 more months on another role (because of the project I’m working on is very specific and only I can execute it). I agree if I get a bonus again. They agree. 

Three months is over and it’s the last day of my employment and the top management asks me if I want to stay to continue the project as they want to build on it. The catch is it can only (for now) be a freelance role because they cannot add a headcount (mainly because the person who took the decision of letting me go is blocking it since he would lose his face). The official offer is not on the table yet. I’m quite mentally drained from going back and forth every month but not taking any of this personally, and the freelance role would be better paid.

166xqz9,Fixed contract not extended - hurt,"Hi, I had a fixed contract with this company. At the beginning, I was SO in love with the company, the job, I had never been so exited and looking forward to a job like this. It was also my first step in my career as before that, I only had blue collar jobs. 

I was so optimistic and naive. 

My first step and it ended horribly. I did finish what I had to, but I’m very hurt and disappointed that they didn’t want to extend it. The whole story has been so weird and I don’t even know whom to believe anymore as I still don’t know the reasons I was rejected. All the managers I worked with directly gave me positive feedback, but now I don’t know if they said something else behind my back to their managers.

I don’t know what to do. I feel extremely stupid, hurt, sad, angry, disappointed, scared. I had approached them three times and asked about extending it, but they were all so meekish about it. 

I feel so irritated by the whole story that I’m not even sure I should stay connected with these people on Linkedin. I’m scared to take another step now too and haven’t really applied for anything yet. I kind of want ‚revenge‘ if that makes sense, because I was so loyal and devoted and feel betrayed now.

166wkpf,Do I test my luck?,"Hi, I’m 21 years old and in my final semester of a Computer Science BS. I’ve been working for the past month or so on computer architecture projects since unfortunately I realized very late into my education that I really enjoy low level programming and hardware. I don’t have any job experience or internships and I was planning on using my final semester to create meaningful projects to hopefully land an interview.

I was just recently given the opportunity to work at a research laboratory with robotics for my university part time which allows for the employees to work on many low level programming projects and robotics projects with decent funding alongside a guaranteed internship I’ll be given after some time, the main issue is is that I’ll need to sign up for a masters for computer science to work under the lab, all paid by the lab.

This very much terrifies me haha, I’ve usually been told a Computer Science masters is not too useful and experience is more useful, but by getting a masters I’ll be able to have both work experience and an internship in the area I like instead of taking a gambit with applying for jobs after graduation with no experience.
I really don’t know what to do and I’d like some advice from anyone that got a masters in Computer Science to see if it’s worth it; just to give some context I’m planning to eventually work somewhere in the space agency with a heavy hardware + low level software focus.

I feel so disorganized, coming home to things that have been out for a couple of days, my rent is increasing since just got notice of my lease renewal. I know I'm not making enough as a server and delivery driver and I keep thinking if could of stuck with my safety tech and or even medical career to make ends meet but I would be mentally drained day by day. I know I have true potential as someone with ADHD. I keep thinking it's my ADHD for the things I tried like safety, nursing, and or trying to be a teacher with all these set backs or negatives.

 I have tried medication like adderall, vyvanse, guafacine, strattera with no luck, 10 mg adderall did however, help me knock out deliveries one at a time and not get distracted as easily by my phone ect. Especially if there were like 40 stops I would just be robot and go one after the other. medical assistant job was really not for me the environment and the nature of the job. as a fed ex delivery driver it’s too much mind wandering between deliveries, there is adventure to it but the driving and waiting doesn’t equate to the adventure parts like seeing deer, squirrels, venturing off road occasionally, interacting with dogs/cats/people, or observing angry drivers.

I hope I can soon find a solution to my adhd or find a job that keeps me stimulated enough to allow me to be present and not in the clouds 70% of the time,

166ug4v,Hopeful Yet Uncertain,"Hey folks,  
  
I wanted to share my recent experience with job interviews and get some input. So, after applying for remote positions on various platforms, I finally managed to land an interview after a month of rejections. To be honest, I was pretty nervous, but I sucked it up and accepted the invite.  
  
The first interview was with the Vice President and the head of the technical department. We had a chat, and they even gave me a couple of compliments about how motivated I appeared and how my background was quite impressive. They mentioned they had around 70 applicants, which was a surprise. After that, I felt a bit down because, with 70 applicants, what are the odds?  
  
Fast forward a couple of days, and bam, I get invited for a second interview, this time with the CEO. I was not expecting that at all, so my nerves shot up again. I tried not to get too hopeful to avoid being devastated if it didn't work out.  
  
During the second interview, I met the CEO and some of the folks from the first one. They actually congratulated me for making it this far, saying only a few people did. That was a morale boost. Once again, I think I left a good impression, at least I hope so. The CEO even told me that I seemed really promising for the job. But here's the kicker: he mentioned that when he looked at my resume, he wondered if it would be a mistake to hire me because of my technical skills and potential. I tried to explain that I'm still exploring my interests and this job would help me expand my horizons.   
  
We talked more, and they kept praising my skills. The vice president even asked me if i would be interested in a job in another department. However, at the end, the CEO said, ""I'm sure you'll succeed in whatever you do, whether it's here or somewhere else."" And that hit me like a rejection.  
  
I might be overthinking this, given that it's my first interview ever. It did feel like they genuinely liked me, but then again, were they just being polite? Also, why would they offer me another job just to be nice? I'm totally confused at this point, and it's only been a day. They're supposed to give me an answer tomorrow, but I'm super anxious.  
  
What do you all think? Am I just being paranoid? Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated! 🙏",DareDevil_23,1,1.0,3,1693534337,2023-09-01 02:12:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/166ug4v/hopeful_yet_uncertain/,9,2023

About 2 years ago, a product manager position opened up in the company. Considering the limited upward mobility in UI design, I coincidentally switched roles and became a product manager.

In the first six months after transitioning, I encountered numerous challenges. It was tough for me to present compelling product data to prove the value of my requirements, and I often faced situations where the features I envisioned couldn't be implemented. I pretty much started from scratch in cultivating my data analysis skills and methods, and, finally able to handle a product on my own. Recently, I've also started learning Python so I can communicate better with developers. I find it a bit challenging, I often forget syntax I've learned before, or get stuck on a bug for ages. Because of these hurdles, I feel like time is slipping away, and sometimes I even contemplate giving up (I actually took a break for a while). 

I realize my issue - as a product manager, there's a ton to learn, and I'm not great at organizing or summarizing what I learn daily.
