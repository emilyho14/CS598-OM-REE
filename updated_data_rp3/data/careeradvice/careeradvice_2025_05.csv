1l0aycz,What to do if you’re graduating college but haven’t had an internship? (Finance),"Hi all! My friend just graduated with a BBA in Finance, but hasn't had any internships. While he graduated magna cum laude from Georgetown, he's struggling to find a job now, as he didn't do summer internships for finance-related roles, but worked in a customer service job throughout college and during the summer. He's done internships in other fields, namely related to criminal justice, but those didn't result in return offers, as the firm was federally funded and has strict hiring limits. (He did a great job and has great recommendation letters from this firm, but can't be hired there at the moment.) He's stuck without a job now that he's graduated and doesn't want to continue working the customer service job he had throughout college. Any advice for him to find a job now?

1l0adog,"Is a Top Online MAcc Worth It for a Consulting/Finance Role, or Should I Consider Cheaper Credit Options or an MBA?","I’m starting a full-time consulting role in August at a public accounting firm (business process, risk and controls consultant), and I’ve been thinking seriously about pursuing a CPA in the future—not necessarily for audit or tax, but to support a long-term career in financial services and consulting.

Here’s my situation:

- I don’t have a business/accounting undergrad background.
- I’ve been accepted into two highly ranked online Master of Accounting (MAcc) programs—Illinois ($25K, possibly less with scholarship decision in June) and UNC ($70K need to accept by 6/1).
- Alternatively, I could take non-degree community college courses to hit the 150 credit hour requirement for CPA eligibility, which would be way cheaper but doesn’t give me a business degree I’d like.
- I’ve also been told that a top MBA down the line might offer more flexibility and ROI, especially since I want to stay in consulting and not go into audit.

I’d love advice from anyone who’s been in this position or works in the field:

- Is the MAcc still worth it even if I’m not doing audit or tax?
- Would a cheaper route to 150 credits + CPA be just as beneficial?
- Is it better to save now and aim for a top MBA later, especially without a business background?

1l09mk8,I don't know how to continue my software engineer career.,"First of all, I would like to start by saying that I love my job, and I want to improve myself as much as possible in this field.

I have been working as an Angular developer for 1 year now and I am learning React in my spare time. I want to improve myself as much as possible and find a job abroad (I currently live in Turkey).

However, since Frontend Developers are generally seen as the entry level sector of Software Engineering and usually receive a low salary (compared to other fields), I am not sure if it is a skill that will be enough for me to go abroad.

Another reason why I'm learning React is because I'm not happy with my current salary. Plus, Angular jobs are much, much less than React and they are usually looking for seniors.

So I am unsure about how to move forward in my career, I am already working as an Angular developer, should I leave React aside and dedicate myself completely to Angular? Should I continue learning React as I make my way for new FE job? Or should I add BE under my belt? I'm really undecided, any comments can help me find a way out and relieve myself.",akinpinkmaN,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1748731136,2025-05-31 22:38:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l09mk8/i_dont_know_how_to_continue_my_software_engineer/,5,2025
1l096s0,Giving up my flexible job,"I’m a bit conflicted. I’m a SW with an agency for disabilities. I’ve started exploring other employment opportunities. The reason for looking was because of lack of funding/grants. Lots of people in the agency recently resigned, I think about 5-6 people, within the last 3 months so that was a bit of a red flag for me. Management says funding is secure however, they’ve asked a few people in leadership to take a non leadership role. The pay isn’t bad and there is more flexibility as there are a few days that we can telework. I like what I do and don’t have many complaints. Supervisors can be weird and toxic which can be something you find in any job. Not affected by that, I just do what I gotta do.

I am planning for a career change in health care and am taking classes at a junior college which are either fully online or meet in the evenings. With that in mind, I applied for a SW role at a hospital. Interview went well and HR told me it’s looking positive. I know I don’t have the official offer but want to prepare in case I’m given the opportunity. From what I know, this role is fully in person (M-F) 9-5. Unsure what time off would look like during the holidays but I’m assuming it won’t be much. I think it’s also safe to assume there won’t be much flexibility since it’s a hospital. I’d also be getting paid more than my current position. The position isn’t union represented so I’m willing to advocate for an additional increase.

Long story short, I’m conflicted. Do I jeopardize flexibility and uncertainty for a new position more aligned with my goals but less flexible? Again, don’t have an official offer but I’ve been thinking about this so much and I’m stuck. I’ve also considered gas costs because I’d be in person everyday lol",BasicSwimmer1095,2,1.0,1,1748729910,2025-05-31 22:18:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l096s0/giving_up_my_flexible_job/,5,2025

1l0947b,Feeling lost and overwhelmed as a new frontend dev intern — don’t know if I made the right choice,"Hey everyone,

I’m a frontend developer, but I’m really struggling just days into my first internship, and I need some advice or just someone to relate to.

A little background:
When I was in school about 4-5 years ago, I wanted to be a doctor or work in the medical field. Then I thought about becoming an architect. But my GPA wasn’t good enough for either, and my family situation got really tough — my father had a stroke in his head, and we couldn’t afford private college. So I ended up going to college for computer science because that’s what my GPA allowed.

I worked extremely hard through college because I believed I had to do the “right thing” for my family, not necessarily what I loved. My college was next to a hospital, and seeing young doctors my age made me change my route to avoid seeing them.

Right before graduating, I landed an internship as a frontend developer. I learned Nuxt and Next.js and started my job last week. I worked only two days before the weekend, and honestly, it was a nightmare for me. I hated it. I was bored, looking at the clock all the time, just wanting to go home. I felt scared of getting tasks I don’t know how to solve, shy to talk to coworkers, and honestly, I couldn’t imagine doing this job my whole life.

I’m lost — should I keep pushing through and try to get better, or is this a sign I’m in the wrong field? I don’t want to disappoint my family, but I don’t want to be miserable either.

Has anyone else felt like this when starting? How did you deal with it? Any advice would mean a lot.

1l091mc,Offered Entrepreneur in Residence Role at 19 — Seeking Advice on Fairness and Next Steps ?,"Hi all,
I’m 19 and currently working as a part-time R&D intern at a sustainability-focused startup in India. I earn ₹7,500/month and primarily work on plant-based materials like banana fiber leather. My current workload is about 4 hours a day.

Recently, the founder offered me a full-time Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR) role. The expectations are:

9:30 AM – 6:30 PM full-time work (no overtime pay)

Build a new vertical around sustainable/plant-based leather

Lead R&D, prototyping, production, and scaling

Possibly manage a small team later

No co-founder title

ESOPs have been mentioned verbally, but nothing is confirmed or in writing

Salary offered: ₹20,000/month


They’ve said the EIR role means I’m expected to “take ownership” and not think in terms of overtime, perks, etc., since I’m building something from scratch — but legally, I’d still just be a full-time employee.

While I’m passionate about sustainability and product innovation, I have some concerns:

The jump in responsibility seems very high for the offered compensation

The role doesn’t come with real decision-making power or co-founder recognition

There’s pressure to sign an offer quickly

Equity discussions are vague and verbal


I’m considering asking to continue in a more defined, technical role (e.g., R&D Associate) where expectations are more realistic and I can grow steadily.


---

My questions:

1. Is this a reasonable EIR offer, or does it lean toward under-compensation?


2. Should I negotiate a different role with clearer boundaries and responsibilities?


3. What would be a fair compensation range in such a situation in India?


4. Has anyone here taken on an EIR or founder-like role this early in their career?


Any insights from experienced folks in startups or early-stage roles would be hugely appreciated. Just trying to make an informed decision and avoid stepping into something unclear.

Thanks in advance!",vee_here,2,1.0,1,1748729505,2025-05-31 22:11:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l091mc/offered_entrepreneur_in_residence_role_at_19/,5,2025

1l08b42,"Is it normal to feel so crushed about relocating for a job, even when it’s a good opportunity?","Hi everyone,

I'm in a bit of an emotional tangle and was wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar. I’m going through a really intense emotional period and just needed to get this off my chest and maybe hear if anyone’s gone through something similar.

I’ve been living in Edinburgh for the past 8 years. I first moved here at 17 to attend university, and after graduating, I got my first full-time job here. 

It was supposed to be temporary, I'm originally from a country where living abroad long-term isn't usually ""allowed"" due to family and cultural expectations. I always knew I’d eventually have to leave. But somehow, this place became home in ways I didn’t expect.

When I was offered the job, my family back home was really expecting me to move back after university. It’s the cultural norm where I’m from. I promised them I’d only stay for two years to get some work experience, then return.

Now, it’s been over two years. And I’m under a lot of pressure from my family to move back home.
But the truth is - I’m not ready. And I honestly don’t know if I ever will be.
Ever since taking this job, I’ve felt like I’ve been on some kind of hourglass timer. Like every day has been a countdown until I’m “supposed” to go home. It’s made everything feel rushed and tense, like I’m constantly chasing time instead of actually living.

To make it worse, while I love the company and I adore the friends and network I’ve built here in Edinburgh, my actual team is incredibly toxic.
I’ve been doing work I have no passion for - it’s not aligned with where I want my career to go at all. My manager doesn’t listen, doesn’t support my growth, and honestly takes advantage of all the hard work I do. The whole environment has been so draining. My mental health has been the worst it’s ever been. I cry regularly, I feel stuck, and I’ve lost all motivation and self-belief.

Despite my toxic team, I quite like the company I work for, the office, and all my other colleagues, have met many incredible people and some have become some of my close good friends.

I finally applied internally for a few other roles within my company and I just got an offer for a role in Cork, Ireland. The work is exactly the kind of thing I want to do. The team seems healthy and supportive. It’s a direction I’ve wanted to grow into for a long time and it aligns more with the kind of work I want to do long-term. But accepting it would mean leaving Scotland, possibly for good - and I’m really struggling with that.

Edinburgh became my home.
I wasn’t supposed to live here forever, I always knew that, but I’ve spent almost a third of my life here. My formative years. I feel more at home here than in my actual home country. Leaving feels like an era of my life is ending, and the grief of that is overwhelming.
I keep going back and forth:
* Stay in Edinburgh: keep my comfort zone, my friends, but stay in a job that’s eating away at me.
* Move to Cork: start fresh, do work I’m passionate about, but leave behind the life I built here - and face my family being disappointed yet again that I didn’t come home.
I'm scared that if I move, I’ll miss this place so much it breaks me. But I'm also scared that if I don’t move, I’ll regret wasting more years stuck and miserable in a role that’s not meant for me.

It’s hitting me how emotional this move actually feels. I'm not just leaving a city. I'm leaving behind a version of myself, my daily life, my comfort zone, the streets and cafés and friends that feel like family now.
And honestly? I feel heartbroken.
It feels like this will be the end of my “Scotland era,” and because of family expectations back home (which is a whole continent away), there’s a very real chance I might never live here again.

I know I’ll still be working at the same company and this new job could be amazing for my growth. But I can’t stop grieving the idea of walking away from this part of my life - and not knowing if I’ll ever get it back.

Have any of you ever gone through something similar?
How did you process the grief of leaving a place that shaped you - even for a good opportunity?
Did moving on feel like the right thing eventually?

Any thoughts or experiences would mean a lot. Just feel very alone with this at the moment. Any perspective would really help. I’m feeling lost, guilty, sad, excited, scared - everything all at once.",splashing20,3,1.0,8,1748727506,2025-05-31 21:38:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l08b42/is_it_normal_to_feel_so_crushed_about_relocating/,5,2025
1l07z7e,Got let go for the first time - feeling humiliated,"I got let go from my job for the first time ever.

Two hours into my shift, my team lead sent a vague meeting invite to “touch base” with no further info. When the time came, she led me to HR room where a rep was already waiting. I was told, point blank, that my employment was being terminated effective immediately.

I asked if it was due to performance or if I had done something wrong—they said it was “without cause.” No prior meetings, no warnings, nothing.

My team lead stayed silent the whole time, visibly red and shaking. The only thing she said was, “I do wish you all the best.” Then another HR rep (who I often eat lunch with) handed me my bag. I wasn’t allowed back to my desk.

What made it worse? Right after I was escorted out, my team lead called a meeting with the rest of the team to announce my termination. I was so humiliated. It crushed my confidence and made me feel like everyone would assume I did something wrong.

I truly believed I was performing well. I never got feedback suggesting otherwise and I got along well with my teammates. This experience left me feeling insecure, blindsided, and confused.

Has anyone else been let go without cause or warning? How did you recover emotionally and mentally from it?

1l06dyq,Career and Resume Questions — Timing and Current Employment Status Unemployment,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently in the process of applying for a new job, and I have a couple of questions that I hope you can help me with.

First, does it really matter what day of the week or time of day you send your resume or application? I’ve heard some people say it’s best to send it in the morning or early in the week to improve your chances of getting noticed. Is that true, or is it just a myth? What if I am sending it in weekend?

Second, I’m wrapping up my contract at my current job—tomorrow is actually my last day. If I send out my resume today in weekend, should I put on my resume that I’m still employed there, or should I state that I’m about to leave or that I’ve already left? I want to make sure I present myself in the best possible light, especially since my experience is pretty limited.

For context: After finishing my master’s degree, I did some internships, but then I had a two-year break. I recently landed a job in my field, but It turned out not to be the right place for my growth and health, and I had to leave after my six-month probation period and they announced me 1 week before the end of it...

I’m determined to do whatever I can to increase my chances of getting noticed and finding a good opportunity, so any advice would be appreciated.

Honestly, I’m afraid of locking myself into the lower end of the pay range for my field if the bonus doesn’t come to fruition and I’m in my mid 40s so not as much time to recover versus if I were in my 20s or 30s. That being said, this is the worst job market I’ve ever seen and with all the volatility out there, so maybe it’s better to just take something and get an income again. While I know some may recommend taking the job and continuing to look, I was only in my last role for 2 years and don’t think another short stint will look good as I’m looking at more senior roles.

Thanks in advance for any advice!",Leather_Radio_4426,0,0.5,9,1748714204,2025-05-31 17:56:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l039o8/would_you_take_a_significant_pay_cut_in_this/,5,2025
1l039d9,I think my previous employer screwed me over,"I was recently let go at the end of a 9 month probation period at a tech company. I was a new graduate, and i was very good - as in, i got a performance related pay increase 3 months in, passed my 3 month probation with flying colours, but then i was moved to a way more intense team (they told me they saw my potential).

As a result, my probation period was extended to 9 months so the new team had sufficient time to get to know me. I was fine with this because the projects were much cooler. I was determined to pass my probation and met weekly with my mentor to discuss my progress, where I received only positive feedback. I completed 2 big projects with no issues. Then I was given a third project, which was a little bit above my pay grade- as in, the task was huge and i struggled to deliver it in good time (due to the fact i was responsible for our constantly breaking t+1 pipeline). This was not seen as an issue because with sufficient guidance from my mentor i was able to complete the task eventually.

That's when we got a new boss, who decided that the codebase I and one senior dev were responsible for would not have any other big projects due for a while.
He sat down with me and explained that my performance on the recent task (which he was not there for) was a cause for concern. I tried my best to explain and encouraged him to talk to my mentor (who told me he recommended me to pass the probation). Later that day, i was informed I failed my probation. Just like that. I am convinced it was because there was no work left for me, and its easier to make it out like I was underperforming and fail me.

Now, as a new grad I cannot exclude this experience from my CV as it is my only work experience. But i feel sick to the stomach knowing that i will be asked about this in future interviews. If they call my previous employer they will be told i was underperforming, as that is what the ""official"" reason is, but i KNOW i did good work.

What do I even do? What do I tell future employers when asked about this in future interviews? I'm really panicking.

1l01uxw,My previous boss wants me to go to work for them on weekends to fix errors in the system.,"Just a background: I left my previous employer more than a month ago due to burnout. Even though there were five members on our team, I was assigned the most work since I was the only one who had proper training on the tools we were using, among other things. I rendered my 30 days, and during that time, I trained the remaining members of the team on the work that I was doing. I even documented my work and prepared teaching materials so that, in case something goes wrong, the remaining team members could handle it—since we often encountered errors in the system due to things we had yet to control.

But unfortunately, these remaining team members didn't seem to take the training seriously. There was even a time after a training session when one team member commented that what I was teaching them was ""for smart people only"" and ""not on their level."" Take note that the team members I was training were either at the same job level as me or even had a higher job level. I finished my 30-day render period, and we had a sign-off stating that all of my work had been turned over to the remaining team members.

Fast forward to two weeks into my new workplace, my previous boss contacted me saying they encountered an error in the system. Apparently, the remaining team members couldn't seem to fix it and asked if I could go to my previous workplace during weekends until the problem is fixed—and that I could name my price for those weekend work.

Personally, I would like to decline, since even though I would be compensated, weekends are a precious time for me to spend with my family and to recharge my mind. I also think that it's not my problem anymore since I'm no longer employed and I know that it's not something that only I can fix. Also, I really don't want to go back to that toxic workplace ever again, but I also don't want to burn bridges. So I was wondering—what’s the best way to reply to my previous boss? And are these types of situations normal in other workplaces?",albertbcs,267,0.9599999785423279,112,1748710638,2025-05-31 16:57:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l01uxw/my_previous_boss_wants_me_to_go_to_work_for_them/,5,2025

1l00h92,Accepting an Interview request for at the same company for a different position after accepting offer?,"I'm in a bit of a situation and need some advice. 2 Months ago, I interviewed for a position at a Consulting Firm to support their Client in my area of expertise. I didn't know who the client was at this time. This firm provided a guaranteed salary with full benefits (PTO, 401k match, etc) and I would basically be working for the client full-time and the firm would just play an administrative role. I thought it went really well, but I didn't hear back from them, so I moved on. 

A month later I interviewed, accepted, and signed an offer letter for a company I used to work at. This time, I would be a W2 Contractor working hourly and zero benefits (no PTO, no 401k match). I enjoyed my time there, so I happily took the position I am now just waiting on their on boarding and a start date and for them to ship me a laptop.

Come this week, the recruiter from the first consulting firm reaches back out to me and tells me that the client is finally ready to interview me. I figured why not and accepted the interview request. I get the invite, and the client is THE SAME COMPANY. The company I used to work at. The same client company I would be working for under the hiring agency. The position would be the same as well. The only difference, is that I would be supporting a different region for that company, under a different manager. 

Realizing this, I immediately let the recruiter know at the Consulting Firm that I already accepted an offer under the hiring agency to support the Client. She said not to worry and continue to take the interview to represent her Firm, since this would be for a different region and their firm provided much better benefits. 

Now, I'm concerned with stepping on toes or ruining both opportunities. Not sure If I should tell either hiring managers or just keep it to myself until I get an offer. Any Advice?

I was also pondering over the thought of opting for Bachelors in Foreign Universities.

Apart from this there are some more options are also available like B. Sc. in Data Science from IITM.

Choosing B. Sc. and preparing in Computer Science and going for Off Campus Opportunities is also one of the options.

1kzzmet,need advice. not wanting to share my tools (int property) to employer.,"For context, the major part of my work when I first joined is just to handle payout for something similar to payroll. for every nth of the month will be the day, and I'll have to make sure recipients data is correct and minimize (possible) errors and rejections at banks.

as time passes, the payout value, number of recipients increased and different types of payouts added. I also, unofficially, had to check the calculations again. have them reverted for recalculation until they are (possibly) correct.

I spent time creating my own calculation file using combinations of excel, vba and python, to do comparisons. thankfully the person on the other side is kind to me to help me learn and understand how all those things work.

now the person is no longer doing that job, since the management had the calculation module embedded in our core system. so all I had to do is just close the month, download the data, check a bit and perform the payout.

surprise surprise the module isn't actually working as intended, and to make it short, closing is okay but the calculation is not. so I calculate everything manually, all by myself. and the most fkd up part is, no one is able to be the checker for my work since 90%  of them don't have the extensive Excel knowledge. i also have responded to the developers to fix them and also add more features that were long overdue but it seems I'll have to wait for another year and do the other things myself as well eg, sending multiple emails with their statements to each recipients. 

now I'm juggling with the decision to resign or to stay, considering my below average pay and I wasn't promoted this year. if I do, I plan not to hand over any of the tools i created myself, since no one trained me properly for the job, and gave proper support whenever there were issues. I'm just worried if there are really legal clauses or rules saying I have to do so.

1kzylj0,You don't rise in business by being smart - here's what actually works,"I used to think the smartest person in the room always won. Turns out I was completely wrong.

After watching dozens of colleagues get promoted while equally brilliant people stayed stuck, I finally cracked the code. It's not about your IQ, your degree, or even your natural talent.

It's about your obsession with getting better.

The people who skyrocket in their careers share one trait: they're addicted to learning. Not the ""I'll take a course when I have time"" kind of learning. The ""I need to understand this right now or I'll lose my mind"" kind.

Meanwhile, most of us get trapped in what I call the Competence Prison. We reach a certain level of skill and then spend all our energy protecting that image instead of expanding it. We dodge challenging projects because we might look stupid. We avoid feedback because it might bruise our ego. We stick to what we know because it feels safe.

But here's the thing about safe: it's also where dreams go to die.

The highest performers I know are constantly uncomfortable. They're the ones asking ""dumb"" questions in meetings. They're volunteering for projects they have no idea how to handle. They're seeking out criticism like it's oxygen.

They understand something the rest of us miss: looking incompetent temporarily is the price of becoming unstoppable permanently.

Your competition isn't the person with the fanciest resume or the smoothest presentation skills. It's the person who wakes up every day hungry to learn something that makes them better than they were yesterday.

So ask yourself: are you more committed to appearing smart or actually becoming smarter?

The answer will determine everything about where you end up.

1kzxcc8,27 and confused.,"Help! I desperately need someone to “tell me what to do” moving forward. 

I’m 27. I have my bachelors degree in interior design. My previous jobs include working for a small family owned construction company doing practically everything besides construction (office management, project management, interior design, graphic design, finance management). I briefly left to work for a millwork company as a project manager/technical engineer because the construction company was extremely toxic - the owner had no boundaries and would take me around town helping him with whatever task he could think of and he’d occasionally talk crap about his wife and about other women he found attractive. (After leaving I found out he was having an affair with my friend there). Anyways - the millwork company was the exact opposite. We weren’t allowed to talk besides about work and I was stuck in my office in silence all day everyday. I had also found out I have a rare brain disease the week before I started and was beginning to have seizure symptoms on the hour drive to and from work. I decided to quit because it was a massive culture shock and I didn’t feel safe driving that far given my health and I was only seeing my family for two hours a day. So I went back to the small family owned construction company.

Two months later I needed brain surgery.

I was off of work for three months and when I came back they were extremely slow. No interior design clients or projects for me to manage. I spent two months doing busy work around the office and felt bad getting paid $60k just to do busy work so I stupidly suggested I go start my own interior design business and they subcontract me as needed. I figured this would save them money, and I’d be able to get the rest I needed whenever I needed it given my brain disease.

Well they haven’t had me work for them at all and that was two years ago.

My design business has practically been a bust. I make construction documents for a wood worker every now and then, but that’s it. I knew I needed another “part time” job to supplement my income so I could survive (I don’t come from money, my parents are as poor as you can be). So I looked on indeed and found a part time CTE architectural design teaching position and took it.

Im completing my first year of teaching and am entirely burnt out. I’ve never worked so hard, and gotten paid so little in my life. I’m part time but stay the entire day anyway because if I don’t I won’t get my work done. Even with that I’m taking work home. I love my students but this job causes me immense stress and I’m not supposed to stress this much given my brain situation. I hate that I don’t absolutely love my job. I miss working in the field. Teaching is not at all what I thought it’d be. Not to mention I’m getting paid a quarter of what I was making before and money is important especially with my medical bills. AND I’ve asked to be full time next year but they can’t make it happen.

I don’t know if it makes more sense to stay and add a couple more years for my resume, or to start looking for a new job now. If I did I’d be interested in a project manager role.

The job is killing me and I have had many health set backs because of this job and even a serious injury that took me out of work for almost a year 

It is a simple job don't get me wrong my brain can switch off and go into auto pilot mode where I just do muscle memory all day and the exercise was great but my body is dying and I feel sore.

I really would like to try find another job anything preferably something where I can earn more.

I know this is a low attempt low effort post that's very obvious and common but I'm trying to look for answers on what I could realistically pursuev or start to pursue this year with no other real skills or qualifications. Basically I'm starting from scratch while approaching 40 with a horrible burnt out body.

I really think a desk or office job or something less physically intensive would be a great step for me. 

I thought maybe security job at a mall or something very low risk or just walking around patrolling nothing like real bouncer work or something. 

But yeah I'm here to get ideas hopefully someone here found someone that I could possibly also do with no real skills and a burnt out body but just age really on my side if that could even be seen as a positive in any role. 

I am in Australia so I guess the answers have to be relevant to that. 

I have thought of many possibilities and some I have to immediately discount is supermarket work and anything construction as I tried both and the quota was too stressful on my body I had to quit then early. 

Anything with driving gets a pass too as I'm not confident in driving at all which sucks because I heard nice things about truck driving, traffic controller pay, FIFO dump truck driving (which I might still actually consider since it is different enough to other driving jobs it looks it might be feasible for me to try do it just have to research the training required) and any other job that is more physically strenuous than cleaning etc 


I have no idea what this leaves me honestly that would pay more than 30 dollars an hour Australian 

But yeah my brain feels like it needs a change maybe or something I dunno here I am 

Has anyone gone through a similar thing and just felt lousy and lost and stuck in a low paying dead end job forever?

1kzwj8s,Awkward back-pedaling regarding job description,"I work in administration for a region of a large, mainstream Christian denomination in the US. For a few years I've been a mid-level office manager with two reports. I learned a few weeks ago that a position opened in another department in the building, with an opportunity for more responsibility and oversight. Similar deal: office management, daily administrative oversight, three other employees in the department along with some clergy in executive positions. But I would also be tasked with standardizing protocols for the way documents are handled, because for several years there were five different (and sometimes inaccurate) ways of handling due to leadership changes over the decades. Those things just hardened into place and people got used to them. 

The position had been advertised for several months last year but was taken offline because no good candidates emerged and the process was put on hold. I learned of the job three weeks ago from the minister who runs the department and he said I seemed like I'd be a good fit and would enjoy the role. He said they'd been looking for someone like me for months. He said he would have me talk more with his second-in-charge while he was out of town for family reasons the following week.

So I had the meeting with his second-in-charge and the enthusiasm was still there. There was a lot of talk about how I would coordinate the department, be comfortable with giving instruction to reports, etc. etc. I was all but offered the job officially pending consultation with HR about my salary requirements and a further meeting when the head minister when he came back.

Fast forward and the top minister comes back. We meet yesterday and he is now saying that they definitely want me on board, but I can't be exactly called the manager because the woman currently acting in that role, even though she's not titled manager, might feel threatened by it. So, I am being asked to join with the same title she has, and I will learn from her the responsibilities. The minister told me that this is with a view to me taking over her role when she retires perhaps later this year. But there is also now talk of ""a few months"" of seeing how I do in the role before I more heavily take over her work.

I don't feel like they intentionally set up a bait and switch but the way they handled this pisses me off, to use a rather un-religious phrase. They did say I will receive higher pay than what I'm making now, but they've also worked with this woman for years and her reaction should not have been a mystery. I also feel like HR inserted a probationary period, which makes sense, but that also wasn't disclosed initially. I feel like I was sold a bill of goods and now they're walking it back. Thoughts?

1kzvxcu,AUS - Engineering Masters or Double Degree,"Quick dotpoints:

* Contemplating transfer after one sem of engineering
* Option A: Continue current pathway (BEng(Aero) + MEng(not Aero\*) in 4.5 years)
* Option B: Transfer into double degree (BEng(Aero) + BSci(Maths major, physics minor)
* Reason: many uni lecturers/students say the current pathway has a bad rep, double degree gives me more options\*\*

\* Uni does not offer MEng(Aero), I'm considering either an MEngMgmt or MEng(Mech)  
\*\* Currently still pretty set on becoming an aero engineer, so not a pro nor a con for now

Questions:  
1. How does a double degree impact my internship/job opportunities?  
2. Is it true that a Master's wouldn't boost chances of graduate jobs, and that some see it as degree 'stat-padding'?  
3. In terms of career outlook, what's the difference between the two options? (graduate salary, consideration for promotions, engineering job opportunities etc.) obviously double degree opens doors to finance etc.  
4. Does a MEngMgmt help with getting promoted quicker?",Ezza429,2,1.0,1,1748694501,2025-05-31 12:28:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kzvxcu/aus_engineering_masters_or_double_degree/,5,2025

3. Should I apply for a second masters? It's a big commitment but working in the same company and role which told me straight to my face that I'm not worth it because I didn't hit the mark. 

4. I did my BSc in Microbiology, Chemistry and Zoology back in 2018 and wanted to work in food science and regulations (ethics and compliance types) of work. But got pushed by my parents into studying MSc because of they believed MSc would give me a better job. I did an MSc, but it was not what I wanted to do.

1kzverr,Best Day/Time to Apply for Jobs? + How to List Current Employer When Leaving Soon?,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently in the process of applying for a new job, and I have a couple of questions that I hope you can help me with.

First, does it really matter what day of the week or time of day you send your CV or application? I’ve heard some people say it’s best to send it in the morning or early in the week to improve your chances of getting noticed. Is that true, or is it just a myth? What if I am sending it in weekend?

Second, I’m wrapping up my contract at my current job—tomorrow is actually my last day. If I send out my CV today in weekend, should I put on my resume that I’m still employed there, or should I state that I’m about to leave or that I’ve already left? I want to make sure I present myself in the best possible light, especially since my experience is pretty limited.

For context: After finishing my master’s degree, I did some internships, but then I had a two-year sabbatical. I recently landed a job in my field, but it turned out to be a very toxic workplace, and I had to leave after my six-month probation period and they announced me 1 week before the end of it...

I’m determined to do whatever I can to increase my chances of getting noticed and finding a good opportunity, so any advice would be appreciated.

He is a bit of an ass and constantly sees me as the snarky child I use to be rather than a reasonable person. I have worked there on and off my hole life because it is a decent opportunity if I can stick with it and he honors what he says he plans on doing, but he also has a tendency to make things sound great and then take them away if things aren’t done a specific way. 

He is constantly telling me to “not start” or “dont start acting this way” even though I haven’t done anything and genuinely dont know why he is saying it other than its a ore existing reaction that has developed from my younger years. When he gets to this point it feels impossible to talk because he has already decided I am wrong and then over talks and belittles everything said and when I point this out he says it’s not true. I genuinely dont know how to communicate with that. 

He wants me to help him out again because none of his other employees want to work there anymore (because of the way he treats people / workers). On the one hand it seems like a good opportunity if I can get something in writing of me getting a portion of the business like he claims, on the other hand I need to start an actual career at this point in my life because I dont want to be starting over again in a year or so. 

Side notes: it’s a small business but does decent, I like the work most of the time and like the idea of running a business but have never had the full responsibilities however I have heard about it my entire life and feel fairly familiar with the gist. If I dont work with him I would want to start another job, possibly as an insurance adjuster or working in a factory if I can get in. Family tells me I should work with him, but I am not to sure.

1kzq6om,"3 months into my first job, already burned out and alone — is it too early to leave?","Hi everyone,

This is my first post on Reddit, so thank you in advance for reading.

I’m two months into my first full-time job in the semiconductor industry after grad school. I relocated to the Bay Area for it—completely new city, no friends or family nearby—and I’ve been trying really hard to build a life outside of work. I joined volunteer clubs, run groups, and affinity networks to feel more grounded. But now I feel like all of that is unraveling.

Work has been chaotic and unpredictable. Communication is often last-minute, and I’m constantly expected to be flexible at the expense of my personal time. Plans I make outside of work often get disrupted, and I’m finding it harder and harder to protect time for myself. I try to be proactive and helpful, but it feels like I’m stuck in reactive mode all the time—like I’m just surviving each day rather than learning or growing.

I’ve also been feeling isolated. I don’t have a local support system yet, and it’s exhausting trying to balance a demanding job with the effort it takes to build a life from scratch. I’m doing what I can—joining communities, meeting new people—but it all feels so fragile.

On top of that, I’m on a visa, which limits my options. I know the job market is tight right now, and I’m not in a position where I can easily leave or take time off. But the stress is building, and I’m starting to wonder how long I can realistically do this without burning out completely.

Has anyone been through something similar? Is it too early to think about leaving? What can I do in the meantime to cope or create breathing room when quitting isn’t an option?",DryPool5991,7,1.0,4,1748672024,2025-05-31 06:13:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kzq6om/3_months_into_my_first_job_already_burned_out_and/,5,2025
1kzq31v,Working remote.,"I'm an autistic man in his early 30s living in the UK. For over 10 years, I've been trying to fix my problems with not being able to leave the house without having massive panic attacks, and various comorbid sleep disorders causing me to not be able to reliably maintain a sleeping pattern of any reasonable tenure.  
I've come to accept that these conditions are just a reality in my life, and the right way to go would be to work around them rather than continue fruitlessly trying to remove them as a factor so that I can have a ""normal"" or ""proper"" job.  
No one likes living off the state. It's horrible. You're always poor, always on edge in fear of being cut off and becoming homeless, always looked down on as a second-class citizen, no matter what some people may insist.

I've become aware of the possibility of remote work, and I think it would be just the thing to allow me to finally become independent and somewhat in control of my own destiny. I know there is a job out there that allows me to work at whatever time of day or night I can (I'm mostly nocturnal) so long as I get the work done, and that I can do online or remotely in some other fashion.

My questions are these: How? What kind of job allows me to work within these limitations? And what do I have to do in order to obtain such a job?

I'm intelligent, focused, creative and driven. I am good with the English language especially, I feel, as I've been an avid reader my whole life and highly enjoy writing. These are fortunately qualities I believe would do well in a remote setting. If I find the right job, I feel I can be a tremendous asset to the right people. I am willing to do basically whatever it takes in order to do what I feel I should be doing, but I literally don't even know where to start. I have been out of work and education for so long that it seems like everything sort of works differently now compared to 10 years ago when I was last looking for work, and when was last engaged in academia. I am starting with basically nothing, no qualifications. My education began to suffer partway through college due to various home problems and personal problems. I became homeless at an early age and did not make decisions that alleviated my circumstances. I am not here to blame anyone for my problems, including myself. The way my own life has panned out thusfar is mostly not my fault, it is not anyone else's fault, but it is my responsinility.  
I am here to learn, to become independent and to provide for myself and my girlfriend to a degree I feel she deserves.

1kzoeys,Should I switch careers?,"
I’m a 25-year-old Sudanese software engineer with two years of experience. Due to the ongoing war in Sudan, I’ve been out of work for a while, but I’ve been working on a plan: relocate to Saudi Arabia, land a good job, and start saving to eventually immigrate to Canada, the US, or Australia.

Recently, my former company offered me an associate product manager role, working directly with the general manager. It’s tempting—great exposure, a potential fast-track to a product management career, and a way to blend my technical skills with business. I could take it, grind, get certified, then make the Gulf move with a stronger CV and a likely pay bump. In fact, PM salaries in the Gulf often beat engineering salaries.

But here’s the catch: product management is more competitive abroad. In North America, engineers often earn more and find jobs more easily. Immigration pathways are also clearer for engineers. If I switch now, I might limit my options later.

My long-term goal is early retirement, financial freedom and owning my time. Staying with software engineering aligns more with this goal, but should I make some changes?

1kzn7zs,Will I get my offer rescinded because of mismatched info between resume and Checkr?,"My resume lacks relevant professional experience. It's mostly working in the restaurant industry. I spruced my resume up by claiming I got promoted in my last job to a managerial role (I basically had the responsibilities of one, just not the official title) and spent a couple of more months there, and I also claimed I spent an additional year in another job because I thought it'd look bad that I spent a short time there in actuality.

The job offer is for working in a call center in a loan company. My experience doesn't directly relate to the position, but the hiring managers liked my personality and said all I really need is my customer service mentality; they'd teach me the rest. I was really relieved because this place is like a miracle that'd accept limited experience like me.

I really want this position to get my foot in the door, so when I saw that the Checkr background asked for only really employment verification and it was pre-filled, I freaked out thinking I'm going to start the job-hunting process over. I'm still worried. I didn't want to lie, so I edited the information to be the truth. I've had experience with Checkr before but they did not ask for employment verification.

I'm hoping Checkr or my employer doesn't cross-check my adjusted resume with Checkr. I don't think they will because I think they just like my food service experience overall, but I don't want to get my hopes up.

On it, he lists “taking the lords name in vein [sic]” as part of a complaint someone made against me","So there was one day that was going so-so.. I had only gotten 3 hrs sleep in the previous 48, and was surprised that I was in a halfway decent mood all morning. Then around 3pm things went downhill quickly and I fell into my “muttering cuss words to myself” mode, this time a bit louder than usual. Now, it was a day where there was a corporate activity most of the morning and afternoon until 3 maybe (I’ll check) and then after some work nearly everyone was going to a bar. I do not drink and I don’t want to be around it. I was asked if I was going multiple times and said nah, had some stuff to do and don’t drink. Then the “but you don’t have to drink” came, and I politely said no, *there’s a bit more to it than that*.  And some finally got it and others kept pushing.. so yeah I was in a pisspoor mood at my desk. 

I’m sure there were a lot of jfc’s and gfd’s thrown around, and yeah it was totally unprofessional of me.  I owned up to it in a meeting with my boss last week. 

Now I got iteration 3 of this form, and on there it says I didn’t have any complaints and thought things were going well — not at all the case and definitely not anywhere close to what I said in that meeting.  But right after that he typed out that I had a complaint “from several people” that I was muttering “expletives under [my] breath and taking the lord’s name in vein [sic]” which was very unprofessional and I was told to stop it immediately. 

I’m wondering how to respond to something like this?  Taking the lords name in vain??? I do not work at a church nor is my workplace religious in nature. People take the kids name in vain all the time. I hear outbursts from other people; it’s irregular but it happens. I just don’t see why this one time thing is something that needs to be on this form, especially the lords name thing. I mean, our team talks and cusses and says goddamn and stuff all the time, but I realize they are doing it as a group and I’m by myself looking crazy.

1kzlwce,I feel like my manager is over delegating tasks and not taking on work because she wants less work herself,"So my manager has been complaining to hire ups for a few months now that she's been feeling overwhelmed because she has to travel a lot for her workshops and trainings. I'll try to make it make as much sense with my job description because I work in a highly specialized area. So we have to screen people through intake tests and I got certified to do this as well as did my manager. My manager is now saying she feels overwhelmed and feels like she's been given a lot of these tests. The past couple of weeks she has had a lot of tests but not anymore then I have had on a busy testing week. I will also get hit hard with them at random times. I had a lot of availability for those tests and then she told me in a 1:1 that I could roll back some hours I don't always have to be available. But now, she's saying she wants me to do a majority of these tests because she feels overwhelmed. I think that if we are both certified to be doing those tests we both need to be doing them. 

(Also a former employee before me said this manager always complained about these tests and that she felt like this girl needed to be doing more of them even though she was part time. I think this manager just wants to lessen the work load even if it's her responsibility.)

Recently, our office also told us we are doing office hours twice a week. She was able to finesse her way out of going in twice a week (like everyone else) because she drives too much and lives far away.

This year, I finally took the leap to find a new role in customer operations/logistics where I could grow, since my old job offered no more challenges or advancement.  

Last month, I landed a great opportunity at a larger company in an exciting industry—better growth potential, a hybrid WFH setup (vs. my old job’s rigid full-time RTO policy), and a much shorter commute. I knew I’d take a *small* pay cut (around 5.6%), but I was okay with it for the long-term upside.  

Then reality hit. When my first paycheck arrived, I realized I’d miscalculated my old salary (turns out, bi-weekly pay is 26 periods, not 24—oops). The actual pay cut? ..12% 😂 My heart sank.  

The silver lining: I genuinely like the job, the team, and the work-life balance. But the pay gap has me discouraged—internal raises won’t bridge that 12% anytime soon.

How do I figure out what to work towards, how to move forward, and how to make sense of it all?","TLDR: 18M online psych student (graduating winter '25-summer '26) with many aspirations and interests, including non-psych ones like design, teaching, entrepreneurship, being an art/creative director, etc. Also unsure of what I want to do in psychology. Unsure of how to reconcile my diverse aspirations, how to pay for grad school, and how to figure out what my path forward is.

Hey guys. As the title says, I'm an 18 year old guy struggling to figure out a career path for myself. I recently got medically separated from Basic Military Training around 3 weeks ago and am back with my parents working on getting back my old food service job and applying for new, better-paying jobs. Expenses are 1.4k per month but I'm hoping to save money by moving out soon and getting away from my somewhat toxic family situation.

I've got about half of my online Psychology BS finished so far and I'm starting a new term in July, with the goal of graduating in winter of this year. I enjoy psychology and am fascinated by it, but not only do I have little idea of what I might want to do in the field (Masters or Doctorate? In what area of psych -- clinical, counseling, neuro, ui-ux research/design, school, io, etc.? Or grad school in an entirely different field?), I also have a ton of aspirations outside of psychology that I'm really struggling to process and reconcile with my degree. These include my dream of being an art/creative director (or starting a design/art studio), aspirations to be a teacher, wanting to one day start my own business, and just the general desire to have a creative career.

I also have a ton of interests that I wish I could explore through college electives and student projects/clubs or whatever as I really enjoy the in-person academic environment and love collaboration and working on personal/extracurricular projects, but due to circumstances I'm doing online school. It's been good financially as I've been able to save money even with the high cost to stay living in my parents' house and also get a ton of school done fast with relative ease, but I feel really isolated and lonely, socially left out/behind while everyone else goes to 'real college', and academically unfulfilled. I'm not great at online learning so while I get through things and test well, I struggle to retain the material long-term.

I'm overall just really lost and confused. I know I've gotta finish my degree at this point, it'd be a huge waste of time and money to switch programs, especially being I don't know how I'd like any other program I could switch to. My online school doesn't offer double majors or minors, and none of their other programs really seem like good options. I know grad school is really expensive (I'd have to get my masters even if I eventually wanted a Doctorate as no good program would ever accept an online student from a pass-fail school with no research experience) so I'm at a loss for how I'm gonna fund that. I'll have a very conservative estimate of around 19k saved up by January of next year, but if grad school only cost 19k we'd all be doctors haha. I've also thought about teaching English abroad for a year or two after I graduate just to save money and see the world. I dunno man, I'm lost here.

1kzka8n,The job I quit in January wants me to redo the report of my work. What should I do?,"Some background: I received a job offer to work on one ESIF project at the university where I study which I accepted. I was working on one specific activity with other two coworkers. I quit this January because the workload was too much to handle with exams coming and I was seriously burned out (and I'd say I'm still recovering rn).

Last week I received an email from some lady I have never met saying that the tasks in my report from this January are not fully in accordance with the scope of the project and that I need to check with my team manager and ""correct it to match the planned activities"". I was super confused so I contacted my coworker who is continuing with this activity asking what is it about and what to write in the report then. She told me that she would only now do the report for her work since January and that she has no idea and that I need to write to the team leader.

I was super annoyed since I'm not part of the team anymore but she is so she could as well sort it out. But I thought okay, I will write one mail and then rewrite couple lines and that will be it. End of it with no error on my part and I could move on.

I sent the mail and received reply from the manager saying she will look into it and that she'll let me know. Since then I received like 10 mails between various people I've never met which they sent between each other and I was only also the recipient. All discussing whether the activity I was part of is or isn't in the scope of the project (which they decided *it is*) but none of them said ""your task should be described as xy in the report"".

I'm super annoyed, because I'm not part of the project anymore and I don't receive any compensation for this time they expect me to spend with it.

My question is how should I deal  with this situation? I thought I will just fix one error of mine in one document in a good manner but it's not that case at all and I don't wanna deal with my managers poor planning (they should have had this figured out back at least in November not only now imho) for no compensation.

At the same time I don't wanna risk pissing her of as if she would be a hostile type of person (I don't know if she is) she could potentially make my final state exam hell for me next year if I had bad luck and had her as one of my examiners. And I don't wanna create extra obstacles in getting my degree.

I'm really at lost since this is my first real job. I'd highly appreciate some input from other people. Thanks in advance so so much!!!

1kzipzu,"Why am I consistently underpaid despite my education, experience and effort? How can I break through?","I’m an outlier—but not in the way you'd expect. 👽

According to research, most professionals see a 10%–20% pay increase when switching jobs—especially in marketing.
But in my case? Every time I’ve made a move, I’ve taken a pay cut.

Why accept the offer, then? Because I felt stuck. Because there was no room to grow. Because I believed the next opportunity would get me closer to where I wanted to be.

Here’s a look at my journey:

After earning my BS in Business – Marketing, I started as a research analyst. It was my first real job post-internships, so I didn’t expect a big paycheck—just a foot in the door.

I went back for my MBA, thinking it would open more doors and lead to a living wage—not luxury, just stability. But reality has looked very different.

Throughout my career, I’ve consistently earned well below industry standards and the California living wage (around $80K in 2025).
And yes, I’ve asked for raises. They were denied.

I came prepared—with data, benchmarks, and a fair ask based on market standards—hoping to close the gap.
The final offer? Still below expectations. Not quite what I’d hoped—but I accepted it, again trusting it would lead to future growth.

While working as a research analyst, I also took on an unpaid internship in social media to build experience. Eventually, I landed a full-time role as a junior social media account executive—but it came with a 13% pay cut.

It was a pivot into the marketing world, and I hoped it would lead to something more.

Spoiler: It didn’t.
At least, not right away.

I eventually moved up into a full account executive role, which came with a modest salary increase. But even then, I was still making significantly less than others in similar roles.

So I searched again. Now with my MBA in hand. Still hopeful. Still motivated.
But repeatedly, I’ve seen roles requiring 5+ years of experience offering $40–50K per year. It’s disheartening.

Am I not looking at the right job titles? Do I lack the connections? Is the MBA… hurting more than helping?

I don’t have all the answers yet. But I know I’m not the only one feeling this way.

1kzinoy,need advice. thinking of switching companies,"ive been working at a plumbing company for 5 years doing residential construction. i havent gone out and done schooling yet. kinda screwed myself with that. the company im at does offer to pay for it but you have to sign a contract saying you wont leave for 5 years after you finish. i like this company but ive never really thought of this being somewhere id work at for the rest of my life. never really thought id be here this long in general but i got comfortable i suppose. im at the point where i just feel like the work i do doesnt really matter and im wasting my life here. i want to learn more. i want to earn more. i want my work to matter. 

well, i just took a few days off and went and tried out a new job. its in service plumbing. the days were great tbh. lots of different things i was able to do. making customers happy. good coworkers. 

so, they offer 2 weeks pto every year after 90 days. paid holidays when i start. pay half of the benefits. no 401k yet, they said they will get it started at the end of the year. he offered me 50k salary to start which is already 10k less than what im making now. they work 10+ hours basically mon-fri. some days can be shorter but he said that was average. no overtime compensation at all. he said i get paid in intuition. they offer schooling and training. if i accept schooling. i will have to sign a non compete clause. for every year i complete, its a $5000 raise to my salary. it would be online so its at my pace and i can finish it quickly. when you join with them, you have to complete a a checklist with the company to show you have an understanding of most service needs before you get your own van and tools and start going out on call. when that happens, you can start to earn 5% commission on all jobs that you sell. its a pretty small company, they just started up last year but its a franchise. they have different locations in different states.

1kzij8y,moving up and treated rudely,"I’m(26f) moved into a second tier role, i’ve been in the field for about three years now and have had a lot of success. A lot of my clients really enjoy working with me and I’ve very industrious in my work.

Now, I have coworkers in starting roles, maybe some who have even started in the last year, who feel jealous and are rude to me and often undermine me at work like making comments about how they are better because I get my nails done and they don’t get their nails done. Really stupid stuff. I know one of them also started graduate school and she just feels she should be paid more and have my job. I understand where she’s coming from because she’s gets paid less, I totally support everyone having a higher wage but, she doesn’t have to crap on me about it.

I have one coworker on my team and she doesn’t do any of the paperwork and lies about most of her documentation. I know she barely sees her clients. but, she’s been in the company for 6 years in a completely unrelated role so there’s no thought of firing her. Our boss wants me to support her but she is also rude and doesn’t do anything. she has literally yelled at people to shut up and sneaks out of the room whenever there’s a meeting.

So, I am kind of doing all of the mid tier work and it feels like everyone hates me in it. I don’t like getting mean or defensive because I just know it won’t really go anywhere.

My bosses told me that I should just report it when I see all these people not doing their jobs instead but that doesn’t feel right to do either.

Just want to know if anyone has any advice on staying professional with coworkers who don’t work and entry level workers being rude to you.

Just wanted to come on here and ask if anyone knows of any well paying, healthcare jobs that either do or don’t require a masters? I have a bachelors degree in genetics, and currently work as a clinical research coordinator and I enjoy it for the most part. I get paid less than 40k a year, which is incredibly low for the area I live in, but the place I work has no money. It is hard for me to pay my loans/other bills, but I am having trouble finding anything. I have always wanted to go get a masters in something, but unfortunately my gpa was less than a 3.0 so I don’t think I would get in anywhere, and that just means more loans. Does anyone have any suggestions or know of any other subs that talk about healthcare careers?

1kzhqkn,Unsure if I should complain too,"At my work (<1 yr), there is a huge conflict between our team and the manager. Various complaints have been filed against him by current and former members of our team as well as other departments regarding his attitude, lack of/bad communication and management style. A lot of the complaints had already been closed out by HR and the management over the years and they are aware that he was an issue and things have finally gotten to a point of no return this month and I think they are really taking some action.

Everyone has already complained and expressed how they feel. I have also joined conversations with my manager's supervisor and expressed what I have seen and my general thoughts but I got written off as just another witness and someone he treats nicely. I have never written an email or submitted a formal complaint against him because everyone else already has. I think they are aware of how I feel but I heard from the grapevine that they think others tainted my and my new coworker's perspective of him. (New co-worker however has actual issues with him and has already filed complaints. They are also legally protected).

I find that unfair because it's obvious that I have been a non issue with him because of my personality. I have had issues with him but they pale in comparison to his trail of victims. I know I'm a new employee but I have seen and heard so much and its ridiculous HR never even reached out to me when they reached out to everyone else. If they thought my view had been tainted by others then I would have probably filed a complaint long ago.

The ball is already rolling and next week there are a lot of meetings (some already individually scheduled and a rumored group meeting as next step). Saw his supervisor at lunch and she told us to just hang on for just one week. 

I was speaking with my coworker who brought up how I'm technically the one who has never really complained about him and now I'm feeling like I should maybe just write something to say my piece. But it feels pointless because things have finally gotten moving and my email will just be a drop in the ocean.

I feel conflicted on what I should do. Do I just wait until the group meeting? I feel like anything I say they have already heard the more severe version and I feel like me not complaining is proof that my views haven't been influenced my team. I am very worried if I were to say something I would then be seen as someone who obviously got influenced by the team.",Busy_Dog_5813,1,1.0,0,1748644937,2025-05-30 22:42:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kzhqkn/unsure_if_i_should_complain_too/,5,2025
1kzhltn,How to play this corporate life,"Hi all, I feel a bit awkward talking about myself here but here we go.

I've worked for over 5 years, jumping jobs with almost every opportunity given, each job around a year or a bit less.

When starting to work for the current IT company I knew it would last longer and it's almost 2 years. The reason I knew I'd stay is that the money is better compared to any other job I had or heard of that was up to my skills.

However I feel like I'm losing the qualifications and I could not tell you honestly what I'm doing now. We're doing a bit of this and that, couple of emails, meetings, work stuff. And obv I have too much free time during a day.

 I previously had some programming and SQL experience - it wasn't much but it was honest.
What I would do normally is I would seek anything else, but all job offers would be like 20-30% less that I earn and sorry but it's a no for me.

I'm just anxious what to do next - I don't think I could land a second job as it's difficult to find  non full time and remote one, and I also am not really afraid of layoffs (at least now), but I kind of want to understand how to play the situation so that I won't be left after 10 years with no real skills - or at the mediocre level.

1kzhipj,What I learned from the only female manager on my FAANG team,"Being a woman in tech can feel like playing a game where the rules were written without you. My first job out of college was at a small, stagnating company where no one wanted to teach me anything. I wasn’t from a fancy school, I didn’t have referrals, and some male coworkers didn’t even bother hiding their condescension. I genuinely thought maybe I just wasn’t cut out for this industry.

Then I landed a role at a FAANG company - and got the luckiest draw of my life: my manager. The only woman leader on the team. Absolute powerhouse. Calm, sharp, grounded, elegant. She became the role model I didn’t know I needed. This post is basically a love letter to the lessons she taught me — and maybe they’ll help someone else out there who’s trying to build their confidence, too.

1. Your appearance isn’t shallow - it’s a reflection of your habits.
 My manager shows up looking polished every day - even during fire drills. I once asked how she manages it and she just said, “Discipline.” Sleep early. Gym 3x/week. No doomscrolling. Clean meals. People say looks are “for men” - but honestly, dressing well made me feel powerful. It’s not about beauty. It’s about energy and human nature.

2. Growth mindset is protecting your energy.
 My ex manager used to obsess over “industry trends” but never read a single book. My current manager? She reads daily. She cuts off draining convos mid-sentence. She doesn’t chase clout or micromanage her team. The biggest advice she gave me? “You don’t need to be the smartest. You need to be the one who grows fastest.”

3. Daily reading!
One thing that stood out immediately: she read every single day. It wasn’t performative or part of some “challenge” - it was just normal for her. Between meetings, at the gym, on flights. She once told me, “Every successful person I’ve ever looked up to has a regular reading habit - no exceptions.” She doesn’t use TikTok. Doesn’t doomscroll. She fills her brain with ideas instead of noise - and over time, you can see it compound.

Over time, I started asking her recommendations on what she used and what she read - and she generously shared her favorites. Some of these I would've overlooked on my own, but they’ve quietly transformed how I manage my time, mindset, and growth. Sharing them here in case they help anyone else:

  - Deep Work by Cal Newport: Every time I asked her how she got so much done, she’d mention something from this book. It’s basically the anti-distraction bible. If you’re tired of context switching and shallow work, this will help you reset your brain.


  - More Than Enough by Elaine Welteroth: Part memoir, part manifesto, this is the story of how Elaine rose to become the youngest editor-in-chief at Teen Vogue. She writes with heart, sass, and honesty about imposter syndrome, boundaries, and being “the only” in the room.

  - Lenny’s Podcast: I kept hearing Lenny’s name come up in convos about product thinking and finally gave the podcast a try. If you’re in tech, this is basically free career coaching. The guests are sharp, honest, and actually share frameworks you can use the next day

  - BeFreed: It’s a smart reading / book summary app that’s perfect if you’re too busy to read full books or struggle to stay consistent. It breaks down dense non-fiction books into 10-min skims, 20-min fun podcast, 40-min deep dives, and flashcards - no fluff, no big words, just clear and practical insights. I usually listen while commuting or at the gym, and if something really hits, I’ll do the deep dive before bed. It also remembers your favs, highlights, and learning goals, then recommends books that match your pace. 

I used to have 300+ books on my Goodreads TBR and couldn’t finish more than 3 a year. This made it so much easier to build a daily reading habit -even when I don’t have the time or mental energy for heavy books. 

  - Snipd: I used to listen to podcasts, get hit with an amazing insight… and forget it five minutes later. Snipd lets me highlight key podcast moments, generate AI-powered summaries, and save them into a personal library I can actually revisit. 

  - Ash: This one’s more recent, but it’s been surprisingly grounding. Ash is a minimal, beautifully designed mental health app that helps you check in with your thoughts, moods, and patterns over time. It’s not therapy - but it feels like someone holding space for you.

I never had a sister, but my manager kind of became one. She didn’t just teach me how to lead - she taught me how to live better. If you’re in a rut, try one thing: sleep 30 mins earlier and listen to an audiobook instead of scrolling. Let that be your starting line.
You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to keep moving. ",Eastern_Ticket2157,15,0.6899999976158142,11,1748644340,2025-05-30 22:32:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kzhipj/what_i_learned_from_the_only_female_manager_on_my/,5,2025
1kzh8cz,Give your experienced advice,"Hi all

At first, to highlight the context I gradatued with bachelor’s of finance two years ago and I hate it, investments is the only aspect in finance that i love. I’m currently working as a financial analyst in a large firm since Sep.

As my work is client-based it was a quiet when i first came so another department requested “support” in financial analysis and i was allocated for that request. When i started the role i found out that it is not a finance role and it’s basically bullshit (excuse me for that) and it’s more like data entry for a middle school summer trainee. Despite the million times I asked to exclude me, they won’t; so i’m stuck since then.

A couple of weeks ago i was assigned to a client project which they told me it’s related to financial reporting but it turned out NOT RELATED TO FINANCE AT ALL and i’m fully utilized on it. although it’s not beneficial in any way, I have no other option but to do it.

So now i’m utilized above 100% which i cannot do and it is pressuring. I have told them multiple times that i’m not able to do both and they have to hire or assign some one else. I have also spoke to my manager but NOTHING CHANGED.

I graduated with high GPA, skills, working on my CFA and i had some passion to pursue a career in investment before this job but I couldn’t find any. i feel down, stressed, and i go everyday to work with anxiety and anger. I really hate it and i don’t know what should i do until i find another job?",iJay12,3,1.0,2,1748643584,2025-05-30 22:19:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kzh8cz/give_your_experienced_advice/,5,2025

1kzgwdn,Do I keep my second job?,"Hi everyone. USA. On Mobile.

I finally landed a bachelors degree in computer science and got a gig making 70k/year. Before this I was working a retail job making 30k/year. 

My tech job does not mind if I work the retail one on weekends, so I have been the past couple months. Reason why is because I know tech jobs can be super volatile with work (mass layoffs are common) and this retail job I have is specifically known for never firing anyone (literally it is sooo hard to get fired here). 

So I was just going to keep it as a backup, but am I being rediculous? Im just so scared of losing any job I guess. On one hand I am making extra cash and they have good stock, and I have a secure guaranteed option if a recession were to hit hard. 

On the other, the retail job is grueling, air is so greasy I get acne after my shifts, and I am paid awfully.

1kzgcer,How to approach leaving a job quickly?,"So recently, I accepted a short-term project role but within a month I've realised it's not for me, I don't fit with the company culture and the work itself is a lot more technically challenging than I had anticipated. No faking it til you make it here.

Having quite a few years of experience, I don't think this is new job jitters or imposter syndrome, I simply don't think I have the bandwidth to deliver in this role as required. I've now come to the conclusion a 'clean' early exit would probably be best for all parties as to minimise disruption. 

I feel terrible as the company are shortly entering a crucial phase of the project (where my role fits in) and I do feel guilty that my departure will invariably throw things off track. However, the more I learn, the more I'm convinced I'm completely in over my head having absorbed the full scale of the project. For reference, the interview was a relatively tight turnaround and I should have asked more probing questions about the project scope and company working style (in retrospect, I definitely feel I oversold myself).

As it's a FTC with a 2-week notice on either side during probation, my rationale is they wouldn't worry about terminating me for underperforming, so it's better to exit gracefully early rather than drown later in a 6-month role I know is a total mismatch.

Now onto my question - how to approach my exit if it comes to it (not good with confrontation given awkward situation)...

I'm torn between going with the 'not the right fit' approach (honesty best policy) or pretending  'a better opportunity presented itself' (a little while lie, but avoids further questioning and may help shorten notice period)? I know some recommend saying nothing, but feel I need some valid reason given my ultra brief stint there.

1kzg624,Relocate or delay relocation for job/experience?,"As the title says, I'm in a dilemma right now. I've been wanting to relocate from my hometown/city for a while now to a different city, but I can't land a job in the city I want to move to. However, a recruiter reconnected with me, saying there is going to be an open position that I applied for last time that's going to be live soon (the reason I did not get in last time was that there was a candidate who had slightly better experience than me. However, I was a top candidate and that's why they wanted to reconnect)

It sounds like a great opportunity (while it may not directly be related to what I want to do, I do have experience in it, and it is adjacent to it (Trying to break into IT, but it's an AV role.)) But I would have to delay wanting to relocate to the town I want which is dissapointing since I wanted to move there (I'm still young/no obligations yet and still have time, but still). 

Finding a job right now is tough, and I don't want to pass up if I do get an offer. Should I just take the offer for the professional experience and try applying for the location again later on, or decline the potential offer and continue applying for the location I want?

I have been one of the top performers in my company for the past 3 years and also received the Employee of the Year award recently where I was directly nominated by the CEO. Now here enters my direct reporting manager. He is one person who has unreal expectations of me and never gives me a 5/5 rating. I have received a 5/5 only once in the past 6 appraisal cycles (twice a year) and that was because I had to fight for my rating and escalate this matter to the CEO. Why the ratings are so important is because my bonus and hikes are directly linked to my bonus and hike. The next appraisal is due this month and now I am in a state of anxiety and burn out. No matter what I do I always seem to fall short of his expectations and honestly I am tired of fighting for what I deserve. Goals are never measured in a tangible manner with him and this is getting very challenging. I have lost all motivation to work for this company and the stress is not letting me enjoy my everyday life.

I recently started working with another manager as I picked up work from a different service line expecting things to be better. This new manager is all sweet on the outside and writes great things but when it came to rating my performance, he has given me a 3.5/5.

I was expecting a good hike and bonus as I have worked extremely hard this past 6 months and the entire year and also plan to start a family soon but this has just killed my confidence.

1kzew1m,Left my job due to humiliation— can’t seem to get hired anywhere. Am I blacklisted?,"I was working remotely for a up and coming tech startup for the last 4 years. Apparently someone hacked one of my personal devices or found a way to look at my internet activity from my phone. Cards on the table— I was struggling with a porn addiction, but I never made it an issue at work or used a personal device. 

My managers and the rest of the team basically tried to humiliate me by continually hinting that they found out and sharing that information with the folks I supervised. My managers point blank told me that they were using me as an “example” to the rest of the team. I had enough, and although I should’ve dug my feet in and made them fire me— I took what was left of my dignity and exited. I did a lot of work on myself, and despite all of their bullying and harassment, I’m determined to do better.

However, ever since I quit I have not been able to land a job. I constantly get interviews but don’t land the position, or in one strange instance, even got a job offer and when it came to start the company ghosted me for three weeks before sending me a letter that I did not get the position. I know the market is rough, but this feels far too pointed and suspicious. Is it possible that I’m blacklisted despite moving to another state and city from where my previous work was based?

And I’ve seen enough. Felt enough. Learned enough. Experienced enough ..!

I no longer want to chase this SYSTEM'S “approval.” I don’t want a degree to ""prove"" I’m worth it. I want to build my career in tech. I’m ready to spend 4-5 hours daily.

I’ve self-learned English, programming basics, digital marketing, how social media works… even how the world works in reality. ONLY WITH MY MOBILE PHONE ...

My dream? Not to be the next Bill Gates , Zuckerberg or Steve jobs ... 🙂

Whatever it takes to give my family a peaceful life. 💚 A financially free life. 🗣️
A happy, normal life. 🙏🏻

But here's the thing...

Everywhere I go jobs, courses, exams... they ask for 12th pass or a degree.
I’m stuck. I’ve cleaned bathrooms, stood behind counters, carried boxes while dreaming of earn in lacks.

I failed in entrance exams, not because I didn’t try… but because I didn’t have the “MINIMUM QUALIFICATION.”

I don’t want to wait till I’m 26 to get a degree.

I want to start NOW!
I want to work on real projects.
I want to earn in lakhs.
I want to change my story.

So here’s my question to the internet:

1) Is it practically possible for a 10th pass like me with no degree but pure will to become something big in tech?

2) What are the options for me? 🙂

3) What can I do that actually works?

I’m open to all suggestions.
I don’t want to be stuck anymore.
I just want to do something big.
Something meaningful. Something that finally makes all this pain worth it.

Thanks if you read till the end.
Your words might change someone’s life.
Maybe mine ❤️",Routine-Avocado-6332,1,1.0,0,1748633536,2025-05-30 19:32:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kzd7o6/can_i_become_successful_without_a_degree/,5,2025
1kzcu7h,No response from Fourth Floor,"I wanted to share my personal experience with **Fourth Floor**, since I’ve applied to at least **50+ jobs** they've posted on LinkedIn over the past several months- everything from design roles to assistant positions that matched my background closely.

Every time I apply, I can see that **they view my application** but I’ve **never once received a response**, not even a rejection. No acknowledgment, no follow-up, nothing. It’s disheartening, especially when the same job listings keep getting **reposted again and again**. At some point, I even started wondering if the company is active or if the listings are just **bait posts** to collect resumes.

I’d love to know if anyone here has actually heard back from them or secured a role through them — maybe I’m missing something, or maybe there’s another way to get on their radar?

1kzcepg,How do I approach this?,"I took up an internship as a transitionary job for a year before grad school. When I got offered the job, I was also offered the chance to interview for a full time position. I didn't realize that the internship is more designed for undergrads. I turned down the interview because given my other commitments I didn't think I could do full time and also didn't want to lose the internship. I had been looking for a job for months. Now, I regret it. I should've asked more questions. This job is super simple and does not allow me the opportunity to learn what I want to learn. It is similar to positions I did in undergrad. The thing is my manager just hired a bunch of new full time employees so I'm pretty sure the team is full. The full time employees all have similar qualifications to me so idk if it would be a long shot or not (graduated the same year and stuff). I'm often left asking what to do because I don't have tasks and am not considered to be part of the team. I want to convert to full time or at least be given more responsibility because I cannot see myself doing what I am doing for a year.

1kzbu37,Specialized Skill Set Becoming Less In Demand,"Looking for some advice here. My background is in accounting and finance but about 10 years ago my company purchased some specialized IT Accounting software and I became certified to use it and quickly became the subject matter expert on it. Because of this, I've spent most of the last decade focusing only on this skill set and being the ""go to guy"" for all things related to this software. 
I'm very closely involved with investment and finance discussions and I'm starting to sense that this software will be obsolete at my company in the next few years and I haven't seen any other jobs hiring anyone to do specifically what I do now.

I guess the advice I'm looking for is what should I start doing in order to prepare for the inevitable? My company is moving to an Oracle product that can pretty much do what this current software does but they've got a whole team of Oracle people that will likely take over the types of things I'm doing now. I've never really been a manager or leader so I don't really have leadership experience per se. I suppose I could always jump back into a financial analyst role but that would likely involve a decent pay cut. I'm wondering if I should somehow build my technical skillset in something like Power BI or try to focus on leadership and management training but I really have no desire to be a ""people leader"".

1kzbl0h,Data Analyst Career,"
I’m a 20F, an incoming 3rd-year college student (junior), currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. Just like any other young adult, I feel lost right now and unsure of which path I should really take. To be honest, I’m mostly here for the money—but the problem is, I don’t think I have enough motivation to follow through with my plans.

I have two local scholarships (nothing major—just sponsorships that let me access premium online courses). I’ve been using them to:

1. Expand my knowledge because I *wanted* to pursue artificial intelligence,
2. Get certifications for data analyst roles,
3. And basically just explore other options.

As someone who’s still undecided, I’m starting to realize that maybe pursuing tech was a really bad decision. Now I just feel stuck and don’t know what to actually go for.

On the side, I do design work—and I’d say I’m capable. I designed a logo for a business that ended up actually using it. I also create pubmats, posters, and similar stuff. I’m also proficient in UI/UX design.

I guess this is more of a rant, lol. But I’d really appreciate some advice, especially from those working in the data analytics field. Is it really worth it? Where should I start if I want to pursue that path—internships? Entry-level jobs?

Honestly, in my country, I feel like opportunities in that field aren’t commonly offered to those without experience.

1kzb0s3,First big adult job help / advice,"I have been wanting to ask about this but not sure where to go for advice as nobody in my life has really experienced these things yet either. 
For context i’m 24 years old, and in my first corporate job out of uni. I do consistent retainer based contracted graphic design work for an advertising agency that gets pretty large clientele. Currently there has been a lack in projects (I’m not entirely sure why. In my personal opinion I think the agency asks for too much $$ due to lack of internal organization and speed), and I have been out of work for 1 month now. 
I was not told until the first day of the month that my contract would essentially be changing, and that now I would be operating under an “hourly wage” instead of a fixed monthly pay as before. No new contract was written or signed, I was simply told this and I said okay. They put me under the impression that in June new projects would start up and it would all be back to normal, and for now there would just be less work. Come to find out this only happened to 2 of us on the team including me, and somehow everyone else has been onboarded to different projects and found work to do for the time being. I find it extremely unfair and I am really unsure what to do. I feel extremely under appreciated now, but I am still only 6 months in to this gig and learning a lot since I’m a junior designer. I can’t help but feel like I am not valued and that this contract is just a guise to mistreat workers. 
Luckily I was okay for bills/rent/etc. for the time being since I’m good with saving. But I can’t imagine what would happen if I lived in a different area where rent was higher, or had less leniency with bills due to being in a relationship and sharing these things. *I understand contracted work can be like this, but the contract I signed states that I am to be paid X amount each month for 12 months with renewal optional after that time*

 Just looking for any outside opinions, thoughts, advice, maybe stories from others if they were ever in the same boat. I just feel a bit lost now, because I do enjoy this job; and the people are generally good to work with. It feels so out of the blue it’s got me questioning everything.

1kzaamv,[Fresher] Feeling stuck after placement – Looking for a better start in Networking/Cloud,"Hey everyone,

I’m a recent ECE graduate who’s been working hard over the past year to prepare for placements. After all that effort, I did get an offer—but honestly, it feels more like a checkbox ticked than an actual career opportunity.

The role doesn’t offer much to learn,there is no growth, the salary is just enough to scrape by (especially in a metro city), and it’s starting to hit me that this isn’t the direction I want my career to go.

  
A little about me:

* I have completed my CCNA and  genuinely interested in networking ,cloud
* I’ve built a few personal projects like:
   * A traceroute visualizer called TraceMAP using Python + Plotly
   * A basic network monitoring tool using Wireshark and GNS3
* Experiments with linux hardening ,cloud platform nd even small bits of ELK stack 
* I’m comfortable with AWS ,Azure, writing scripts in Python, and exploring anything new
* I’ve even blogged about some of my learning on Medium and keep my GitHub updated

# What I’m hoping for:

* An opportunity where I can actually grow
* A company, startup, or even individual who values curiousity,potential more than just polished resumes
* I don’t mind starting small—internships, paid traineeships, even contract roles—**as long as there’s something to learn**
* I’m open to relocating or working remotely

Please drop a comment or DM me. I’d be beyond grateful.

Thanks for reading this far. I just want a better start, and I’m ready to work hard for it.

Let me know if you’d like to see my GitHub, blog, resume. Wishing the best to anyone else here going through the same phase.

This week, my team announced that one of our senior employees is moving to a different part of the company. Although I have not asked nor been asked about a promotion, historically we almost exclusively have promoted the top junior when there’s a senior opening, which would be me. The promotion would come with better pay and benefits and not much change in responsibility. 

Obviously I want the raise, but I don’t want to be audacious and ask for a promotion then get a new job in a few months. What’s the best move here? Ask for it directly, wait until it’s offered, or just not accept at all?

I graduated with a degree in Civil Engineering back in 2019 and worked in the field for about a year. Unfortunately, due to the limited job opportunities and low pay in civil-related roles at the time, I made the decision to switch careers.

I’ve been working at a software house in Islamabad for the past 2.5 years as a passive sales person. The job pays decently, but there’s no real growth or future for me here, and I honestly don't feel connected to the work. Now I’m stuck in a dilemma.

I want to get back into civil engineering — it’s what I studied and what I’m truly passionate about. But I’m facing some big challenges:

I only have 1 year of civil experience.

I’ve been out of the field for over 2.5 years and feel rusty.

I don’t know where to start — what jobs to look for, how to bridge the gap, or whether companies would even consider someone like me.


Is there anyone here who’s been in a similar situation or has advice for how I can transition back? Would a certification, short course, or internship help at this stage? Should I apply for junior positions again or look for site-based roles to get back in the game?

Any guidance would be deeply appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Pexels are killing me, it all feels pretty meaningless. Before this, I was a painter, which is what led me to art school in the first place.

1kz8z5r,How to handle racism?,"I'm about to write a post I never thought I would need to write. I work in the US within a primarily Indian company. I'm in engineering and there are very few non-Indians in my role.

Overall the company has been great. But recently I was put on a project with a very senior member of the firm to work on a proposal. Immediately when I joined the project this person insisted that my boss (who is Indian) also be engaged. She had never really met me, so I assumed it was something I need to win her over. My boss does not have the bandwidth to deal with it, so she is now insisting I bring an Indian guy, we will call S, from my team on the project to work on it. So we've been working together on the project.

Everything I create is garbage, terrible, I should know better at my level etc. This has been going on for a while. And she has been complaining about me to my upper management. I one time asked a simple question via email and never heard a response. It turns out she called S and told him the answer.

I've been feeling for a while it is because I'm not Indian.

After todays meeting S suggested he should present next time, because there is something about me that is setting her off. This really shook me because it is confirmation another person has noticed it. S is great. He basically said ""we need to protect you so let me take the hits for now.""

I'm just stuck on what to do. I need this job. I have no actual proof it's racism vs I just suck. Every time I have a meeting with her, my stomach turns. Every meeting is verbal abuse about my work.

I'm reluctant to go to anyone about this. I been around long enough to know what happens. If it gets out I made an accusation, everyone will be afraid to work with me. And there is no proof.

Today they called and said I got the job. On the spot, I panicked a bit and told them I had realized the commute was too long and that I’d need a higher salary.  
  
I now feel a bit irresponsible for not raising this concern during the interview, even though they had been transparent about the salary from the start. I didn’t want to waste anyone’s time, and I worry that I’ve handled this poorly.

Did I handle this wrong? Is it unprofessional to ask for more after the interview even though they told me the salary upfront? Any advice would be appreciated.

I’ve now been working at an agency for about 2 1/2 years now and everyday I am getting more annoyed with working simply because I have the most annoying coworkers!

They constantly complain, act incompetent, misinterpret and read things incorrectly, talk about eachother constantly. I don’t want any parts of the drama, and I genuinely don’t care to hear about their baby daddy drama and etc. the two times I did open up and speak with someone here, they misconstrued my words and told my supervisor something I did not say. It’s a lot of high school type things here with a lot of petty older women. They are always attention seeking and it’s just a very unprofessional environment. 

I am over it but also feeling bad because I’m so quiet and I think it comes off as stand off ish - I do say good morning, etc, but I genuinely do not want to get to know these people. I am the type to work and go home. I don’t attend work events, only if it’s one for just my team of 5-6 people. I have also expressed this to my supervisor who understands 150% and she is quiet like myself.

1kz6dq3,About to be fired. New experience that never happened before. Need advice,"Hello All,

Looking for advice, best practice and best next steps.  Earlier this week, I uncovered a massive oversight on my part with a new process that was given to us two months ago. I had to bring it to the attention of my superiors (following playbook steps) and it has been a terrible experience so far. I consider myself a good performer, with my last performance review being a 5/5 and being told that my greatest strength is being proactive. Unfortunately, I this oversight came up and my hands are tied and I am relying on my leadership for help. My leadership is completely ignoring me at this time and I feel terrible. Their attitude with me has shifted literally overnight. Went from being “golden” to “dirt”.

I already have proactively begun reaching out to my immediate contacts via LinkedIn, already began aggressively looking for new roles, already am at the third round of an organization and scheduled with another company first round of interviews. 

I feel like I am on borrowed time here and should take advantage of looking for a new role now. I feel awful about what happened. I feel like I am now on an island by myself and left to drown. I get their message, if that is what they are intending and feel the best thing would be to start looking.

Any feedback on what my best steps may be? Thank you!",CSMthrowawayaccount,5,0.8600000143051147,3,1748617130,2025-05-30 14:58:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kz6dq3/about_to_be_fired_new_experience_that_never/,5,2025

Company A is a corporate outfit, offering $75K per year in a low cost of living area. Comes with benefits package, 401K, insurance, and relocation assistance.

Downside is the housing market is barren and the area is completely unfamiliar.

Company B is a mom and pop shop offering $65K per year in a higher cost of living area. Similar benefits package. Lower stress

However, after I left that job a little over a year ago I've been struggling to even find interviews.

I feel like I've done everything else: optimized my Linkedin, gotten resume writting help, I've tried both mass submission and very personalized applications, and I have gotten a few interviews. Additionally, I've been able to get a few more interviews through people that I know, which the internet seems to think are the golden ticket to a job, but after having had 6 interviews so far from internal referals 5 have been rejections 1 is still currently pending. The little feedback I've been able to get from these has been that I nterviewed well, with a few minor critiques, and ultimately that there were ""other candidates better qualified for the position"". Which is ultimately what's lead to this question.

I've started looking at the breakdown of education level of people applying for the same positions I am on Linkedin (whether I found the position there, through another job board, or through an internal referal) and it seems that even for the most entry level positions that only require a Bachelors degree and zero to a few years of experience 50% or more of the applicants on Linkedin have some sort of Masters degree. I'm left wondering if the only way to be competitive in this industry, even just to get in, is to pursue an MBA or MS in finance or another related feild? I'm wondering if anyone else is having, or has had a similar experience? I really don't want to spend the time or money going back to school if I don't have to.

1kz5061,Need Career Advice | BCA Final Year Student Confused Between Govt Job & IT Sector,"Hi everyone,
I’m a 19-year-old male from India, currently in my final year of BCA. I’m at a point in life where I’m really confused about what career path to take, and I’d appreciate some honest advice.

I’m stuck between two options:

1. Government job – I’m considering clerical-level government jobs or others that don’t require physical criteria like height, etc.


2. Private sector (IT) – I’m also thinking about going into IT, maybe starting with web development.



The main reason I want to start working soon is because of my family’s financial situation. My father is the only earning member, and I really want to support him and ease some of his burden. That’s why I want to start earning as soon as possible—maybe within 2 to 3 years at most.

Right now, I have zero skills in coding, but I’m planning to start learning web development. I’m also exploring the idea of starting a small side business to generate some income, but I haven’t committed to anything yet.

The problem is that I’m stuck in the “thinking” phase. I overthink so much about which path to take, and in the process, I’m not actually taking any steps forward.

I really want to ask:

Is it realistic to go from zero to job-ready in the IT field in 2–3 years, especially in web dev?

Is government job prep a better path considering my situation?

Can I balance learning IT skills while maybe trying a small side hustle?

Anyone who has faced a similar situation—how did you get started?


Any advice, resources, or personal stories would mean a lot to me. I just want to stop feeling lost and start making progress.

Thanks in advance 🙏",shadowub,1,1.0,0,1748613719,2025-05-30 14:01:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kz5061/need_career_advice_bca_final_year_student/,5,2025
1kz4qlu,Radiology tech or clinical therapist (MSW) for 47 year old?,"I am a 47 year old divorced mom of three teenagers and full-time massage therapist. I own my own business and live in a HCOL area. I am making enough to survive but not a lot more. I am looking for a career change because I will likely need to work into my 70s and don’t see myself doing such a physically demanding job for so long. I’d also like the stability of a salary, being self-employed gets very old without paid time off and health insurance. I also do a lot of deep tissue work, sports massage, etc. so I use my whole body a lot during my day. I am in good shape and don’t mind the physical aspect, but I am aware that I will age and may not always feel so fit. On the plus side, I love working with people, I love helping people, and I love the flexibility of my job. 

  
I’m looking into returning to school for either radiology tech or for a MSW to become a clinical therapist. These are two programs in my area that are flexible and (reasonably) affordable. Radiology tech makes more sense from a purely mathematical standpoint - the program is less expensive and the average salary seems a bit higher. But I know radiology tech is also a physical job, so I’m not sure how I’ll feel in 15 years doing this every day. It’s also an on-site job so I’d be working in a hospital or clinic. I am more drawn to the MSW, mainly because I’ve thought many, many times about becoming a counselor/therapist and I think I could be good at it. I also like the fact that I could eventually work remotely in telehealth. But the program is at the university (vs the community college for rad tech) and costs about 50% more. 

And with AI taking over so many careers, I’m curious if current rad techs or clinical therapists think their jobs are at risk. 

I’d love insight from anyone who works in either of these two fields. Thank you!",SensitiveOption771,1,1.0,1,1748613050,2025-05-30 13:50:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kz4qlu/radiology_tech_or_clinical_therapist_msw_for_47/,5,2025

I need some input about a situation I’m in. Want to just get some feedback from y’all on this.

I (29) am a software dev. I have been working for a consulting firm for the last 6 years. Things are going well for me here. I have a network of people who bring me from project to project, they support me in our talent discussions, and they’ve allowed me to grow and lead.

But truthfully I’m unhappy here. The last 2 years have been tough. I don’t like our project structure, we are always behind and playing catchup, and things feel sloppy. TBH I’m not proud of our work. They also didn’t give promotions or at-level pay increases for 3 years. 

I told my job if I didn’t get a promotion this year, I’d be looking to leave. I gave them an ultimatum. So my team fought hard to assure I’d get promoted. I actually learned I got the promotion this week!

But before learning about the promo, I started interviewing with another job. This job sounds like they will extend me an offer soon. I want to take this job.

Is it wrong of me to accept this job? I gave my current job an ultimatum and they met their end of the deal.

After deciding I wanted to pursue it, I got my Pharmacy Tech license and am currently working as a tech in an inpatient setting. While working here, pharmacists have expressed their concerns with me about pursing pharmacy, and how it also doesn’t seem viable when considering the “insurmountable student debt,” job stability/availability, and lowering salaries. I have yet to look into how accurate and serious their concerns are, but this has caused me to question if I’m pursuing a career that will cause me a lot of hardship in the future. I’m having a hard time deciding, but I am planning on taking a gap year to accumulate experience as a tech and see if this would be a career I’d like to pursue. As of right now, I’ve realized I’m much more interested Pharmacy than I am in pursuing other careers they suggested (RN, NP, PA), as I feel like bedside care isn’t for me. I have also developed numerous of connections with pharmacists, PICs, and other people in the field, but I’m not sure if this will help me as much in the future.

1kz2cda,How to talk about previous consulting experience in an interview without revealing the client?,"Hey everyone,
I'm preparing for a consulting job interview and could use some advice.

In the interview, I’ll need to talk about my previous consulting experience. The challenge is: I worked exclusively for one client throughout my time in consulting, and that client is very unique in their field—basically, anyone familiar with the industry will know who I’m referring to, even if I don’t say the name.

Of course, I know I shouldn’t disclose client names for confidentiality reasons. But it feels really awkward trying to describe the work without making it obvious who the client is. I end up saying clunky phrases like “a large, international organization known for global coordination in X” — and it feels both vague and oddly specific at the same time.

To give an example (not my real case): Imagine I was a consultant from New York who only worked with the UN. How could I talk about that experience without constantly saying “a unique intergovernmental organization headquartered in NYC focused on international policy”?

This is my first job interview since joining consulting, so I’m still learning how to handle these things professionally. Any tips on how to balance confidentiality with being clear and compelling in interviews? How do you frame your experience when it’s obviously tied to one well-known client?",peterschen,1,1.0,0,1748606197,2025-05-30 11:56:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kz2cda/how_to_talk_about_previous_consulting_experience/,5,2025

1kz16p1,I don't know how to respond to tough questions,"Over the past 10 years in my job experience, whenever I am faced with difficult questions especially from client/boss in meetings, I tend to get flustered and end up having incoherent answers that does not really get the answers they need. Knowing this is my weakness, I always try my best to prepare whatever questions they might throw at me and note down the possible answers when the time comes. 

As much as I tried to prepare myself before the meeting, there's always questions coming from them that throw me off guard. Sometimes I know the answer, but can't answer them because I forgot due to my nervousness or I totally did not think of it. 

Here's an example - We are planning to implement something for other business unit. I was asked to find out who bears the cost of the promotion and the purpose of them having it and how long. While I can perfectly execute the implementation process as a business analyst and among other stuff just fine. During that meeting, I had already prepared answers for him, but still it wasn't enough to satisfy his questions because my answers led to more questions from him. To find out the business justification as to why other business units are doing so and so is what I'm struggling with. 

My boss laid an expectation that I need to think things at deeper level and I clearly acknowledge that this is something I need to improve on. But deep inside, I know I have tried my best and admit to myself I am just not being critical enough.

  
I'd greatly appreciate if someone here could have some pointers for me to improve further on having ""deeper thoughts"".

1kz0xe1,Honest Reviews: Job Application Tools Edition,"With so many job application tools out in the market, it's so hard to decipher which ones are good and not. So, I did some research for each tool so that you don't have to ✨

**Smart Applier (Undetectable AI)**  
 **Rating: ★★★★☆**

* **Pros**: It auto-applies to jobs *based* on your actual background, which feels way more targeted than just spraying out resumes. Also super handy that it connects with LinkedIn and ZipRecruiter.
* **Cons**: No in-depth analytics or stats, and setup can take a bit of tweaking.
* **Bottom Line**: If you want *semi-automated* help that still feels personal, this one’s worth checking out.
* **Why it stands out**: It actually tries to match your experience, instead of just spamming jobs!

 **LazyApply**  
 **Rating: ★★☆☆☆**

* **Pros**: Sends out tons of apps fast, works across big platforms.
* **Cons**: The “spray and pray” method - it applies to jobs whether or not you’re a real match. Feels like throwing darts in the dark sometimes.
* **Bottom Line**: Good if you want *quantity*, not quality.

 **Teal**  
 **Rating: ★★★☆☆**

* **Pros**: Fantastic for organizing your search, tracking applications, and keeping notes. Very clean dashboard.
* **Cons**: Doesn’t apply for you, so it’s more of a tracker than a helper.
* **Bottom Line**: Great companion tool if you like to stay organized but want to apply manually.

 **LoopCV**  
 **Rating: ★★☆☆☆**

* **Pros**: Lets you schedule job hunts and auto-applies daily. Easy setup. 
* **Cons**: Application quality feels generic. Cover letters are cookie-cutter.
* **Bottom Line**: Set-it-and-forget-it tool, but don’t expect personalized results.

 [**Simplify.jobs**](http://Simplify.jobs)  
 **Rating: ★★★★☆**

* **Pros**: Super clean UI, autofills applications, and works well with internships and entry-level roles.
* **Cons**: Limited job boards supported, not ideal for more senior positions.
* **Bottom Line**: Awesome for students and new grads. Smooth, fast, and simple!

 **Careerflow**  
 **Rating: ★★★★☆**

* **Pros**: Built-in resume optimizer, Chrome extension for job tracking, and some automation.
* **Cons**: Less consistent in matching you with the right roles.
* **Bottom Line**: Solid all-in-one, though might require a bit more hands-on use than expected.

**Conclusion:**  
Looking for jobs can be tough and tiring. Each of this tool help in their own way, whether you want to automate applications, stay organized, or send out more fast.

None are perfect but using a mix can make things easier. Good luck to everyone out there sending applications and trying to land that next gig.

1kyz4vg,"Complete career pivot, and I'm terrified.","I wasn't sure which subreddit to post this to, and it's a bit of a long winded rant so apologies in advance. 

I burned out. Hard. I've burned out before but this time landed me in hospital and it's completely shifted everything into another perspective for me. 

Ever since I was a kid I wanted to work in film and do art, which I did. I completed a design degree, went straight into working for an animation studio, then TV, then film. I freelanced for a long while doing concept art and storyboarding, illustration, compositing - then the writers strike happened at the same time as AI and completely ruined my entire earning potential for over a year. I was distraught but I worked through it. I moved countries and got fulltime work in VFX and now nearly a year in I've got terrible physical and mental health, I quit my job, and I'm returning home. All in all I'd say I've given about 15 years to this one singular career path of CG and art, doggedly trying to ""break through"" somehow. 

But here's the kicker, I'm not from any of the 1st world countries. All the ""good"" remote jobs are limited to people with a right to work in the country of the company. If I was in the EU I'd have a plethora of options from film to gamedev, but I'm not. What that has left me with is being forced to work in the 3rd world outsource sector with bad salaries, poor management, and a massive pool of talent in competition.   
But for what? I'm 36 now with no savings, no hope of ever affording a home or even a flat, stuck on a survival-level salary with no time for friendships or relationships and too depressed to bother. I once saw this infogrpahic on the 12 stages of burnout and this last week I went full number 12 - full physical and mental breakdown with a little bit of a psychotic break sprinkled in. After I left the hospital I quit my job. 

Now I'm using my last cash to buy a ticket back home, to stay with my parents for a while. I intend to do a 5-month cybersecurity course through a college and at the same time learning backend coding. I know the tech sector is not much better but it's the only thing I could come up with. The cybersecurity thing is the main focus I want to find employment in, especially because the certifications can be done in a short time. 

Thing is, I never studied IT. Through my career and my nerd life I've been very comfortable with computers, I know how scripting works, I understand the basics of Python from compositing in Nuke, I've mostly worked on Linux systems... it just seems like it could be worth it.

My ultimate goal is just to find work as soon as possible, even entry-level will pay more than what I got in VFX anyway. I want some sort of work-life balance, I want to be one of those people complaining about being bored at work so I can also learn some Unreal Engine for fun or something like that. 

Am I being too naive? My home country has a massive brain drain problem and tech is always hiring there, smaller companies especially are looking for long-term employees. All my friends who are in the sector think it's a great idea and are very supportive. I am highly motivated to make it happen and collect certs like pokemon cards if I have to. 

How realistic, at my age, is this idea? I honestly have nothing else I can think of doing. I tried ArchViz but the pressure of that is just as bad. I'm just sick of always having to be grinding at over-capacity. For the last year my work day was literally non-stop work, 15 minutes to eat, plus 3 hours of my time outside of work for commuting and getting ready etc. I couldn't keep it up. I'd happily sit through some boring meetings at this point. 

Does anyone have any advice? I'm flying blind and I've been ground down to a stub to the point where I can no longer trust my own decision making. 

TL;DR mid-30s artist doing the learn to code meme - am I dumb?

1kywkvi,"I've been fired from lots of job, how can I overcome this?","Full disclosure, I'm reeling from being fired for 3 years at my last job suddenly earlier today. So some of this mught come off as venting

Long story short yesterday when I was setting up for an event (I worked manual labor at my school setting up for events) one of the custodians came in and started a conversation up about the event we were setting up for,  It was just us talking about how this event has a lot of young kids running around and they normally trash rooms. I just contributed by saying that it's a lot of kids for very little teachers so of course they're going to get into places they're not allowed. (I don't remember all the details but I'm sure more than that was said) Turns out some people who were part of the event walked into the room at that moment and overheard us. They were so upset they were threatening to not come back the next year, and as a result I got fired (cards on the table, I had definitely had similar issues in the past but I'd really shaped up my act in the last year and a half)

I had worked at this position for 3 years. Before that I had a string of jobs that I hadn't worked at for more than a year or so before either I found a new job, or got fired from it, with all of them ending for similar reasons.I deal with diagnosed autism and ADHD issues and that definitely shows in my jobs.

 I'm 28 years old and as I get older I'm getting more and more scared about my career prospects and my ability to hold down a job. Spatial awareness and social skills have been a struggle my entire life and I feel like it's going to get in my way for the rest of my life 

I do have another job already lined up (I was actually literally days away from putting in my two weeks before this happened) but what's going through my head right now is ""what if I fall into the same trap? What if I do this again? Is this going to ruin future job prospects?""

Another division at the company has a role open which I’m qualified for, it’s purely sales and sales strategy in a completely different product that interests me more than my current. Base pay would not change, annul bonus might come down.

I am very comfortable in my current position, well paid, boss has full trust in me, come and go as I please.

This flexibility and my ability to present myself well has lead me to mastering “getting by” and knowing how to push things through “half assed-ish”.

I think this new role cuts out the technical tasks which I dread and find shortcuts for, and could leave me only doing sales and relationship management which I really enjoy. I don’t want to just half ass my way through a career.

1kyvlcp,Suprise bad performance review,"Hi everyone, would like some feedback here. My new manager started a few weeks ago and it’s been a rough transition. We have been without a manager for about 7 months now, but the team has been managing well. Today I had a surprise performance review before my annual review and it was really bad. I was told I am disrespectful, behind on tasks and unable to do tasks without help. While I can accept that my task management needs to be better, I was absolutly blown away by the disrespect comment and the inability to do tasks without help. 

I have had very minimal training since starting this position, a lot of things were taught to me by a fellow coworker that also never got any formal training. So this means I have questions and this review is making it seem like I ask too many questions. 

New boss has expressed to the team to be honest with him about new things being implemented. I was honest, but I feel my words were twisted and now I am being called disrespectful. 

The day before my review, boss and I had a meeting to discuss some of these issues and I thought we had an understanding and I was going to start working on fixing what he wanted me to fix, only to be surprised with this new review. 

I think it’s worth mentioning that my other team members are having the similar performance issues as me but I am the only one being reprimanded. Should I be worried?

1kysyzu,Received a very quick offer from one company while still in the interview stages with a few others,"Sorry, I know this question has been asked a million times before but my situation has some specific caveats so I am kinda desperate for any advice! So, I've been unemployed as of last week and I've been shooting out applications and interviewing before then and since then. Some I have done final rounds with as of last week and some I am scheduled to speak with next week. 

This one company I just interviewed with earlier this week surprisingly got back to me with an offer today and didn't state a deadline to accept but they want me to start in like 6 business days (I originally wanted some more time off since I only just recently left a toxic job and went straight to job hunting without having taking a real vacation in over a year). Unfortunately, they are not my top choice at all. Should I **(a)** ask to have more time to consider the offer and make an informed decision either by mentioning I have pre-scheduled interviews coming up (or not mentioning that at all) *or* **(b)** try to negotiate the start date back a bit?

I've read through so many similar threads and seen conflicting comments that the offering company may understand that you as a candidate are interviewing at other places or that they may just move on to their runner up candidate. I've also seen comments about starting at the company if they aren't flexible on timing and just reneging if a better offer comes along later but I am worried that (on top of appearing unprofessional and burning bridges) even a super short stint at a place might come up in a background check (?) and it will look bad to future employers. 

And then should I make all the other places I am in consideration at aware that I have to respond to an offer soon and ask for either an update or an expedited interview timeline? I just had a screener today with a place that is my top choice and it sounded positive and they said the next steps would be 3 rounds of interviews with the team (no idea if that'd be all back to back or spread out) but they would get back to me in a few days. Most places take days just to schedule the next round so this process is so stressful and I don't want to feel compelled to take the first offer I get but I also can't afford to be too choosy right now and lose out...",legalandregal,4,1.0,3,1748571606,2025-05-30 02:20:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kysyzu/received_a_very_quick_offer_from_one_company/,5,2025

1kys71y,My OE Cheat Sheet (Interview Edition),"I recently began experimenting with OE (overemployment), but the true problem isn't getting jobs; it's passing several interviews regularly. Especially when you're searching for jobs in many industries and need to appear honest in each. Here is my own OE interview cheat sheet after a few rounds:

1. Create role-specific preparation templates early.  
I've been looking for marketing, project management, and data analyst positions. I used Beyz AI's interview question bank to construct three unique prep profiles, each with the most relevant questions for the job type. This allowed me to stay in character and respond organically to each part without merging egos.

  
2. Conduct fake interviews to alter your thinking.  
Sometimes I prepare for two completely different interviews in one day. I rely on a fast 15-minute mock interview session in Beyz to alter my mental focus. It's more than just simple Q\&A; it provides specific criticism on tone, structure, and clarity. Practicing like this allowed me to transition roles faster and sound more concentrated.

3. Stories > scripts  
Beyz's cheatsheet function is ideal for organizing STAR tales by role. I don't memorize whole answers anymore; instead, I use bits from my ""story bank"" to meet the question. That way, I can remain malleable while also seeming detailed and honest.

  
If you're also experimenting with OE, having a reliable interview AI assistant is really crucial. Beyz AI helped me simplify my preparation and stay focused even when I had back-to-back interviews.",werakogej5449,2,0.75,2,1748569313,2025-05-30 01:41:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kys71y/my_oe_cheat_sheet_interview_edition/,5,2025

1kyrmpg,Career pivot advice: from Education to Corporate (Sales or Learning and Development),"Hey everyone, looking for some perspective as I make a major career pivot.

I’m an educator (former teacher, current Administrator) and school leader with over a decade of experience in teaching, coaching, people management, and training. I originally started in phone and field sales before moving into education, where I found a calling helping kids, especially as someone who immigrated here and had to learn a new language and culture from scratch. I moved up into leadership roles (obtained a Masters) and have spent years designing curriculum, leading teams, and developing others—skills I know translate well into the corporate world. 

I’m ready for a change. I want to bring my experience into a corporate environment where I can continue helping people grow, while also challenging myself and providing for my family in a meaningful way. I’m looking at associate-level roles in client development, account management, sales, or corporate learning and development. I’m bilingual (English/Spanish), coachable, and hungry to learn. I definitely anticipate needing to earn my stripes and prove myself, which I am excited to do, if a leader bet on me. 

My biggest question: what’s the best way to position myself to recruiters or hiring managers so they see the value of my background without dismissing me as “just a teacher” or “just a principal”? Are there strategies or types of companies/job titles that are especially good for someone like me looking to break in?  

Appreciate any advice, stories, or resources from folks who’ve made a similar jump—or helped others do it.

Thanks in advance.

1kyrkc4,Enterprise MT vs Junior Financial Analyst – Not Sure What to Do,"Hey everyone, I’d appreciate some advice.

I’ve been at Enterprise for 3 years as a detailer while studying, and I recently graduated from a top Canadian business school (finance & econ). Now I’ve been offered a Management Trainee (MT) role at Enterprise and a Junior Financial Analyst job at a small manufacturing company.

The MT role is long hours (11/day), and I don’t love the team or store. But I’ve already proven myself, and there’s clear upward mobility. The analyst role is fewer hours, more aligned with my degree, and I’d be working directly under the CFO — but it’s a small company, and I don’t have a CPA or CFA.

Honestly, I don’t love finance either, but I feel like I’m chasing the analyst title more than anything. Both jobs are 20 minutes from home.

Worried I’ll regret leaving Enterprise after investing 3 years — but also don’t want to stay stuck in a path I don’t love.

1kyrj48,Company RTO demands but my contract is remote… any options?,"I was hired in October 2021 (during Covid) as a remote employee. Under pre-COVID conditions, my position would have been office based. 

In January, the company announced a mandatory 3-day RTO, enforced by badge scan. 

I (and other remotes or those with a covid-era arrangement) were exempted forever under our current positions. Then, they changed policy to say we were exempted until December 2026. 

Today we learned that by Monday we have to declare our intentions: 

1- do you intend to comply with the company RTO policy?

2- if yes, when will you move to office location?

There is no “if no” option. 


I asked my manager what happens if we say no, and what happens if we say yes but then life changes before we can move. My manager knows my situation already— I’m 2,000 miles away from the nearest office, and I’m the only child to 2 sets of elderly and infirm parents. Plus my own kiddo and my spouse— moving isn’t in the cards. 

Do I have any recourse or options since my company changed the terms of my employment (remote to office based) despite prior reassurances that I’d be OK? 

Or am I out of luck because I’m in the US? (Company global HQ is France but US offices on the east coast)

1kyrbwg,"I'm an intern-turned-employee, how do I set boundaries and deal with a patronizing boss?","Long post ahead. **TLDR**: I was an intern working for a small company and was forced to become my boss's personal assistant full-time. He's condescending and demands immediate responses, doesn't care about work hours, holidays, or weekends. The stress has begun to impact my health and my life severely, and my HR manager isn't listening when I tell her I'm not fit for the role. I'm not sure what to do next. 

I've been working at a very small company for a year now. I started off as a summer intern but they liked me so much they offered me a permanent position as an accounting assistant. The job was great, pay was obviously great since I’m aware internships don’t always pay, and I felt like I was a valued member of the team. I helped my boss occasionally but he had his own personal assistant so I was able to focus on my accounting work. A few months ago, he randomly told me that his personal assistant was being let go and I would be “expected to take her place and work for him.” 

I immediately asked our HR manager if this was true and she said yes. I didn’t say anything at first because, at the end of the day, I’m fairly young (20) so I thought it was just be something I’d have to suck up and do to keep my job. Unfortunately, even while I was being trained, he began to get demanding. It started with extremely specific requests such as him telling me to organize his files in a convoluted way and redo everything if I messed up, but I figured everyone has their preferences and tried to memorize all the conventions. Lately, he started calling me on my off-days really late at night for things that weren’t urgent. If I didn’t answer, he would get very upset and tell my manager. 

I’m still a part-time uni student and had a great work-school balance as an accounting assistant, but now he was calling me during my off-days when I would be in class. All this started making me very anxious— inducing work nightmares and mini-panic attacks when I would forget to answer the phone and he’d start getting angry at me. 

I have *repeatedly* told my HR manager that I was very uncomfortable taking on this role as a part-time student, that I was concerned I couldn’t meet his expectations and I didn’t want to disappoint him, but I quickly realized they were expecting me to do this no matter what because he ‘needs’ a personal assistant. It’s taking a really big toll on my mental health and I feel constantly on edge and afraid he’s going to get angry with me. He’s so condescending and hard to please, it feels like I can’t do anything right.

I loved my accounting job and love my coworkers but my friends and family are starting to notice that he’s all I can talk about. I can't enjoy anything because I’m checking my work email nearly every hour. Why does it seem so hard to set my boundaries? It feels like I can't say no. And it seems unfair to me that I didn’t even get a say in accepting the position. I would have immediately turned it down because I know I’m an anxious person who could never do something like this without freaking out about it, and now I’m just being proven correct. ",operagrandis,4,0.8399999737739563,2,1748566719,2025-05-30 00:58:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kyrbwg/im_an_internturnedemployee_how_do_i_set/,5,2025

It says on my contract that ""if I resign from employment, I agreed to provide company with at least 2 weeks prior written working notice.""

I'm worried what my boss would say regarding the contract as I don't have that much experience resigning from work as I was only layed off from a previous job that I worked for 8 years.

1kyr7fr,Just want to hear some opinions,"First time ever to write anything here.

I'm Korean and a multilingual person, speaking total of four languages fluently.

When I was in uni, I pursued to work in the music industry while utilizing my language skills. Luckily, I got the opportunity to work at a well-known KPOP company.

But the work was horrible and I had such hard times, ended quitting after 6 months. It was extremely tough regarding long working hours and the role wasn't a good fit to me as I realized I was not much of a creatives.

So as a next step, I hopped to a semiconductor industry that was a pretty big global company. It was a leap but the role itself was similar to what I did before as the main task was communicating in foreign languages, and I mainly wanted to have a job that had stable working hours.

It's been about 3 months since I started working at semiconductor, but I'm keep wondering if I want to continue doing an office job (sitting long hours in front of the desk, sending emails) or have a career shift.

I'm planning to have an interview at big guitar brand for retail position, but not sure if I am willing to take the risk and go for such change as I even have to move abroad for this role.

On the other hand, I also feel like I want to still try out new things while I'm still in my 20s, but realistic things (like current job is stable, and having too short job hops would not seem too good on paper) always get me.

Of course I'm the one who should be making the decision, but I just wanted to hear other people's thoughts on my career path. Sorry for the long ass text.

1kyqoi0,28F stuck in entry level jobs and no career path,"Hello everyone, 

I am 28f and previously worked in the hotel industry for 7 years. I was mostly front desk but became a supervisor twice and then moved to sales. I was fired from my sales coordinator job after a little over a year because ""I wasn't performing as well as I once was"" and I kept making small mistakes. That was very traumatic for me as I was at that property for almost 4 years. I then moved to another hotel to be a sales manager, but left after 10 months due to a toxic work environment and hating the job. 

I now work for an association in their meeting services department, but I am just in an entry level admin roll and I tend to make a lotttt of careless mistakes. I try to double check or go slowly but i am so scatterbrained and unorganized due to my adhd that I still make mistakes and look stupid. I try asking for feedback but I feel like it's not true feedback and I can't tell if they think I'm doing well or if they take me seriously (I had a regional sales director say to my face at a conference that she can't take me seriously because im too goofy and outgoing and that stays with me). I just got my bachelors in marketing at age 27 and I want to move into marketing but I fear I am extremely unqualified. 

I don't feel like I'm really good at anything at all other than being friendly and energetic which seems to get me in trouble or targeted by bosses even if I'm doing my job. I don't feel like I'm gaining any skills, and I fear I'm not going to be able to move up in my career or break into marketing. I know the job market is so competitive with qualified people and we are heading into financial uncertainty and I feel absolutely horrible not having a secure career and enough skills to secure me in a career path. 

Do you think being almost 30 or early 30s without being in a managerial position or a secure career path or secure skills means I'm behind or incompetent? I've applied for marketing jobs but haven't received anything back and have stopped looking since working for my association for almost a year. Is starting a career in marketing in your 30s a disadvantage due to people being younger and on trend and more qualified? Panicking feeling like I'll always be insecure in a job and struggling.

Hey folks 👋

Just wanted to share something I’ve been working on recently, i realized many roles are only posted on internal career pages and never appear on classic job boards.
So I built an AI script that scrapes listings from 70k+ corporate websites (about 1M jobs).

Then I wrote an ML matching script that filters only the jobs most aligned with your CV, and yes, it actually works.

You can try it [here](https://laboro.co) (for free).  

If you're job hunting or just curious, check it out. Would love any feedback or suggestions. feel free to drop a comment or DM. And if you know someone who’s looking for work, feel free to share it with them too.

(If you’re still skeptical but curious to test it, you can just upload a CV with fake personal information, those fields aren’t used in the matching anyway.)

i'm a junior in hs, so it's around the time i need to figure my shit out.

i would love to work in the marketing/digital world. i'm a beast at videography (tiktok editing for 6 years on ae on a 2008 mac makes u learn a lot) and with some classes, my skills wouldn't be an issue. i am a photographer, i understand content creation, and some of the psychology behind it. in general, it comes easy to me to learn new skills in this realm. problem is, i haven't spent as much time as i want to here because of more practical things in my life (grades, jobs, extracurriculars that are better for common app) so my nonexistent portfolio is limited. i can't allow myself to invest in this career because i am so afraid of not making money/succeeding, especially with the amount of debt that comes from school  AND you don't even need to major in marketing to do this type of stuff. BUT i definitely like the idea of this the most.

other route, PA. yes big jump. i'm okay smart and genuinely do love helping people (kinda an empath), and bigger thing, i'll defo make money if i survive PA school. the passion is generally liking helping people, but, PA is more because of the money, which may be your turn off to going to picking this BUT WE GOTTA BE REALISTIC HERE. my parents are NOT wealthy people, i want to be able to give them stability. like not at all. like I will be swimming in my own debt and probably their's for years.

  
i had an idea to get all my prereqs for PA school during college, but spending all my time trying to make it in the marketing realm and if i graduate with a bio degree and didn't make it in marketing, i would get all my patient care hours and etc in a gap year after college, and then apply for PA school. this plan is just much slower, and i would need to keep my grades up in my bio classes while trying to make it in marketing (which classes are MUCH easier) which makes marketing version of me's life harder when i'm trying to ""make it.""

I know someone who’s been trying to get into tech for the past 4 years. He is EU citizen but can work in UK without visa restrictions.

He struggled badly with coding assessments, ghosting, and hiring freezes. Eventually, it affected his mental health,  gained weight, stopped socialising, spent all day on screens. He was depressed for a while but has been seeing a psychologist and is now ready to get back in the game.

Software engineering feels out of reach now. He’s open to other tech roles (not coding-heavy) and even willing to do another MSc in AI part-time.

What roles or certs (AWS, CompTIA, etc.) would help him restart? Should he start from the very bottom again?

then i could pick radiology, i don’t know anything about it. i don’t like it or dislike it, all i know is that you can get money quick and fast. especially in this economy??? i need a stable foundation. 

i value passion and purpose rather than money, but what if i have no money but the purposeful job?? then what if i have money but no passion in my job???
i’m young so i have time to experiment and make mistakes but damn man, i don’t want to stick with healthcare and be like what if this actually worked out? and then i don’t want to do journalism, get out the military, and have holes in my pockets.

i value passion/purpose over money but in this day in age, i don’t even know.

1kyoxcd,Boss put me on PIP,"Before all this happened, my boss told me all the time that I was doing well and a good fit for my job.  The fly in the ointment was that she kept pushing me into working with clients I didn't feel I was able to help appropriately.

I pissed her off by telling her I didn't feel comfortable working with a certain type of client unless I was trained first.  I asked, several times, for formal training.  ""Training"", for her, appears to be throwing me in the deep end of the pool and seeing if I swim or drown.  When I told her I am concerned working with a client I don't have formal training to see is unethical, she put me on PIP.

It should be noted that the month prior, she shot me down for a raise.  I can't help but feel this is retaliation.

I'm shutting up and doing what she tells me, but the whole thing took a huge toll on my confidence and I will never trust her again.

1kyow7v,How to go about telling a company you have only worked at for a few months that you got offered a higher paying job?,"So I recently moved from one state to another to take a position.  I have been at said position for a little over 2 months.

How do I not burn any bridges or is it impossible to not upset the company I am currently working with? They have all been nice, but the schedule is super hectic and just not challenged at all yet. They hoped to move me up in the hierarchy in the upcoming months but for now just doing grunt work. 

I am not sure why I feel bad or have loyalty to the current company as I know I need to do what is best for me. But at the same time hate confrontation and want to still be on good reputation with them. Any advice? Anyone experience something similar?

1kyodxn,How to be a creative executive for a studio?,"OMG! I’m on episode 4 of The Studio and I’m totally hooked. Maybe it’s just the flair of television, but I’m really considering being a creative executive. I’m a video production major in my community college, and have been consistently producing films for film festivals the past couple of months. You see, I’m not a great screenwriter, I’m decent with a camera and editing, but I’ve always loved movies and helping my friends with their screenplays and being on set. I go around and network with other creatives, try to secure locations, have my friends pitch scripts to me, do all the scheduling, do casting calls, assign crew’s roles and opportunities to make their vision happen. Literally being the foundation to whatever their films may need. And I LOVE IT. So when I’m watching The Studio, I’m like: Is this for me??!

After I graduate from community college, I want to go for a bachelor’s degree. So what should I do that would get me closer to becoming a creative executive for a studio (which probably wont happen for another fifteen years, but I’d like to try!)?

1kynfk5,Please tell me what to do,"I was just wondering if I could get anyone's advice on my current situation. I'm 23 years old, and I'm trying to enroll in a college. And, you know, between the federal Pell Grant and the loans, there's still money left over that I have to pay. And the federal Pell Grant helps alleviate some of that. But there was a question on the FAFSA form about are you homeless, are you at risk of being homeless, or something to do with financial hardship. And my parents had said something about they thought they were going to have to move me out. They don't need disruption in their home, all this kind of stuff. And both my counselor and one of the providers that I was seeing for mental health had suggested I go away to a residential facility or a group home. And anyway, so I had answered yes to that because I do have financial hardship. And depending on how bad things get, I guess technically I could be at risk of being homeless, even though I'm not currently homeless or living on the street. And I wasn't intentionally trying to lie. I guess I just read the question and answered it as honestly to my ability as I could. Anyway, so the people at the college are wanting some kind of paperwork or documentation from my
providers that know a little bit about my situation, I guess, to put that in there. And anyway, my mother came into my room earlier today and wanted to know why I was lying to the federal government and said it made her and my dad look bad, like they don't provide for me. My mom had said something along the lines of, you know, I couldn't even take the classes that I needed to take to pass or graduate high school. I'm assuming she's referring to me struggling with math in high school because I did struggle with math in high school. And I took algebra one, geometry and algebra two and struggled a lot in it. But I think I did get through it. I just had a lot of difficulty and I was one of the students that was always took out of the classes that they would help extra and sometimes they would give us the answers. Anyway, so I've never really had a good algebra foundation like with the imaginary numbers and the quadratics and all that. I've never had like a super strong background in it. And so when I got to college and started taking chemistry and stuff, some of the classes were kind of hard and they couldn't take out loans in 2020, which is when I graduated high school. For personal reasons, they couldn't take out any loans. So I wasn't able to attend a university at that time. They could only pay for me to do like this little vocational diploma program at a commuter college. It was like 10 months. Anyway, so they paid for that and they did pay when eventually when I got older and transferred to a university, they did pay on that and anything that was left over from the loans, they did pay on and they paid for my parking pass. But everything else, like I'm kind of having to take out the loans and stuff in my name personally, and they said that they couldn't finance keep continuing to finance ‘a risk’. And I guess there's a concern that I'll fail out because of the classes and you know, it's going to be really expensive to fail the classes. And it's just not really seeming like maybe it's working out. So I have a job as a CNA. It's really hard on my body and I'm not really able to do it. But a couple times here and there, I can't do it full time. And I have a pharmacy tech job that I do. But it's mostly like metrics that you have to meet. But I don't. I had I had hopes of going and being able to do more because, you know, like at Walgreens, for example, they're always asking about, you know, if you have a bachelor's degree and they were paying people like that were walking in off the street more money than they were paying me. And I was the one training them after I had gone to school for 10 months to be a pharmacy technician. I was only making like fifteen dollars an hour. So then I went to the hospital and they do pay me much better there. But I honestly hate the job. And I guess, you know, being in the hospital setting, it's kind of like academia. It's always competitive. And when are you going to go back and learn and do more and all of that kind of thing? And I've I struggle kind of in the classes. I'm not really sure that I can pass like, you know, organic chemistry and biochemistry and all that. I've never been like really good and super heavy evolutionary type stuff, mainly just because I guess it's not of interest to me. So I was thinking maybe the biology degree I was in was maybe not the right fit. And maybe, you know, pharmacy school isn't the right fit because too much, you know, chemistry. I don't really know. But anyway, she had come into my room earlier and was wanting to know why I was lying to the federal government and had said that about, you know, makes them look bad and all this. But to be honest, there have been times when not long ago they were talking about thinking they're going to have to move me out of the house. They said they don't need disruption in their home. And they had said something about. They had said something about. I'm trying to remember. My counselors and doctors had said something about one or thought maybe I should go to a group home or a residential facility. They had brought that up. And so I wasn't actually trying to lie. I was just trying as best as I could read the question. Give as honest of an answer as I could based off of my situation at the time when I did answer that question. So no, I'm not homeless or living on the street or anything. Although sometimes I want to be. I guess I'm just, you know, she got really mad and then she wanted to know if I was video recording her. And after I said no, she's like, show me and went over there to my phone. And it's like touching on it and stuff, you know, to make sure that I'm not recording her and said, you know, that's illegal. If you ever record me and all of this. A lot of times in the past. That have been said, like, you know, being told, you know, I'm selfish because I have depression and stuff and. Asking, you know, if I have demons and all of that. So I did record some of that mostly just because I wanted it to be able to listen to. I didn't want it to be like, you know, I'm not homeless. I'm not living on the street. So I did record some of that mostly just because I wanted it personally to go back and listen to. Because sometimes it just these little conversations happen really fast and I don't know how to process it as fast as they happen. Anyway, there's that. And I guess I'm just trying to figure out like. I guess I'm just trying to figure out like. You know, what, if anything I should do, if I should just. Not go back to college, you know, if there's this many problems, you know, financing at all. And this many academic difficulties and, you know, she kind of was honest, you know, I did struggle in high school math. So I was just wondering what everybody else's thoughts were on this because I don't.

1kym35o,"Take a Closer-to-Home Job and Stay with Parents Longer, or Stick It Out and Move to the City?","Take a Closer-to-Home Job and Stay with Parents Longer, or Stick It Out and Move to the City?

Hey all, looking for some advice as I’m really torn about a career/life decision. 23M 

I’m currently living with my parents, making around $65k/year. I pay them ~$700/month (covers rent + car insurance). My current job is fully in-office and requires a 2-hour round trip commute to the city every day. It’s draining, and to be honest, I don’t love the work—I’m a Software Engineer, but fixing bugs and staring at a screen all day isn’t fulfilling to me. I’m more extroverted and think I’d enjoy something more on the business side.

Recently, I got a job offer that’s much closer to home only a 15-minute drive each way and it offers two remote days per week. The role would be more of a Tech Specialist, so still somewhat technical but leaning more toward business/communication. It feels more aligned with what I enjoy, but here’s the catch: taking this job would likely mean continuing to live at home for at least another year or two to save money or find a job in a big city…( worried about how job hopping looks on my resume)

Here’s where I’m torn:
I’ve been dreaming about finally moving to the city, having my own place, and enjoying my early 20s—meeting new people, going out, building independence. But that lifestyle would likely require sticking with my current (unfulfilling) job for a while longer, just to afford it.

So I’m stuck between:
	
•	Taking the new, more enjoyable job closer to home, with better work-life balance, but delaying my move and independence, or

	•	Sticking with my current city job, pushing through the long commute and unfulfilling work for now, just so I can move out and live the lifestyle I want sooner.

Any advice or perspective would be appreciated. ",SillyMonkey502,4,1.0,5,1748552453,2025-05-29 21:00:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kym35o/take_a_closertohome_job_and_stay_with_parents/,5,2025
1kym2v6,Negotiating raise and promotion,"I’m based in Minnesota, where employers are now required to post salary ranges. Last year around July, during my 1-year performance review, my manager told me I was doing very well but said I couldn’t get a raise because I was already being paid “too much” for my level. For context, I’m an Engineer, 25, I and have been making $80K for the past two years. I started at $55K and job hopped a couple times since I graduated college but haven’t had much luck lately with the job market.

Earlier this year, our company was acquired, and job postings for our roles were made public. Here are the posted ranges:

• Associate Engineer I-II: $65K–$77K

• Engineer I-II: $77K–$97K

• Senior Engineer: $104K–$130K

So, it turns out I’m actually being paid close to the bottom of the range for my level, not the top like I was led to believe.

I brought this up to my manager back in February, pointing out the discrepancy. I have my next annual review in about two months, and I’m planning to ask for either:

• A raise from $80K to $87.5K if I remain at Engineer I

• Or if I’m promoted to Engineer II, I’d like to ask for $97K (the top of the posted range), while expecting they might counter with a bit less

Does this sound like a reasonable ask? I plan to leave the company sometime next year once my 401(k) vests, but in the meantime, I’d like to be paid fairly.

I have been approached by other agencies for similar positions, however I don’t think I’d like to work as a recruiter if I manage to leave this job.

We have expanded into civil work, including surveying, commercial landscaping, piping, concrete, trucking & hauling, and general earthworks. I am 19 years old, still in University and I am starting to wonder if this a risk i should take. My father & brother are the owners, and they are saying in years from now we can be multimillionaires if we play our cards right. Within the past two years, they have made a few million dollars, and they are not contempt with that and want to grow more.

They are saying they want me to be part owner, and once we grow more, I will run sub divisions within our company. It might take a few years for me to learn, but I believe that the money & authority within the business will come sooner then later for me.

I am heading up to one of our jobs in a week or so, and I will be doing the surveying, machine operation, and other endeavors that they usually partake in. I've had the opportunity to see the behind the scenes such as bidding, how they get work, and have been invited to attend meetings with our business partners. It seems like this operation is getting big, and the room for growth is high, so I am wondering if you guys think i should take the leap.

Well with no response and no movement it appears the company decided they don't care. With that I've started to thumb through the classifieds. I found a spot five min from my current job, the pay is nearly 50% higher then current pay and per the job description less work. 

I'm on the fence if I should apply and if I do apply what if they want to higher. I have this stupid feeling that I need to stick around for my team and very large projects I am managing right now. I hate being loyal, it makes eating good so hard.

1kyk24i,Struggling to choose between Robotics and High-Tech Engineering MSc at TU Delft – advice welcome,"  
**TL;DR:**  
Choosing between **TU Delft's MSc in Robotics** and **High-Tech Engineering (Mechatronics)**.  
Background: BSc Mechanical Engineering + minor in CS. Almost switched to software, but prefer working with physical systems.  
I live in the **Netherlands**, so local job prospects matter.  
Robotics = exciting but new; High-Tech = stable but more traditional.  
**Looking for advice from people with similar experience.**  
  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi everyone,

I'm currently trying to decide between two Master's programs at TU Delft and would really appreciate some advice or personal experiences. The options I’m considering are:

* **MSc Robotics**: [Link](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/robotics/msc-robotics/programme)
* **MSc Mechanical Engineering – High-Tech Engineering track (focus on Mechatronics)**: [Link](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/me/msc-mechanical-engineering/track-overview/track-high-tech-engineering/curriculum)

# Background

I have a **Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering** and did a **minor in Computer Science**. For a while, I seriously considered switching to Software Engineering entirely (mostly for the money and WFH options and job flexibility), but I’ve realized my heart is still more in (at least partially) **physical systems** — especially the intersection between mechanics, electronics, and software.

I'm particularly interested in **mechatronics and robotics**, and I enjoy both theoretical work and hands-on engineering. I live in the **Netherlands**, so the local job market is a major factor in my decision.

Here’s how I currently see the pros and cons:

# Robotics MSc

**Pros:**

* Highly interdisciplinary
* “Jack of all trades” approach — which could be a strength in innovative, emerging fields
* Niche field with strong long-term potential
* Flexible curriculum with lots of electives

**Cons:**

* May lack depth in specific areas (""jack of all trades, master of none""?)
* Still a relatively new program and field — uncertain how soon it will really take off
* Smaller job market in the Netherlands (as of now)
* Risk of being too broad or not specialized enough

# ME High-Tech Engineering MSc (Mechatronics focus)

**Pros:**

* Builds directly on my mechanical engineering background
* Broader job applicability, especially within the Dutch industry
* Established, proven field with a good reputation
* Theoretical but solid academic foundation

**Cons:**

* Possibly a bit too traditional?
* Less interdisciplinary compared to Robotics
* Slightly more rigid curriculum
* The curiculum is not really mechatronics as it lacks electronics and software

  
I’m really torn. Robotics sounds exciting and future-oriented, but High-Tech Engineering (with a mechatronics focus) feels safer and more aligned with the Dutch job market.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation, or gone through either of these programs? Any thoughts on how employers in NL see these degrees?

**I’d really appreciate any advice, insight, or personal experience!**

Thanks in advance 🙏

I’m 24 years old and currently have two certificates(CCNA R&S: Routing and Switching Essentials and CCNA R&S: Introduction to Networks )  an upcoming diploma in Computer and Network Technician. I’m trying to figure out what specific IT career I should pursue. The thing is, I’m not great at math, and communication isn’t really my strong suit either. I feel like I have different strengths, but I’m a bit lost on which direction to take.  
I recently applied for a 6-week internship with the following main duties:

* Participating in the laboratory’s daily work
* Recording results in the computer system
* Ensuring the proper operation of assigned equipment
* Photographing all incoming devices that will be tested
* Helping prepare the lab’s equipment maintenance and calibration/control program

I’m wondering if this internship is worth my time and effort. Has anyone here been through something similar? Did it help you get a foot in the door or build useful skills?

1kyjfmd,Boss is retaliating against me for reporting him and for knowing private info about him.,"Hey all. Looking for guidance on what to do here. I’m certain my boss is targeting to get me fired and I would like to know what I can do in this situation. 

Backstory: when my boss first got hired on, he was very flirty with all the young girls in our area. Including myself. Things took a step further when he and a girl in a sister branch (not under his management but closely related), started sleeping together secretly. She told me in confidence a little while back but I never reported it because I don’t want to mess with someone’s livelihood. She also disclosed to me she knew of him doing something similar previously with another lady in our department that answers to him currently. 
When he started getting flirty with me, I reported him to his direct supervisor and they handled it. But I’m sure he knows I was the one who reported him because he’s treated me negatively ever since. All this being said I did not, nor wanted to report any of this because I don’t really care. BUT I now know he knows I’m aware of his activities since that girl and I are no longer friends and she’s spilled the beans. 

Now to more current times: he has taken extreme measures against me at any and every little mistake. His boss seems to typically side with me when these issues arise but I know at the end of the day we’re all put to protect our own butts. But what can I do at this point? He’s launched investigation after investigation on me and I feel like he’s aiming to get me fired to keep his secrets. What do I do?

Also I have a meeting with his boss later to discuss how I’m feeling about all of this, and to gain a better understanding of what exactly I am being accused of. I am not naive, I know there have been times I have messed up and own up to it when it happens but it feels like given the opportunity he exploits all of it.

1kyjboe,Should i stay or not,"Background:
I worked for a year in a BPO in india, then quit. My last working day was during the first week of May. After taking a one-week break, I joined a new company — a logistics firm based in Europe.

Current Job Situation:
The new job offers a better salary — about 25% more than my previous package — which initially seemed like a good opportunity. However, several things promised during the hiring process are not being followed:

The job was supposed to have a fixed salary with no targets or minimum quotas.

Workdays are Monday to Friday, with 2 weekends per month expected.

The shift is supposed to be 10 hours a day, but there’s always leftover work, so I end up staying at least 30 minutes extra daily — which is unpaid.

The manager now expects me to learn additional tasks related to a completely different role, which wasn’t discussed initially.

They are also planning to extend weekend shifts from 2 to 3 per month, again without any increase in pay.


It’s only been a little over 10 days since I joined, and I’m already seeing red flags. Financially, I have enough savings to manage for about two more months, so I’m feeling uncertain about what to do next.",CorgiEmergency2567,3,1.0,0,1748545783,2025-05-29 19:09:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kyjboe/should_i_stay_or_not/,5,2025

1kyinxt,Car Sales/ Career Advertise/ 23M Married,"Hello Everyone , this will be a long post so I thank you in advance for taking the time to read through it.

I started in the car business at 18 years old at a Mitsubishi store in Long Island. They mainly sold used cars 2-300 cars inventory. I began as a bdc rep and quickly moved up to sales. My first month as a sales rep I sold 16 cars. From there I was averaging about 18-20 cars a month. It was decent , the hours were brutal , but I was making decent money. I dropped out of college to pursue this as the checks were great, I thought of turning this into a career. I stayed there for about a year before leaving to an independent store.

The independent store located in great neck is where I learned the most. As I had a decent relationship with the owner who just like me started in the industry at a young age. We had about 100-200 cars in stock. I was delivering around 20-25 cars a month. My best month ever I sold 33 cars. Made like 19 grand! However, things quickly took a turn downhill. There were constant changes within bdc, advertising, inventory, management etc, employee turnover was astronomically high. This caused my numbers to tank and I began getting tired of this environment. The owner saw how as a salesperson I was eager to learn about finance, dealer operation basically how does this business run. He gave me a shot as sales manger. I was exited and did decent. Delivered 50 cars a month with 100 in stock best month was 75 and learned ALOT! From dmv verify system, lender submissions, compliance, structuring deals CDK, DealerTrack etc. I began to run the idea through my head that hey if he could leave his job and start this small business why can’t I! I was basically running the place.

So fast forward 3 years I partnered up with a bodyshop/ repair shop that wanted to sell cars. It seemed like a dream in the beginning but quickly fell short. I am here literally every day managing inventory , 20ish cars doing what I was doing the other store but on a much smaller scale. Granted I have learned a lot on the office/ backend side of things, accounting , bookkeeping things about repair and body shop of things etc. but we really do not have capital to continue operations. Plus come to find out we have serious liability’s, tax issues that I just came to find out. So now I want out and need a job lol.

My question is what do I do? I’ve applied to around 50 jobs and am waiting to hear back. So far I took an offer at a well established private store just to sell cars 200 cars inventory 30 years in business , in house service etc. they gave me a decent pay plan and it’s straight 1099 meaning I get paid to my corp. I’m doing this just to make some $ which I need to because I have substantial bills for my age. Goal is 10-12k a month. I have a stay at home wife and 2 year old daughter. However, I prefer an F&I role I would hate to go back to being a salesperson after being a manager / owner. How likely is it I get another F&I position? Do I keep looking at decently sized used car lots/dealers? Franchise stores? Luxury sales? Career change- maybe tech sales ? Should I go back to college? Lol I’d love to try to open my own spot again but need substantial capital. I’ve invested close to 100k into this partnership. I’m really stuck and not sure what to do? Any advice from all the vets in the industry would be greatly appreciated! Btw I’ve been a die hard car guy since a kid! I’ve noticed the more I stay in the business the less it excites me now, maybe I need to sell Lambos lol.

1kyijnd,My career is falling apart,"Hello everyone, 

This is going to be a long post, combined with ranting and seeking advice. Thank you in advance for any help you may offer. 

Just like most people in this economy, I have been looking for a new job for almost a year now. I left my old job at the beginning of June in 2024 due to feeling burnt out, overworked, underpaid, and at times mistreated. I did not realize how bad the job market was at the time, and kind of thought that after some months, I'd have another role lined up. I never expected myself to have a hard time landing a role, but even a harder time landing an interview. I'm not only writing this to complain and point out the obvious experiences I am going through in this job market, but I wanted to write some crazy experiences I have had during this ongoing job search. Now I have a bachelor's degree in international business, so most of the roles I go for are within the business field. I have about 6 years of experience in operations as an Administrative Assistant at two separate companies and 1 year of banking. 

**Here comes my most recent experience:** About 3 weeks ago I did an interview to be an Office Manager, I was so excited and did my best. 3 days after the interview, I was offered the job over the phone. I started a week later, after my 27th birthday had just passed. I started on Monday and worked a 8-hour shift, it was tough but I was going to stick through this. Like most jobs in NYC this was an at-will job, and I did agree to a 2-week trial, obviously I was getting paid but the probationary period was 2 weeks. The next day Tuesday I come in to do my shift and before I can even start my manager calls me in to speak in her office. She tells me that they have to let me go, and I ask her if I did something wrong. She says No, I was perfect, but explains that since it's a family company, that their main location in NJ needs an assistant there supporting their CEO (her father) as his health isn't great and he won't be traveling in NYC as originally planned. She said everything just changed and happened quickly while I was working Monday. I accepted it and then I was given my paycheck. I deposited it and went home.

It was an unexpected result, but also made me realize that it was possibly a sign, as I left the day before they let me go, feeling unhappy about the job. It was isolated and nothing like my past experiences. I was willing to stick it out but something else stopped it. It's just now I am feeling weird and stuck all over again, trying to get another job or at least an interview. I want to make good money, enter a new chapter in my life, be happy at my job and possibly have that work life balance. I especially want a place I can stay at for a while. What do I do? I'm worried this gap on my resume is not helping. Any career advice for my next steps?

I recently graduated with a degree in computer science engineering and have been actively applying for data analyst roles, since that’s the career path I truly want to pursue.

* Can this kind of role offer transferable skills (e.g., project coordination, reporting, Excel, communication) that would benefit me in a future data analyst role?

1kygp9k,"7+ Years in Retail – Burnt Out, Overlooked, and Unsure How to Pivot Without a Degree","I (31M) have been working as a stock associate at a retail fashion store for over seven years. What started as a part-time job during school turned into full-time work after I dropped out of college. I always thought it was temporary… but here I am, nearly a decade later, stuck and burnt out.

Growing up, sports were my biggest passion. In college, I majored in sports management and dreamed of working in the front office of a pro team. But I wasn’t mature enough to handle being away from home, and after two years, I dropped out. A lot of classmates who did graduate still struggled to break into the industry, so without a degree, I figured my chances were even worse.

I kept working full-time in retail, telling myself I’d figure something out soon. A couple years later, I enrolled in a golf management program, but when the pandemic hit and classes went remote, the program lost its value. I planned to re-enroll later, but it was no longer financially viable.

So I went back to full-time retail. The job became my safety net. I told myself I was leaving “soon,” but that turned into years. Around the six year mark, I left to try a new opportunity after a coworker landed a job at a major tech company and referred me. It turned out to be a call center job, and I was miserable, yelled at all day, completely drained. I quit after three months and returned to my old retail job, again telling myself it was just temporary. That was over a year ago.

I don’t hate my job. It suits me in some ways, I’m a neat freak and enjoy organizing, which is a big part of the role. I genuinely like my coworkers, and my boss has always been incredibly supportive, like an older brother. But after so many years of the same routine, I’m exhausted. There’s no challenge, no advancement, and I know I can’t stay in retail forever.

There’s no room for growth here outside of becoming an assistant manager. That position never appealed to me, but after my father passed away last year and I became the primary financial support for my mom, I decided to go for it. A temporary assistant manager position opened up, and even though I’m quiet and non-confrontational, I felt ready. I’ve already been doing the work as an unofficial back of house manager- overseeing stockroom operations, training new hires, and keeping the team on track.

I told my boss I wanted to return to full-time, and he was thrilled, he literally started dancing on the sales floor. But when I mentioned applying for the assistant manager role, his enthusiasm vanished. He told me to “just apply online,” and that was it. I didn’t hear anything for months.

Meanwhile, a younger coworker, let’s call him Bob, started getting more responsibilities. He had worked at the store for about 2–3 years and “replaced” me in the stockroom while I was at the call center. He’s friendly but not a hard worker, he avoids tasks he doesn’t like, leaves work unfinished, and has been called out multiple times for slacking off. He also applied for the job, and I honestly didn’t think they’d take his application seriously.

About six months later, my boss finally asked if I was still interested in interviewing. The timing felt weird, but I said yes. I interviewed with him and another store manager and thought it went well. A few weeks later, my boss pulled me aside and told me I didn’t get the job. His reasoning? He thought I’d struggle with “difficult conversations” with customers and employees. Was that a fair concern? Maybe. I’m not someone who enjoys confrontation, but who really does? I knew what the role involved and still felt ready. 

What crushed me most was finding out Bob got the position. The same person who left his work for me to finish now earns significantly more, and I’m still doing the tasks he avoided as a stock associate.

That was six months ago. I’ve stayed professional, but it’s hard not to feel bitter. And now, just last week, another assistant manager role opened up… and my boss immediately started interviewing candidates without ever asking if I was interested. Considering I couldn't even get a temporary manager job, I didn't bother applying this time, but it still hurts that he didn't even ask. That confirmed what I suspected all along: I was never truly considered.

I’ve been applying for jobs outside of retail, but everything that pays more seems to require a degree or certifications I don’t have and can’t afford right now. I’ve already tried one pivot that didn’t work out, and I’m afraid of making another bad move. I don’t know what’s realistic or worth pursuing.

So for those who’ve left retail, especially without a degree, how did you make the jump? Are there any stable, realistic career paths I could explore that don’t require going back to college full-time? I’m open to training or certification programs, and I’m not afraid of hard work. I just want something more sustainable, with a future.

Any advice is truly appreciated.



TL;DR:
31M, 7+ years as a stock associate in retail. Took on unofficial leadership duties and applied for an assistant manager role but was passed over in favor of a less reliable coworker. Recently, another manager role opened and my boss didn’t even ask if I was interested, confirming I was never seriously considered. Burnt out, stuck, and supporting my mom since my dad passed away. Tried pivoting once to a call center and hated it. No degree, limited options. Looking for advice on how to transition out of retail into a stable, sustainable career without going back to school full-time. Open to training/certification programs.",Seanmgz,1,1.0,0,1748539627,2025-05-29 17:27:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kygp9k/7_years_in_retail_burnt_out_overlooked_and_unsure/,5,2025
1kygnfn,I'm on a good path (I think) but feeling stuck at the same time...,"Hey everyone! I'm not entirely sure if this is the proper sub to be writing in, but I have a feeling some of you may be able to help me out. This may be a bit long of a read but I feel its necessary (and helpful to me) to kind of type this part of my life out.

I am 22 years old, upon graduating high school my goal was to become a Realtor. Instead I had success with an online ecommerce brand that wasn't necessarily a long term gig, made a lot (to me) of money really fast. Moved out of the parents house, became completely self sufficient. The brand was 95% automated so I was working for my brothers business in construction full time in the mean time. It led to complete burn out, stress, anxiety, the whole nine. I went down a dark spiral of missing work and gambling, something needed to change. For reference, not that it matters but I don't drink alcohol, do drugs, nicotine, nothing like that. So I finally hit a breaking point back in January 2025 I had to take action on SOMETHING, literally anything. The thoughts of being a Realtor slowly entered my head again and I took action, I got my license fairly quickly and decided to go all in. Got teamed up with a great, very helpful brokerage. Currently 3 months into it and I have closed 1 deal, and have 2 under contract closing in mid June! Personally I feel that's a great start, as I've read horror stories of first year agents not even closing a single deal. I am absolutely loving every second of being an agent, it doesn't feel like work to me, I love all of the tasks that are required to close deals and it really feels good. That's the part where I feel like I am on the right path.

Now for the part where I am feeling stuck... I completely understand being in a fully commission based role such as a real estate agent, but I do miss the consistent pay already. I know that will come in time as I'm only 3 months in. There's a couple agents in my office making 6 figures a month in commissions in my market (one of them being a brand new agent just 2 years ago) so that's my biggest motivation truly. On the other hand I am asking my self should I a get a full time role with a base pay or any type of remote position to get that cushy consistency back? Stick to doing real estate as a part time gig? My worry falls into once these next couple deals close, where is the next deal going to come from? Which seems to be common in sales. I mainly ask my self these questions because my savings is quickly drying up as I am spending more monthly, than I am making. I am extremely driven, hungry, tech savvy etc. I feel as if no one will give me a chance though for any type of remote role, even making lower end money. I truly need someone to just give me a chance, so I can prove what I am worth. I am stuck and sort off lost... Even though things are looking up?

If anyone has any ounce of advice, I would really appreciate that! Possibly even a job role lead they can pass my way. I just need to hear other peoples takes on my situation to better help me take my next step. I simply want somewhat stress free income that covers the bills.

Thanks in advance!

1kyg6ds,I got a new job offer and I'm so stressed about whether I should take it or not,"I'm so conflicted. My husband is telling me I should absolutely take it, and my parents are telling me to be a bit more cautious. I flip-flop every 10 minutes on what my gut is telling me. It does seem like a no brainer, but I think I'm just apprehensive about the unknown. Here is the comparison between the two (I didn't include health insurance because I'm on my husband's plan, but the plans are comparable anyways):

|CURRENT JOB|NEW JOB OFFER|
|:-|:-|
|**Company:** Small company in my industry (\~20 people). I've gotten great experience, but nobody has heard of my company, which I think sometimes is detrimental in my industry.|**Company:** One of the largest and most well known companies in my industry. I eventually want to shift to a more advanced sector of my industry in a few years, and having this name on my resume would be a huge plus.|
|**Salary:** Current salary $88K base|**Salary:**  Offered $110K base (25% increase)|
|**Office Policy:** Fully remote|**Office Policy:** 1 day per week in office was negotiated (1 hour drive for me, but I don't think I'll mind as I've been going a little stir crazy)|
|**401k:** No 401k match, we have a simple IRA but no match|**401k:** Offers 401k match |
|**Vacation:** unlimited|**Vacation:** 3 weeks|
|**Growth:** Very vague growth plan. The soonest I would be promoted is in December, and it would only be a 5% max raise.|**Growth:** Growth plan has already been laid out for me in regards to position growth. Lots of growth potential, although I'm not sure of specific raise amounts.|
|**Work life balance:** My work life balance is great, probably a little too great. 75% of the time I'm able to ""phone it in"" without anyone knowing. My job is incredibly easy and has gotten to the point where it's almost a bit boring. I work for 3-4 hours a day and then just check my email while I go watch TV or do chores. I think this is probably detrimental to my career because I'm not being challenged at ALL, and I know there is so much more I am capable of doing, but the risk-averse side of me knows it will never be like this at another company.|**Work life balance:** Mixed reviews. I chatted with a few people on the team who say the hiring manager is amazing and takes work life balance/working boundaries very seriously. The manager let me know she is passionate about avoiding burnout. Many working parents with multiple kids at the company. *However*, several Glassdoor reviews are a bit scary and talk about working late often. It is a pretty large company, so it could easily be dependent on the team.|
|**Company outlook:** Not great. As you saw above, not a lot is going on. A lot of people are leaving and leadership is a bit messy. The clients we mainly serve are being hit hard by the economy. I don't really trust that leadership is making the right business decisions (losing clients & not a ton coming in the door), but in my little bubble everything has been ok.|**Company outlook:** From what I can gather, it's pretty safe and obviously expanding. To put it vaguely, the clients that this company serves are as close to recession proof as you can get. They are also household names and have insane budgets, something I'm not used to with my current clients.|

  
Feel free to tell me that I'm insane for even stopping to think about this. I think it all boils down to me being apprehensive about the Glassdoor reviews that I saw, and also because I'm just so comfortable responsibility-wise in my current role. If it were a lower offer, I probably would be more hesitant to take it. What would you do?

The thing is, I don’t actually want to pursue a career in music or any related field. I already have experience as a music producer, and honestly, the only reason I went to uni was because my parents pressured me into it with no choice.

I’ve been looking into doing an MBA in Data Analytics, but I’m also feeling pretty burnt out after my third year at uni. On top of that, I’ve seen a lot of people say that getting a master’s degree isn’t really worth it anymore, especially in the UK job market.

The director of HR related to me there's been a big laundry list of complaints filed against me yesterday by someone who is technically under me. Some were true but taken out of context (for example early on I was trying to relieve some tension between us by making the joke that sometimes I can sound like an a**hole over text when I don't mean to and this is after they called me one) and I owned that part but others were just completely made up and included things like her saying I was smart and me responding by saying ""yeah that's how I get away with things like calling you a bitch"" which is never something I would say. No dates or receipts have been provided to me and they even said it's very much her word against mine. 

I'm honestly a wreck from this. I am supposed to keep mentoring and acting like everything is normal but I even said I am at a loss for words. I have receipts for her hostility towards me but I was never asked to provide them even after I brought them up. I have multiple one on one interactions with this person and there is no way for me to record them.

1kyfs3t,"Hired, Started Work, Then Suddenly Dropped — What Should I Do?","Hey all, I could use some perspective.

I was hired through a staffing firm to work at a major tech client. I went through two months of background checks, onboarding, and was given the green light multiple times by both the staffing agency and the client team. I officially started work.

At the end of my first week, I was told I was “not eligible for hire” by the client. No warning, no explanation. The staffing agency told me they *might* be able to reassign me, but offered no guarantees. Their only direction was to look through their internal job portal like any regular applicant.

Meanwhile, I quit a $135k/year Program Manager role in good standing to take this job. Now I don’t know when (or if) I’ll be paid again. No severance. No assignment. No communication from HR or next steps.

I’ve drafted a formal letter asking the agency to confirm one of the following:

* Immediate reassignment with equal pay
* Paid administrative leave while waiting
* Formal severance

I also made it clear that if they don’t act, I’ll need to file for unemployment, which will impact their account since my last five quarters include my $135k salary.

Does this approach sound right? Has anyone else experienced something like this? Should I escalate more aggressively?

The company basically agrees they messed up on their vetting process and it was their fault.

1kyfjea,Feeling Lost After BTech with Backlogs – Need Guidance to Fix My Life in the Next Year,"Hi everyone,  
I’m a 24-year-old male from India. I’m feeling a bit lost right now and hoping to get some honest guidance.

I have a diploma in Mechanical Engineering (passed with first class) and recently completed my BTech in Information Technology, but I still have a few backlogs to clear. The truth is, I didn’t really choose either of these paths myself — I just followed what my family thought was best for me in terms of education.

Now I’m at a point where I genuinely don’t know what I want to do. I don’t have clarity about my strengths or weaknesses in either mechanical or IT. I’ve realized I’m not particularly strong in coding, at least not right now.

The good part is I’ve managed to save enough money to support myself for about 1.5 years without depending on my family financially. I want to use this time to figure out a clear direction and build a career I actually care about.

So, my questions to you all are:

* How can I find out what I’m actually good at or interested in?
* Should I explore jobs, certifications, or internships in mechanical or IT (or something else)?
* Are there any practical steps or tools that helped you discover your path when you were in a similar situation?
* Is it too late to start over or pivot?

Any advice or perspective would really help me. Thank you for reading.",drunken_pirates58,1,1.0,0,1748536889,2025-05-29 16:41:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kyfjea/feeling_lost_after_btech_with_backlogs_need/,5,2025
1kyfiqa,Considering leaving barbering for a skilled trade,"Hey guys. I’m a barber right now and tbh it’s the easiest job in the world. I work maybe 30hrs a week and make enough to live my life and save a tiny bit. I’m not rich but I’m comfortable. I came from the skilled trades. I did window, doors, and siding on and off since I was 16 (I’m 23 now) then I did commercial/industrial low voltage electrical for 2 years. I personally think the work was very rewarding and I LOVE working with my hands. I hated the constant overtime, on-call, and overnight travel though, it burned me out. As much as barbering is a cake job, I have 0 benefits. I have no insurance, no retirement, no pension, my income isn’t THAT stable, and I get hosed on taxes. I’m considering going back into a trade, this time one with a journeyman pipeline, and most likely a union, then cutting hair out my house for friends and trusted clients maybe 1 evening and Saturdays. (I used to do this when I was in school anyways.) I just feel like I need stability and benefits to have a long term career to support my wife and future family. It’s hard to get a loan right now, and I had a huge reality check when I broke my ankle last year and got fucked with the income loss and no support. It just makes me really think. This is more of a self employed vs w2 issue then barbering itself. On the other hand though I feel like I’d be making my life harder for maybe not enough of a reason, and I’m “throwing away” a lot of the barbering work I’ve put in to get myself in this position.

After I tried treating my jaw issues for years and years, I stopped trying to find solutions. It's TMJD/TMD, so it's just so complex.

I was okay for a while, now I'm in almost debilitating pain daily, including jaw, neck, shoulder pain. It's really bad. Tinnitus too, spasming facial muscles pretty much constantly. And yet, I'm still trying to leave my current job and hop into a new role. Trying to act like everything's okay but ya know, I'm not gonna be able to be my best self in interviews so this is really hard.

My current job doesn't give me benefits so I pay out of pocket for health insurance. I've been 4 am to 1 pm for almost three years. I haven't made time for my health. I've been tryi g to act like I'm fine and I'm wondering if I should just quit and take care of myself for a while.

1kye2i4,"Switching from an uncompleted Bachelor of Fine Arts to a Psychology Major (BS or BA), is it worth it?","Hi! I have just finished two years of a Canadian uni majoring in Fine Arts (mostly, Painting and drawing, although I did some extra courses). I love art and I will never stop doing it but I am thinking whether that is a good decision later in life. I am not that type of person that paints or draws every day, maybe because I didn't teach myself to do so, or because that's just not what I enjoy to do. I like drawing and painting but mostly I am enjoying bringing very specific ideas to life or painting in a studio (which is hard to find for me outside of uni, and I can't paint at home).

Right now I am in debt to the government bc of my student loan, I still live w my parents since I or them have no funds to pay for me to move out. I don't really have a space at home I can paint or draw at so I am used to do so in the university studios. This is one of the reasons I'm afraid of quitting BFA (Bachelor of Fine Arts) as I won't have access to the oil painting I enjoy a lot. 

I thought about two ways, switching to the digital illustration (I don't have the skills to paint digitally as well as traditionally yet, but I can try to obtain those with practice) and go into concept art/illustration. I'm just not sure I can make myself draw or paint persistently :')

Another way is to switch to something with a more clear career pathway. It's hard since I'm so used to thinking of myself as an artist career-wise, I dreamt about it since I was little. And I am considering Psychology as that is something that always interested me. I enjoy learning a lot about it. I am thinking about both research psychology or clinical psychology. I am interested in forensics psychology, child development psychology, or basically... any kind of it that concentrates on the individual's problems?

My main worry is my debt. Wouldn't it be reasonable to finish BFA, pay off the debt and then study Psychology somewhere for less amount of money (I'm thinking about a free countries in Europe)? Or should I just stick to my chosen career since I do enjoy art, and I might just haven't found the way around it as a career option?

Is there anyone who switched from BFA to another, more 'conventional' degree, or someone who studied psychology and who can share their experience?

I’ve been actively job hunting for the past few weeks, sending out resumes, tweaking cover letters, and all that. It’s been… frustrating.

Then I kept seeing this site pop up — Laboro.co. Looked like just another “AI will apply to 1000 jobs for you” gimmick, and I almost ignored it. But desperation and curiosity won, so I tried their free plan (10 applications).

Honestly? It was surprisingly solid. It didn’t just blast my resume to random listings. It:

Scored jobs based on my CV

Flagged the ones with 90%+ matches (which were good fits)

Auto-generated tailored resumes for each application


I sent out all 10 apps two days ago, not expecting anything.
Today, I got my first interview invite. 🫨

Could be luck, but the fact that it applied on company sites with custom resumes? I feel like that gave me a better shot than my usual routine.

1kyc6og,Am I studying the wrong profession?," 
Hello,
I’m creating this post to ask for advice on my career path.I’m currently in school for psychology and computer programming, but I’m having some doubts. While researching jobs after graduation, I noticed that some people said it was hard to find a job—even with a bachelor's degree or certifications. Honestly, this is breaking my heart because being a part of the computer science industry is a dream of mine. Eventually, I want to branch out into cybersecurity and become an ethical hacker after furthering my education.I'm scared of making the wrong decision after putting in so much hard work and effort.

On the other hand, I know that nursing and becoming an RN is a viable option. But the truth is, I hate the healthcare industry with a passion. The thought of entering it makes me extremely sad and unhappy. I know there’s a high demand for healthcare workers and that there are countless job opportunities for nurses now and in the future.However, I’m not the type of person who wants to help others in that way. I prefer working in an office or from home over being in a hospital setting where I have to constantly cater to people and their needs.Can anyone offer some advice on whether I should stay on the path of computer programming and tech, or switch to nursing for the job security?

My heart is in the tech industry, but I don’t want to end up a failure. Any help is appreciated.

Note: While I know race doesn't matter much, I know that some people carry bias towards race so I am also stating that I am a black woman as well if it helps.

1kyc4ch,Feeling incredible anxiety and guilt about not working,"I am 40 years old, and am an ""expert"" in a tech platform. I have worked at three different companies, being hired because I am an expert to help with a transition to this platform and then managing it. My current company hired me three years ago for this, and after the transition and then projects related to it, things have settled down a lot, to the point that I have very little to do. The same thing happened in the other two companies, but, I was still getting outstanding performance reviews and no one seemed to care/notice that I wasn't doing much all day. I was poached by my current company because of my expertise lol.

This current company is amazing. I make a very good salary, the benefits are fabulous, I get to work from home, and my colleagues and boss are wonderful. I have established myself as the expert on this platform, and colleagues and my boss think I'm amazing and always give me positive performance reviews. I work from home, and probably spend between 1-4 hours a day of actually working. I'm not bored though, because I have a rich life of hobbies that keep me occupied, and that I would much rather do than my job. So, I do my hobbies (happily) all day, and work when I am needed. I think I am naturally likeable, do a good job on the things I do, and am very efficient.

Lately I am starting to feel wracked with guilt and anxiety about it though. I've sort of checked out of my job. I do what is needed, and I am still getting positive reviews, but I struggle to force myself to go ""above and beyond"" in order to create new projects for myself, work more hours, and warrant the salary I am getting. I feel like I will get found out somehow, even though I never have before and there is no sign of it coming, and wonder how I could really keep this up for years?

 I want to stay at this company, but I go back and forth on whether I should just ride the wave of this, or should I figure out/find ways to be more productive? I really don't want to haha, and honestly it would be a reach to be able to find things - my position just doesn't really even require it, if that makes sense. And I honestly just... don't care about the work I'm doing. In the moment when faced with: force myself to conjure a new project to work on, or do my hobbies, I choose to do my hobbies. My hobbies make me excited and passionate (but they are not things I could generate much money on, if that's what you're thinking). Yesterday I literally did no work all day aside from answering a few questions and tickets, and that evening I sat in some really bad anxiety about it, wondering about my future and how I could continue like this.

I know I'm fortunate to have this be my problem rather than long hours and stress in my job, so of course I am grateful.

1kyb7xt,Is it normal to be constantly overwhelmed?,"I'm new in my career as a social media manager/communications specialist, I graduated 5 years ago, and I've been at my current company for one year. I've noticed of all the positions I have that marketing is usually a team of one or two with the only budget being our salaries, so it's usually just myself and a supervisor deciding what our jobs look like.

My first job was nice, but I was frequently getting frustrated at menial pixel pushing. It didn't pay enough so I moved on to another position at a nonprofit, and was brought to tears more than once by an uncommunicative and passive aggressive boss, feeling like I'm never doing anything right, and endless cycle of trying to 'prove myself' despite my work being perfectly fine. 

I lost that job due to layoff and after a brief unemployment, am at my current position. I wanted to work here, but also couldn't say no to the offer because of how unemployment works, but I remember in the interview my eventual manager said that she runs our social media like a 24/7 job, and to be on top of it always every time.

I've been here a year, and I still feel like I'm always over correcting, always not quite good enough, always playing catch up, and always always falling behind. I'm regularly working on a minimum of 3 projects at once, and while my boss is the kindest I've had, she also has the highest expectations I've managed.

I didn't realize what I was getting into when I went to school for digital communications, and I can't really get out of it without some other certification or degree to match or exceed my okay-enough salary (56/yr last I checked).

I don't know if this is normal, and mostly, I don't know if I'm asking too much or 'an entitled young person' for wanting a kind supervisor and a little less put on me for my work. It's not even that I don't want to work or I want to swipe Instagram all day, I just don't want to feel like I need to come in 2 hours early and work 2 hours late just to still get a text saying I need to be more on top of things.

  
If this is just 'what it's like' working in my kind of field, that's fine. I just want to know if this is normal, or if the overwhelm and burnout don't have to be this way.

1kyb14i,New job anxiety,"Hey all

I recently got a job offer from a large defense company. My current job was a telecom company that also does defense work. However, current job I am commuting 1.25 hours each way, and don’t get remote options. New job is 50% remote and I get every other Friday off, plus a 50k raise and better insurance. 

I had an offer from the same company, much less money at the time, and I had told my then best friend about it, and he cut me off on the basis that I wanted to work in defense, and subsequently got a bunch of people in our friend group on that as well. 

Now im having some severe anxiety after accepting the position. My mind seems to continually race through things such as I should rescind my acceptance of the offer, I made a bad choice, people will hate me for it, and I’m overall going to end up unhappy and or alone for it. I feel like I can’t eat, sleep or think clearly. Really feeling overwhelmed.

1kyablv,Marketing department won’t stop asking to learn about my clients (to let someone else take them),"I work in a professional services firm and am in senior management.  Everyone in senior management has the same title (managing director) but we are paid based on revenues from customers that we originate and people who have more customers are more powerful.

The person (X) with the largest number of customers is able to get the company to hire a team for marketing and teams for other services.  In name, those teams work for all managing directors, and their pay comes out of our pay, but we all know that those teams really report to X alone.

We have a new marketing manager who keeps asking to meet with me ""to learn about my practice"".

Whatever.  The marketing manager will then be required to feed information about my customers to X, who will try to move in on my leads.  Or X will get mad because the marketing manager's time is being spent on me.

So I have told the marketing manager that I am unavailable, several times.  I've also told the marketing manager that I don't have internal approval to meet. The marketing manager keeps asking to meet.

Appropriate to tell the marketing manager that I am not meeting with the marketing manager, period?  

As a new hire, the marketing manager may not realize how things actually work at the company and may not understand why I am blowing off the meeting requests, and I don't want to create an enemy, even though the marketing manager probably won't stay more than a year or two anyway.

1ky9z4h,Getting out of sales roles,"I (27m) work in finance and have been working for for the same company for about 3.5 years now. I recently was promoted about 8 months ago from my former role which came with a nice salary bump from 50k/yr to 65k/yr plus a quarterly bonus based on performance. Essentially I moved from retail banking to consumer investment, but I’ve started to feel like this career path may not be for me.


I work for quite a well known firm and the benefits are great but I just feel like I’m not really succeeding as quickly as management is expecting me to which has taken a toll on me. Partially because of that I feel reluctant to take time off for vacation or when I’m sick because each day I’m out of office I feel like I fall behind little by little and then soon enough there’s a gap to close for my sales goals but the window to do it has already closed, I won’t go too much into the comp structure but basically we’re judged on three metrics and one of those metrics is an 8 wk pipeline of new funds brought into the firm, that tracks from the day of deposit to be credited 8 weeks later. Because of that I feel like if I miss a week then 8 weeks later I’ll have $0 money in the pipeline for that week when I realistically would need several hundred thousand per week to hit my goals.


It just feels kind of unsustainable for me personally, but you can make very good money in this role. I’ve made about 15k gross in bonuses so far and the average rep probably makes somewhere between 110k to 150k/yr. But I just dislike that endless grind aspect of it because even if I have a good quarter there’s no moment that I can ever really take a day or two to breathe, I just have to keep going and going.


I know that’s characteristic of sales in general and so far all my post college professional experience has been in relationship building/sales roles and I don’t know how to get out of that loop because I know ultimately I’d rather have something more stable where I can take a week off and it doesn’t have an effect on my pay and performance.


For reference I have my Series 66 & Series 7 licenses, currently studying for the CRPC because the company pays for it, and I have a bachelors degree in Economics. Any suggestions of transition roles that would be a good fit for my skill set on paper would be appreciated, I could realistically learn to do anything but I feel kind of locked into this path due to my work experience.",xxSwaglord420yoloxx,2,1.0,1,1748523032,2025-05-29 12:50:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ky9z4h/getting_out_of_sales_roles/,5,2025
1ky9iop,I need advice from people in the culinary or business field,"This might become a throwaway account, but I created this account because I need an advise from someone who’s in the culinary or business field. I just finished culinary and will be graduating very soon, but I have enrolled into a two year business program in the fall at the college in which I took my culinary. I decided to go back to business because over the summer last year I lost the love for culinary and a lot of the people I worked with over the summer that I talk to either loved it or hate it now. I know culinary isn’t the best paying job, but I feel like I really lost the passion for it. also, at the same time in which I started college for culinary, I started dating my now boyfriend for almost 2 years now and it has really made me start to think more of having a family and realizing the time that the culinary field will take away from the people I love. I never really thought much about having a family or anything until I started dating him.

The reason on why I went into culinary was because working in a kitchen was my first job and I wasn’t too sure about what to do after high school so I decided to go into culinary because that was really the only job experience I mostly had in. I also originally wanted to travel or work on boats, but I realized it would be hard for me to maintain a relationship if I decided to go that path.

A lot of people recommended business for myself to take saying that culinary business go hand-in-hand together, but I’m not sure what exact job positions I could use culinary and business together. I don’t want my schooling of culinary to become useless skill that I spent a couple grand on. And before anyone says it, no I do not want to open my own restaurant (if I had a dollar for every time, someone asked me that question I would be a millionnaire by now). I’m just looking for someone to point me down the right path or idea I should look into.

1ky8ebt,Just finished school and want to become an editor — Need career guidance from experienced folks!,"Hi everyone,
I just completed Class 12 and I’m really passionate about video editing. I’ve been doing some basic edits and now I’m serious about making a career out of it. I’m confused about what the right path is from here, and I’d love some advice from those already working in the field.

Should I pursue a degree in another field (like media, design, or even something unrelated) while learning editing on the side and doing freelance work?

Or should I dive fully into editing by joining a course, building a portfolio, and trying to go full-time as an editor?

Is it better to aim for international opportunities in places like the US or UK, or can I build a solid editing career from India itself?

Are there any specific courses, software, or platforms you'd recommend for someone starting out in 2025?

What mistakes should beginners avoid when trying to go pro in editing?

Is a formal degree in editing/film really necessary, or does a good portfolio matter more?

1ky8bgr,Should I quit my first corporate job 4 months in?,"As the title says, I work in a corporate office for a nuclear construction company. I was initially hired for global business purposes and when I signed my contract I agreed to Monday to Friday 8:00am to 5:30pm with a lunch break lasting 1.5 hours. For additional context I'm the only Westerner in a Korean team based in Seoul.

Now I'm a few months in after 2 months of mandatory ""training"" where I did nothing, we've hit a busy season with clients. My coworkers always stay late every day, usually till at least 6:30 or 7pm. I leave on time or maybe 15 minutes late if I'm not busy and I have no tasks, or up to 45 minutes late if I need to get something done.

However due to the new workload this week I'm in the office 7am until 7pm. My boss asked me to come in before 8am for a 7:30am meeting yesterday and today I had to start work at 3am due to a virtual meeting. WFH culture doesn't exist here. What makes it worse is that I had to wake up at 1:30 and take a taxi to the office (they didnt repay me and said they wont) and they told us to start our work day once the meeting was done at 4:30. I had to work 3.5 hours extra and its not even paid as our computers don't log your hours till 8am.

I understand we are busy but my boss has now asked me to come in on Sunday and also skip the 2 public holidays next week and work instead. There's no extra pay since they said I have to do the work voluntarily they can't force me to do it - but I know there will be repercussions if I don't. 

I was really upset about this because to me honestly even daily overtime is too far for me personally. I think it's only okay when its needed but if every day just means theres something wrong with your ability to manage time or the companies ability to distribute a work load. I tried to talk to HR and they said ""that's just how it is"" and I tried to talk to the Ministry of Labor help line and they clarified these practices are 100% illegal but I can't report anonymously. They'd know it was me because they'd only investigate my case. 

I'm genuinely miserable. I don't earn enough money (like $32k a year which is ""good"" for a newbie here), I'm not compensated enough and I don't have a life outside of work. Even if I did have a weekend they expect us to come in when they need us, 100% unpaid.

I really was happy to get hired here because its a big company and would look amazing on my CV but I know quitting after 4 months is a huge red flag. The transferable skills are great but I cry about my job maybe 3x a week lol

Should I tough it out? I need to give 30 days notice so my national holidays are gone regardless. No time off for me. Or should I wait 6 months? 1 year?

It's making me genuinely miserable but I don't to shoot myself in the foot because I couldn't deal with it for a bit longer.",naixi123,6,1.0,6,1748517865,2025-05-29 11:24:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ky8bgr/should_i_quit_my_first_corporate_job_4_months_in/,5,2025

1ky7ohf,What do you think about working as an electrician in the U.S. for a year?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a 20-year-old certified electrician from Switzerland, and I'm thinking about going to the U.S. to work for a year.

The main reasons are to experience something new, improve my English, and learn more about how the trade works in another country. I'm not doing it for the money — it's more about the adventure, personal growth, and professional experience.

A few things I’m wondering:

* Has anyone here worked in the U.S. as a foreign electrician?
* How difficult is it to get licensed or legally work in the States as a Swiss electrician?
* Are there areas where electricians are especially in demand?
* Do you think it's worth it for just a year?

I'd really appreciate any tips, personal experiences, or advice. Thanks in advance!",Low_Initiative1077,1,1.0,11,1748515655,2025-05-29 10:47:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ky7ohf/what_do_you_think_about_working_as_an_electrician/,5,2025

1ky7hjt,Future Career Advice?,"I am 24 years old (M) and currently in Sales. I graduated Uni in 2022 with a bachelors degree in Business. I took an administrative assistant job first year out of uni because I had no what I wanted to do in life and was in a really bad mental space during the time. Fast forward a year later, I quit the job and didn’t have another lined up and ended up getting into Sales 7 months later being unemployed for a while. I know I don’t want to pursue a career in sales long term but I’m a happy where I am atm. For future career me, I feel like a loser not wanting to pursue being a CEO or someone really high up in the chain is not for me for a few reasons.

1. I’m not 100% sure what I really want to do in life.
2. I am not someone who is good at public speaking/ can articulate my thoughts clearly
3. I hate how nervous I get sometimes when it comes to work related things
4. Certain it’s not something I would love 

Does anybody else feel like this? And honest opinion, do you think I feel like this because of point 2 and 3?

1ky6goi,"The news industry no longer offers viable career paths for me, so I have to quit and find a new path. Advice?","Advice on switching to a new career?

I put my heart and soul into working with cameras. I did high school broadcasting, ended up taking lots of news writing and photography courses in college, and then ended up with a job in my field because of experience.

Honestly, I knew in college this wasn't the right  route for me, but with sunken cost fallacy, I kept going. I never finished my degree, but I have now worked in the industry and am witnessing the death of my own job. Other stations already use robotic cameras, but I got to be a camera op for a while! Now, it's time to go. This position has a time limit, and it's almost time for the robot takeover lol.

I have outgrown this position. This industry will also never pay me enough for what they want. And unfortunately, as someone with a chronic pain condition, I need a stable job with benefits because I need to be able to take time iff when it's necessary.

Here's the thing: I feel aimless. It's not that I'm passionless, but following my dreams led me down this road and I don't want to do this again. I am currently figuring out my next steps and have wanted to quit my current job for over a year. Fear has held me here, but the time has come for me to put in my two weeks. The 3 am to 1 pm schedule hurts me mentally and physically.

1ky652x,"After bombing 3 interviews back to back, I built a tool that helps you actually prepare","A few months ago, I flopped in 3 interviews in a row — not because I didn’t know the answers, but because I wasn’t ready for the **pressure** and the **flow** of real interviews.

I realized that just reading prep guides or copying answers from ChatGPT wasn’t cutting it. What I really needed was a **practice environment that felt real** — like talking to an actual interviewer.

So I built something called **MockChamp** — it's an AI interview copilot that does two things:

1. Runs **mock interviews** using voice or chat — and actually gives you feedback on how you did.
2. Acts like a **live assistant** during real interviews — listens in and give answers based on what the interviewer is asking (crazy helpful for me in behavioral rounds).

It also has a **free ATS checker**, which helped me finally fix my resume to pass those online filters.

Not trying to sell anything — I made this to fix my own pain and now it's free for others too.

Happy to share the link if anyone wants to try it — or just DM me.

I'm facing a tough decision and I'd love to hear your thoughts. I've got two options on the table:

1. Take a new job that offers a 38% salary bump (plus a 14th month pay, which is a nice bonus). It's a new challenge, new company, and a chance to start fresh. But, I'll have to leave my current team behind.

2. Get promoted to a supervisor role within my current company. The pay bump is smaller (around 20%) plus, I'll get to stick with my current team and take on more leadership responsibilities.

So, which one would you choose? I'm leaning towards the new job, but I'm not sure if I'm just being swayed by the bigger salary bump

Founder was an engineer and he's completely ENG focussed and at times feels looks down on PM and Design/marketing and feels all of this is same and the reason I joined was to work with him more often! He's in the states - so we rarely connect! I work with my CPO who's in the states too! Working on a GenAI product but I'm not feeling heard and frankly it's not exciting or challenging anymore!
I'm frankly working all the hours I can possibly put in!

Lately (Although extremely rare) have been getting good feedback from my CPO - but don't know honestly feels a bit fake! Tried talking to the same about how I feel more and more boring by the day - I want more exciting work - we keep having these conversations but it doesn't go anywhere!

1ky3xfd,Chef looking for advice,"Hey I’m 27m. I’ve been cooking for a while. Long story short, I have a bachelors in social science, a masters in culinary science. Worked in kitchens since I was 11 washing dishes. Went to Europe, did some internship at a big name restaurant and worked at a few others. Got my masters degree. Came back to Canada.. 

I work in a corporate chain restaurant, one of the better ones. My pay is a blessing, it helped me clear 40k in debts, and it helped me put away another 60 in the span of almost 3y. 

The issue is working in that restaurant does nothing for my resume.. I want to go back to the fine dine world. But the issue is I need to take a massive massive pay cut which I’m struggling wrapping my head around. I currently take home about 5.5-6k a month depending on the month. I got a job offer as a senior sous at a prestigious golf course, which would basically bridge my lack of experience for the last few years and boost me up. 
The pay is Salary 65k a year. Take home about 3900 a month give or take. Which is doable with my current fixed expenses at about 2500. But if I leave the corporate job, I’m done can’t go back. 

I’ve told them I want to go back to Europe they said they’d be willing to help me even with placement if I stayed till the following spring and helped them develop in culinary. The only issue is the pay and the now less savings I’d be bringing in. I just don’t want to fuck up in my life financially and be a washed up chef at 35 dead broke, but also need to start making serious career decisions.

1ky1wj7,Am I really Hopeless?,"I’m nearly two years into my tech career, and I honestly feel lost.

Background:
I was a bright student and landed a job through campus placement. I could’ve aimed higher, but I believed getting industry experience would help me grow.

Initially, work went well. But soon after our team delivered a major project, most of us were laid off. I was moved to a different team with peers who hadn’t performed as well. Since then, all the meaningful tasks have been handed to others, while my efforts go unnoticed.

I’ve been thrown into failing projects just to make them work, and even then, colleagues I knew from college started playing dirty. I’m told this is just corporate politics, but it’s draining. Even when I’m in the right, manipulation flips the narrative.

Now I’m a web developer with no strong DSA background, reliance on AI, and no motivation left. I want a better, higher-paying job—but I’m stuck. Work exhausts me, and when I’m free, I’m distracted or numb.

Remote work has isolated me. I’m wasting my 20s, and every day feels like I’m losing myself. 
Am I really hopeless?

1ky0axl,Biotechnology…Medicine…Patent law…. Help,"Hi career advice, if this should be posted somewhere better, just let me know. I \[M 21\] am at a decent college on a good scholarship, so I shouldn’t leave with much debt, so paying for extra school doesn’t matter to me. I am studying Biochemistry and data science. I enjoy science and have been doing research for years and enjoyed it…even though I am not great at it. 


Basically, having an early-life crisis about where to go from here….

With my major, I will have taken all the courses needed for med school…but my GPA won’t be great as I had some mental health issues in my 2nd year of uni (which I know is not an excuse, or that employers or medical schools care about it). I am just not sure what to do going forward. I know that this is a safe route but also don’t want to be stuck in something I hate.

The majority of my friends are on the investment banking/PE career path (I go to an IB target school), and that seems interesting to do, but it seems too late for that as recruiting has already happened, I wouldn’t know enough about finance to get into it, and I am not sure if I would love it enough to leave the STEM field. 

I don’t know if I want to spend 6 years of my life to get a PhD when I don’t know if I can justify the 6 years with the salary that will be coming out of it unless I get an MBA as well and shoot for a CSO or start a startup. 

Essentially, based off of this, what careers should I look at…the career office at my school has been incredibly unhelpful. While I know this is mostly soul searching I need to do, I thought it wouldn’t hurt to ask the internet as well. Looking for a job where I can live the same quality of life as how I grew up, upper middle class, went to a good public high school, both parents lawyers and doing well for themselves (but say I shouldn’t do law). I don’t care about work from home, and don’t care where I live if the job is location dependent but prefer the east coast as my SO’s job will be location dependent. 



TLDR: Don’t know what to do with my life (but who does) likes science and not sure what to do. Give me hope or brainstorm with me. ",_Vexatiion_,2,1.0,2,1748487795,2025-05-29 03:03:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ky0axl/biotechnologymedicinepatent_law_help/,5,2025
1ky0835,"Promotion, No Raise. How Should I Handle the Conversation and What Comes Next?","TL;DR:

I’ve been at my nonprofit job for almost 2 years and have made a big impact. My manager has been saying for months that my upcoming promotion would come with a title change and a raise. But I was just unofficially told that raises are off the table, and that the new title and added responsibilities are the raise. I’m now trying to prep for the conversation where my boss breaks that news. Should I push back? Accept the experience and move on in a year? Would appreciate advice on how to approach the talk and what to do long-term.

Hi all - I work at a nonprofit in the U.S., which of course comes with its own challenges (contemplating leaving the sector 🙃). A lot of the structure (like pay bands, review processes, etc.) is still being figured out. I’ve been here nearly two years, and I’ve worked hard, led new projects, and made a meaningful impact. Leadership has acknowledged that, and over the last year, my manager (Senior VP) and I have been discussing how to grow my role.

A couple months ago, they told me I’d be getting a direct report and a title change, and they clearly said it would come with a “significant financial increase.” I assumed that meant a raise, even if the nonprofit definition of “significant” can vary.

But this week, I had an informal lunch with our CFO, who gave me a heads-up (off the record) that NO ONE is getting a raise this year, even though our cash flow is consistent and performing as projected. That was a complete surprise, especially since just last week the SVP walked me through the timeline and implementation of my raise. The CFO is going to be leaving in a couple months due to leadership decisions like this.

So now I’m trying to prepare for the conversation where my manager delivers this news officially. I’m torn on how to respond in the moment, and what to do after. 

Do I:

Push back and advocate for the raise anyway? I know for a fact there’s room in the budget.

Take the promotion and management experience, stay for another year, and then look for a new role with better pay and a clearer growth path?

Some quick context: I’m about 3 years out of school. My salary is a little above average for my age and area. I genuinely like my job, I learn a lot, my boss trusts me, there’s flexibility with hours, and I have great coworkers. But I’m also ambitious, and I want to feel respected and fairly compensated. Right now it feels like they might be hoping I’ll stay because I want the experience, without actually investing in me.

How would you handle the conversation with my boss when this comes up? And what would you do after?",agk0427,1,1.0,4,1748487559,2025-05-29 02:59:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ky0835/promotion_no_raise_how_should_i_handle_the/,5,2025

20 year old here who is torn between continuing to work vs. committing to obtaining an associates degree/return to school full time. Today, I was walking around reflecting. I have $32k in savings. I worked at a school for a little over a year. My latest job was as a behavior tech, I am no longer working as one as of late (I did like the job, running goals and such) and had it for under a year. As someone who turned 20 within the last two months and isn’t signed up for summer courses, I’m lost. I do have a different job I’m supposed to switch into, need to complete the paperwork. I was walking around today reflecting. I realized that ever since I graduated from high school, though I’ve taken community college courses, I have not actually sat down and committed to obtaining a degree. I have depression and anxiety, I have had a lot of anxiety concerning money because my immediate family members all have mental health problems and we are not in a “house.” My mental health over the last few days has not been ideal, though I have started to calm down. When I was walking around earlier today, I realized that whenever I think about jobs and the like, I think about money - about saving, about the rate. But I haven’t really made a commitment to just majoring in something and getting that degree. I’ve been taking courses, but no commitment. I’m torn between the matter of whether or not to just major in something that would prove lucrative/return to school full time  (I am trying to figure out what I am passionate about) or continue working while attending school part time, which is what I was doing over the past two years (the latter path mentioned.) I don’t currently have consistent employment, I will be working but it won’t be consistent this summer for the most part, not until August. I feel like I’ve been too afraid of money and of my future to let myself “relax.” I never spend money if I can help it. I feel lost. I know deep down inside that that degree is what I should really be aiming to get, that associates. I was thinking today when reflecting about how what I really, truly want to do more than anything else is help people. I want to better the community, to make an impact. I’m just trying to figure out how to do it. I’ve been worried about potential transfer later on to obtain a bachelors due to the cost of transfer.

1kxzpmp,Need Advice: What’s My Next Move to Grow My Career and Income?,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some honest career advice on how I can move forward, grow professionally, and increase my income. I’ve been feeling a bit stuck and would love some outside perspective on what paths might be available to me. I’m open to either pursuing certifications or going back to school if that’s what it takes—I just want to make smart, strategic decisions that will actually open doors.

Here’s a snapshot of my background, education, and experience:
	•	I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Public Health and a Bachelor’s in Human Development from a large state university.
	•	Currently work as a Senior Software Training Specialist in healthcare IT, where I train clinical staff, optimize EHR workflows, and assist with implementations. (2 years)
	•	Prior experience as a Patient Care Technician, which gave me direct clinical exposure and a strong foundation in patient-centered care. (2 years)
	•	Background in curriculum development, client onboarding, and supporting post-go-live optimization.
	•	Also have experience volunteering in healthcare, tutoring in academic settings.

Skills:
	•	EHR optimization & training
	•	Technical onboarding & support
	•	Workflow analysis
	•	Project coordination
	•	Microsoft Office Suite
	•	Basic project management principles
	•	Stakeholder management
	•	Communication & adaptability
	•	Ticketing systems & knowledge base creation

My goals:
	•	I want to grow my career in a direction that allows me to make a greater impact and earn a higher salary.
	•	I’m open to pivoting slightly—whether that’s deeper into healthcare tech, operations, product, or data.
	•	I’m willing to pursue certifications (e.g. PMP, Salesforce, data analytics, etc.) or further education if there’s a clear ROI.
	•	Ideally, I’d love to find roles that are either remote or offer location flexibility.

I’d love to hear from anyone who has made a similar leap or who can recommend certifications, degrees, or roles worth exploring. What would you do with my background? What areas are hiring right now that would value someone with my skills?

Thanks in advance!

1kxz6rq,Feeling Lost—Looking for Career Advice and Direction,"Hey everyone,

I'm a 20 yo guy and I’m at a bit of a crossroads and could really use some advice from people who’ve been through something similar.

Right now, I’m working as an HVAC installer again to make ends meet while finishing up my AA degree through online school. I’ve got about a year left before I’ll be moving to wherever my girlfriend ends up for law school. I’m trying to figure out what career path to pursue, and honestly, I feel pretty lost.

When I took this HVAC job, the plan was to transition into electrical work as a trainee after two months. It’s now been almost six months, and that opportunity still hasn’t happened. On top of that, there aren’t many electrical jobs in my area right now, so I’m stuck doing work that doesn’t excite me.

I’ve started thinking about becoming a firefighter or police officer. I’m in good shape from playing sports all throughout high school, and I feel like those careers could give me more purpose and fulfillment. I’ve always been a hard worker—I just want to do something that makes me feel good about myself and like I’m making a difference.

College has never really been on my radar because of how expensive it is and how few degrees seem worth the cost. That said, if I found something I was truly passionate about and knew it required a degree, I’d seriously consider it.

I know if the right opportunity or path presented itself—something that really clicked—I would throw everything I have into it. I just haven’t found that “thing” yet.

If anyone has been through a similar stage or has any insight into careers that offer both stability and a sense of purpose, I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts.

1kxz4wt,"Recovered after 10 years of illnesses, seeking Canadian advice to pivot into electrical engineering","Hey everyone, I’m in Ontario and I'm trying to figure out how to pivot back toward engineering after 10 years of chronic illnesses. Tutoring engineering students made me realize how much I like this stuff when I'm healthy and possess the mental capacity to tango with the intellectual aspect. I can work in software, but I'd like a path that doesn’t involve staring at code all day.

**Background:**

* Started a double major in CompE and CS in 2013, but chronic illness forced me to drop CompE because it was the harder of the two
* The CompE program is now canned after COVID
* I didn't like the CompE program anyway and actually appreciated our EE courses
* I finished a non-honors CS degree by 2023 after a decade of struggles with lots of fails and drops
* Currently tutoring math/physics/programming (pay is decent, living costs low)

**Situation:**

* I'm open to careers with a good component of tangible, hands-on work. It's like I have to satisfy some weird mental need for tactility and tangibility. I can code and do work in software, sure, but pure software jobs feel mentally stifling to me because coding feels like being forced to condense 3D thoughts into 2D. CS imo is a great supplement to EE, but not the main course for me
* I liked troubleshooting hardware. I ripped apart a desktop CNC machine and diagnosed stepper motors issues. I also tore apart a 2kW industrial laser to find the nuked diodes inside 😆. I did an engineering internship during COVID and these were my highlights
* I'm eyeing RF, power electronics, or maybe photonics in the future but these kinds of areas really like an engineering degree and benefit from a master's
* I can’t return to finish my degree because my readmission is rejected based on my shitty transcript

**Questions:**

1. Any advice? Anything is welcome for the bendy path I find myself on
2. Are there perhaps college programs that could get me into EE-adjacent work *and* keep P.Eng options open for later? I think I see a lot of need for various engineering services, and it might be useful to have a P.Eng down the line in case I want to provide engineering services myself
3. How feasible is it to break into RF/photonics/power electronics?
4. Any Ontario-specific advice? (e.g., employers hiring people without engineering degrees, any bridging options?)",GoofySombrero,2,1.0,0,1748484211,2025-05-29 02:03:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kxz4wt/recovered_after_10_years_of_illnesses_seeking/,5,2025
1kxyvdx,When can I leave?,"I worked really hard in high school and college and recently landed my “dream” engineering job at a cool company. It is simultaneously the best and worst experience and I’m not sure what to do. It is great because the work the company is doing is incredible and I feel proud being a part of history. They pay well and it is great on a resume and for building skills. However, the hours are insane, the expectations are high, and they don’t want to take things slow for a new hire and train them. You’re expected to contribute day 1 and there’s always the risk of getting fired for not meeting their super fast pace (they fire people often). Some engineers can probably guess what company I work at based on my experience.

I basically have no time on the weekdays and sometimes have to come in on weekends. They say that I should ask questions but when I do, I get complicated answers or just get referred to someone else. Everyone seems too busy/stressed to help out the new hire. Ive been here for 4 months and I think everyone already thinks I’m too dumb to be here. I know a lot of new hires experience this but somehow all of the other new hires/interns seem to know what they’re doing (at least more than me). I look around and everyone has no life outside work which is okay for them because they enjoy it, but I’m not like that. I can’t do 60+ hrs a week for much longer. Most engineers in other companies work 40 hrs and get training and have more reasonable deadlines.

I recently accepted that this isn’t the life I want and that I need to change companies but that’s a terrible idea right now. Not only does it look bad on a resume to leave my first full time job after 4 months, but the job market rn is terrible. I think I have to stick it out for a year at least but it’s been really hard. I feel like I might even get fired before the year is up. I’m seeking advice and wanted to ask:

1. What is the earliest I can leave a job without it being a major red flag?

2. How do I know if I hate my experience because of my company, engineering in general, or just work? Am I just too anxious and afraid of individual expectations?

1kxx6fu,Torn about being a veterinarian,"Hi everyone, I just graduated from my undergrad and looking for advice. 

I’ve wanted to be a veterinarian since my freshman year of college when I started working for an equine vet. However, I take the realities of the profession very seriously. I’ve worked about 4,000 hours as an assistant in small animal gp, equine, and ER. I LOVE the work, I never feel like I’m at work, I love working with doctors, I’m an introvert but I really enjoy talking to owners. I’ve also met so many unhappy doctors that have urged me to do something else. 
I’ve planned on applying to vet school but changed my mind (and schools) about 3 times, mostly because the debt/schooling scares me. I’ve also struggled academically for most of undergrad but I managed to pull off a 3.9 gpa my last semester with all heavy science vet pre reqs (however my university was very easy imo)
The most recent time I changed my mind I decided to pursue something easier, I was introduced to radiation therapy (14 month program, $10k tuition, 100k salary), my plan was to do this for a few years first and then pursue vet med if I still wanted it. I have no interest in human med, radiation would just be for good hours, salary, less demanding education. 
I actually applied to a very competitive program and got rejected. So now I’m in a position of actually applying to vet school this year or trying to pursue radiation again. 

I know I wouldn’t regret being a vet, it’s literally the dream job for me. But at the end of the day, everything becomes work. I want animals of my own, horses, time to trail ride, read books for independent joy. I question the career so much, I think if it’s right I would just know- right? 

Basically I’m overwhelmed and on a time crunch to make a decision. I’m 24 female. I’ve talked to vets that do and don’t regret their decision. But is there anyone that didn’t pursue vet med that regrets not doing it? How realistic is it to pursue radiation for a few years then switch to vet school later? Are vets able to have time for families? Hobbies? Some vets tell me to just go for it, others tell me to try something else first.

1kxx3su,"Need advice; PIP, role changes,  not wanting to resign","I’ve been on a PIP for the past 6 weeks due to challenges working with my manager. Initially, I asked to be let go, but my manager insisted I stay, complete the PIP, saying that the team would be at a loss if I left (i.e., due to my “institutional knowledge”and “commitment”to the work).

As I am wrapping up my PIP, I’m being told to consider what it would look like to step into a different role at the company. For context, I’m in a research role, and I am being asked to go into comms. The reason? Shifting ""business needs.” Essentially, our shareholders and funders are looking for less research and more implementation work, which requires admin folk. This ask isn’t unusual; at this particular company, job descriptions are fluid, and you can basically rewrite your role to better align with your interests.

The problem is: I don’t want to pivot into this new discipline. I enjoy research, and I would rather they just let me go if I’m not able to proceed in my given role. It’s very challenging and chaotic working at this company, and I only find it worth it if I’m doing something that aligns with my goals. At the same time, I don’t want to resign, because that could impact my ability to collect unemployment.

1kxun03,Two Job Offers,"I have two job offers right now that are time sensitive (need to make a decision by tomorrow morning) and I am caught in the middle on which way to go. For reference, I have been laid off for 5 months (not performance related), previously working as a senior consultant in the e-commerce and SasS implementation space for over 5 years. Details on the jobs below:

Job 1: Consulting role (not labeled as senior). Very similar to what I was doing previously, bit of a different space. Feels like something I could easily pickup. Medium sized company. 

Specifics:
- Salary: ~10% more than my last job
- 3 weeks vacation
- Decent benefits
- Perks: Remote work, annual wellness spending, couple floating holidays, summer Fridays
- 3 month probation period

Job 2: Senior Architect role. Still working in SaaS, but in a different space and in a different way. Not something I’m super familiar with, but could have good potential to learn and add skills to resume. Very large and well known company, but in a small team.

Specifics:
- Salary: ~20% more than my last job
- 3 weeks vacation
- Very excellent benefits
- Perks: Remote work, annual wellness spending, monthly stipend for internet+phone, free therapy coverage
- 6 month probation period


I accepted Job 1 earlier this month and am supposed to start on Monday. I just received the equipment yesterday. Job 2 has been a bit of a lengthy process but finally came back with a job offer today. This would start in two weeks.

Money, benefits and perks aside, I have very little fear about going into Job 1. It does kind of feel like a lateral move. Something that is safe and something I could ease into. The people there have been very friendly about onboarding. For Job 2, I am slightly apprehensive as the responsibilities are a little more unknown to me, though they did state that all I need is a willingness to learn and that there are many resources available. But being unemployed for 5 months, there is definitely a thought in the back of my mind that it could not work out and I’d be back here. But at the same time, I do feel like Job 2 could definitely lend itself to bigger opportunities down the road. So would I be dumb to turn it down?

I work in a large company, and employees are blue collar workers that involve driving. They will hide in their vehicles waiting for employees to make 'infractions'. Or they will wait somewhere and observe employees. Infractions could be not wearing a seat belt in a drive thru, moving the vehicle 30ft, not closing the door, not backing up when parking to name some. Employees have been suspended for doing too much overtime. 

Management really get a kick out of giving workers a hard time. They also have a quota to meet in for suspensions. It makes them look good when they 'catch' workers or suspended them.

To preface this post, I want to make it clear that there are no policies in place that prohibit dating or the need to disclose relationships (unless there is a person in a position of power above the other person). 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year. We met at work and are in the same department and team. For the past year, it’s been strictly professional and our other coworkers do not know we are dating. We recently got a new boss for our division and he pulled us into his office for a chat. He asked us if we were together, because he senses a “vibe”. I am sucky at lying, so I was honest with him. 

Ever since then we have been prohibited from doing any tasks together without another coworker, which puts a little damper on the teamwork aspect for the whole team.

Seven months ago, I started a new job. The current team is very patient and kind (from a human standpoint), but I feel there’s a lack of collaboration among team members, both internally and externally. I find myself doing small tasks without collaborating with others. I asked the managers to let me have more exposure to stakeholders so I can be more proactive, with no success . Furthermore , many of the stakeholders I work with with are leaving the company , so many sign-offs have been postponed.

I thought it was because I was a new joiner, but I’m actually seeing that the team is very passive and not as proactive as I would like.

In my previous company, it was the opposite—much more dynamic, and I could take part in interesting projects. The downside was my former manager, who was very unprepared and always provided wrong info to everyone.

I feel like I can't grow in this company—since I still consider myself junior, for me, learning and working proactively is essential. On the other hand, the new company has good benefits and a really relaxed environment.

The job itself is very simple in comparison from what I'm used to and requires basically I just show up. This makes me feel highly dissatisfied and longing for that feeling of fulfillment with my work.

This is a small company that is run by a woman younger than I whom had slept her way to 51% of the company and blackmailed the owner into it to avoid a lengthy court case. She runs the business like a spoiled brat with little to no compassion for any of her employees and feels they should work themselves to death and get ridiculed all the while. It's by far the most toxic unprofessional workplace I could have ever imagined. The VP of the company takes it in the ass by her all day and watches cameras like a glorified security guard. He is incapable of taking any accountability and is just a spineless worm. I'm coming up on my 1 year here at this company and I have been putting in applications for the last couple months very selectively. I'm fearful employers will not think too highly of this short stay of less than a year at this company but that's a risk I must take. Working here has drastically affected my mental health and relationships with my family.

Later today I have an Interview for what could be a perfect position for me. A Warehouse Supervisor for a very reputable beverage company. This role sounds near perfect for me and closer to home and from what I have been told so far. It checks all the boxes of what I want EXCEPT the salary. The job is posted 70-75k and I'm really trying to move forward and was specifically applying for jobs from 76-80. During my first interview the HR representative made it sound like there is some possible exceptions that could be made as the 70-75 is the advertised range but it could vary depending upon experience and how the interviews go. The last thing I want to do is ruin my chances by overshooting or negotiating the salary. It's very hard to gauge via phone and video chatting.

Should I just ask for the 75 so as to not blow my chances or do I stand firm and try to advocate why I deserve a higher rate than what they had posted? I know sometimes this works and other times it can ruin a great interview. I'm nervous for this conversation for only this reason. I'm confident Ill nail the interview. Any thoughts or recommendations for me?!

1kxo53e,Dropped out of medical school. Got a master’s in medical science. What are some well paying job options for me to pay off my massive debt.,"I recently made the difficult decision to drop out of medical school. It’s been a painful transition, especially since I had spent years preparing for and fully expecting to become a physician. Now, I’m facing the reality of having hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt and a Master’s in Medical Science that I likely received as a result of completing a portion of the program. My entire professional and academic background is in basic science and clinical research, and I have no experience outside of healthcare or academia.

At this point, I feel lost and unsure about my next steps. I know I need to find a career path that not only allows me to make use of my skills and education but also pays well enough to realistically address my student debt. I’m open to new industries and learning new things, but I have no idea what kinds of jobs I should be looking at or what would be a good fit given my background.

If anyone here has been in a similar situation or has any insight into career paths that are accessible to someone with a medical science background and research experience, I would really appreciate your advice. What kinds of roles or industries should I be exploring? Are there specific areas where my background would be especially valuable? How should I start thinking about building a career from here that can also help me manage the financial burden I’m carrying? Any guidance, experiences, or suggestions would mean a lot right now.

1kxnn9g,27F and Burnt Out of Tech. Advice?,"I’m 27 and I’ve been working in tech startups for about 7 years now. At my current company I have grown & jumped around a LOT. I used to work insane hours, working in to the night and working weekends. I hit major burnout nearly two years ago so I slowed things down and have a better balance now, but I feel like I still can’t recover. 

It’s hard to find my motivation again. I dread going to work every day. I’ve looked into getting a new job, but I don’t think I want to be in tech anymore. When I’m job searching I only get recommended tech jobs because that’s where all my experience comes from. I don’t even know what other jobs to search for. I don’t know where else to go or how to make a career change. Part of me also feels like it would a poor choice to throw away everything I’ve learned and built just to start at the bottom in something completely different. 

I’ve been at my current job for 4 years. They’re a tech startup with roughly 40 employees. I built their technical support team and managed that for a while. Became a product manager for a bit, but I was already burnt out at that point and couldn’t teach myself a new job (I have to teach myself everything because it’s a startup and that’s just the way it is). Then I moved to CX operations and managed the software / reporting for support and CSM teams. Taught myself HR and took over that role when our HR admin left. Became an Executive Assistant to the CEO on top of that. Now I am Chief of Staff, HR, Office Admin, and lead our Culture team — with random projects for other departments here and there. 

I have a great relationship with everyone here. I’m very close with the CEO and I feel so lucky to have had these learning opportunities. The company isn’t perfect, but it’s a pretty great place compared to other companies. My job is secure here and I have a real voice. So the company isn’t the problem. I just can’t get myself to do it anymore. 

At this point I’m considering leaving without something else lined up. I feel like I can’t find something new while I’m still doing this every day of my life. But I realize it’s not smart to quit without a plan. The job market isn’t great so who knows how long it would take to find something new. I don’t know how to begin changing industries. 

I would appreciate any advice at this point. ",Zealousideal-Yam-789,5,1.0,5,1748454691,2025-05-28 17:51:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kxnn9g/27f_and_burnt_out_of_tech_advice/,5,2025
1kxnei2,Feeling Lost After Layoffs — Unsure How to Restart My Career in Tech,"
Hi everyone,

I graduated with a degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) in 2023. I started an internship in January 2023, which turned into a full-time role and lasted until May 2024. During that time, I worked across multiple domains, including:
	1.	Data Analysis – Worked on time series forecasting: data cleaning, analysis, and building predictive models.
	2.	Data Engineering – Created and maintained DAGs using Apache Airflow.
	3.	Computer Vision Projects – Built and deployed two complete end-to-end applications (frontend, backend, and deployment).

Unfortunately, I was laid off as part of a mass downsizing. I couldn’t apply for jobs immediately afterward due to some personal and family issues.

Now, I’m feeling completely lost.
	•	I don’t know which tech stack or domain I should focus on.
	•	I have limited understanding of DSA, system design, or even some of the tools I previously used—I mostly got things done by consulting peers and figuring it out on the go.
	•	I feel like I lack depth in any one area, and that’s making it hard to decide where to start rebuilding.

I’d really appreciate any advice on:
	•	How to evaluate and pick a tech stack or domain to focus on
	•	How to restart and plan my learning/job search journey
	•	Whether I should go deep in one of the areas I’ve already worked on (like data or backend) or try something new

Thanks for reading, and any help or guidance is truly appreciated.",Neat-Reindeer-9065,1,1.0,2,1748454118,2025-05-28 17:41:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kxnei2/feeling_lost_after_layoffs_unsure_how_to_restart/,5,2025
1kxne42,Struggling to match corporate jargon in interviews—even though I can do the work. Advice?,"Over the course of my career, I’ve built a reputation for getting things done—and doing them well. I’ve received strong references, including from the CEO of my last company, who said I’d thrive in any environment I work in next. I’m proud of that.

But here’s the issue: when I’m in interviews—especially with larger companies—I sometimes feel like I’m speaking a different language. I don’t use a lot of ""corporate speak."" I’m very straightforward, and I tend to focus on action and outcomes.

I’m now targeting more operational, tech-savvy roles. In past jobs, I’ve had to teach myself everything. I’ve led HRIS cleanups, implemented automation tools, created internal systems and documentation, and improved internal processes—but I didn’t have anyone guiding me or using formal terms for what I was doing. I just figured it out and got it done.

So when I hear interviewers throw around phrases like “center of excellence,” “change enablement,” “value stream mapping,” etc., I sometimes freeze—not because I don’t know how to do the work, but because I’ve never used those words to describe it. Even phrases like “end-to-end” (which I’ve since picked up) used to throw me off—I’d just say “I managed it from start to finish.”

1kxn7z6,Done with pursuing a career. What job should I do instead?,"For context, I am a 29F and currently on MAT leave from my full-time Marketing Executive role where I earn £28k a year in the UK.

One thing becoming a mum has taught me is that I’m not a career person; never was, never going to be! I hate my job, I hate my bulling manager and I hate the 40min commute in rush hour traffic. I’m very resentful of my education which shamed and shaped me into being more academic than I actually wanted to be. I’m sick of trying to be someone I’m not just to cover my mortgage and monthly expenses. 

I have decided not to go back to my current role when my MAT leave is up in January, something I am able to do as I only get Stat. MAT leave. I truly think my calling is being a mum, and feel more fulfilled being at home than I ever have in my 5 years in the corporate world.

However, I will need to get some kind of job next year in order to cover a part of the mortgage and bills, have some ‘me’ money and save for a rainy day. 

My husband and I have discussed this and have agreed that there is a lot of benefit if I work part time doing something: I qualify for Stat MAT leave again, contribute to my own pension, and the first £12,000 of my pay check would be tax free and I wouldn’t have to pay anything towards my student loans. 

My question is what should that something be? My criteria is this: 
• Low importance/drive - no overtime, strict individual KPIs or pressure to climb a corporate ladder/improve.
• To be within 5 miles of my village - I have business park, train station, university, high street, town centre, supermarket, garden centre and IKEA all within 5miles of where I live. 
• To earn at least £900 a month to maintain a liveable lifestyle. 
• Can’t suck up all my evening or weekend time - I need to be home to put my son to bed and need at least one weekend day so I can have family time with my husband and son. 

I know I can work in a cafe or shop part-time but are there any other opportunities I am missing which I haven’t thought of which would fit my criteria?

1kxn2n6,"Career Advice Needed – 31F, Burnt Out After 7 Years in Sales, Looking for a Peaceful Yet Stable and High-Paying Career Switch","I’m a 31-year-old woman looking for genuine career guidance and practical suggestions from this community.

I’ve been working in sales for the last 7 years across industries like insurance, healthcare, ed-tech, and currently FinTech. I started my career with a salary of 2.5 LPA and now earn 12 LPA fixed + 3 LPA variable.

On paper, the growth looks good — but mentally and emotionally, I feel drained.
Sales has been a non-stop hustle. Targets, pressure, and burnout have become part of my daily life. Even though my current role isn’t as hectic as before, I still feel anxious due to the uncertainty of the private sector — layoffs can happen anytime.

Now, at this stage of my life, I want to settle down, and I realize how important it is to have a stable career with good income and work-life balance, especially as a woman. I don’t want to compromise on my salary — I’ve worked hard to reach here — but I also want to live, not just survive deadlines.

About me:
	•	31 years old, female
	•	MBA in Marketing (Tier-3 college)
	•	7 years of experience in B2B and B2C sales
	•	No technical or coding background

Now I’m hoping to transition into a career that is:
	•	Stable and in-demand for the next 5–10 years
	•	Peaceful, preferably day shifts
	•	Offers decent or higher salary than I’m currently making
	•	Gives me work-life balance
	•	Allows me to grow without burning out

I’m open to upskilling, learning new things, and even starting in a new field, but I want to be sure I’m heading in the right direction.

What I need help with:
	1.	What career paths can I realistically consider given my background?
	2.	Can I use my sales/communication/strategy experience in a better role (e.g. product management, project management, operations, customer success, business analyst, etc.)?
	3.	What skills/certifications/courses should I take up to make this transition possible?
	4.	Any platforms or communities that can help me get started?

If you’ve made a career switch, or know someone who has — I’d love to hear from you. I’m at a point where I really want to build a stable, peaceful and fulfilling life.

1kxmre0,Have 3 backlogs in my degree(2020 batch). Can I get a job as softwaredeveloper in UAE without degree?,"Hey, I'm sorry to start like this, Because I'm in a deep trouble, kindly please guide me.

So, I was a 2020 - 2023 BCA student, and I couldn't complete my degree and I got 3 backlogs still now (after 2023 I was learning MERN Stack by own and was not even thinking of completing my degree was thought we don't need degree to become a software developer, we only need skills), and I apply to 1000s of Jobs and I have cracked one after a year (2024 July), as a Frontend Developer in a Edtech Startup only earning 15k/month working remotely. Right now I only have 10months of experience.

So my main problem (after my degree 2023),

While I was doing self learning at home my parents and cousins are keep telling me to go abroad because some of my cousins are in UAE and they keep asking me to sent my resume, I tried to escape from that because I don't have a degree, because we need a degree to get work visa right as a software engineer (But I really like to work abroad). Every time I was telling I was doing a course work I will share in some day after getting some experience for there. And the real problem is even my parents don't know that I don't have a degree. I just showed my degree completed certificate only not my degree certificate.


And every day I'm very low always thinking about my mistake (ie, not completing my degree) and currently trying to switch to get a better pay, and was getting some calls but everyone saying you only have 10months experience we are looking for someone who have minimum 2 year of experience. And some of them are ghosting me after 2 and 3 rounds of interview, And right now I feel stuck don't know what I can do. My parents are so worried about me and keep telling me how can you survive with only this much of salary and telling me to sent my resume to my cousins because right now you have 10months of experience, you will get a job by some chance.

 
And I talked with my teacher of my college and she told me that even she don't know I can write my back paper because of this much delay. Right now I feel I don't have a future, and don't know what to do. 

And currently I'm working everyday to switch, sharpening my js skills, preparing DSA and machine coding rounds and trying to built side projects. And currently trying to learn GO.

Kindly please everyone give me some advice to give break from this. I can't tell my parents/cousins that I don't have a degree. And I'm 100% ready to work 24*7 to only need to see my parents living a better life and happily. And after 2023 I'm leaving every family functions and outing with my friends and sitting in my home every day, because I was getting tensed and afraid that I'm wasting my time and not learning anything.

Please tell me if is there any way I can work UAE or any other countries without a degree, or how to do a smart job switch and get a decent pay. Please any hard plan would work for me, I just need a everyone advices please.

Please please guide me I'm literally feeling lost now. 

Thank you! 


TL;DR :

 I was a BCA student (2020 - 2023) couldn't complete my 3 backlogs yet, currently working as a frontend developer in a Edtech startup earning 15k per month with only 10months of experience, my parents keep telling you can't live with only this much pay and to try abroad where my cousins are working and they keep telling me to share my resume (And I really like to work abroad too). My parent don't' know that I don't have a degree. Currently I'm trying to switch my job but its too negative. Kindly please please help me get through this. I can work 24*7 and any hard plan would work for me. Please tell me if is there any way I can work in UAE or any other countries without a degree, or how to do a smart job switch and get a decent pay.

1kxmnnx,Career Path Decision/College Major,"I am 19F, I am currently in both a university(off right now for the summer), a technical college, and working a full time job. I work as an estimator for a construction company for 16USD / hour, I am going for a bachelors of science in construction management, and going to technical college for welding.

I am mostly done with the technical college, but had personal issues arise and have not gone to class in a few months. I am worried about going back, but will as it is something I would like to complete.

I started freshman year of college last fall, I have nothing to show for it as work, and technical college, and university all piled up and I ending up paying for the semesters but not passing any classes and withdrawing. Ultimately I feel very behind as I started university a year late anyways, and then completely messed up my first year by not getting anything done and wasting money on it. And a lot of my friends already have associates degrees to show for their work.

I do not think I want to continue working construction, not unless something seriously changes with my current job. I very much dislike sitting at a desk, so construction, MIGHT, be okay if I was different side of it, but it seems my boss believes women don't belong in the field. I had originally planned to become a Certified Welding Inspector, and that still sounds all good and fine, but I would need to switch majors it a engineering course, but I am worried to do that as I don't want to end up sitting at a desk again. To add  to that, I would need three years field experience, so three years of a welding job, to even be able to apply then have to do all the testing for it. With a welding job, I am unsure if it is something I would like doing for working because this far it has been a hobby. My boyfriends family friends are ranches and every summer we go out to help them for a week, and I really enjoy that, but I am unsure how that is something I could get into, or even find a degree for. To be completely honest, I really dislike college but like it is something I HAVE to do.

Paying for college is also a really big factor for me, I do not qualify for FASFA because my parents make to much, but they will not be helping me pay for college. I have applied for lots of scholarships and seem to have absolutely no luck when it comes to being awarded them, plus most of the scholarships on my universities website for major specific and I don't want to apply and have to stick with construction management just to be able to pay, even though it is something I hate.

Like anyone else, I want a high paying job, I enjoy. I enjoy being outside, working with animals, working on cars and turning wrenches, building things, fabricating, etc. I have no idea how to search for a niche job that is something I want to do, basic things like being a vet, and being a teacher are things that sound good to me. I worry about going into large animal vet, for cattle and horses, and it looking like I am copying a friend of mine. I worry my parents will see it that way and get irritated with me, I am worried if I change into a degree that doesn't align with welding like I had originally planned they will see it as me giving up on that, and not agree with that decision or support it.

I am looking for any sort of advice anyone is willing to give, because I have no clue what I am doing.

1kxlvvy,Guidance on moving out of the world of sales. Open to certificate programs or any advice.,"First I'd like to say I appreciate anyone reading this and the advice they may provide. A bit about myself...

In 2018 I moved to Austin, TX where I started my career in sales after graduating with a public relations/advertising degree. I've primarily worked in software/tech. I started as an SDR/BDR and then moved into an inside sales rep role, and from there found myself working in an account management/csm role. I found the most success in the AM/CSM role, but still felt very little fulfillment, and ultimately have never enjoyed working in sales.

Bringing things to the present moment, I'm out of a job after getting laid off and then having a brief stint working for a company as an account executive, where I ultimately was not able to find success. I left that role and have been applying for more AM/CSM roles for the last few months with little traction. 

I am realizing that I'm just applying for jobs where I ultimately won't have security or fulfillment in a career path I've grown to hate. 

I'm taking advice from my wife, family, and friends that I need to remove myself from the world of sales and find something that, at the very least, I won't despise. 

With so many potential options in front of me, I don't know where to start looking, which is why I'm posting here. I'd like to avoid going back to a university simply due to the cost of tuition, but am very open to the idea of a certificate program or an accelerated program through a community college.

Any advice for well-paying and secure jobs in spaces where I can enter either without previous experience or with the help of a certificate would be appreciated.

The leaders of the school are meeting to discuss contracts, tomorrow I heard. I will have been here a full year.

I overheard one of my coworkers, who is also office personnel, flat out ask ""When are contracts going out? I need more days off."" I was under the impression there wasn't much negotiating to be had but now I'm not sure. I'm trying to get a meeting later today to chat real quick.

Basically, I am hourly and my hourly pay stinks. I'm trying to sell/refinance my home or get a HELOC to make improvements but ""don't make enough income"". My annual is not so bad because of the bonuses etc. but that doesn't matter or count to a bank (understandably). If I remember correctly, on my new hire paperwork, my projected raise was to be $0.71. I've proven myself to be worth more than that. And initially took a pretty big but to make this move $30 an hour to $24 an hour. Have been playing catch up ever since.

How much of this do I share with my boss (about the heloc etc. how my hourly is impacting me)? How do I appear grateful while also asking for more?",ExistentialKale,1,1.0,3,1748450513,2025-05-28 16:41:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kxlvpv/negotiating_my_raise/,5,2025
1kxkyvt,Should I change my job because of my manager?,"My new manager of 7 months manager wrote a performance review that was false and also painted me in a negative light, and I'd like to take the next job I was offered out of her team.

I feel I could do the biggest thing for the company and she would just overlook it.

I have been doing extra work on the team for which I've been given written approval, and she said in my report that I wasn't following instructions to not do that work.

This type of misunderstanding has continued. I'm getting bad advice from my manager and it really looks like she doesn't know what is going on. This is giving me stress and I told her that. 

Talking to her about it seems to lead no where or she might just change the topic. When I told her I'm going to leave to focus on new projects she gave me the new projects and said do it all together.

I do technical engineering work and the next job would be a manegerial position. I would prefer to stay because I'm worried about losing the technical muscle.

I don't mind trying new things so long as I get to continue the technical work I do later on, and I feel maybe this is the push I need to try out new things.

Throughout this a much higher senior manager that overlooks our area knows me well and appreciates my input. I think I should change positions but also maybe I should also let him know? Is there any point in that? I want to have the option to. One back if the new position doesn't work out.

I feel like I could travel while working with the new position which is a side bonus.

1kxjywi,How do you test what work you’re meant to do without wasting years?,"Hi all – I’m 30, based in Asia, with a non-linear background:  
BA in Sociology, MBA from the U.S., and work experience in sales ops, data analytics, and project management/product management at huge tech.

For the past few months, I’ve been deeply questioning my path. Corporate life felt soul-crushing — I hated doing work that felt like just optimizing for meaningless KPIs. I crave more impact and freedom.

Now I’m caught between two directions:

* Going deeper into research: possibly through a PhD or research assistant roles in fields like digital society, data ethics, or tech and democracy.  
* Rebuilding my industry career: in a direction that feels more aligned: creative, analytical, globally relevant. I'm drawn to data storytelling, civic tech.

I don’t need a perfect answer. But if you’ve been in a similar space — pivoting at 30+, choosing between research and industry, I’d love to hear your story.

Then disaster struck the company, and they haven’t been hiring anyone for the last year (right before I finished and got a chance to apply).

Literal hours after this, the company I wanted a job with said that they will be hiring again soon, potentially within a couple months.

Do I try to take a job as a machinist, or wait it out for my preferred company to maybe figure things out?

For those who do not know, Cinema and Media Engineering is a course in the IT department of the Politecnico, we have many courses in common with Informatic Engineering, in fact I did courses of OOP, C++, C#, and Python. Now, I do not consider myself anywhere near the competence of an Informatic Engineer, considering thst I didn't do any of the algorithm courses or data analysis courses.

I got my masters degree 3 years ago, so I am not a freshman anymore.

I have some fellow colleagues that got into software engineering after the masters degree, but what I wanted to ask is if you think I can allow myself to have the ambition to go to work to bigtech (google, meta, amazon etc) if I work hard enough. Do you have any suggestions or do you think it's a stupid idea?

1kxj01r,1099 or W2 Employee in US,"Hi All,

I am in a bit of a pickle as they say. I was laid off from a company in March since they had decided to shut the site down. Fast forward to today. The company has decided to try to sell the site instead and has a prospective buyer but it's not official. 

The company had a FTE quit and they are now looking to fill this role. I was told that they would only be able to do a temp pending changes to the site to make it a permanent role. I was asked if I would be opening to being an independent contractor or if I would need to come in with an agency. 

Now I am all confused. Based on the IRS website it looks like I would be required to be an W2 employee. Not sure if i can post the link. If I can I will put it in the comments. That would require me to go through an agency with crappy benefits. Plus it would require the company to pay a buy out to them if I was able to come back as FTE. With the 1099 of course I would be paid more but the taxes are harder. Not including if it would even legally be an option. Either way I would pay out of pocket for insurance and have basicly no PTO.

This has been my only true prospect of a job and money is running low so I need to take something fast. What would be the best option and how do you make it all above the table?

1kxi3la,Should I send follow-up feedback after a negative interview experience?,"I'm an AI engineer who recently interviewed with a major software company. While the initial two rounds were great — I had positive interactions with the panel and was genuinely excited about the opportunity — the final interview took a complete turn.

The interviewer in the last round was extremely rude, dismissive, and made no effort to engage in any form of conversation. Halfway through implementing the problem he gave me, I found myself no longer focused on the solution — instead, I was thinking about the best way to exit the interview. I really wanted to say ""You can't even fake being nice for 15 minutes, huh?"" 


Afterward, I emailed the recruiter with a polite message:

""After careful consideration, I've decided to withdraw my application and will not be proceeding with the interview process. I appreciate your time and support throughout, and I wish the team all the best in finding the right candidate.""

While that message was professional, I still feel like I want to say more. The experience left a very bad taste, and I honestly can't imagine working on a team led by someone like that. I'm also grateful I found out early, before making a bigger commitment.

1kxhmba,Should I take a more specific internship or a fulltime position somewhat related to my end goal?,"Hello! I am a computer science student with a small dilemma that I would like advice on. I was just offered a cybersecurity internship position. I also have an interview lined up for a fulltime software dev role. I have little experience in both of these areas. My interest is much more heavy in cybersecurity though enjoy some aspects of programming.

Here are the pros and cons I can think of for both.

Cybersecurity Internship--
Pros:
- It is part of a local government team so would open doors for gov roles down the line (questionable pro maybe?)
- it is specific to cybersecurity, which I'm more interested in
- the team I'd be working with is very friendly and interested in seeing their people develop and grow, even if it means leaving for another position down the line
- it is close enough that the commute isn't a bother/won't have to move
- the position would make me high priority for future open positions

Cons:
- It is only two months
- the pay is quite low ($18/hr)


Software Dev Role--
Pros:
- I would be making more (the pay is about 6 figures) than I currently am *if* offered
- it would allow me to improve on my understanding of coding with some aspects of security involved

Cons: 
- I would have to move which is never fun. I would have to spend time finding a new place to live, actually moving, and getting acclimated while trying to work on my summer classes
- the role isn't directly related to my end goal of being a security engineer/analyst
- my bf works there so if we were to break up it would make working there very uncomfortable

1kxfx7f,I interviewed with a company last week and the boss texted me late last night asking to meet one on one at Starbucks for a final interview. Is this weird?,"So I had a job interview last week (Wednesday)  a legit role, solid pay, and I interviewed with the office coordinator and her manager. Everything seemed normal at first.

Then on Tuesday , I got an email and text from the coordinator saying the doctor  wanted to meet me. I agreed, and I was originally scheduled to meet him Friday.

Later that day, he personally called me from his cell. My schedule had opened up, so I told him I could meet earlier — on Tuesday instead of Friday. He said we could meet at one of two locations, then suggested Starbucks near Aldi. I said I could just come to the office, but he still pushed for Starbucks. He ended the call by saying he’d text me the time and location.

That night, I got a text from his personal number… at 11:07 PM. It just said something like “Can meet tomorrow at 4pm if you’re available — Starbucks, [address].” Then again at 7:30 AM the next morning, he texted “Please confirm if available (his name)  with (company) .”

Now, nothing overtly inappropriate has happened. But I can’t shake this gut feeling that something is off:
- He already knew I’d confirmed the Friday meeting, why override that through a personal call and late-night text?
- Why Starbucks, even after I offered to come to his office?
-The 11 PM text just felt… off. Especially coming from a 50s–60s man who owns the practice and who I barely know.
- Something about the tone and timing gives me “boundary-blurring” vibes.

I haven’t withdrawn yet, but I’m really leaning toward just declining the position altogether. I do have another offer, and while this job pays more, the way this unfolded is throwing me way off.

1kxfrcl,My (26F) new boss (43M) is hot and cold — only with me — and sometimes even taunts me. What’s going on?,"So, my new boss joined a month ago. In the beginning, he was very warm and talkative with me — we’d chat for a good 1–2 hours some days. But suddenly, he’s completely pulled back. He barely acknowledges me now, while he continues being friendly and conversational with the rest of my team.

A bit of background: I transferred internally to this team and was never really welcomed by them. Because of that, I tend to hang out with my old team, where I’m still close with my previous manager of my old team — he treats me like a younger sister, honestly. Importantly, he also holds a lot of influence in the company and openly supports me, which I truly appreciate.

Now I’m wondering — is that closeness with my old boss making my new boss uncomfortable? Could it be some sort of power dynamic thing?

The confusing part is how inconsistent my new boss is. Some mornings, he’s nice to me — polite, even warm. But by the evening, it’s like a switch flips, and he becomes cold or almost dismissive. And this hot-and-cold behavior seems directed only at me.

On top of that, I’ve noticed he’ll make these weird comments — like subtly taunting me, saying things like *“You’re pretending to act dumb”* or *“This isn’t really you.”* It feels like he’s trying to undermine me or suggest I’m not being genuine.

Just to be clear — my work is excellent. I’m consistent, I meet deadlines, and I’ve even been recognized for the quality of my work. So I know it’s not a performance issue.

My team is planning a trip soon, and I chose not to join because I don’t feel comfortable with them. I already feel isolated, and now with my boss acting so unpredictably, it’s getting harder to show up every day with a clear head.

Total CTC (Fixed): ₹43L

Base Salary: ₹31L

RSUs: ~$10K/year

Joining Bonus: ₹3.5L

Variable Bonus: Up to 9% of base

Total CTC (Excl. Variable): ~₹43.5L

My Dilemma:
The Qualcomm role is more Linux-focused, and I’m a bit concerned it might lean too much toward the hardware/embedded side, which could limit flexibility for future switches. But I believe my work will mostly be focused on DevOps side last time I checked with hiring team.

Would love to hear thoughts from anyone with experience at either company or in similar situations. Thanks in advance!

1kxeq94,Which job should I quit?,"A little background, my old job is a fully on site role with a private office and I basiclly have nothing to do 95% of the time. However, last year they once tried to laid me off but at the end I can keep my job.

I started this new Job last week, I was told it's remote job but the training period is in person during the interview. Although they did't mention how long is the training period, I assumed it's one week or two. So I thought I can take 2 weeks of PTO from my J1 to onboard to J2. And doing both afterward. I was wrong, my team leader told me yesterday that it will be at least one month. And he seems upset when I ask him the timeline of the training. And this new job has more things to learn and remember than I expected and I feel overwhelmed.

Salarywise both job are the same, J2 may be slightly higher due to higher bonus (<10%)

Which job should I quit in this situation?",Civil_Permission4709,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1748431948,2025-05-28 11:32:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kxeq94/which_job_should_i_quit/,5,2025
1kxeoiu,Desperately need advise on health related careers - Australia,"Hey guys, I'm a HS student wanting to go into medicine but seeing how competitive it is, I've been trying to consider other roles. My subjects are mainly science and math based (which I enjoy the most as well), and I'm really into building relationships with others + leadership roles, so health seems like the only field I truly see myself in. I do still want a career with good money but everything in health requires intense shift work or a lot of experience, which is lowkey kind of discouraging.  I have been researching about nursing (specifically becoming a Nurse Practitioner) but the starting pay as an RN is superduper low. The highest it gets is maybe just over 100K unless I reach like 20 years of experience. Honestly, I'm so confused now I might as well consider becoming a train driver than getting a job in health in Aus. Is there anyone who has a really niche job in health which actually pays well by any chance? or people who always wanted medicine/health careers but decided on something else instead? 

  
I primarily want good money, so I honestly wouldn't mind any other field apart from health. Feel free to give me literally any advice because I'm genuinely so stuck on what I want to pursuit, especially having medicine be engraved in me all my childhood.

1kxd4bq,Feeling Stuck and Depressed,"Hey everyone,

I’m in my mid-20s and currently working as a qualified electrician in the UK. I’ve been doing it for a while, and to be honest, it’s just not working for me anymore. The pressure, the lack of support, constantly feeling like someone’s watching and waiting for me to mess up — it’s exhausting. I feel anxious most days, I overthink everything, and I dread going in.

Before this, I worked in retail for a bit and really enjoyed it. It was busy, but the people were good, the environment was more relaxed, and I actually looked forward to being there. I’ve also worked as a tattoo artist in the past — another job I loved because it felt creative and personal. So I’ve bounced between a few paths but found that these are surprisingly the ones that really don’t pay well and that’s why i had to leave in the first 6 months of doing it, but what I’ve realised lately is that I need something that’s me something that doesn’t constantly drain me or make me question if I’m cut out for it.

it’s led me to think  about coaching basketball and coaching multi sports in general. I’ve always loved the sport, and lately I’ve felt like it’s something I want to take further even if it means starting right from the bottom. I’ve been reaching out to local clubs to see if I can volunteer as an assistant coach and just start learning and getting stuck in.

But the biggest thing that’s holding me back is money. My current job pays fairly well and helps me and my girlfriend save toward moving out something we’ve both been dreaming about. So I’m scared. Scared to leave that security, scared I’ll be broke, and scared that chasing something I like instead of something that just pays well will end up being a mistake.

My girlfriend’s been amazing. She says she’ll support me no matter what and doesn’t want me to stay in something that’s making me miserable. But I still feel the pressure like I’m supposed to stick it out because it’s the “grown-up” thing to do. Like I’m throwing away a serious job for something that might never lead anywhere. I don’t want to be seen as someone who can’t handle real life but I also don’t want to stay in something that’s slowly wearing me down.

So yeah, I guess I’m asking: am I doing the right thing here, or am I just kidding myself? Has anyone made a leap like this and actually made it work? Or at least found peace in giving it a go?

1kxb0f9,Help an 18yo figure out their shit 😭🙏,"Hi, this a bit long, but I really need advice because I’ve been overthinking about this for such a long time now. I’m about to graduate high school in like a week, and since I’ll be going to college in a few months I’ve been thinking very seriously what it is that I want to do with my life career-wise. My three realistic options: teacher (math/science); engineer; or doctor/PA. Truth is I absolutely love teaching. I’ve been both a calculus and chemistry tutor at my high school and I just love explaining things to people and making it make sense to them, especially math, I love math, the way it works, and how it almost always leads to a solution. I also love science because I truly believe it can explain our existence. Anyways, I love teaching right, but as a FGLI, the teacher salary isn’t gonna cut it for me. My parents are immigrants and with all the sacrifices they’ve made, I think it’s almost insulting to them that I make the same salary they make. I mean, they missed their parents’ funeral and didn’t see them for 20 years so that I could get a great education here in the US, so I need to make their sacrifices worth it. Yeah but the teacher salary won’t be enough; I just know it. I also don’t want to depend on a man (fyi: I want to be fully financially independent at some point for many reasons but mainly cuz I’ve seen how relying on a man economically can lead to you being silenced as a woman). Anyways, engineer. So I tried a few engineering classes in high school, but more than enjoying them I struggled. I remember once joining the robotics team at my school but I never really saw anything impressive or interesting, maybe bc it was the upperclassmen doing everything. But to be honest, engineering itself doesn’t sound very interesting to me. I can’t imagine myself working as an engineer. I’d honestly only do it for the money. I’m a math oriented person and a hard worker so I’m sure I could survive the training, but I’d definitely only do it for the money. But then again, I haven’t really learned what engineering is all about still. Besides, passion is also important to me, so the lack of passion in engineering is what would stop me from going into it. Now finally medicine. I love science, like I said, and I also took a bunch of health science courses in high school like med term and anatomy. I found it very interesting, and I have a particular interest in hormones and in the nervous system. I have many family members, including myself, who suffer of endocrine conditions and I’ve thought about becoming an endocrinologist (maybe pediatric endocrinologist) for some time because not only do I find the pathology interesting but I feel like I would understand my patients on a personal level. Primary care also interests me. I’ve seen how hard and inadequate it can be to access healthcare as a minority and more primary care physicians are needed, at that, more Spanish speaking physicians are needed because no one is going to advocate best for you that your own people. Again, this is just my own personal experiences with healthcare care, but it would mean a lot to me to help people like me, if that makes sense. And ngl, the money is a factor to consider, not my main motive but definitely a motive. “Dr.” also sounds beautiful as a first gen. But I’m aware of how hard and long it takes to become a doctor, and that is why I’ve also thought about pa school. However, the only downside to that is that I like being the boss. I like leading, I don’t want to be a follower. I don’t like being told what to do; I like telling others what to do. I also don’t like the idea of not knowing enough. Ik you can’t know everything as a physician, but you certainly know more than anyone in the room and to me, the “why” of things is very important. However, I’m not currently at my healthiest, and I don’t think I ever will since I have chronic condition that drains all my energy (but hey I managed to be valedictorian of my school so it must mean something no? At least right now). That also is a setback for me to pursue medicine, and honestly, I’m not fully sure if medicine is for me because I’ve never shadowed a doctor; I do plan to in college though. Lastly, I feel like medicine is where all my interests could intersect because I could always exercise my passion for teaching when educating patients and know all these cool science facts that deeply interest me. The math… I wouldn’t mind being my kids’ personal math teacher (bc I do plan on having kids). Ik I yapped a lot but I think a lot and I wanted to give all the details.

1kxa8bc,Conventional science vs entrepreneurship,"
* heads up- it's a long text...

I am totally confused what should be my next step in my career. On one side I am really ambitious and that is from materialistic things. I've been a middle-class till now and one thing that I know for sure is this is something that I don't want to offer to my future self and future family. But due to other career goals of becoming a vet (also to get financially independent, rich and staying connected to the field of my liking) I chose bsc with zoology as major but the prospect plan isn't gonna work out due recent spike in the course fees structure. And now I've ended up getting a zoology degree which unfortunately doesn't have much of a financial growth, at least the way I want to have. And if I follow this conventional path I will end up being a middle class again which I absolutely hate. (definitely I'll be in the field that I like and workplace I'd love such as in the woods or in mountains studying some species). I love Zoology, wildlife biology and stuff but reluctant to go with that becuz of low pay. 

Unknowingly I always tend to find flaws of our day to day products that one can innovate and launch as a completely new and much effective product but never thought of it as an career because I was blinded by my ""passion"" in the career. Additionally, irrespective of my career, down the line I always wanted to be an entrepreneur.
So, now I'm thinking of getting into a MBA (with a soul aim of becoming an entrepreneur because sooner or later, I wanted to become one) certainly not for its typical reasons such as to get a promotion in the job. Rather for its intrinsic values, the knowledge it has to offer me, to make connections with like minded peers, and to understand how business works and how to control it, just to implement it for how I can innovate my own ideas. But some people are suggesting me that now a days MBA have became full of crap and people remain unemployed despite having a MBA. And I was seriously considering to get my MBA from abroad (I'm Indian) in order to have global exposure, better marketplace and open environment for startups. The students loans and current uncertainty in employability is making me reconsider my decision.

Another reason to consider entrepreneurship as my career is I'm into conservation and I am sure I will be able to contribute to it much more efficiently than me working as a researcher/ ecologist/wildlife biologist, at the same time achieving my materialistic objectives by becoming an entrepreneur.

 I am currently in terrible state and any help or advice would be highly appreciated.

1kx9wbu,Should I have negotiated my salary?,"Alright, so I’ve already accepted this offer but I’m reflecting on my behavior for learnings to apply next time around.

I scored a fully remote role with a 20% salary increase (not including equity) and better benefits+culture than my old role. My old role was also fully remote.

Salary range listed in the JD was $100K-$125K. When I talked to the recruiter on the phone, they said the range was $100K-$140K. I didn’t follow up to ask (maybe I should have), but I assumed that) $140K was the top of the full range (not starting range) for the role before you’re bumped to a higher position. 

THE OFFER:

They offered me $120K, and I accepted without any negotiation. Here’s my thought process:


WHY I DECIDED NOT TO NEGOTIATE:


1) The JD said 5-7 years and I only have 3.5, but very niche experience that fits perfectly.

2) The offer was only $5K lower than the top of the range on the JD (even though it was $20K lower than the verbal range the recruiter listed). I figured that was a good faith offer, especially since I could tell the really liked me.

3) Finding a remote role was extremely difficult and took me a year and a half of trying spitting myself. Especially hard to find one I was qualified for, and one with a salary bump and good culture. I’ve heard rumors on Reddit that because the job market is so bad, people are getting their offers yanked after they try to negotiate.

Did I make the right decision? I feel like I did, but a part of me is tossing and turning at night feeling like I missed an opportunity. Would like feedback on how I should have handled this. For context, I negotiated my previous role, but I felt I had leverage since they created a position just for me.

1kx9r4l,"I dig through LinkedIn’s algorithm guidelines, community policies, engineering blogs… so you don’t have to.","I started using LinkedIn since 2012. 5‑7 figure deals I got are from LinkedIn. 80% of my star employees is from LinkedIn.

Not until this year do I sit & write down everything I know about leverage career with LinkedIn. I document everything in this [LinkedIn Growth Hub](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-LinkedIn-Growth-Lab-1ef25e9875f980a281d3f23473f3bb65) (update every weekend if I have time). 

This week I read LinkedIn’s algorithm guidelines, community policies, engineering blogs… & here are the gist: 

**1-Automated engagement tools could get you shadowbanned.**

We all wish for AI doing all the work for us. But be careful what you wish for!

A friend of mine - a YC founder - used Taplio, a tool that helps automate content and engagement on LinkedIn. It boosted the engagement to 100,000+ impressions!

Then LinkedIn banned Taplio. Both the CEO’s and company’s accounts were banned permanently. Many of their users have been penalized.

My friend’s posts hover at 1,000 impressions. Today he asked me to talk to someone in LinkedIn HQ to get him out of the LinkedIn jail…

**2-LinkedIn isn’t designed for virality.**

Still seeing cringy viral posts and thinking “What’s wrong with LinkedIn?”. Well, they know it’s wrong and they’re trying to fix it.

Their AI models are getting more accurate at scoring content and creators.

Odd engagement patterns raise red flags. And even if your post gets real engagement, if it’s too clickbaity, your content, or even your account, might get flagged.

More from LinkedIn [**HERE**](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/trust-and-safety/viral-spam-content-detection-at-linkedin).

**3-Engagement pods (like for like) are ALSO being cracked down.**

LinkedIn distributes your content to relevant people in your network. But most pods are filled with random folks from unrelated industries, or worse, fake accounts.

If they like or comment on your content, it confuses the algorithm. Your content score might get downgraded, or your entire account could suffer.

**4-Posting every day used to be the golden rule. Not anymore.**

The algorithm now tags over-posting as noise. It’s not about being daily, it’s about sharing thoughtful insights. Let’s be honest, do you have thoughtful insights everyday…

TLDR: Optimize for sustainability: respect their policies, be patient & consistent with quality content.",Few_Alarm_5169,1,1.0,1,1748412259,2025-05-28 06:04:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kx9r4l/i_dig_through_linkedins_algorithm_guidelines/,5,2025

1kx8xsj,How can I transition out of a customer service role in a nonprofit?,"I’m an immigrant in the U.S. I got my first (and only) job here 18 months ago, working as a customer support representative at a nonprofit. My job includes answering phones, transferring calls, registering members and event participants, processing payments, data entry, filing, transaction reconciliation, and sorting and distributing mail.

In addition to that, I’m responsible for processing volunteer background checks and was given extra duties in fund development operations. I now help with gift data processing (tracking donations and sending acknowledgments), updating donors records, generating reports, running mail merges, and other related tasks. This is the part of my job I think it gives me the best chance of moving beyond customer service.

However, I’ve found that jobs focused only on gift/data processing in nonprofits are rare. Most entry-level development roles also require fundraising, which I’m not interested in or qualified for especially since I’m not local and English isn’t my first language and these types of roles require excellent communication skills. 

I’ve gotten interviews for three gift processing/fund development operations roles. I chose not to pursue one, and I didn’t get the other two after final interviews. I believe it’s due to a combination of limited experience, language barriers, and interview skills that can be improved. I haven’t gotten any interviews in 4 months. 

I also have a law degree from my home country, but I’ve never used it. Legal assistant/paralegal roles seem to have high entry barriers and low pay in the first few years. I’ve applied to a few generic legal admin jobs, but I haven’t gotten any interviews.

I want to say I make about 35k a year (I live a MHCOL city and this is minimum wage and by no means enough money to live) and my goal is getting at least 50k. Right now I want to be practical and follow steps that will allow me to have a livable wage. I want to say I come from low income family and I’ve been in survival mood for a very long time. No one in my family has a good career and therefore I need to start making smart decisions to stop the poverty cycle.

I’m interested in data and technology. Maybe finance. I would consider myself a good communicator, but I come off as weird when speaking English. Customer facing roles is something I would like to leave behind. 

Getting promoted is out the question. I tried that route and failed. When I said I’ve been doing a bunch of things that have nothing to do with customer service they basically told me to suck it up and do it for the learning… Right. 

What career paths should I consider? How can I use the skills I’ve built in my current job to transition out of customer service?

1kx7emi,"What should I do: pursue M.E. in Data Science despite weak math, or start a career in BPO?","Hi everyone, I’m seeking some guidance regarding my career path and I’m really confused.

I'm completing my B.Tech in Computer Science this August. I wanted to join the IT sector, but I couldn't clear interviews mainly because I feel I'm a bit weak in coding. So currently, I’m considering joining the BPO sector for 1–2 months or maybe even long-term if things go well.

At the same time, I’ve also been planning to pursue an M.E. in Data Science starting in August—but honestly, I'm not very confident in mathematics either, which makes me question this decision too.

Now I’m stuck between a few thoughts:

Should I join a BPO job for just 2 months before my M.E. starts, or should I think about working there long-term?

Is it worth pursuing M.E. in Data Science if I’m weak in mathematics?

Is it okay to join the BPO sector if I’m from a tech background and not strong in coding?

Can the BPO sector offer a good long-term career in comparison with it sector?

I'm really confused about what would be the better decision for my future. I’d truly appreciate any advice or experiences you all could share.

I’m 23 years old and a mother, and I’ve reached a point in my life where I’m determined to continue my education. My goal is to become self-reliant, secure stable employment, and eventually move forward independently so I can better support my children. While their father is supportive, I don’t want to leave the relationship until I’m in a position to provide for them on my own. i was forced into marriage at a young age, and as a result, I haven’t had anyone to mentor or guide me through academic or career decisions. I recently began pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Cloud Computing at WGU. Although I’ve completed a full year, I’m realizing that I may not be well-suited for a tech-focused field, as I have no prior experience or foundational knowledge in this area. i fully understand that no degree guarantees employment — ultimately, it comes down to one’s skills and initiative. That said, I’m looking for a degree path that can realistically lead to stable, entry-level job opportunities and offers practical value in today’s job market.

1kx6uw4,Boss said “I’ll help you apply to other jobs”,"I’m working at a great company, and the past 4 years and I have been crushing it, I have won awards for my projects, built relationships with C-Suite to front desk staff, and I work in a coveted industry with a lot of visibility. I’ve had a few slips and mistakes along the way but this last year in particular was my best.

I had an annual review with my boss, and for the first time opened up to him about where I see myself in 10 years, and asked him what it looks like to go from my current role, to my dream role (this was my thoughtful introduction to asking for a promotion) instead of telling me what I need to do to get there at my company, he begins to describe to me how to know the right job when I see it, how I’ll know what company fits my goals and how he will support me when I outgrow the place I’m in. I was…wait…WHAT?? Lmfao. I didn’t mention working somewhere else, I was referring to my current company, to which he replied, that realistically he doesn’t know if I can grow to that level here due to our company’s current structure and if I did it would take a long time. He has been there 15 years.

I was soooooo let down, like completely deflated, despite that I still did my planned Segway of asking if he would help me get promoted this upcoming cycle, to which he said he would support me. But I can’t help but think is it all for nothing if he doesn’t see me growing here long term, there have been several instances of roles being created across our company to accommodate talent and value, and I think it’s possible but it seems bleak without the support of a manager who doesn’t believe it’s possible. Not to mention that I’m already grossly underpaid, AND he said the promotion would add to my workload since we don’t have the headcount to replace my role if I’m promoted.

*sigh* with the job market the way it currently is I’m afraid to try and make a move this year, but I fear I’m also selling myself short where I am. What should my immediate next steps be, and what should I plan to do in the coming year?

1kx6bmf,Torn between PA & Marketing - What do I go into?,"Hi everyone, l'm a high school senior currently planning for college and I'm torn between two very different paths. I'd love input from anyone who has experience in either field.

OPTION 1: PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT (PA)
• I really like the job itself: working with patients, helping people feel confident and healthy, having direct impact.
• I like the idea of working in dermatology or women's health as a PA. BUT... I struggle with science courses (didn't enjoy AP Chem or Bio), and I'm scared of the intense prerequisites and PA school itself. Most of my friends are pre-health as well and I'm worried l'll regret not going into medicine.

OPTION 2: MARKETING / BRANDING
• I'm very creative and love branding, fashion, skincare, social media, and storytelling.
• I can see myself working for a beauty brand, building my own company, or doing brand strategy. 
- BUT... I'm scared of the instability, low starting salaries, and the pressure of needing to ""make it big"" on my own. I also worry about disappointing my immigrant parents who value traditional career paths.

Some personal context:
- I'm attending Stony Brook for now but hoping to transfer. (If i stick with PA, I'm not transferring) 
- My dream is to be successful, financially secure, have time for family, travel often, and attend social events (confident, connected, luxurious lifestyle).
- I'm extroverted, people-oriented, and hate isolating or super technical work I love working with others and expressing myself creatively.

Would love to hear from:
• Anyone who's become a PA and has thoughts on the schooling vs the career
• Marketers who feel stable and happy in their careers
• Anyone who has made a switch between these paths

So I moved to France a few months ago for my studies, super excited to explore the luxury/premium marketing space. I’ve got past experience in eco conscious branding, content, logistics, etc., and I thought finding an internship would be tough but doable.  
Well… it’s been way harder than I expected!!!!!

Most of the roles I’m applying to are in branding, marketing ideally international facing stuff, where English works and cultural diversity is seen as a plus. But a lot of them ask for fluent French, even if the job itself is global. And then there’s the visa uncertainty, slow replies, or no replies at all.

There are days I feel like I’m doing everything I can tailoring every cover letter, networking on LinkedIn, prepping for interviews and still nothing clicks. Rejections sting, but what hits harder is the silence.

Still, I’m not giving up. I’ve learned a lot about how to tell my story better, how to deal with uncertainty, and how to keep showing up even when it’s exhausting.

1kx3w93,"Is Computer Eng. still worthy to study, or should I just change degree? [19M]","Hi everyone,

I’m a 1st-year Computer Engineering and Automation student in Italy, top of my class, but lately, I’m losing motivation. I’m seeing a lot of talk about AI replacing software engineers, and I’m unsure about the future of the field. I don’t have anyone in tech to talk to, so I’m hoping to get some advice here.

When I applied to university, I was torn between Software Engineering and Medicine. I love both fields, but in the end, I chose SWE because:

• The study path seemed less intense, giving me more free time to build a family.
• I wanted a well-paid, remote job (2,000–2,500€ net/month) so I can live back in Eastern Europe
• Doctors in my country earn around 1,500€/month even with specialization (public sector), so I’d only consider practicing in countries like Germany or Switzerland.
• I saw that senior SWE roles (like at FAANG) can pay really well in Europe (according to sites like levels.fyi), and that made the decision feel financially safer and more flexible.

But now I’m unsure if I made the right choice. I’m worried about AI taking over development jobs and the struggle older engineers face in finding roles. I’m still passionate about tech, but I also wonder if I should switch into medicine, even with the long journey it requires.

Any thoughts or personal experience would be really appreciated !

1kx3uc1,In-person contract job makes us feel like prisoners or children when management constantly scolds us and scares us,"A new in person 8-5 job makes us feel like prisoners or children with the way they scold us and scare us for every little thing. They told us we can’t hold the door open for coworkers, we can’t be slightly late and need to be on the dot, we can’t leave the room to take breaks or use the restroom for too long, no PTO or sick days, no talking to coworkers while working or asking coworkers for help, the list goes on. Coworkers come in sick and coughing the whole time since we can’t take sick days without a doctor’s note and have not accrued any sick time yet. The ones who worked for the company also said how strict they are and how management talks to each other, so even having a doctor’s note to take a sick day looks bad. One of them said they had to come into work sick and then got sent home by their manager. We only have short 15 min and 30 min lunch breaks that are timed to the exact minute which also makes it hard to schedule doctor’s appointments and interviews. Anyone experience this before?

Cons:
Roles are constantly changing
Sink-or-swim, no training

No guaranteed increase or bonus yet

I received a job offer for a similar role at Company B. 

Pros: 
The initial pay is at par with my current salary, with a planned increase after three months and additional bonuses. 
Specializing in one service, so they seem to have good and effective systems in place 

Cons:
Not sure about company culture
Only offers one service, no diversity

I'm currently employed at a well-established American MNC in India, earning approximately ₹22 LPA CTC  \[$25,780 USD\]

I've received an offer from a US-based startup \[ Series B\] for a role that entails:

Base Salary: $20K USD \[17 LPA INR\]

Performance Bonus: 40 % max.

Equity: None

Work Schedule: Rigorous 6 day work, high ownership

Theyve indicated before a budget of up to $40K USD for this position.

Considering the increased workload, absence of equity, I'm contemplating negotiating for a higher base salary or a combination of base and sign-on bonus.

Questions:

What would be a reasonable salary to request in this scenario?

Would proposing a $50K base salary be appropriate, or should I consider a mix of base salary and sign-on bonus?

Are there other compensation structures I should consider given the lack of equity and extended work hours?

1kwwrj5,Termination advice,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share something I've been going through and ask for some advice. A couple of weeks ago, I was terminated during the trial training period at a healthcare clinic. The reason given was that I wasn't making enough progress, but it was also acknowledged that the issue stemmed from a lack of proper training rather than my performance.
Later, I learned from other former coworkers that the real reason may have been related to budget cuts, as the clinic relies on state funding. While this makes the situation more understandable, it's still disheartening to have a termination on my record—especially when it wasn't due to my skills or work ethic.
It's been two weeks since I started applying for other positions, but I haven’t received any responses yet. I’m beginning to worry that the termination might be affecting my chances, and it’s been tough staying optimistic.
If anyone has been in a similar situation or has advice on how to move forward—especially with addressing this in applications or interviews—I’d really appreciate your insight.

Despite my progress, I’m finding it difficult to land professional opportunities. Some people are suggesting that I pause my current degree and enroll in a new bachelor's program at another college, taking the full four years, especially since I have a good scholarship offer. The idea is that I’d build more connections, get more traditional experience, and give myself time to mature — but honestly, it feels like hitting ""restart,"" and that’s disappointing after how hard I’ve pushed myself.

I’ve thought about doing personal projects with what I’ve learned so far, but I realized that without a following or network, they’re unlikely to lead anywhere significant right away. I considered starting a YouTube channel to build a presence, but I’m unsure what direction would actually work or be worth my time.

The conversation was mostly about timesheet utilization, they were less concerned on billing and more than people are submitting their sheets, working on projects, not over bearing certain people, keeping people happy, vacations etc. with expectation and time lines etc. 

I'm comfortable managing people (about 18 years military experience) but what I don't like is typically if I see a gap in things I step in and accomplish that work. Where the work is specialized and of the 12 people there might be 2 people of each specialty, I can't possibly know all of it, and I guess it would be striking a balance between them. It also seems like a complete train wreck if they lose someone.  

Anyone managing a small engineering firm? Anyone experience managing a team that you're not familiar on the process? Advice?

1kwuz6n,Should I quit?- Ethical dilemma,"CONTEXT: I have worked in the Facilities industry for a long time, almost 10 years. I am familiar with the industry standards & common practices. Occasionally, there are moments in this industry when contractors (plumbers, HVAC, electrical, etc....) and the companies that hire them get into disputes and contractors do no get paid for their services for a number of reasons. Sometimes it goes to court, most times it gets paid late.

The company I have worked at for the last 2 years, is the WORST company I have ever worked for, when it comes to paying their contractors. After my first year, I highlighted issues with payments multiple times in leadership meanings. Many times, I even stopped ""doing"" my job due to no payments being sent to my contractors for work that was already completed.

My department is performing well, the best it has. Across 200+ international locations we have held under 400 facility tickets across all our portfolios. However, we are right back where we started 2 years ago. The department has nearly $100,000 outstanding debt that grows everyday with no updates from our accounting team and my ability to do my job is dwindling. Not to mention my self-esteem.

It is starting to weigh heavily on me that if I quit, the contractors we work with wont get their payments. I hate being in the position when I call business owners for work knowing that it will be a 50/50 chance they actually get paid. It makes me sick. 

I fear that if I leave this company, it will be hard for me to work elsewhere. The network of contractors I have grown over the last 2 years would be irate and most likely refuse to work with me down the road. 

Essentially, I feel like I am ruining my name in the industry by staying here longer. Plus I absolutely hate this feeling of not getting people paid what was agreed.

1kwu9b5,Advice/Career Suggestions,"Hello everyone, I'm 25M and I feel like I've hit a roadblock for my current career. My original plan was to apply to PhD schools and I tried this last application cycle and unfortunately due to due to the nationwide budget cuts majority of the programs I applied to (computational neuroscience/systems neuroscience) were no longer able to accept students or programs I got into had to rescind their acceptance. 

I've been working in non-invasive brain stimulation for 2.5 years post-undergrad as a clinical researcher in a lab at a hospital. I've made it to be the most senior researcher in my lab and I feel like I can't transition into anything remotely similar without taking a major pay cut or not being qualified in the slightest due to how specific my skillsets are. I've worked with neuroimaging modalities, MATLAB/python library assisted data analysis (more sufficient than very proficient but very code literate), worked with IRB (internal review board) amendments/initial submissions, worked on about 6-7 projects, recruitment/patient scheduling, and running research visits. I've got about 1200 hours of operating non-invasive brain stimulation devices and associated software/hardware. I've gotten the most I can out of my lab at this point but don't have an opportunity to leave without being unemployed for a great period of time applying for other jobs.

Despite all the work I've done, I haven't been able to publish anything to my name due to the length of time these projects are. They've lasted anywhere from 2-10 years each and won't publish anything really anytime soon. I haven't even been given the opportunity to do a poster presentation due to the amount of time I've needed to dedicate to collecting our data in our sessions and training all the other staff.

I don't know what I can do or what I can turn to for a career change. I've looked into project management though I haven't found any jobs that align with what I've been doing and thought about going into sales but every sales job I see requires minimum 2-5 years of experience for a beginner/intro position. I feel lost/stuck where I'm at. The academia route is deteriorating faster every day so I can't see myself able to get in this next round of applications based on how much more difficult it'll be to get into a program. Plus I've been able to get debt free recently so I'm hesitant to start a masters to only go back into debt again.

If anybody has faced anything similar or has any advice for what careers may be good for me or what I can turn towards to start again I'm all ears.

1kwtvas,Is a CAPM certification a smart way out of a dead-end comms job?,"I’m 26 with a degree in Communications, currently working in local government. My career so far has been… fine — steady, but I’ve hit a ceiling. I’m in a niche role with no clear next step or promotion path, and I’ve started to feel stuck.

Lately, I’ve been questioning whether my degree has really positioned me for the kind of financial stability I want. Most of the jobs I see in communications are low-paying, and while I know salary isn’t everything, it’s hard to ignore in today’s economy.

I’m considering going back to school to earn an MBA with a focus in finance, but I also need a job in the meantime that can help me both afford that goal and move me forward. After some reflection (and a long rant to ChatGPT), project management came up as a strong next step — especially since I already coordinate a lot of projects, events, and stakeholders in my current role.

I’m looking into getting my CAPM certification to break into project management.

1kwtsci,Trying to figure out my future in the field of Education...,"I am between a few different paths and I am unsure what route to take. In a sense, I feel quite lucky to have multiple options but I am scared of choosing the wrong thing.

I have two degrees, a Bachelor of Arts (4 years, Human Rights Specialization), and a Bachelor of Education. I have also taken a few extra qualifications courses so I am a certified teacher by the place I live, with the ability to teach all grades (K-12).

When I first finished my Education degree, I only had experience from my school placements and supply teaching a bit in May/June each year of my program (2 years). Very minimal teaching experience. I was worried about not liking it because I did not enjoy my placements, so I took the first job I was offered out of university as an admin assistant at a university over continuing supply teaching. It is completely remote, so I figured it offers me flexibility, a chance to learn something new, and a potential career shift. 

I am nearing the end of my year contract, and my job wants to keep me as permanent ideally afterwards. The issue is, I don't feel like I really want to continue this and I want to give teaching another chance. I have been hired back onto the supply teacher roster, and am looking forward to going back ""out into the world"" and pushing myself. I was hoping to take some more extra qualification courses, and I was even accepted into a Masters program for September (though I am heavily considering whether I am ready for that right now). 

I feel like I have 3 great opportunities in front of me and I don't know which routes to take. 

If I stay at my job another year as admin, I can work remote and maybe find ways to bring more balance to my life (something I have struggled with this year, as I don't think remote work is really best for me). But, I will also have benefits. I am somewhat still unsatisfied with this choice. My pay would be around $53K and I would work M-F. If I continue this job next year, I will likely also get a weekend job to supplement my income a bit. I am wondering if I am having a grass-is-greener complex and am a bit worried I will regret leaving my job, though I feel less ""alive"" in this role than in past jobs. I don't feel a ton of growth in myself, or in my ability to move up within my position. The biggest thing that is giving me anxiety about leaving is I really love my tiny team (3 of us) and they would probably be upset at me leaving.

If I move into supply teaching, I have much more flexibility of scheduling. I would still likely take on another job, but I would make about 50K by working most days of the year. Then I have the ability to take employment insurance over the summer or otherwise get a second job/continue with the second job I have. Since I want to pay off my student debts quickly, this option also feels like it gives me more ability to ""hustle"". As well as more flexibility for travel (another personal goal). I would also like to give teaching another chance and think about it often.

If I decide to do a Master's degree, I would also likely choose supply teaching as it gives me much for flexibility in scheduling. While the program is online, I will require time for schoolwork and being on my laptop that often might drive me insane.

I would love outside opinions on how I should navigate this. I am struggling and probably overly-catastrophizing this. But I think hearing others take would give me a clearer path.

Thank you!

TLDR: 

I'm torn between three paths: staying in my remote admin job, returning to supply teaching, or starting a Master’s program (while supply teaching). I have two degrees (BA in Human Rights + BEd) and I’m a certified K-12 teacher. I took a remote admin role after graduation due to doubts about teaching, but now I feel unfulfilled in that job—even though it's stable, offers benefits, and has a supportive team.

I’m considering giving teaching another try and have rejoined the supply list, as it offers more flexibility, potential income through extra work, and aligns with goals like traveling and paying off debt. I’ve also been accepted into a Master’s program, which could complement supply teaching but adds pressure.

I feel lucky to have options but scared of making the wrong choice. I’d appreciate outside perspectives to help me decide.",SnooPies2212,2,1.0,4,1748368104,2025-05-27 17:48:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kwtsci/trying_to_figure_out_my_future_in_the_field_of/,5,2025

1kwt6km,Becoming a Doctor is all i’ve ever dreamed of but…,"I (21F) am not sure if I truly want it. My entire life i’ve always wanted to go into medical school especially given the healthcare disparities between African American women and their non black counterparts. My family has been affected personally by racial inequities in healthcare, specially when it comes to women’s health and it’s always been my driving factor to become a part of the 5% of physicians. I’m currently entering my senior year as a biomedical engineering student and am planning to get my masters in BME after graduating. I feel like I don’t know what i’m doing anymore! Every two months I wake up with a career aspiration but if you asked me, my “dream career” is to be working in the C-suite in healthcare and making advancements through medical technology and pharmaceutical research. 

I have passion for cancer and maternal health research; but I have no interest in completing a PhD as I do not want to work in academia . I have clinical hours but i’m no where near the amount necessary to apply, and I have 11 credits of pre med prerequisites left to apply to medical school. I’m unsure if I want to dedicate the next 11 years of my life to medical training (I know it’s 8 with medical school + residency but I have to factor in the additional time it’ll take for my masters, completing the remaining pre reqs, gaining clinical hours, AND studying for the MCAT). I had a revolution before my senior year and thought, maybe I could be an attorney and leverage my biomedical engineering experience to work in health law or up law. I took a practice LSAT and though it didn’t discourage me, it made me realize that law school in itself may not stimulate me enough as I love science!! 

I hoped to become an OB/GYN for years but I quickly realized I do not want to go into a surgical speciality. I want a career that is recession proof and will allow me to make mid six figures well into my 30s. I have considered many other avenues to become a Doctor, such as dental school,  optometry, podiatry, and pharmacy but I’m just not sure about those either. For pharmacy school, around 60% of the jobs are retail and I do not want to work in that type of setting. I love the idea of optometry school but it seems that the debt I would go into doesn’t really look the best for the salary I would receive. As for podiatry and dental school, nothing is really wrong with either of them but I haven’t peaked any interest in the idea of working on feet or the mouth. 

I’m looking for something fulfilling with good pay and a great ROI. Many people have told me to stay in engineering but most engineers are not touching the physician salary of $250,000-$400,000 without being years into their career, and even at that, it’s typically people who have gone into one of the more practical engineering specialities like Mechanical, Electrical, or Civil. 

I know I want to advance my education and WILL be getting my masters, I’ve always wanted my doctorate too and am just feeling completely discouraged. Referring to myself as a future attorney doesn’t feel right as I’ve never been super passionate about gaining a formal legal education (JD). I know passion doesn’t pay the bills, but it would be nice to get a general idea of what suits me. I also have an extremely entrepreneurial mindset and have flourished in sales and marketing internships in undergrad but I was advised not to pursue and MBA until after I’ve gained some work experience. I am planning to shadow both dentists and physicians in my hometown this summer to further my perspective.

I am 28M currently making 210k annually in a B2B SaaS field sales role. Five months in and I absolutely hate it. Preparation for tailored presentations; useless internal meetings; constant deal follow-ups with leadership; easing frustrated customers; networking with partners... I dislike meeting customers face-to-face. I'm not an outgoing person by nature so all this socializing is draining my social battery.

I wanted to try something new and the offer was super enticing so I accepted this job, but now I regret it. The only thing keeping me going is the money.

I used to be in a remote technical role at the same employer making around 110k, but I was much happier with less stress. It was an easy 9-5 where I could disconnect from work without worry, but now I work 8-7 while constantly stressing about the job.

1kwspw6,Need advice for DMS,"Need advice: Should I join DMS IIT Delhi?

Hello I'm female 26 years old having 4 years of experience as full stack java developer.

My CCTC is 6LPA. 
But I have received an offer from a different company for 13LPA.
I recently converted DMS IIT Delhi as well.
Should I join DMS IIT Delhi?
Things that I have been thinking about 
Pros:
I will get a MBA tag from a premier institution which will help me in my career
I know MBA Salaries are inflated but I guess I might get 18-20 LPA fixed post MBA
Cons:
I'm thinking that maybe my 4 years of experience as a developer would be lost and I would start afresh.
If I go for MBA now, I will pay 12 lakhs fees and also will not earn for 2 years (13*2=26) .. so I would be losing around 38 lakhs
I might be able to maybe switch and earn a comparable salary( I'm thinking I will get paid a lot in future even if I don't go for MBA: I have seen other software developers earning a lot )

1kwsac0,The Evolving Job Market – How to navigate?,"I'm seeing a lot of posts from those who are blindly choosing career paths without understanding the current landscape. Here is some genuine advice.

Let me be blunt: if you're considering *any* career solely for the paycheck, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. This is 2025, not the time before 2022. The job market is unforgiving, especially for those without genuine interest or aptitude. Chasing popular fields like headless chickens won't cut it anymore.

What you learned in school is often foundational, but the real world demands more. The job market has fundamentally shifted. The skills and knowledge that guaranteed success even a few years ago are rapidly becoming outdated. Just getting a degree from a top-tier college is no longer a golden ticket.

I have worked on this project for weeks now, to solve this exact problem, it's not perfect but still lot better than the outdated guides and roadmaps, https://careeroadmap.com , it different from GPT prompt as it continuously updated itself, sends notification about events that's important and relevant to your field, be it scholarships, competitions , etc. Often it's not someone who works harder and is more skilled that gets ahead, it the one who had better access.

The aim is navigate the noise and fog surrounding future. It's free, try it, might help.",golden_iris07,2,1.0,1,1748364643,2025-05-27 16:50:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kwsac0/the_evolving_job_market_how_to_navigate/,5,2025

1kws6nt,Possibly Quitting a Role at a Small Business...Advice Please,"I'm reaching out because I could really use some advice on how to leave my job and manage the anxiety that’s come with it.

I’ve been working from home at a small, family-owned business for four years. It’s owned by a couple, and I originally got the job through the husband, we have been friends for 9 years. I knew there could be challenges with working for friends, but things were manageable until about eight months ago.

Their personal issues have started spilling into the workplace. They often argue, give me conflicting instructions, and put me in the middle of their disagreements, yelling at each other on work calls. While I technically have PTO (only type of benefit I have), I can rarely use it. I have to request time off at least a month in advance, and even then, they check in the week of to ask if I ""really"" still need the day off. They are offline/unavailable and are out of town often, and leave me to handle the business alone. If I reach out with questions while they’re away, they act annoyed or angry, even though they’ve said I should call if anything comes up.

I’m essentially running the business when they’re gone, managing contractors, clients, and daily operations, all while trying to keep the peace and completely dread calling them if something comes up, to the point I get nauseous. It’s extremely stressful. On top of that, I’ve been yelled at and hung up on for simply asking clarifying questions during chaotic phone calls. Then afterward, I’m told they’re struggling with their mental health, and to be understanding. I am empathetic, but I’ve never been spoken to this way by a friend, let alone an employer, and I’ve realized I don’t deserve this treatment. Something is always blamed for their outbursts, and it's never truly ""their fault.""

I recently started job hunting and found a promising opportunity. I’m in the final stages of the process, have negotiated the salary, and expect to hear back today. The pay is a bit lower than what I currently make, but the benefits, a healthier work environment, and in-person structure feel worth it. My current remote role never gave me the flexibility or freedom typically associated with WFH. I was micromanaged, discouraged from ever leaving the house, and constantly having unpredictable calls that could last 10 minutes or 2.5 hours. One singular time I left, they called while I ran up to the gas station by my house to get a soda. I didn't answer the first phone call, and they called a second time not even a minute later, and then questioned why I wasn’t at my desk because they could hear other background noise going on.

I’ve been carrying the emotional burden of their personal problems both individually and maritally, managing business tasks without support, and watching them take nice vacations where they're gone for long periods of time, then I am left in the thick of the stress to deal with their business. If things were handled better when they went on the trips, it wouldn't be horrible when they were out of town. However, even when they're in town, they are frequently not readily available online, either. Anytime I’ve tried to express concerns, it’s been brushed off with promises to “communicate better” or with explanations about their mental health struggles. Meanwhile, I’m never really allowed to express how this affects me.

You probably have a sense of what kind of situation this is. My biggest source of anxiety now is how to break the news if I accept the new offer. I don’t want to completely ignore the friendship I’ve had with the husband, but I also can’t keep tolerating this. I’m thinking of framing it around needing a change for personal and mental health reasons, which is 100% true, and saying that working from home is no longer sustainable for me.

They are not the kind of people who take feedback well. The wife tends to make everything about her and gets defensive, and she’ll ultimately have to absorb my responsibilities when I leave. I feel responsible for how this will affect them and their business, but I also know I can’t keep putting myself last and their business operations at the end of the day are not my personal responsibility to take care of.

I plan to give two weeks' notice, assuming things don’t get hostile or I don't get terrorized. I just need help figuring out how to say it in a way that’s still somewhat empathic because that's who I am, but being firm, and in a way that is ready, because they will 100% say this is horrific timing for them.

Thanks so much for reading my post. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",Impressive_Couple182,2,1.0,2,1748364407,2025-05-27 16:46:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kws6nt/possibly_quitting_a_role_at_a_small/,5,2025

1kwr7ve,"I messed up, didn’t I?","

I need advice.  I think I messed up with my education.

All throughout my childhood, my teachers and family all beat it into my head that to make something of myself, I needed a college degree.  Without a college degree I wouldn’t be able to get a good paying job and I’d live my life just scraping by.

I was told how important it was to get a degree in whatever it is I wanted to be when I grew up and that it would come to my in high school like an epiphany.

Well, that epiphany never came.  And true to form I was stuck working part time in a hardware store after high school before I decided to take my shot at being an attorney at age 23.

I went to college and got an Associate’s of Applied Science in Criminal Justice and an Associate of Arts majoring in History.  I worked hard to get both simultaneously.

The Judge I interned under said NOT to go into political science as that would put me on a narrow path, and if law didn’t pan out, then I’d be employably stranded.  He suggested I do either History or English as History would teach me all the research I’d have to do, and English would teach me how to write.

So, I double majored in both for my Bachelor of Arts.  Then a grim reality set in.  I really should have looked into this before I’d even started my journey.  Law school was completely unaffordable to me.  There was no way I could’ve done it at that time.

I went back to that Judge and asked, “now what?”  He suggested I be a paralegal instead.  He revealed most attorneys when starting out struggle for the first few years, and that nobody becomes an attorney because they love the law.  They do it for the money, but that money isn’t there anymore like it used to be (in 2012).  So, I did one final year of college and earned a paralegal certificate.  

The thing is; being a paralegal was not a lucrative option.  I was a paralegal for 8 years and I was just scraping by.  It was embarrassing.  Worse yet; it was exactly what I feared.  People I knew with no college degree were doing infinitely better financially than I was.  I felt like college was a scam and I’d been bamboozled.

I’ve since moved on to being a Court Attendant.  It’s only marginally better than the paralegal gig.  The pay is the same but now I get state benefits and insurance.

I’m tired of scraping by.  I’m tired of being the poorest guy at the table.  After getting my courtroom set up for trial, I hate looking around the room and being the poorest employee in attendance between the attorneys, the judge, the bailiff, and even the court reporter.  Hell, probably even half or all of my jurors.  I want to be able to afford to go do fun things without worrying about how deep in the hole I’ll be afterwards.

What can I do with a Bachelor’s in History/English if I can’t move on to law school?  Did I screw up?  I’m 40 now and I feel like I’m just spinning my tires in the mud.  I feel the same as I did when I moved out of my parents’.  It seems like when I was younger, everybody the  age I am now had it all figured out.  It seems like everyone around me today, my age and even younger, has it all figured out.  I don’t know what to do, where I went wrong, or how to fix it.

Please help.  Is there any career out there my education qualifies me for, or is this it?",Need_2Vent,2,1.0,3,1748362132,2025-05-27 16:08:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kwr7ve/i_messed_up_didnt_i/,5,2025
1kwqyws,"Company I’ve been working at FT for a year wanted me to stay long-term, but doesn’t pay living wage for area. Advice?","I was hired at my current hybrid role a year ago. The job itself is fine (Administrative/Logistics Coordinator is the best way I’d describe it generically — I send a shitton of emails and put together school visiting evaluation teams together based on needed criteria) and I am a top performer on my team. Benefits are great. Coworkers are fine. The trouble is, we are required to go into the office at least 2x per week (this is in the job description) in a high CoL state (Massachusetts), which severely limits where I could live cost-wise, and even with an 800/mo apartment with housemates in the area where the office is located and a contribution of only 5% per paycheck to my retirement plan, I’m struggling. I can pay my bills and feed myself and my dog, but even with my car paid off, I’m still having a hard time saving even a few hundred dollars a month due to how much everything besides my base rent costs. I’ve been budgeting, I don’t spend crazy money on shit I don’t need and use, and this is still not easy.

  
I want to stay, because I know I likely won’t find better for all the non-pay factors at play (number of hours is a huge one at 35 hours per week, however given how the org is as an NPO we CANNOT work overtime)… but my pay is about ten percent lower than I’d like it to be, particularly given recent CoL increases the last year.

  
Any advice on making a case for a salary increase? Am I nuts to even try? I’m very new to this at age 27 but I have heard that it’s best to stick to performance/quantitative indicators when making a case for this kind of thing. And I feel like I am missing out on better compensation for not trying. I have one area I could be stricter about budgeting on, and that might help me save 100-300 more a month is nothing unexpected happens, but that’s the only thing I can think of that might help me save more.

1kwqkbn,Should I try to build a Data department in my company?,"To give a little backgound: I'm 29M, with degrees in CS and Statistics. I worked on a certain ""Big Blue"" as a Mainframe Analyst for five years. Then, I switched to my current company and was a Systems Analyst for four years. Last year, I moved into a Data Analyst spot under the Marketing manager. Since 2019, my primary focus of study has been data, particularly Machine Learning. I have experience with personal Data Science projects and feel confident tackling most regular and deep learning challenges. The company I work for is a medium to large-sized tech sales organization with a significant market presence in my country.

When I made the switch last year, I really wanted to help build up the data culture here. My agreement to move included the hiring of an additional person to handle daily operational tasks, allowing me to focus on data development (as I am the sole data analyst). But, thanks to some upper management issues, that never happened, and I was just about to start looking for another job. Then, yesterday, my manager calls me up and says he's leaving and that I'll be reporting to the IT manager again (who was my old boss).

Here's the situation: the IT manager is the best manager I've ever had. He's understanding, hardworking, and has always trusted my judgment. My move last year was solely to be closer to a data-focused role. Today, he called me, and we chatted about what's next for the data team. He said he wants me to do more coordinating than day-to-day tasks and that we'll get someone else for the operational stuff soon.

Has anyone here had a similar experience building this kind of department? If there are any tech or data managers reading this, how would you approach starting this initiative?

This job has been both super nice for me and apocalyptically difficult. On one hand, it's remote and pays very well, so I've been able to complete some life milestones while employed here, that I couldn't before. On the other, the work is sporadic, I often go weeks with nothing to do, only to have days where I must do a million things. I feel like I don't have the discipline to keep up with it. I get lazy on the off days and can't seem to conjure the energy or experience to complete the busy days to the best of my ability. 

  I do not feel as though I know what I'm doing. I rarely find edits to change in my projects and no one checks behind me really so I don't get feedback. I had a few projects early on that my boss shadowed, and she mostly just pointed a few new things out to me. She's always available even now for questions, but most of the time I don't even know what to ask.

  I spend the stretches with no work cleaning, reading, playing video games or meal prepping, most days. I feel guilty for this but I've had coworkers say they a lot of the same things. I think they study our training more though, and ask more questions. They also have a lot more experience.

   Lately, the job has been eating me alive. I feel lazy and unskilled, like I'm not performing well and my contract won't be renewed. I have had very little hours to log, due to how infrequently I get assignments, and when I do have them, I struggle to log them correctly or even remember to log them at all, because again, I so rarely need to do these tasks that I haven't been well versed yet. I haven't gotten much feedback in a while, mostly just my boss reminding me to log hours properly sometimes. I've looked at similar jobs nearby that I could do instead, and they all pay half of what I make now. I don't think I could afford my apartment on that for very long. 

  I don't know what to do. I'm newly living on my own, in a new city, and I don't know what I'm good at or how to maintain what I have. I'm not sure this even makes sense. Should I hone my skills in this/ something else? Try to make the job work, even though I've already set myself so far behind? I'm truly lost. I have a few untreated mental disorders that are making this especially difficult to keep track of and I'm incredibly overwhelmed. Before this job I had massive stretches of unemployment and I'm worried I'll hit one again, this time with rent to pay.

I have just given my inter exam (high school in USA) and still not clear about what to persue in uni. I am not going to some prestige uni but just a regular one in my town.
I have a dilemma about comp science or ai or comp engineering or cyb. Security.
Now, first of all, I have selected cyb sec. As a choice for bs bcz it just sounds cool. Nothing else. However I have been told it's too specific field.

Now for CS, everyone recommends it but I see everyone going into this field. It is becoming quite saturated. Furthermore, many C's grads I know are jobless even some on international level due to impact of automation. So there's that.

I personally like AI bcz it's more like CS but a little more specific rather than too generic and it's also not that much saturated, so, job chances are a little higher. But still I cannot decide it it's the right one. What if it's too specific and I cannot get a job in future.

Last one is computer engineering. I don't like engineering field but I feel CE has an edge over all above mentioned fields. It's hardware plus software. It's not saturated and according to my research, I can opt for masters in all the fields that anyone can go for masters in, if they are from CS background.

The last one I enjoyed, but just got laid off, and now I’m just…. directionless. 4 jobs in 6 years isn’t a great look for starters, even with 2 of them being layoffs. Then there’s the fact that my resume doesn’t have any clear direction. I come from a pretty low income background, the kid of a labor worker and SAHM. I have never learned where to go from somewhere like here, I just feel lost. 

I know the aspects of my previous jobs I loved the most always took place in the organizational and data sides of things, but that’s also vague as hell. 

Sorry for the rambling, but does anyone possibly have any sort of advice? Do I go back to school? Do an IT boot camp? Pay someone to make my resume look more actually marketable? For context, I’m currently living in the US, more specifically the Midwest. Thank you in advance.

1kwncsw,Title: Toxic Management Broke Me,"
Hey redditors, I need to get this off my chest. I worked in a start-up in customer success team. But not want to change field into analytics to escape this nightmare. I’d love to hear your thoughts, similar experiences, or tips for my career pivot.

The company had a “Lala company” vibe—autocratic, chaotic, and completely unsupportive. I managed multiple clients daily, working long hours, but my efforts were never recognized, only my mistakes. I felt unappreciated and constantly on edge.

One day, right after lunch, my manager blindsided me by asking about a major client’s info. I panicked, my heart racing, and I gave an off number. My manager berated me, saying I should’ve known from daily reports, then took me downstairs to reprimand me. I felt humiliated and small as he threatened to reassign my accounts to a new hire and emailed leadership about my performance. The shame lingered for days.
Another time, I was blamed for a technical issue I couldn’t fix without training and ops team help, plus was being told not to contact the client since he was in touch for it. However days passed and I got reprimanded by my manager as he used a math problem analogy to describe that situation that it was a simple word problem solution mindset you could have followed and fixed this issue by taking everyone on a common call —impossible! I felt helpless and frustrated, like I was set up to fail. 

Expectations were contradictory: I’d be told to focus on one task, then criticized for not doing another. I felt confused and lost, never knowing what was actually expected. Once, he’d accuse me of ignoring him if I didn’t reply instantly—I was swamped!—but he took 10 days to respond to my probation inquiry. I felt angry at the double standards, like my time didn’t matter.
My probation was a mess too. I’d clarified it was 6 months, but in the last 3 days of month 3, he extended it, saying he had “no confidence” in me. I felt betrayed and anxious—he’d misunderstood the timeline, yet I was blamed. By month 6’s end, I heard nothing, so I texted him in month 7 while he was on leave. His 10-day delayed reply left me in limbo, feeling ignored and worthless.

 Variable pay was another blow: I wasn’t paid for Q1, and when I asked, he had me submit numbers, then lowered my rating without telling me, slashing my pay. I felt cheated and devalued, like my hard work meant nothing.
Client meetings were a nightmare too. My manager never took me to in-person meetings, yet expected me to go alone, saying, “I haven’t stopped you.” I had no idea how to lead conversations and felt clueless and scared, dreading every interaction. 

The constant termination threats and lack of coaching made me feel like I was walking on eggshells, always fearing I’d lose my job.
I couldn’t take it anymore. After he didn’t clear my probation the next day, I wrote a resignation email, citing different reasons to avoid conflict as you must be aware the magnitude of influence these people have on HR. I felt defeated but relieved to leave. They gave me an early exit, but in my FnF, they didn’t fully cover my 2-month notice period, which felt like a final slap in the face—shortchanged after all I’d endured.
This role numbed me—I’m done with client-facing jobs. I’m now learning SQL and Tableau to break into data analytics, where I can focus on numbers and avoid toxic managers. Has anyone else dealt with this kind of management? How did you cope? Also, any tips for transitioning to data analytics? Thanks for listening—I really needed to share this.",Ind-Wisher,3,1.0,1,1748352732,2025-05-27 13:32:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kwncsw/title_toxic_management_broke_me/,5,2025
1kwmy3q,I need your advice - Software Engineer,"Hello fellow redditors,

i'm a bit lost , and i would really appreciate your advice.  
I am a software engineer, with almost 7 years of experience, currently working in a bank - software engineering departement ( europe - france ) ,a 9-5 job with only one day for remote work.

the pay is not that good, the tech stack is pretty normal, the routine and the projects are soo boring, i feel like i am wasting my life here even tho it's been only a year working for this company and i always felt the same in the previous experiences (except for one when the projects were interesting).  


I always feel like there is something missing, i can code, i can solve problems, i can create things , but knowing that there is no future here makes me lazy ( sometimes i write a couple of lines of code in a whole week knowing that i have tasks to finish and all i do is watch youtube videos).

I feel like i can do more, but i don't know why i can't , is it the environement ,the company ? the field ? i feel like if i get the right job ( which honestly i don't know what it is ), i will probably do my best to ace it.

i am lost.

1kwm54t,Career Obstruction. Advice?,"I took a pay cut to get a foot in the door at my company. At first it seemed like a good idea. But now, I have seen ample evidence that for all the bluster, this company is actually quite resistant to compensation in all forms (low merit increases, weak bonus structure, low ball offers, unreceptive to departmental transfers, adding job scope without pay).

We have had high turnover, and at this point there are 2/5 on my team, our role has actually changed to formalize after hours work and make us readily available 50% of the time, and we’re getting squeezed to cover the gaps without any time or money compensation to do so. 

I suspect that they may come to the negotiating table due to the potential to lose the whole group, but I’m wondering if it’s even worth sticking around knowing I’ll continue to fight an uphill battle to continue my career at the pace I intend to.

1kwlod1,Should I take a much higher paying job or stay where I am comfortable?,"Hi all

I have a bit of a conundrum and not sure how to proceed

TLDR; happy at my current job but received a much more lucrative one. 

I currently work for a firm in the tech industry that does some defense work but mostly just consumer tech. I’ve been there for about two years and I’m pretty happy in that my bosses are relatively laid back and the workload isn’t terrible, I probably work 5-6 hours of the day on average. However, I do commute about an hour and 15 minutes each way to get there. When I started, it was part time remote, but now they’ve mandated in office 5 days a week. 

I received an offer last week from a large tech defense firm that is only about 10-15 minutes from my house, and it nearly doubles my current salary and allows me to work from home half the time, with every other Friday off. Additionally, the health will be about 1k less of a deductible, though I am young and typically don’t go to the doctor that often. PTO is roughly equal. 

The wrinkle I have is, primarily, that I am planning to go back to school within the next few months, so I’m unsure what is going to be the better choice here. 

Additionally, I had a falling out with my best friend a little over a year ago relating to working for the company I received an offer from on the basis that it is defense work. 

I’m really at an impasse on whether to take the job or not. So what say you Reddit, do I stay where I’m comfortable and know the stress level or do I move onto the lucrative offer?

1kwkvft,Started a new digital marketing trainee job and it feels very dodgy. Should I quit now?,"
Tldr: I started a marketing trainee job in a dodgy little office where he left me to start cold calling people for 7 hours for a cleaning company. It’s been 2 days and I’m thinking of quitting because it seems so dodgy and I haven’t met him since I started the job for an hour. I also hate col calling and I just want to do marketing.

So I started my new trainee sales and marketing job two days ago. I had an interview with the guy at a fancy office that he told me he was renting this office for £400 for 2 hours to do these interviews. He told me everything about the company and it all seemed very dodgy. He told me that there’s 3 people working at the company but I didn’t meet them or see them. 

He then called me two weeks later offering me a job and asked me to work tomorrow so I accepted and we met in starbucks where he explained more about the company and that they don’t have a proper office yet. He then took me to a very dodgy tiny office above a NatWest with about 5 tiny rooms and a toilet and tiny kitchen. all the other rooms were in use where some of them there were people tutoring for GCSEs and the office next to mine was someone blasting Indian music. 

He told me he’s got a client who needs appointments booked for his cleaning company. He told me to start cold calling people on yell.com to try and book in appointments to get a cleaner in to start cleaning restaurants or anything. He did an example call with me and then left for 7 hours in this tiny dodgy little office to start cold calling companies. He called me at 5pm and asked if I had booked any appointments and I said no I haven’t booked anyone but I’ve called over 150 people.

He then told me he’s going to have to start calling people to set an appointment or his client will get mad and then said if I can go home and I did the exact same thing the next day and today working from home and I got 0 appointments. He told me if I don’t get any appointments he’s gonna be in the shit and he needs to start calling people as well. He’s now flown to a different country to a meeting and is asking me to stay on cold calling because he doesn’t want to do it.

He told me this was a digital marketing company and I would be doing marketing and I’ll have to stay on calls for 2 more weeks. I’m supposed to be trained on digital marketing such as SEO and email campaigns. I’m thinking of quitting today as I hate cold calling",jahjah2223,9,1.0,22,1748345356,2025-05-27 11:29:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kwkvft/started_a_new_digital_marketing_trainee_job_and/,5,2025
1kwkihg,"I had a panic attack while deciding between Architecture and CSE — I’m scared, confused, and don’t know what to do","Hi everyone. I’m posting this because I’m stuck and honestly very afraid.

I’m currently an architecture student. I took a semester drop recently because I was extremely overwhelmed and burnt out. I thought I just needed a break — but during that time, I started questioning everything. Whether architecture is even right for me, whether I can keep going, whether I’ll ever feel okay again.

That break was supposed to give me clarity, but instead, I spiraled. I became so consumed by the pressure to choose between staying in architecture or switching to Computer Science and Engineering that I ended up having a severe panic attack. I couldn’t breathe, my chest was tight, my hands went numb, I thought I was going to die. I had to be hospitalized. It was the most horrifying experience of my life, and it made it painfully clear how much this indecision and stress is affecting me. I have also been having thoughts about committing suicide. I have a history of self harming. I feel like a failure.

I should also mention that I struggle a lot with perfectionism: I have to get good grades or else my entire life will fall apart. I was never that good in school, I guess I’m trying to overcorrect as an adult. I’m a good student now but..

I’m now stuck in this place where: •	Architecture feels familiar, and I only have about 2.5 years left. •	But it’s also drained me emotionally, mentally, and physically. I’m scared that if I go back, I’ll crash again. •	On the other hand, switching to CSE feels like a fresh start… but it’s also full of uncertainty. I’m interested in the idea of working with complex, moving systems — but I’m not sure it’s the right choice. I’m scared I won’t be able to keep up or that I’ll just end up lost in a new kind of struggle.

I keep wondering: Am I being weak for not just pushing through? Am I wasting my time if I start over now? Is it too late? And more than anything, I’m terrified of having another panic attack. I don’t ever want to feel that helpless again.

Has anyone else been through something like this? Switching majors late, dealing with mental health crises, choosing between staying in something familiar or starting something new and uncertain? I could really use any advice, encouragement, or even just a reminder that I’m not alone.

1kwjgre,I feel lost and need advice,"Can’t leave home due to war. I write, I love music and specifically video game composers, my interests are cinematography, psychology and philosophy. I also love character design and character sculpting, but I’m not good with drawing so I mostly do it in games, never learned animation programs. I also have perfect english as my second language (I’m Ukrainian so Ukrainian and Russian are auto-included). I have severe back problems and some heart problems preventing me from doing physical work. As much as I am charismatic I can’t make my hands stop shaking irl with social work unfortunately, and online it results in me being very nervous in work calls with clients barely not suffocating from stress. Ironic because everyone loves my voice. Got a laptop. 

Basically, I really need money of course. I always wanted to work in a bar, but my hands shaking prevented me from being hired in all these bars and cafes I tried. I wanted to try teaching english online but all the companies that take you as an online teacher without diploma just seemed scammy so it never happened. I now try to work at a call center and seeing how difficult it is for me compared to other people that feel no anxiety from work calls makes me sad and hopeless. I once wanted to get into cinematography professionally, but again anxiety prevented me from passing the entry-exam in uni. Dropped out of journalism degree because I started to detest the idea of insufferable studying for 3 more years to work a job that lacks any individualism. Now after 2 years of getting a law degree it feels the same, and money’s a problem too. Maybe I could learn tools in future to be a 3d character designer? I think they need to be able to draw though.

1kwj1th,When should I quit my job?,"Hi, grateful for any two cents I can get! 

I started working my first job as a data analyst last year. I’ve not been very happy in this company because, as someone aspiring to work in the data field, we have no connected infrastructure or databases. They want me to manually update and manage a massive excel consolidation of sales data across regions. Not only is it obviously inefficient for obvious reasons, but the excel files I receive monthly can often be inconsistent or incorrect in some ways. There’s a second dashboard I’ve also been tasked with, but that smaller data is also fragmented and needs to be collected and transposed regularly. 

I have a proposal for a technical infrastructure that would solve most if not all of these problems; but I don’t really want to wait over a year to see it get anywhere. 

We also don’t have any data related team. It’s just me floating between departments, going in circles, and copying and pasting. 

I don’t feel like I can grow in a company with such little data infrastructure and no technical team to learn from.

My mental health has also been at an all time low. It’s so bad I’m on full survival mode. It feels like the work I’ve done for over a year here wasn’t technically robust and now I’m very behind as an applicant. I really want to quit especially for the sake of my mental health, and just focus “full time” on building a portfolio of DS/DA projects, but I’ve understood the job market is terrible especially in my field, and going unemployed for a year or years would be a grave mistake. 

But shouldn’t I set a deadline to quit regardless? What’s also the point of working in a company full time where the issues are out weighting the progress of my work?

1kwh5pi,What to do if I feel the new supervisor at my job dislikes me?,"I hope this is the appropriate sub to post this to. Also preemptively apologizing for format issues, I'm typing this in my phone. So for a bit of background, I work in the mental health field doing crisis intervention. I answer calls from 988 and SAMHSA for example. I work nights and am the lead specialist there. We just got a new supervisor, who has only been here for a few weeks. 

When she was in training she was super nice, and even asked for me to help her with getting adjusted to everyone on night shift. Of which I was completely willing to do. However, I noticed that when she is here, she does very little to interact with our colleagues on the floor. I thought this was odd, but I understand that she has some health issues so I didn't think much of it. Not everyone wants to interact with new people all the time.

However, since she has started there have been multiple instances where I feel flat out disrespected by her. I have been at my job for almost 2 years. I know why and how things are performed. The few times I have offered her direction (such as that our direct supervision meetings are supposed to be an hour long, or that we are allowed to having productive, emotionally supportive calls, that do not have resources attached) she has responded very rudely, or has flat out told me I am wrong, and only when someone of ""equal standing"" to her (another supervisor) told her otherwise that she acquiesced.

Additionally, we use microsoft teams at my job. A few months prior I conducted a survey to change the profile picture of our main group chat, and a picture of my cat as a kitten won. In another group chat, the one of for the direct reports of our previous supervisor I also had my cat as the profile picture. I was given permission to do both of these things.

When this supervisor gained ""control"" over the group chat, she immediately changed the profile picture without saying anything prior. When I expressed that I was hurt about it, she was immediately dismissive. One of my colleagues told me as well, that for the larger shift group chat that she ""hated"" the picture. And when asked directly about why she changed the picture for the other one, said that she ""didn't give a fuck"".

Honestly, that's just the tip of the iceberg and I could continue on about other things that she has said and done to me or my coworkers. I have a meeting tomorrow to discuss her behavior with her direct supervisor, as well as come up with some ideas for how to navigate the conversation. I plan on speaking to her directly on Thursday, to explain my concerns and how this has genuinely hurt my feelings. We work a very emotionally taxing job.

1kwg0zg,Need Advice: BCA + Self-Learning vs Pure Self-Learning Path for Web Development,"Hey everyone! I'm at a crossroads and could really use some guidance from people who've been through similar situations.

**My Current Situation**

I'm 19 and have decided to pursue freelance web development instead of the traditional job route. I already know basic HTML/CSS and some JavaScript fundamentals, so I'm not starting completely from scratch.

# The Dilemma

I'm torn between two paths:

**Path 1: BCA + Self-Learning**

* Get a formal degree while learning web dev on the side
* More ""secure"" option with backup credentials
* Takes 3 years, costs around ₹45,000/year (₹1,35,000 total)

**Path 2: Pure Self-Learning**

* Skip college entirely, focus 100% on building web dev skills
* Use the money saved from college fees for better equipment, English speaking courses, and premium learning resources
* Could potentially start earning within 6-12 months

**My Family's Financial Reality**

Here's the thing - my family can afford the BCA fees, but it would be a stretch. They'd have to work extra hard to cover ₹45,000 annually, plus all the additional expenses (travel, books, exam fees, etc.).

**If I skip college, that same money could go toward:**

* A proper computer setup and study desk
* English speaking institute (crucial for freelancing)
* Premium online courses and resources
* Living expenses while I build my skills

**What I'm Looking For**

* Freedom from 9-5 jobs
* Early financial independence
* Ability to work on my own terms
* Eventually, maybe get into content creation

**Where I'm Confused**

Everyone on social media seems to follow the same pattern: graduation → masters → FAANG job → quit to sell courses → freedom. But is that the only way?

I have the luxury of a completely free schedule right now. I could dedicate 6-8 hours daily to learning web development, building projects, and improving my English communication skills.

**My Questions for You**

1. Has anyone here successfully freelanced without a degree?
2. Is the BCA worth it if my end goal is freelancing, not corporate jobs?
3. Am I being too optimistic about the self-learning route?
4. What would you do in my shoes?

I'm not looking for validation - I genuinely want honest perspectives from people who've walked this path or seen others do it.

Any advice, personal experiences, or reality checks would be incredibly helpful. Thanks for reading this long post!

*P.S. - I know freelancing is competitive and won't be easy money from day one. I'm prepared for the grind, just want to choose the smarter path.*",Rawat_Aayush,2,1.0,1,1748325922,2025-05-27 06:05:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kwg0zg/need_advice_bca_selflearning_vs_pure_selflearning/,5,2025

I'm a scaffolder by trade with loads of experience in industrial plants as well as oil&gas rigs and vessels. Also been leading hand for quite a while. I'm a 25 yrs old German citizen so I got an EU passport as well. My plan basically is to get the online diploma mentioned above (18 months part time study 100% online at EIT Australia)

The reason I want to do this is because I'm very interested in the topic, and to get a higher education behind my back to be able to get into scaffolding supervisor roles worldwide more easy in the coming years. Currently I'm working in Australia but at some point I see myself working somewhere else across the globe.

Anyone involved in offshore/industrial plants, what do you think of this idea? I would study while working at the same time.

And has any of you ever heard about that University? (Engineering institute of technology)

How well are they accepted in Australia and/or worldwide?

Would be great to have some insights from Australian fitters/ engineers or whoever has some knowledge around that topic :)

1kwdhz8,Advice Needed: Should I make a career swap from software engineering to nursing?,"I have been a software engineer for the past 5 years now. I don't know whether it's me being in a general funk or being burnt out, or something more, but I'm unhappy with my career. I am thinking of leaving the career altogether and pursuing an accelerated BSN and becoming a nurse instead. My girlfriend also works as a nurse so I know enough basics about the career field through things she's told me.

My thoughts are this:

1. I feel like I am slowly wasting away at my current job. I dread logging on everyday. I hate the corporate jargon, the office politics, endless and pointless meetings, and feeling like a disposable pawn of the company if I don't create enough impact/value to move their bottom line with profits/costs. 

2. We have already had a couple rounds of layoffs at my current company since I've been there and so far I've been safe, but there's a ton of uneasy energy looming over possible future ones, and I feel like as time goes on, there are going to be more, and they will pin more work on fewer people under the guise of ""AI can do it."" 

3. I work from home and hate sitting at a desk all day and feeling so isolated. I want to be moving around and active and out in the world, interacting with people in person, face to face, and not through a video conference call all day. 

4. I hate that it's really hard to turn off work. I can't just clock out and leave it all behind for the day. I often work well more than 40 hours a week, and I'm salaried, so I don't get paid for that. I guess at least in nursing if I picked up a shift I'd get paid OT for it.

5. Yes, there would be a pay cut with going into nursing, that's one of the unfortunate down sides.

6. I know that right now looking at nursing may be a ""grass is greener"" type of situation and that it isn't a perfect career field so maybe I need to hear some of the cons of going into it outside of what I hear from my gf and her nursing friends. 

And maybe it's just that I hate my current job and finding a new software engineering job would solve some of my ""funk,"" but the market isn't awesome, and that's not guaranteed to resolve it. I also have some time to figure it out, I would need to take a few prerequisite classes at a community college before I can be accepted to the ABSN program near me, so maybe I can start there while staying at my engineering job and go from there and continue weighing my options?

Some of the staff seems irritated I sending stuff while on shift. Even though most of the staff will respond WHEN ON SHIFT. 

Most of these emails unless flagged urgent can be responded to whenever workers get on shift. Some workers have work email on thier phone and will respond at wierd hours, which means they responding from home. 

I also am usually the one who's good at communicating which several people have noted. As I know if say person A is gone and it's effecting 9 different people, those 9 people need to get the message.

1kwawuj,When should you leave (move out) from a new city,"F (24) I’ve lived in NYC for three years and like a classic transplant, don’t see myself here long term. 
I don’t like my job (I’ve only had current one for 6 months) and my community has started to move out. Expenses and overall pace is hard to keep up with. 
Do I quit now and take a break or keep my secure job while the market is crap?

For context, I work in finance and i know it’s ultimately not a good match; the culture is depressing; not a lot of opportunities to collaborate or be creative; content is not my interests; don’t think my skills are being best used; not very flexible with life 

Is this classic 24yo existential confusion or nyc weeding me out?

It limited my options so I took admission in BCA. But I ended up wasting my one year by not going to college because of health issues.

My father will retire from his government job in 2027. So I guess I would need to do a job by then.

I want to take a drop to give CUET and J"""" next year bcz a maths degree would have better guarantee of a job. But my parents want me to continue BCA because I would graduate by 2027 and have also invested 1 lakh rupees in it.

I could go on with BCA but it's difficult to continue because I would have to manage 6 backlogs with new subjects and I'm not completely mentally fine yet. I don't know anything I studied in the 1st or 2nd sem and would have to learn everything and clear those backlogs.

I am also writing CUET this year but bsc courses mostly lead to academia and I won't be having a good score either. Moving and living in Delhi would be very expensive too.

1kwapvz,Struggles in new(ish) job,"Last year I was made redundant from a job I held for 15+ years. Very fortunately I landed a new role in my field via a contact, going from agency to client side. I started the new role immediately after my last day in my old job. It is also a 55% pay rise from my old job.

Apart from a few slight learning curves typical from a newbie, the first few months went really well and I got a “meets expectations” on my first performance review, which my manager said was an A in said context. My supervisor (who is not my line manager) has been very supportive in my training and gave great peer feedback. However, things are changing nine months in.

I started working on more strategic tasks (which are new to me but I’m open to learn). More mistakes and misunderstandings started to creep in but I viewed that as part of the learning process. However, a few weeks ago I was handed a written document detailing all the things I was doing wrong and given a “focus plan” for the rest of the quarter. My supervisor said if I don’t improve by the end of the quarter I would have this in my review and potentially end up on a PIP. I’ve never been on a PIP before so this is a very frightening prospect. 

Being honest, there were errors that I shouldn’t have made and have quickly fixed. But the other issues come from misunderstanding of the task requirements and the fact that this is the first time I have done this type of task. The instructions provided were not vague as such but wide open to misinterpretation. My supervisor feels that I should be asking more questions about the scope. I do agree to an extent and try to put myself in her shoes, but I can’t help but feel that if the instructions are ambiguous in the first place, it’s hard for me to move forward and not make any mistakes?

While I’m trying to be grateful for being alerted to my shortcomings, I can’t help but feel blindsided by the way this has landed on me. Since then I’ve been desperately trying to fix the situation and double check my work, even logging on at weekends to recheck my work and ensure nothing is missed. But the errors still creep in and I am pulled up for it, making me look careless. I also tried setting aside calls to discuss questions I have on the task - which is also wrong, apparently I am supposed to raise questions as inline comments on documents…

I can’t seem to do anything right at the moment and it is really getting me down. I was over the moon when I landed the role and would be destroyed if I lost it, especially after being made redundant last year (which affected me both physically and emotionally)

Any words of advice - or reality checks - would be appreciated. Thank you so much in advance 🙏",Imaginary-Line4873,1,1.0,0,1748307994,2025-05-27 01:06:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kwapvz/struggles_in_newish_job/,5,2025
1kwa6dv,"Need Help Choosing Between Two Job Offers – One Is Stable but Commute-Heavy, the Other Is Remote but Riskier","Hey everyone, I could really use some perspective.

I was laid off about six weeks ago, and my official last day with the company is June 27th. Since the layoff, I’ve been actively job hunting and recently landed a job offer last Thursday (Offer A). I need to make a decision on it by this Tuesday.

Here’s the situation:

Offer A:
	•	$120K salary
	•	40-minute commute, 3 days/week in office
	•	From a stable, mid-sized company (top 1,000) with good financials
	•	Not a big name, but solid and steady

Offer B (expected tomorrow, also Tuesday):
	•	Fully remote
	•	Senior Manager role (big step up in title/responsibility)
	•	Expected to be a higher salary than Offer A
	•	From a company dealing with instability due to major acquisitions over the last few years (stock performance has taken a hit)
	•	Seems like a lot more work and ambiguity

I’m torn. Should I:
	1.	Accept Offer A now, and back out if Offer B comes in stronger tomorrow?
	2.	Ask Offer A for a short extension and explain I’m still finalizing some considerations?
	3.	Trust stability over higher comp and remote work, even if the second role looks more exciting and senior?

This is a big decision and I’m trying to balance career growth, stability, compensation, and quality of life.

I have experience volunteering as a teacher in a after-school program and several years in security and customer service. While I enjoy teaching, I'm not interested in becoming a full-time teacher. I am considering roles such as a corporate trainer because I love helping people learn and I excel at public speaking.

Additionally, I enjoy using my imagination and problem-solving abilities, leading me to also consider instructional designer or UX design. I left school at 21 after completing mandatory education courses and am now 25. I'm contemplating returning to school if a degree is essential for becoming a trainer or designer. However, I'm concerned about the financial implications, as I have a car loan and want to move out of my parents' house.

1kw8xfu,"Need Advice – Facing a Likely RIF at the VA, Have a Private Sector Offer, Unsure What to Do Next","Hi all,

I’m hoping for some guidance from anyone who’s been in a similar situation or just has perspective on federal employment and private sector career decisions.

I’m currently a career-conditional HR Specialist at the Department of Veterans Affairs, with about 1 year and 10 months of tenure. Unfortunately, given my status and the fact that HR is not an exempt series, I’m in a vulnerable position with the upcoming RIF (reduction in force) efforts happening across the agency. My supervisor confirmed that I’m #11 in tenure out of 341 in my VISN, so realistically, if this RIF happens, I’m likely to be affected.

The VA has offered me the Deferred Resignation Program (DRP), which would allow me to resign and still get paid through September 30th, giving me time to transition. At the same time, I’ve been offered a role at Target as an Executive Team Leader - General Merchandise (ETL-GM) at $85,000/year. I previously worked for Target as an ETL in HR and left for more stability and better hours with the VA. So this would be a return to retail and a more demanding, less flexible schedule (including weekends).

My dilemma:
	•	If I take the DRP and the Target offer, I will essentially be making a full salary from both Target and the VA through September.
	•	I’m also worried that returning to retail might make it difficult to get back into HR long-term, especially federal HR.
	•	On the flip side, if I stay and get RIF’d, I lose the DRP option and might be scrambling for any job.

The federal job market, especially for HRBP or generalist roles, seems really tight right now. I’ve applied to 110+ HR jobs and haven’t had much luck getting interviews. I received one screening from 110 applications. Many good HR roles seem to require relocation or significant experience I don’t yet have.

Has anyone here faced something similar?
	•	Would taking the Target role and DRP be smart for now just for income stability?
	•	Would a 1–2 year stint at Target hurt my future chances of getting back into HR?
	•	Is it worth riding out the RIF even with the risk of losing everything?

I’d really appreciate any advice, insight, or experiences from others who’ve been in similar shoes.

Thanks in advance",xtremeswax,6,1.0,3,1748302589,2025-05-26 23:36:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kw8xfu/need_advice_facing_a_likely_rif_at_the_va_have_a/,5,2025

That said, I work for a tech (not software) startup and there aren't many opportunities for growth, and I don't feel particularly challenged, so I'm looking elsewhere.

I'm just trying to make whatever opportunities I can to challenge myself and grow. Here are my goals for the next couple of years:

1. Working on a part time MS degree in engineering management (almost done) - definitely learned some things, but is expensive and won't help me get a job (I already have a PhD).
2. learning about IP laws & procedures and passing the USPTO patent agent exam
3. managing some projects over the past few years, hoping to study and pass the PMP exam for project management

1kw595x,Am I required to repay for my relocation stipend after accepting a new position with a different company?,"Hi all, first-time poster looking for some advice.

About 9 months ago, I accepted a job that included a relocation stipend. The company (small, no HR department) asked me to move to another state. I accepted the offer via email—no contract was signed—and the stipend was included in my first paycheck.

I visited the area, looked at apartments, but returned home. Since it was the holiday season, they agreed we’d revisit the relocation conversation after a few months of remote work. I even offered to return the stipend then, as it felt like a weight hanging over me, but they told me to hold on it and we would discuss relocation at the beginning of this year.

Fast forward to now: I never relocated, and the topic never came up again. I recently accepted a new job in my home state with better pay and benefits. When I gave my two weeks' notice, my boss was supportive—but then said they’d be taking my final paycheck and last week of work as reimbursement for the stipend. So I’d essentially be working the last two weeks unpaid.

I’m unsure how legal or fair this is, especially since there was no signed agreement about repaying the stipend. Friends and family are advising me not to work the final two weeks if I won’t be paid.

What do you all think?

**TL;DR:**

Accepted a job 9 months ago with a relocation stipend, but never relocated. No signed contract, just an offer letter accepted via email. I offered to return the stipend months ago, but they never followed up. Now that I’ve accepted a position at a different company, they say my last paycheck and week of work will be taken as reimbursement. Not sure if this is legal or fair.",ThrowRA_WideTower,0,0.5,2,1748292826,2025-05-26 20:53:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kw595x/am_i_required_to_repay_for_my_relocation_stipend/,5,2025
1kw54z9,Is “following your passion” the worst career advice we keep giving young people?,"I’ve been watching so many people (friends, family, even myself) chase “passion careers” — creative fields, dream jobs, personal projects — and end up broke, burned out, or stuck. Meanwhile, the people who went the “boring” route (steady jobs, good benefits, stable industries) are often the ones living with less stress and more financial freedom.

Why do we glorify passion over practicality so much? Is it social media? Movies? Fear of “wasting” our lives?

I’d love to hear from people on both sides:

If you chased your passion, did it work out? Would you recommend it?

If you chose stability over passion, do you regret it — or are you glad you did?

Is there actually a middle ground, or is this just a hard tradeoff we all have to face?

1kw4h7c,Reading is the most overlooked career tip,"Life is moving too quickly these days, thanks to the Internet and artificial intelligence. (Even if I continue to post on Reddit, I believe that text content can help me think more profoundly than other sns.)

There are too many jobs, too many applications, too many new industries and occupations, and too much indistinct information on the Internet, which occasionally causes me to question the world I live in. It goes without saying that technology should be a ""new thing"" that ""liberates mankind,"" enhances efficiency, and transforms lives. However, it has caused too much fear for humanity at the moment.

Everybody is looking at short videos, online information, and learning how to use AI tools to find a job ""faster,"" while others are using Beyz interview assistant to prepare for mock interviews, GPT interview coach to write resumes to pass the ATS screening, and LinkedIn to connect everyone in order to create their own network of contacts. However, they all overlook the significance of **reading.**

How long has it been since you took the time to read a book slowly? Meanwhile, several of my pals who predicted upheaval, layoffs, and the AI boom are now leading companies, freelancing like pros, or boldly negotiating pay raises. What is the connection between them?

I originally planned to get a masters in a technical area and specialize at my company, but that seems to be impossible at this point with the current work life balance… I stated that I’m interested in this when interviewing, but it seems like people are actually discouraged from this because it takes away from work.

- EU
- BSc in Mechanical Engineering
- starting a master’s in Industrial Engineering in September

- most recent: a little over a year as a project manager in a large tech corporate. 
- currently searching for another job due to being very unhappy with the management + an upcoming structural change.

1kw1q8k,don't know if i should continue nursing school,"(i'm not gonna base my decision off of whatever reddit says lol i'm just trying to get some perspective)

i (18) just finished my first year of nursing, and it’s been alright, but I’m not sure if I actually want to keep pursuing it.

 I’m naturally an introverted and quiet person, so clinicals were a bit uncomfortable for me, but not horrible. I hate the sight of needles, blood, severe wounds, etc but I’ve managed so far. My grades so far have been ranging from 60s to 80s, so they’re not terrible, but I was honestly cutting it close for a couple of classes. Although nursing school hasn’t been terrible or traumitizing or anything, I’ve realized it might not be for me. When I think about it, if it weren’t for the job stability, good pay, and variety of specialty options, I probably wouldn’t have even chosen nursing. I originally wanted to go into teaching or English, but I was worried about job stability and pay and everything. Now, I’m not sure if I would even really enjoy working in healthcare. I initially planned on working outpatient or becoming a nurse practitioner, but I’m questioning if that’s something I really want, or if I'm just doing it for the money. I like taking care of people and helping them, but I don't really like the nursey aspect of if if ykwim. 

 If I were to leave nursing, I’d think I'd either go into social work or business. Maybe teaching too, but I'm scared it wouldn't be stable. Social work seems kinda appealing since it’s similar to nursing but without the heavy responsibility, but I’ve also heard that it’s very emotionally draining and underpaid. Business is also a strong option since I’d definitely enjoy working in an office environment, but I'm scared that I'd go nowhere. My math skills aren't the greatest either. If I left nursing right now, I’d be able to pay off the year I’ve already spent, so money isn’t a huge issue here, I'm just worried that I'll make the wrong choice and regret it later. I have 3 weeks of daily hospital shifts coming up, so I'm going to go through it with an open mind and see how I feel when it's over. 

Anyways sorry for the long post lol, any advice/insight/opinions would be very appreciated 🙏🏻",Fresh_Dog2626,2,1.0,1,1748284136,2025-05-26 18:28:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kw1q8k/dont_know_if_i_should_continue_nursing_school/,5,2025

1kw1fcg,Employer is pushing layoffs and RTO. What remote roles should I be targeting to get out?,"Hey folks, hoping to get some fresh eyes on my job hunt.

I graduated last year with a degree in Communications (marketing and PR emphasis) and have been working fully remote since September 2022. I’m based in Utah, USA, and due to some ongoing health issues, staying remote isn’t just a preference — it’s a necessity.

**The problem**? My current employer is now threatening layoffs and a return-to-office mandate, and I don’t want to stick around to find out if they’re serious.

**My background** is kind of a hybrid between customer service and communications/training, which makes it hard to know exactly what roles to target. I’ve been aiming for more writing- and strategy-focused work, but haven’t had much luck and don’t want to box myself in. I’d love ideas for titles, industries, or directions I might not be considering.

A few things I bring to the table:

* 8+ years of experience across CX, internal comms, training, and content development
* Strong at translating complex processes into clear, human communication
* Selected for two company-wide pilot programs for my mix of leadership and communication skills
* Built training materials and onboarding content that cut ramp-up time by 35% and improved CSAT by over 20%
* I’m a 2x national college speech and debate champion
* I’ve worked closely with IT, compliance, and service teams to streamline communication and reduce friction across departments
* Passionate about making things easier, more efficient, and better for employees and end users

Tech stack/tools I’ve used:  
Salesforce, Slack, Confluence, Asana, Monday, Microsoft Office, Google Suite, Zoom, internal CRMs and KMs  
Lately, I’ve been diving into AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and learning Make (Integromat) for automation

Any thoughts on where I could pivot with this background? I’m open to new ideas, just looking for something fully remote, stable, and a bit closer to my degree (even if not a perfect match). Would really appreciate your advice!

I'm currently working as a CNA in LTC, part-time/3days a week, and I need 2 more months of direct patient care to get a couple more points for my CC's Rad program, but I've also been looking at pharmacy tech programs, as it could be more chill.   
I know retail has its ups and downs, but I may look into pharm tech jobs in a hospital. Anway's, I'm a pre-radiography student and a rad tech assistant job opened up recently at my local Atrium hospital (4days a week, fulltime) and I'm a bit undecided. 

I only took the CNA job, since I was pursing the LPN route and needed to retain my license, but since I'm no longer pursing nursing, I could try for the Rad tech assistant position. I have all my pre-requisites done, besides chemistry which I'm currently taking, so I'll have fall, next spring/summer off, until I can hopefully start my rad program next fall.   
  
I've been looking at other certification courses/positions as well, such as, sterile tech, phlebotomy, CMA, monitor tech, patient sitter, patient transport, etc. but I think pharm tech could be less direct patient care, though I would have to help with customers. 

So, should I tough it out for a little long, as a cna, and maybe pursue a pharm tech course or maybe go for the rad tech assistant position? Would love to hear your thoughts, and ty! :D

It would really be helpful if u guys give me some advice about content creating or clicking pictures and give a follow and suggest your friends.
More than that your support would mean a lot to me.❤️🫂🧶",PristinePop1980,0,0.5,0,1748281919,2025-05-26 17:51:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kw0so6/21f_college_going_starting_a_crochet_small/,5,2025
1kw0rfi,Consideration for a job offer?,"
I’ve been working for about 3 years and am currently in a stable role with a really supportive manager. A promotion has been promised in the near future, and I am in a really comfortable position with decent work hours. 

That said, the role itself is quite slow-paced at times and I often feel underutilized. I’m starting to worry that I’m not growing or being challenged enough in my current position. Although I have expressed this multiple times to my manager, I am afraid it is limited by the nature and scope of the team I am in. 

I recently got an offer for a new role at another company. It comes with a decent pay bump and the scope sounds broader - combining internal operations, business planning, and some strategic support work. But based on what I’ve learned from someone in a similar role, much of the day-to-day could be operational (e.g., reporting, tracking, internal coordination), with limited strategic depth. However, it could be a stepping stone for internal mobility in the future.

I’m torn between: 
- Staying in a comfortable, growth-promising environment with a great manager?
- Or taking the leap for more exposure and higher pay, even if the work may be more operational than strategic?

Would appreciate thoughts from anyone who has navigated a similar fork in their career.",xlshds,1,1.0,0,1748281839,2025-05-26 17:50:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kw0rfi/consideration_for_a_job_offer/,5,2025
1kw0lx8,Wanting to quit a job after big promotion?,"Hi all. I'm a baker and was recently promoted to head baker of the new kitchen we just opened. I got a big raise and a lot of benefits but am now impossibly burnt out. I'm working almost every day, extremely long days (12-14 hrs) and have no time to properly guide or train new staff or do any of my extra managerial tasks. I always dreamed of becoming a baker since I was a little kid as it was one of my biggest passions and now it's ruined it for me. I hate doing it. I dread going into work. Going into work at midnight has ruined my social life and mental health to a degree I never thought possible and haven't been this depressed in many, many years, and the anxiety is making me physically sick most every day.

1kw0h4r,Recruiter did me real bad and now I'm in deep trouble,"If it matters, I'm from South Asia and in Software industry.  
  
I was expected to join this new company by the end of this month and while I had resigned at the beginning of this month. My official notice period is 2 months however I did not had any major dependency on me and in fact I was getting released from my project at the first week of the month. But my current company is stalling me and I had talks with my skip manager but they're intending to make me serve the entire notice period though I had them accept my resignation.



The recruiter really pushed me hard to joing early and said in case if I don't get an early release, they can extend the joining date. However, they called me last week and said extension is not possible and effectively that job is gone. I was really shaken and asked them to to look for alternative options and do anything that is necessary as I'll be jobless. They said that they're really sorry and they're doing everything possible for me and said there will be few positions for the same role that will be opening after couple of weeks and they're going to fit me in there and asked me to trust them and wait.



However I don't really know on how to trust after what happened. Now the thing is, in my current company, I had couple of rounds of talk with HR on them retaining me and matching my offer, but I, thinking I'd get an early release, rejected it politiely.



Now I wanna take my resignation back and have to talk to my skip level manager, HR and I don't really know what to say. In retention talks with HR, I told them I'll get a different stack from what currently I'm working on and maybe I can say to them that in my new company they've changed my teams etc, but this is the only thing that I can think of.



I really need some good suggestions on how can I go back with genuine reason.



PS: I'm on good terms with my RM, skip manager and HR. 

Also I changed my joining date in offer letter, is there any chance that HR can see if original document signed using docusign was changed or not?",guyThatMeets,0,0.5,0,1748281138,2025-05-26 17:38:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kw0h4r/recruiter_did_me_real_bad_and_now_im_in_deep/,5,2025

1kvzs42,Pursuing career related to passion but I'm not satisfied,"I didn't have a dream job but i have always been interested in Psychology. My goal is to become a MD–psychiatrist. I'm currently a sophomore in college and unfortunately didn't pursue psychology. The reason being younger me making the decision to choose my dream uni over my dream degree, uni didn't offer psych. The name and prestige (being the top), I was drawn like a moth to a flame. I chose a degree related to Psych and majoring in child development. 

I actually enjoy the degree/course and i felt more passionate to pursue medicine especially to help children. However, I feel so unsatisfied and miserable often. I have a subconscious fear of being average, even when i try to remind myself that every career has it's purpose and all degrees are hard in their own ways. It doesn't help that people often look down at the degree I'm pursuing because everyone ""knows""  how ""easy"" it is. People from my university says no one fails because you just basically study behavior, unlike STEM which is the ""harder"" science. I try so hard to ignore these comments because it's just stupid and shallow. But when these words are coming from family and friends, it hits different. My parents would always ""joke"" about me being unemployed or comparing me to other kids taking up engineering, nursing, etc. 

This leads me to feel like what I'm doing right now is too easy, and to be good and satisfied is to take the ""tougher"" path. I feel like struggling is necessary. Even though i still struggle with my degree rn, i feel invalidated since everyone thinks it's easy and others have it harder. I often find myself thinking about leaving my university and considering to pursue ""real"" medical degrees such as nursing, laboratory medicine, radiology, etc. I'm so conflicted, I'm a semester behind my batch.

1kvz9mb,New hire taking over my role. How to handle this?,"Hi everyone, I’m hoping to get some outside perspective and maybe a little advice on how to handle a situation at my current job.

I work as a specialist at a marketing agency. For context, I’m already casually job-hunting and plan to get more serious about it after I return from my honeymoon (I'm getting married in two weeks!). But something’s been bothering me at work, and I could use some thoughts on how to approach it in the meantime.

I’ll provide some background first because this isn’t the first time I’ve felt like something weird is going on.

I joined the company last September. The onboarding was a bit bumpy but nothing major. A few minor mistakes in the early weeks, as I was still getting up to speed and adjusting to the fast pace.

Then, right before Christmas, I had an unexpected medical emergency and had to take two weeks of medical leave. It was a rough time, both physically and emotionally. My doctor actually recommended I take a month off, but since I was still new to the job and already feeling better, I returned after two weeks.

During my leave, I noticed something odd: my team was acting cold and distant, and I saw interviews being scheduled for a role identical to mine. When I came back, I was given minimal work (like 1-2 hours a day) and they said it was “for my health.” It definitely felt like they were phasing me out.

Eventually, I set up a 1-on-1 with my boss to clear the air. She assured me they were hiring someone new not to replace me, but because the team was growing. She also said she understood why I had to take time off and appreciated my transparency. I left that meeting feeling good and reenergized. I was motivated to prove myself again and show I was all in (despite my suspicions that they were only being nice because they weren't finding a replacement, haha)

And for a while, things were good. I got more involved in projects, the vibe improved, and I genuinely felt like I was back on track.

Then, a couple months later, they finally found someone and a new hire joined, someone with the same title/role as me. I welcomed him, showed him the ropes, explained the projects. From a technical standpoint, we’re equals, but I’ll admit he’s much more charismatic and has a real knack for dealing with people, especially clients (something I’m still working on, I'm a bit shyer).

At first, I was happy to have someone else on the team. But slowly, I started noticing red flags again.

In multiple 1-on-1s, my boss had told me she wanted me to be the technical point of reference for a particular specialty area, one I’m passionate about and see as my longterm path. I was also clear that one specific project (let’s call it *Project T*) was my favorite. I’d been involved from day one and helped set it up, so it felt meaningful. She reassured me that I was a key part of that project and would continue to be.

Fast forward a week later: there's a restructuring, and suddenly the new guy is appointed as the point of reference for that area, not me.

Then, another week later, I get pulled into a meeting with the new guy and another supervisor (my boss’s right hand). They inform me that I’m being taken off *Project T* and he’s taking over my responsibilities there. He clearly knew this in advance and wasn’t surprised. He even said something like, “I think this is the best for everyone,” and seemed… happy about it?

My boss has been hot and cold with me for a while, and I’m left confused and honestly a bit hurt. On my side, nothing has changed. I haven’t slacked off. I’ve kept a strong work ethic, stayed positive, and only received good feedback. But now I feel like I’m being slowly edged out again and I'm once again working barely 2 hours a day because I don't have enough work.

Not sure what to make of this. Am I being paranoid? Is this just how office politics work? Any thoughts on how to handle this situation while I prep my exit would really help. Thanks in advance.

1kvyv97,Verbal Misconduct Consequences - Advice please ?,"I made a stupid comment to a coworker and I’m worried I might lose my job or hurt my chances for promotion.

This happened recently during a dinner with a coworker as we usually do, outside of working hours, around 8 PM. We’re good friends, have worked together for three years, and normally joke around—but this time I crossed a line.

I had few glasses of wine before dinner and I were little tipsy, While we were having dinner, there was a piece of bread on the table. She made a casual comment like, *""The bread is soft when it's hot, but it gets harder over time,""* while picking it up with her hand. I made a dumb, poorly-thought-out joke and said: *""The bread got harder because you touched it.""*

I realized immediately how inappropriate it sounded. Later that night she told me it made her uncomfortable; I apologized sincerely on the spot, and we discussed it, and she said she’d let it slide—**once**. She added that if anything similar happens again, she’ll go to management.

However, ever since then, I’ve been feeling anxious — I keep thinking:

* **What if she changes her mind and reports it to HR/Manager?**
* **Will this go on my record?**
* **Could I be fired over this?**
* **Will it ruin my chances at future promotions or leadership roles?**
* **Should I talk about this to my manager in order to not let it be taken out of context later?**

Context:

* We’re peers, not in a reporting relationship. Our workplace culture is generally friendly but professional.
* She sometimes makes bold jokes herself (cussing, talking casually about bold subjects, etc.) But not directly to me.
* This is the first time I’ve said anything questionable.

I'm not trying to excuse what I said — it was dumb. But I’m genuinely worried now if this can come back to bite me.

Has anyone been in a similar situation or seen how HR handles stuff like this?

1kvx6mb,New employer has gone silent,"I handed my notice in at my current job, following a conditional offer from another employer (conditional on references and a criminal background check). Still waiting on the criminal background coming back, so I haven't been given a firm start date or signed anything with the new company. But, I handed my notice in as I have to give a minimum of 4 weeks so I didn't want to wait until the criminal background check came back (I know that this will not pose an issue), and potentially delay the start date. 

But, now I'm starting to wonder if the new company is ghosting me. To begin with, they were very communicative with me. Emailing back and forth. They emailed me to confirm they had received one of my two references and to give me the access details to the staff training portal. Then they emailed me a couple of days later to advise me to make sure I had completed specific modules as a priority as they are mandatory before starting the job.  

I know for a fact my second reference has been submitted to them, but I've heard nothing. Given that they contacted me to confirm receipt of first reference, I expected they'd also email to confirm receipt of the second. Also, they booked me onto a training course that I advised them at the time I wasnt sure I'd be able to attend whilst working my notice, but in the end, I managed to get the day off, and so I emailed them to confirm I would be attending.  Radio silence. No word regarding the receipt of my second reference, and no reply to my email advising I'd be able to attend the training. 

I'm still waiting for my criminal background paperwork to be processed, which can take a few weeks. (Legally, they can't confirm a start date until that is in place). 

But now, I just feel like I'm in this weird limbo and I'm starting to worry about it. Am I just being paranoid? ",BrilliantWalrus718,8,0.8399999737739563,25,1748273238,2025-05-26 15:27:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kvx6mb/new_employer_has_gone_silent/,5,2025

In September but my boss and my colleague are going on parental leave and I’ll be left holding the fort and potentially training up a senior manager.

However, there are some red flags. During the interview, the hiring manager volunteered that the previous person left due to burnout and was never replaced. He also emphasised that the team works across nine time zones — and I never asked about that. That makes me think they’re setting expectations early that the workload will be high and the hours unpredictable. Online reviews echo concerns about culture and management. There would be a £25K salary bump.

Still, I’m torn. I don’t know if or when another opportunity will come up, and I’ve been praying for change. Part of me worries I’ll regret passing this up. But part of me feels like I’m walking into a fire with my eyes open.

1kvw758,Facing Midlife and Unsure of Next Career Move,"Hello everyone. I come seeking advice!

I'm a 45 year old man. For almost the past 20 years I've worked for a consulting agency, doing a myriad of tasks from writing marcom content to website management to SEO. As a result I have experience in about 2 dozen tech & marketing fields. I also work with incredibly out-of-date bosses who are losing the plot more every year. The company is in danger of collapse.



Here's the trouble. I don't know what to do next. I have too many options.



I've considered each of these as a next move:

* Return to technical writing full-time
* Begin a one-man digital agency
* Move full-time into SEO
* Job-hop to another company for a full-time content manager or strategist role
* Skill up to a full-stack web developer
* Switch to book editing (something I enjoy) full time
* Something else entirely - complete career change



Here's a skill set list as a broad picture, with levels (Basic - Good - Very Good - Excellent) to give you some idea of my work:

1. Content Creation & Strategy - Excellent
2. SEO - Excellent
3. HTML - Excellent
4. CSS - Good
5. JavaScript - Basic
6. Email Marketing - Good
7. Newsletters - Very Good
8. Content Operations - Excellent
9. Website Administration - Excellent
10. Website Development - Good
11. Documentation - Very Good
12. Python - Basic
13. GitHub - Basic
14. AI Editing - Very Good
15. Digital Strategy - Very Good
16. Social Media - Good



Some factors to consider: 

* I don't like managing people, but will do it if needed.
* I'm a severe introvert. I tried self-employment years ago and failed miserably. I would be willing to try again, but would need to know I'm going into a field where I'm not going to starve.
* My current boss may try to sabotage me, even sue me, if I leave. She has done this to others.
* I own a home and am lucky enough to have decent savings. I can weather a short period of unemployment.



Hopefully this is enough to derive insight? I'm happy to provide (some) more details if it helps.",weezulmaster,1,1.0,1,1748270820,2025-05-26 14:47:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kvw758/facing_midlife_and_unsure_of_next_career_move/,5,2025
1kvvvnr,Chinese student — Should I take a low-paid creative internship in Singapore even though it’s outside my major?,"Hi everyone, I’m a third-year undergraduate student from China, majoring in Financial Management. To be honest, I’m not very passionate about my major and have found myself much more drawn to creative work like design, video editing, and e-commerce.

I recently got an internship offer in Singapore through Xiaohongshu (RED). The role involves creative tasks I genuinely enjoy — design, video shooting/editing, and e-commerce. I’ve also interned in a similar area before (at Sina Guangdong), so I know I like this kind of work. The company is a local bak kwa (barbecued meat) brand called Fragrance Foodstuff. It’s not well-known internationally, but I’ve heard that internships like this don’t come by easily and that it could have been worse.

The catch is the salary — around 1400 SGD/month — which isn’t much considering Singapore’s high cost of living, especially rent. I would likely have to pay some expenses out of pocket. The internship runs from July to December, so I would probably take a gap semester. I’ve already missed summer internship camps in China due to an exchange semester in Korea.

Right now, I don’t have a better offer. This internship could help me explore a creative career path, but I’m also unsure if the cost (financial and emotional — I worry a bit about being lonely) is worth it. I do have a few friends in Singapore, though.

Would you take the offer if you were in my position? I’d really appreciate any advice!",kayzest,2,1.0,5,1748270012,2025-05-26 14:33:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kvvvnr/chinese_student_should_i_take_a_lowpaid_creative/,5,2025

1kvulse,Mechanical Engineer in MEP Estimation – How to Grow My Career and Salary in UAE?,"Hi everyone,

I'm 25 years old ,From India and currently working in the UAE as a **MEP Estimation Engineer**. It’s been around **7 months** in this role, and I’d say I’ve learned around **60–70% of the responsibilities**, especially related to quantity takeoff for HVAC, plumbing, firefighting, and sometimes electrical.

Along with my job, I’m also doing a course that covers:

* **MEP Estimation**
* **MEP Design (AutoCAD, REVIT basics, Duct/Pipe sizing, etc.)**
* **Site execution and materials knowledge**

Before this, I worked as a **Junior HVAC Design Engineer** in India.

I want some honest advice from professionals here:

# 🔍 What I’m Confused About:

1. **How should I guide my career from here?**
   * Should I continue focusing on MEP Estimation?
   * Or is it better to move into Design / Site / BIM / or even HSE (Safety)?
2. **What should I learn or do to increase my salary and career growth in the UAE?**
   * Are certifications like **NEBOSH, IOSH, PMP, or BIM** worth doing?
   * Any specific tools, software, or skills I should master?
3. **Is there a good path to shift into consulting firms or higher positions in main contractors?**

I’m very committed to growing professionally and willing to put in the effort to study and upgrade myself — I just need clarity on **what direction to go** and how others have navigated this phase.

Any suggestions or guidance would really mean a lot. Thanks in advance!",Aggravating_Sport495,1,1.0,0,1748266775,2025-05-26 13:39:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kvulse/mechanical_engineer_in_mep_estimation_how_to_grow/,5,2025
1kvufrl,Seeking Guidance for a Career as a Crime Scene Investigator Abroad – ISC Grade 11 Student from India,"
Hello everyone,

I am currently a Grade 11 ISC Science student from India. Unlike many of my peers, I am not preparing for NEET or JEE. Instead, I am deeply interested in pursuing a career in Forensic Science, with the ultimate goal of becoming a Crime Scene Investigator (CSI) abroad.
As of now, my tentative plan is to pursue a B.Sc. in Biotechnology, as the university I’m targeting offers it with an honors option. Afterward, I intend to pursue an M.Sc. in Forensic Science. However, I recently discovered that M.Sc. Forensic Science is a broad field with multiple specializations, and there are also individual master’s programs focusing on specific forensic disciplines. This has left me somewhat confused, and I would sincerely appreciate any clarity or guidance on how I should plan my academic path from undergraduate to postgraduate level.( I want to go abroad after bsc )

Currently, I am in my summer break, and I am using this time to explore the field more seriously. I’ve started enrolling in online courses and attending webinars. One such course I’m pursuing is ""Introduction to Forensic Science"" by a university in Singapore on Coursera.

While learning, I realized that skills like basic photography and digital imaging are essential in this field skills I currently lack. Could anyone kindly recommend YouTube channels or online resources where I can begin developing these skills from scratch?
Lastly, I want to mention that I’m committed to focusing on my academics in Grades 11 and 12. This post is not a distraction but an attempt to set a clear career direction, as I have always lacked proper guidance. Forensic Science is still a lesser-explored path here, and I’d be truly grateful for any advice from those who have experience in this area.

Thank you in advance!",GSP777____,1,1.0,0,1748266303,2025-05-26 13:31:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kvufrl/seeking_guidance_for_a_career_as_a_crime_scene/,5,2025
1kvsysx,How can I make myself more employable?,"Hello, I’d appreciate some advice on how to get myself started in a career with a decent wage. 

For a bit of context of where I’m at: I’m 22 years old, I received decent grades on my A-Levels (B in English Literature, B in Media Studies and a BTEC Level 3 Distinction in Personal and Business Finance) and I have an Open University degree (2:1 English Literature). Currently, I work within libraries and I have done for the past four years. I considered looking into becoming a librarian, but my local council is pulling so much funding from libraries it doesn’t seem like a feasible option long term - plus the pay is pretty terrible. 

When applying for my degree, everyone told me it wasn’t employable and that I should look into other subjects if I wanted to actually get a job. The issue is, I did my degree because it was something I enjoyed rather than something I thought could ensure future job security, so I didn’t think much of it at the time. Though now I am struggling to find anything that pays a liveable wage. 

I’d love to move out and have my own place but even working full time I don’t make enough in libraries. I love books, comics and everything else relating to libraries - I just can’t live on the money they’re paying me. 

Are there courses I can take that could land me in a career with some actual progression? I don’t mind starting at a low salary and proving myself in order to move up. I’m not sure what I want to do so I’m not set on an industry either. I’m pretty mediocre talent wise but I’m willing to improve. I don’t really have masters money (nor do I want to get more student loans because I already owe enough). 

Could anyone offer advice? Courses, careers, skills that would make me employable in higher paying roles?

1kvrvqj,How do I tell my supervisor I need a raise?,"I'm currently working for a defense contractor as an Assembler level B. I've been with my current company for a  year and almost 6 months. In that time I've learned 5 top assemblies and I currently support 3 sub assembly lines independently. I make $25 an hour and had a review back in March and got a 2.5% merit increase (.60 cent increase) which according to my supervisor is the highest he gave out. After taxes I'm making about $3,000 a month. I bring up my pay because I'm barely getting by with rent, car insurance, car maintenance, student loans and Credit card payments. This is not including groceries, gas, etc.

  
Most of the people I work with only know 1 or 2 systems and are a higher level than me and make more money. My On time delivery is 88%, my first pass yield is 98%. I have never been late, I have never had an argument with my coworkers or any managers. I'm expected to cross train other people on some of the jobs I've done. This is not to relieve me of the duties I've been doing but it's so more people do not get laid off. They had a round of lay offs early march and I believe it was 9 employees in different departments. All of which had numerous HR complaints against them. 

  
I spoke to HR last week about moving up a level which would or should come with a pay increase. I also spoke about how to move up from my current role which is something I wanted to bring up when I talk to my supervisor. I'm not sure if he will or if I should bring up the one coworker that had a problem with me. Never really interrogated with the guy but from what I could gather he sounds like he's a paranoid schizophrenic. He was constantly giving me a hard time (not preforming my inspections), tried hitting my car, staring at me (my coworkers commented on that) and even tried following me home which I had to call 9-1-1 over. As far as I'm aware he has been terminated. 

I feel like I'm a good employee but I need either a pay increase, maybe a new career path or I'll have to leave my current role or find a 2nd job which I'm not sure I could juggle. I don't mind my job, I like most of my coworkers and I'm not sure what the job market will look like and honestly it sucks looking for a new job.

1kvqwrt,Is a Dream Career worth the pursuit?,"One of my many dreams (was once) involved with being a professional musician, but I've learnt over the years that I often don't have the stamina or personality to do it full-time. I've long been interested in things like giving lessons of being on Patreon, but between work and life and just coming back from near-poverty, it seems like something I cannot fathom. 


I *love* music, and have grown my skills very much, but find things like online engagement as a necessity to be sapping...but what other way is there? Realistically, Patreon or selling my scores wouldn't pay the bills, but being a teacher or instructor might be a little close. I have somewhat of a professional position currently in a religious setting, but sometimes I feel like the strive and drive to do it 'full-time' is close to tangible, but then I become defeated. 


Should I let it go? I feel like most people only want to/can learn from Youtube, so there goes my competition.

1kvq0vg,How to break out of this unproductive rut ?,"I am 31-year-old Indian guy towards the end of my 5th year of my PhD programme in India. Life has been pretty rough lately and I just felt like I needed to vent. Although I say I need advice, I am also just looking for someone to just listen to and someone's shoulder to rest on. Nevertheless, please feel free to share your unbiased opinion.

Although I am towards the end of my 5th year of my PhD, I am nowhere near to a publication. In fact, all of my other batchmates have either published papers or has submitted their manuscripts to journals. I am feeling more hopeless and slipping into a state of apathy and inaction everyday. Right now, as I am writing this post, I have skipped going to my laboratory. Everything feels like a task, even showering or eating or browsing social media and watching movies. My eating and sleeping schedules have got messed up pretty much. I am skipping my meals most of the days and just eating outside food which appeal to my taste buds like chocolate or other fast food (basically comfort eating). I literally want to do nothing and just want to sit or lie down quietly at a place all day.

I have recently done a lot of self reflection on what I have done in my life so far and I don't really feel proud of myself. I found that I have been deceiving myself so much. I had and still do have ambitious academic goals but have never put in the time and effort hard towards my goals. I don't remember the last time I have studied hard since school days and hence, I can see why my career is in shambles today. I cannot accept this fact to myself that I have screwed up like this. I know I am not alone and it really is disappointing to think as to why some of us don't really take our priorities seriously. Deep down we know what to do, we know we have to work hard to achieve our goals but still choose to lose ourselves in distracting, meaningless activities destroying our time and potential.

I had made a similar post on many platforms like ""[r/PhD](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/)"" titled ""I have ruined my own career"" few months back. My situation has not gotten very better. I had a talk with my supervisor last week. He is very much concerned about my lack of progress and the future of my career. We have already been repeating the same conversation for past 4 semesters. He has signed my progress reports and fellowship forms on condition that I step up my game which I have failed to. He told me that he fails to understand as to why I am not putting in the effort when I have chosen the PhD line as well as topic on my own accord and to be honest, I myself am not being able to give him a proper answer. I spent many semesters in indecision, overthinking and several trials but was unable to come up with something really commendable for a publication. I struggled with reading literature a lot and frequently avoided things when they used to get complex and distracted myself with other things. At some point, anxiety and hopelessness started to creep in and made things more difficult. He told me that claiming an extension will be difficult without substansial progress and insists that I quit PhD and look for a job as he is worried about my passing age which will serve as a huge hindrance in securing a job in our country.

My parents are also worried sick about me. I have to get employed and take up family responsibilities. I am feeling really guilty and ashamed of myself. I have disappointed a lot of people including myself. I know I have to take action but I find it difficult to muster the energy which leads to wasted time and more guilt. This is going on like a perpetual cycle and I don't know when I will break out of this.",Due_Crazy,2,1.0,1,1748251045,2025-05-26 09:17:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kvq0vg/how_to_break_out_of_this_unproductive_rut/,5,2025
1kvpttt,Laid off and struggling to find a UX job — what more can I do?”,"Hi everyone,
I’m a UX/UI designer with about 3 years of experience, including internships and a full-time role. I got laid off from my full-time job in December 2024, and since then, I’ve been freelancing and trying to stay afloat. I’ve handled client projects solo, built design systems, and even led small teams—but I still haven’t been able to land a new full-time role.

Right now, I’m doing a 100-hour freelance project, and I’m also learning WordPress to broaden my skill set. I’ve started taking courses on advanced UX and development so I can apply for more hybrid roles too.

Despite all this, the job market feels super saturated, and sometimes I wonder if I’m doing enough or heading in the right direction. I keep tweaking my portfolio, writing personalized applications, and networking, but the responses are minimal or non-existent.

1kvpfj8,Looking for Advice From Civil Engineers or Those Who’ve Found Fulfillment in Life and Career,"I believe that I don’t need a lot to be truly happy in life, but just a few meaningful things: strong family and friendships, staying active through sports and various activities, and having a career that brings me long-term satisfaction. Less but better.

I’m not writing this because I need motivation—I’m already motivated. What I’m looking for is advice from those who have achieved what they truly wanted in life, especially in engineering or a similar field.

Currently, I’m a 10th-grade student at an engineering-focused high school. I recently completed a two-week internship at the Faculty of Civil Engineering, mainly focused on transportation engineering. Since childhood, I’ve loved building things, especially shelters and towers from sticks, and that’s when I knew that construction, infrastructure, and building science were for me. I also know that I want an active job that involves being outdoors, working with others, and not just sitting at a desk all day (although I’m fine with desk work or meetings sometimes too).

Right now, I’m giving 100% effort to all STEM subjects in school. But honestly, it’s starting to get repetitive. We mostly just learn theory, take tests, and prepare for exams—rarely anything practical. That’s why I’m here to ask a few questions:

  1)What can I start doing now to prepare for a meaningful and fulfilling career in civil engineering or a similar field?

  2)Can anyone recommend civil engineering universities in Europe? I’m not necessarily aiming for the top-ranked ones. I’m looking for a place where I can grow, learn, and still maintain a balanced life with time for hobbies and social life.

A bit more about me: I’m the kind of person who enjoys exploring and learning about different fields—from neuroscience to art. I already read a lot of books, including literature, biographies, and personal development. I believe books are only valuable if you apply what you learn from them in real life.
Lastly, while I love sports, I’m not trying to go pro. My goal is to stay active, healthy, and enjoy time with others doing outdoor activities.
If you’ve found happiness in your career or life path, or you work in civil/structural/transport engineering and have advice, I’d really appreciate your insights.
I will really appreciate any advice from any one.

Specifically i want to move into an accounts payable/receivable, or payroll, i dont really mind which, but from job descriptions and people ive spoken to i know its basically the same role as an Administrator, but a step up, less customer service and alot more pay 

Ive been looking for work for 6 months now, i fixed up my resume, ive been told by my job provider that on paper im a very desirable candidate (2 business degrees, been employed longterm, i have a car/licence etc,  but i dont have any references cause well, i work alone and my boss dosnt know im looking for another job)
Ive been getting job interviews for almost every job i apply to but its always been a no.
Ive had a couple close calls that i was the lesser option because my contract is 4 weeks notice to my current employer.

But i wanted to know if theres anything i can do/say to be more prepared for an accounts role, im good with numbers and i enjoy the work in general. 

I will say ive never actually had to be in a job interview before,  so it could well be that im flunking every question they ask me.

My backlog history has 11 backlogs but, I have cleared/passed them all. My GPA after the completion of this course would be between 6.5 to 6.8 Nothing more or nothing less than that. 

My college is affiliated to this university called Anna University. 

I'm from Tamil Nadu, India. 

I have been thinking of applying for job roles like junior management consultant or Market strategy analyst? 

Obviously, it's not like I'm gonna land a job right after my graduation. 

I need to upskill, probably build project work, get an internship and then I would be able to get a job. 

But, I just wanted to ask you if this whole junior management consultant or Market strategy analyst route is a viable career path or should I stick to coding?
I came to this conclusion because I wasn't aware of my own strengths and weaknesses. 

I know that ChatGPT isn't 100% credible all the time but I gave it some prompts to test my emotional intelligence, IQ, problem solving ability, analytical skills via questions and assess all of the aforementioned factors based on my answers

It's final verdict was that I showcase dialectical skills and ability to solve real world based case studies on a beginner level, it recommended that I would do well in fields like policy making or management/marketing where being able to conceive different nuances is considered to be a valuable asset
I wanna know what's your take on all of this. 

It's not like I can't do coding but, I wonder if I would ever be able to become a competent one. Maybe it's imposter syndrome? Maybe it's just me fear creeping in, I don't know.

I wanna know what's your take on all of this. 

I'm somewhat average when it comes to deriving logic for my coding problems but idk, I never really liked tech. I never keep myself up to date with tech news or tech updates, not because I'm lazy but, because tech never intrigued me.

I did learn coding for a few months until I stopped it cos my 7th semester exams started. 

To be honest, I never had a passion for coding. 

I was told that there would always be job openings for programmers and even a mid programmer could earn decent money. All I had to was just to learn Java, as I was told. 

I joined an engineering course like a sheep cos I didn't know of any other choice and my peers were doing so. I never did well in our labs. My mental health wasn't in a great stage, maybe that's why I couldn't do it? Nevertheless, I only studied to get marks and pass subjects. 

I'm learning Java via mooc course. 

I never had an interest in Java, I never had an interest in building any app, website, software, game or whatsoever. I learnt programming in those initial few months solely out of my desire to make decent pay to afford the kind of lifestyle I aspire to live. 

I'm not that much into business/marketing side either but, the only fields that I'm probably interested in are history, sociology, anthropology. I can't get myself into these purely cos pay in these fields aren't that great. 

The case studies related to business or management are interesting and it also feels good solving problems based on such case studies. 

ChatGPT suggested me job roles like Junior management consultant or Market strategy analyst. 

I asked for it to shortlist a bunch of job roles that are viable both in India and abroad, which would also enable me to apply for MBA. Jobs that would pay me a decent amount as a fresher so that I could live my dream life (my dream life being me able to buy self care products, favorite clothes, gym membership without relying on my parents money) 

This is a copy paste of the write-up which I sent to my uncle, so hope you guys wouldn't mind the singular, ""you"" in-between the lines.

I want to work to live not the other way around and I’m surrounded by workaholics that get pressed if they work less than 12 hours every day all year long. 

Luckily I haven’t put too much into my pension so I wouldn’t be leaving a lot on the table but the union benefits are solid and the salary is going to be nearly impossible to match but that’s what I’m willing to leave behind so 60+ year old me doesn’t have to keep putting on coveralls every day.

1kvlvfs,Feeling Stuck Because I Started WFH Early in My Career 💻➡️😓 (Need Advice!),"Hey folks, I’m Nikhil.

So here’s the deal — I started my career working from home (thanks to the pandemic era), and while it gave me experience, the salary was super low. Fast forward to now: I’ve completed my MBA in Digital Marketing and want to grow, but my salary just doesn’t reflect my skills or potential.

I can’t help but feel like if I had started in an office role, I’d be earning 2x or even 3x more by now. 😤 Now when I try to switch or ask for more, recruiters see my current salary and either lowball me or pass over me entirely.

It’s honestly frustrating. I know I’ve got the skills, and I’m hungry to grow — but this low starting point is really holding me back.

Has anyone else faced this? How do I break out of this low-salary trap and finally get what I deserve? 🙏

1kvk3yc,Considering An Informal Job Shadowing Type Thing Each Week... Ideas?,"I've just finished my junior year of high school in the US. I really have no idea on what I'd actually like to do as a job/career after high school/college. 

I'm considering an informal job shadowing type thing where I contact a bunch of local businesses in my area and see if I can check them out for a day, maybe once a week or so, especially over the summer. I'm definitely more into intellectual jobs over hard manual labor, but I'm very open.

  
As for interests, I've actually taken an EMT class because my school offered it for free, but I'm not sure if healthcare is for me considering either the work life balance or the immense schooling, and EMTs actually don't get paid very much.

I do feel like architecture could be cool, but I don't really want to sit around in a chair all day, and it's hard to tell if I'd like it/be good at it.

I like cameras?

Very into tech, but I have absolutely no coding or engineering experience.

I want jobs that create meaning, pay decently but have the opportunity to grow (I'd love to be able to start my own business), and allow you to think while still letting you move throughout the day.

I really want to be open, though. Some things can just be temporary, but the end goal is to find a long term career.

Any ideas? I'm not looking for the obvious, like ""sales"", but if you have a good case to make, please do! I'm very open, and I don't want to miss out on anything.

1kvk3sr,How do you know when it’s time to change paths — and trust it’s the right one? Feeling pulled toward acupuncture after years of being lost.,"Hi all — I’m at a big turning point in my life and would love some guidance from anyone who’s gone through a major career change, especially toward something more meaningful or aligned. This is a long one, but I truly appreciate anyone who takes the time to read and share their experience.

I have resonated with the Sylvia Plath fig tree analogy too much the past few years. Also exactly like treading water in the ocean, looking around and not seeing any land, so not knowing which direction to swim, but still losing energy and time.

I’m considering going back to school to become a licensed acupuncturist. For the first time in years, something feels *right* in my body when I think about this path. I casually thought about it a year ago when I was seeing a practitioner, but yesterday and today the clarity came rushing back. And—coincidentally or not—my friend told me that yesterday was the first day of my Saturn return. It all feels weirdly aligned. Anyone else experience this during theirs?

# A little background:

I moved to NYC to study advertising and marketing at FIT, mostly because it was the “cheapest” option for coming to the city where I felt like I needed to be and the major seemed broad and creative enough. But I never felt truly connected to it. I think I also came here to get away from family trauma. Since graduating 3 years ago, I’ve worked in restaurants, a store and a freelance marketing role, job searching every few months for a marketing job, nothing working out and giving up and repeating that cycle over and over, since I have felt like that's what I need to do for work since that's what I went to school for.

I’m currently in a part-time marketing role, but honestly, I’m just… tired. I’m creative, but I’ve realized I don’t love promoting other people’s ideas. I want to be the one *creating* something original, not promoting and finding ways to share others' creations — something that feels healing and meaningful. And marketing just hasn’t fulfilled that for me yet. I feel like with the worsening state of the world, a lot of it feels very meaningless and like I'm not improving the world or people's lives. I also can't see myself working behind a computer all the time, I don't like that. It’s always felt like I’ve been forcing it because it’s what my degree is in. I don't know if I should keep trying or when to change paths.

I also carry A LOT of guilt. I have around $70K in student debt. My mom has been helping with payments. My dad had told us all growing up that he was saving for college, he was the sole-income as an electrical engineer and made a lot for living in the midwest. But after my parents divorced during my late teens, we were each handed “college funds” with just $1,500, halfway though my degree. It was a huge shock. My mom, a former stay-at-home mom, had to take a grocery store job when they separated and where she still works. So now I live with this tension of wanting to explore other paths but feeling like I’ve already wasted so much time and money. AND A LOT of guilt of my mom paying for this degree I'm not even using, when she doesn't even make much money.

# Why I’m drawn to acupuncture:

Health, healing, and the mind–body connection have always been incredibly important to me. They guide almost every part of my life. Acupuncture helped me a lot in recent years, and the more I learn about it, the more I feel pulled toward it.

I’ve also dreamed for years of eventually owning a wellness retreat or bed and breakfast maybe outside the mountains. I’d love to host people in beautiful, nature-filled environments and offer healing services like acupuncture, yoga, or facials. That blend of design, care, nature, and creativity feels like *me* in a way no job ever has. I've had a pinterest board for maybe a year of what I envision the brand to look like that excites me.

# My questions:

I guess I’m asking for advice from anyone who’s been in a similar place — stuck, burnt out, unsure if you’re making the “right” move:

* How do you **know** when it’s the right time to make a change?
* How do you deal with the fear of starting over, especially in your late 20s? I'm 26.5 and already feel too old and time is lost.
* Have you ever made a leap into something totally different — and how did you trust yourself enough to do it?
* How do you manage guilt about student debt or past “wrong” decisions when considering a new path?
* What helped you confirm that your new path was the right one — even when it felt risky? How do I know I'm not just being manic and unrealistic?
* How do I know that I won't be in the same place I am now post that degree?

I know I’m not actually “old” at 26, but I’ve been feeling stuck and behind for so long. And something about this — maybe Saturn return energy — feels like the door opening I’ve been waiting for. I just want to make sure I’m not running away from something… but moving toward the right thing. I've considered yoga, pilates, facialist, physical therapist, nutritionist or even interior architecture or product design because I have always been very creative and art focused in every aspect of my life as well. **So I also get nervous of making a decision and losing out on that other side of me.** But acupuncture seems like it might check most of my boxes for me?

I want to share a practical and strategic plan for those of you currently struggling to land your first job.

By profession, I’m a Product Manager, but over the past several months, I’ve been closely involved in helping fresh graduates and job seekers find their footing in today’s competitive job market. One thing is clear—breaking in as a fresher is hard. And if months go by without landing a role, that ""career gap"" can become even harder to explain later.

So, I decided to take a different approach.

I’ve officially launched my own EdTech startup—complete with a domain, website, and all the necessary legal formalities. The goal? To provide meaningful support for freshers who are currently stuck in the job hunt. Instead of showing a gap, you can show that you’ve been gaining real experience.

Here’s how I can help:

Internship / Experience Letters
Salary Slips
Relieving Letters

These documents can be useful if you’re:

A fresher struggling to land your first job

Trying to build your resume with relevant experience

Applying for roles that expect a work history or experience

Aiming to show continuity and professionalism in your career path


On top of that, I can also help you get placed in private companies through my network and startup collaborations.

If this sounds useful to you or someone you know, feel free to reach out. Let’s be smart, strategic, and supportive of each other in this tough job market.

Yes, there is a fee involved. And if you’re skeptical—that’s fair.
I encourage you to read reviews, feedback, and ask questions. If you still feel this could benefit you, I’d be glad to connect and help.

My goal is simple: to ensure you don’t feel like your time is being wasted just because your first job isn’t materializing immediately. Instead, let’s use that time to build something credible and valuable.

1kvgboy,Pharmacist needing Career advice’s,"I’m 29, currently working as an independent prescribing pharmacist in the UK. I’m on about £70k a year — decent, sure — but I’ve always aimed higher. My long-term goal is to hit £150k+ and I’m willing to work hard for it. I just want to know I’m investing my time in the right direction.

The truth is, I don’t enjoy pharmacy. It feels repetitive, underpaid for the pressure, and I just don’t see a future in it that excites me anymore.

When I was 23, I lost my entire inheritance — around £170k — trying to trade stocks. One of the worst decisions of my life, and I’ve never really recovered from it. It’s something that still affects me mentally, every single day. There’s this constant feeling that I’m trying to catch up or fix that damage.

Recently, I’ve been seriously considering going back to uni to study medicine and become a GP. My sister’s a GP so I know the lifestyle and earning potential. It sounds way better than being a pharmacist in a lot of ways. But medicine is a long road — another 5 years of med school, plus foundation years and GP training. I’d be in my late 30s by the time I’m fully qualified, and that feels like a big gamble.

On the other hand, I’ve always been drawn to tech. I’ve done some coding certifications, got my AWS Cloud Practitioner, and I’m now working on the AWS Associate cert. I also have a Level 7 diploma in leadership and management. I’ve thought about software engineering, cyber security, cloud architecture — maybe even starting my own tech company one day. But I keep hesitating because I don’t know if it’s too late, or if I’m just wasting time exploring instead of committing.

Right now I feel stuck. Like I’m doing everything and nothing. At 29, it feels like I’ve run out of room to experiment. Every decision feels high-stakes. I just want to get onto a clear path that can actually lead somewhere — where I can grind for 10–15 years and come out financially stable and mentally at peace.

If anyone here has switched careers late, gone from healthcare to tech, or taken a leap and made it work — I’d love to hear from you. I’m open to advice, honesty, even hard truths. Just trying to find some clarity.

1kvfwao,Should I leave a stable job for a higher-paying role at a smaller startup?,"I’m trying to decide whether to leave a stable and flexible job at a large company for a more intense role at a smaller one with more risk and potentially more reward. 

Currently I'm in a manager making $137K base with 15–20% bonus, great 401k (19% total with company contributions), low-cost healthcare, and a very flexible schedule. I regularly come in when I want, sometimes I'm done by 3:30, and I can work from home if I want though I try to be in office most days. I'm good at what I do, and I have a ton of really great relationships I've built, but I'm bored. While I've grown consistently in my time there, I'm starting to hit stagnation due to not having enough time in role, so the next promotion wouldn't happen until next year, at the earliest.

The new offer is a Senior Manager role at a smaller, startup-ish company. $170K base, 25% bonus, stock options, and a possible Director promotion in 6 months. But healthcare is $14K more per year, no discretionary 401k contribution, and it's fully in-office, with the expectation that I would be there every day, likely with little flexibility to leave early. The company has a lot of plans for growth, but they are in the midst of new regulatory changes that I'm uncertain what the impact will be.

I’d make about $35K more per year after costs. But I’d be giving up lifestyle and stability for potential growth and bigger impact. My family doesn't necessary NEED this money, but it would certainly help us achieve some of our goals sooner.

1kveuix,Working hard And Getting Abused By Site Manager,So I work a stocking job where this place has strict standards. Cases are counted for each stocker and each stocker must stick 45 cases per hour at least. I have many years stocking experience and started with this company a year ago. I came in right out the gate owning my isles. Stocking 60 cases per hour thanks to my experience with this type of work. Management loved my obviously and soon after took me off my aisles I was working to a new aisles are much more difficult than the others. For example my new total case count on average is about 250 per night that I'm still running at 60 cases per hour. What makes this aisle more challenging is it's alot of heavy items. Lots of big cases of water. All my other coworkers aisles are rarely more than 190 cases per hour and light easy to stock items. We all get paid the same. 8 months into me working my harder aisles I've become burnt out and my body is hurting. I've asked the site manager multiple times if i can switch aisles. But she won't let me. I'm not stuck with this hard aisles that are hurting my body. My hard work got me suckered into the most difficult spot to work in the store and the manager refuses to move me. Of course she wouldn't move the best worker out of the hardest aisles. I've bummed about this and already looking for new jobs. But I'm very short tempered now and every night I just wanna walk out. Any advice besides the obvious that is change jobs??,MrSimsational,2,1.0,4,1748212025,2025-05-25 22:27:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kveuix/working_hard_and_getting_abused_by_site_manager/,5,2025

1kvdzvc,Not sure whether to quit after manager tanked my reputation,"I’ve been at the company several years now. Our team was created from scratch.

Onboarding was poor, we were given minimal training and thrown straight into things. We were also told there was a massive backlog of work that had built up that we were inheriting and were expected to resolve this ourselves. 
Making things worse was the Manager who had severe issues with micromanagement and took any suggestions of continuous improvement as a personal slight (outright called me arrogant in a team meeting when I suggested our data management could be better organised). We were all remote workers so rarely interacted with one another, it was mostly work between us and the manager. 
Things came to a head when I went on holiday, I worked with the manager in the preceding weeks to create a plan so that all my high priority work was completed or covered before I left however in the week before leaving he threw multiple “top priority, must be completed by end of week” pieces of work at me. Consequently I didn’t get everything on my original list done before I left. 
When I got back I was blindsided by him telling me I was being placed on a PIP. This was a complete shock since, by the numbers, I’m the highest performer in the team. 
I was embarrassed about the whole thing and internalised it all, accepting the feedback that I was the problem. So I made sure the terms of the PIP were specific and worked extra hard to meet them. Passed the PIP with flying colours and while HR acted like it was an incredible success, I got a comment from the manager that he thought it was “just a temporary show of effort before I slipped back into old habits”.
Shortly after this, within a 2 month period, all of my team apart from myself handed in their notices one by one. It hadn’t been planned but as it turned out, they had all been experiencing similar issues with the manager and had had enough. All of them got exit interviews where they singled out the manager as the sole source for leaving.
Not long after the manager gets shuffled off to a new team and we get a new manager (and new hires). However I’ve been unable to shake the feeling that the old manager has poisoned the well, someone I know in a different team mentioned my old manager had told people I was lazy and not to trust my work. Biggest red flag was my new manager discussing areas of improvement in my end of year review and repeating verbatim some comments made by the previous manager. 
Its the sad thing that I love working at the company and I know the job markets rough at the moment. There aren’t many jobs that pay this well for my level of experience.

1kvcduf,Career Advice (23M),"I just completed my BCA, and now I’m trying to figure out my next steps. Before pursuing this degree, I worked as a video editor for around 5 years. While I gained a lot of experience, the toxic work environment I faced during that time really burned me out, and I honestly don’t want to go back to video editing.

Back in 9th grade, I got into web development and have been learning and building ever since. Along the way, I also picked up app development, and now I have a solid portfolio across all three fields — video editing, web dev, and app dev.

The problem is, I’m stuck. I’m confused about what I should pursue. Every time I lean toward one path, I feel like I’m letting go of the others, and that really weighs on me. It’s depressing, honestly. I feel like no matter what I choose, I’ll be missing out on something else I enjoy or have built up.

Deep down, I want to contribute to society — but not by working for some generic service-based company where all I do is create cookie-cutter websites, apps, or promotional videos that don’t mean anything to me. I don’t want to make things just for the sake of marketing or replicating what’s already been done a hundred times. I want to work on something that feels meaningful or interesting — something that makes a real impact.

But then reality kicks in. I know we all have to survive. And survival often means doing things we’re not passionate about. That’s the frustrating part. I *do* know what I want to do — the kind of projects that give me joy and a sense of purpose — but those don’t necessarily pay the bills. It’s like I’m stuck in this puzzle with no clear answer, and it’s honestly exhausting.",arn_noz,1,1.0,0,1748205295,2025-05-25 20:34:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kvcduf/career_advice_23m/,5,2025
1kvbuqs,Looking for advice on next steps for career,"Looking for advice on career/job change

Hi everyone, 

I need some help with figuring out what to do next with my career and jobs in general. I'm getting increasingly burnt out in my current place and am being strung along by a senior manager on the promise of a promotion which I don't believe will ever occur. I am 28 year old male currently based in Scotland. I am looking for a job with better hours that my current 9am to 6pm with similar or better rate of pay. I currently have a base salary of 27k per year, but with the bonus structure that I am on, I am essentially guaranteed 30-31k per year as things stand. Ideally, my next job could be a 5+ year type of job leading to a career that I could stay in for a long time, as the 5 year plan currently involves a mortgage and wedding.

For current context, I'm currently working in a call centre doing collections for car finance. I've been working here 2.5 years and am one of the best agents in my department by pretty much any metric (the aforementioned senior manager called my performance over past 15 months ""exceptional"" in our private meeting regarding progression). I enjoy the parts where I get to help people struggling with their situation but as per most workplaces, I get easily fed up with the endless bureaucracy and corporate nonsense, with good workers going unrewarded and poor workers going unpunished because the management doesn't want to break the fragile equilibrium. 

Before this I worked for 2 years in a hospitality/retail environment (gaming cafe) with the majority of that time spent as the assistant manager. 

Prior to this I worked for family business in recruitment sector, mostly as a resourcer (admin and searching for CVs) with some movement into cold call recruitment before I left.

My education is a double honours BA in Journalism and Politics. 

If any further info is needed please feel free to request some info, I would be happy to provide if asked. If anyone has any ideas what kind of directly I could go, I would be very grateful.",Deadshot2802,1,1.0,0,1748203910,2025-05-25 20:11:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kvbuqs/looking_for_advice_on_next_steps_for_career/,5,2025

1kvalqm,Engineer switch to Medicine or Dentistry?,"Mid 20s career crisis,

I'm in my mid 20s currently working for one of the FAANG with around 160-200k yearly salary (depending on stocks). Just got accepted into dental school & waitlisted for med school. I would like some advice on whether I should make a complete career switch and get into healthcare. Although at first glance this seem like a dumb question as I'm already making a lot, I think medical field especially Dentistry might be a better option in the long term. I would start by listing out the cons in tech:

Cons:  
\- **No job stability**: you can be making 500k and still lose your job because of layoffs and stack ranking which basically rank you against your fellow engineers and the bottom performer gets fired at each performance cycle. Some companies (such as mine) even has mandatory firing rate, where they have to fire x% of engineers per cycle to keep the talent fresh.  My manager quote on quote told me ""**You are expected to always improve and be better than your peers cuz thats how a fast pace company work, people are becoming more intelligent everyday and its your job to keep up**"".  Being promoted to a manager wouldn't help neither as companies are actually looking to trim down managerial positions so even if in your late 30s or 40s you can still get fired and I personally know manager who worked at the company for 15+ years and got fired just like that. What's the point of making so much salary if you get fired the next year.

\- **Insane bar for Interview:** Interviewing for a new job feels like taking a mini-MCAT all over again. You need to prep for LeetCode problems which are just coding brainteasers that have zero relevance to your actual job. Everyone I know who landed a top-tier job solved 300–500 problems (around 500-1000 hours of prep). Then you just have to hope the interviewer doesn’t throw you something ridiculously hard and unless you’ve already seen the question, you're probably not solving it in under an hour. If you fail even one question, regardless of having the right approach, you can get disqualified. Seniority doesn’t help in interviews so you’ll be grinding like everyone else and competing with people half of your age but whose brains are just faster than yours.

\- **Office politics** : You can get fired over the dumbest shit ever, toxic manager can nitpick on your work and throw some bs company values at you saying you are not good enough even after you did all the dirty work. My manager quote on quote  Basically you always feel like you're on thin ice and just a number. I once almost got fired because I took 1 month and half approved vacation, but then a reorg happened and the new manager was trying to fire me because they need to pick someone on the list and I had the least datapoint because I took time off during the cycle.  Lot of time I honestly just wanna smack them in their dumb face and tell them how dumb and hypocrite they are.

\- **AI** : all engineers I know are using AI to write their code, while it helps ease up the difficulty of the job, I believe in the future companies are going to hire less and less because of it.

\- **oncall** : you don't get paid for on-call and you can get paged anytime during your oncall rotation and you are expected to answer even on weekend.

Pros:

\- Not having to go back to school

\- Remote job opportunity

\- No overhead

\- Can start my life earlier (buy house, car, getting married)

For reference my partner is a dentist who just graduated and she is working 4 days a week and still making more than my yearly salary. She has incredible wlb and can spend the weekend not having to do some stupid coding problem or worry about losing their job as their interview is more of just a vibe check.

For context the university I got accepted is in Canada where the tuition is very low for med/dent. Yearly tuition is around 15-20k for Dentistry and 10k for Med. So I could technically graduate by 30-31 with minimal debt. However, I do want to take my partner into the equation as well as it would mean delaying our plans by 5 years, and I’m unsure how that dynamic would play out in the relationship.

**Dentistry**

This is my 1st option because I can graduate in 5 years and make 200-300k right after school while not having to deal with none of the cons I mentionned above. It also gives me the opportunity of becoming an owner/specialist and making even more money in my late 30s & 40s (Possibly 500k - 1M).

However if I'm wrong please let me know redditors.

**Medicine:**

2nd option cuz at least 7 years and I heard family medicine wlb is pretty bad with all the paperwork and quota from the government. It is cheaper than dentistry and you get the ""prestige"" of being a real MD but I don't think money wise it's that different than a general dentist unless you specialize. But then again speciality will be another 5 years of residency and I think the opportunity cost is just not worth it at that point. Again, please let me know if i'm wrong on this.

If you made it this far, thank you for bearing through my complains and any feedback or advice would be really really appreciated!

Side Note: Both fields also allow me to incorporate which can save a ton of taxes( \~20%), something I can't do in Tech.

1kva8ze,I lost what was nearly a perfect job. Bed bound due to depression and unable to move forward in life.,"So unlike most people here I can't blame restructuring lay offs on the company. It was me, my manager and the misunderstanding that happened along the way between us. I was fired 6 days before my probation came to an end. They said I just wasn't a good fit. I had felt that for once in my life I had something that could've been stable, secure, work life balance government position and could have set me up for a very long time. It was the first time in 15 years since I was a teenager in poverty that I felt like there was a better future. A vision and dream that I could build upon finally. That I didn't have to just survive anymore. I could accumulate, grow, finally get married, leave my mum's place and buy a house, Work a decent job that didn't exploit me, I can almost see the horizon as I entered into my 30s.
Then out of nowhere it was all ripped away from me. I blame myself. I keep feeling like I self sabotaged or imploded. Something went wrong and I could've done more or soemthing differently to not be fired.


Now I'm totally bed bound. I don't do anything but lay in bed, ruminate, game and browse reddit to feel something again. I can't afford mental health help.
I told myself I was finally gonna get the energy to go for a walk right now but then like a stab in the heart that layoff hit me again and I crawled back into bed. Angry, depressed and afraid. Thoughts of what if this and that, if only I had done so and so, how my life would've been different, how I wouldve been happier, I would've had a future etc. But now it just seems like everything is gone. I will never get a job like this again. Day by day my mental health declines and I don't know what to do. I will die in misery, poverty and as a failure who almost made it. A total loser in life.

I effecticely ended my own life before it began and now will lay down in its shattered pieces. ",aldjfh,116,0.949999988079071,44,1748199720,2025-05-25 19:02:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kva8ze/i_lost_what_was_nearly_a_perfect_job_bed_bound/,5,2025
1kva1g0,"Drained from being an assistant in Hollywood, debating leaving the industry entirely","(26F) I worked at a talent agency for 1.5 years on a double-desk, making about $50k/yr, working bad hours and dealing with 2 crazy bosses. Then I moved on to work at a movie studio, making around $60k/yr, also on a double-desk, with okay bosses but still bad hours and mindless work, where I have been for just over a year now.

I don’t have an end goal to work in movies (I don’t have any career/end goals in general — I used to think I wanted to work in entertainment, but I don't care anymore), and for the past 2.5 years of working in Hollywood I have been consistently bored out of my mind. My average workday at each job has been the same — scheduling, phone calls, expenses, scheduling, arranging travel, escorting talent/executives, scheduling. Also I’m barely making any actual money, because most of it just goes back to paying rent each month.

My current bosses' last assistant was there for almost 3 years before they promoted her, and they seemed to adore her (and they still call me her name accidentally pretty often) and they would meet with her often to discuss career goals. I’ve scheduled just 15 minutes with them 4 times now because we haven’t sat down ONCE since I started to discuss performance/goals/etc., and they keep telling me they are too busy and for me to schedule our meeting later, so I’ve given up on scheduling time with them after 4 tries, and they haven’t brought it up either.

I haven’t learned a single new thing since I started, and I want to leave but would feel ashamed for doing so because 1) legit everyone seems happy here, especially since assistants in my department stay on their desks for 3–4 years before moving up 2) the benefits/insurance plan are good.

Everything is so insanely boring to me, and I thought I would like moving out after college and living in LA but I am terrible at making (and especially keeping) friends, and I never leave my apartment except to grocery shop and go to the gym. I prefer living alone (what I’m doing currently), but I feel like it makes more sense to move back home and live with my parents and quit my job because 1) I’m not learning ANYTHING and my bosses don’t care to teach me after asking them multiple times, 2) I’m barely making any $ since it all goes back to LA rent, 3) I have no friends/hobbies here in LA that I would miss, 4) “burning bridges” doesn’t matter to me in Hollywood because I have no desire to work in entertainment anymore.

I'm just not sure if I should hold out for another year to complete the 2-year job commitment ""rule"" (and because commitment looks better on resumes?), and to see if I maybe learn something new, and because people tell me how lucky I am to work at a movie studio since the film industry hiring is really slow/competitive. 

TLDR: burnt out after 2 years of working as an executive assistant in the entertainment industry in LA and want to quit despite potentially burning bridges, not learning anything new, low pay, incredibly bored but afraid to give up many people's ""dream"" opportunity that could open doors for better future opportunities.",badassbuffy,13,0.9399999976158142,6,1748199180,2025-05-25 18:53:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kva1g0/drained_from_being_an_assistant_in_hollywood/,5,2025

I want to go back to college for something thats hands on but something i can still make good money from- i cant do office work and medical things disgust me. I would get into construction or welding but i feel like all blue collar jobs take 40+ years to start making enough to actually survive living in the US. I've been thinking about going into electrical engineering but honestly i have no clue what their job even is? what ive picked up on is they just problem solve instead of actually making the things they design. if i could stay in automotive work and survive i would but i cant live off of $13 an hour until im ""experienced enough""
possibly important information- i have ADD so i cant be doing the kind of work where i just sit at a laptop all day and socialize with people trying to make myself look like my life is soo much better than theirs.. 

basically i need something hands on and real physical work with hopefully more than a 35k salary- everything im interested in i wont be able to survive until im 67 years old and i cant wait that long to start living life. if you can offer any advice or career options to consider please do- sorry this is kind of a word spaghetti but idk how else to format this",s3rennn,2,1.0,5,1748198981,2025-05-25 18:49:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kv9ytc/im_lost_looking_for_a_good_career_path_to_follow/,5,2025

1kv91co,I chose the wrong degree and feel lost. What are my options?,"
I have a teaching degree but realized it is not a good fit for me. I prefer a pink- or white-collar job, even if the pay is decent $40,000–$50,000 in my current low COL area or the equivalent of $60,000–$70,000 in my previous higher-cost-of-living area. 

My experience includes one to two years in food service, one year in home renovation, and six months as a ramp/gate agent for American Airlines (I will continue this job and return after my upcoming internship). I have an upcoming internship that is somewhat related to education, but it could also be described as human resources and light office work. 

I would like a job with more independent work and autonomy, even in a team or client-facing role—something as closely related to nursing, but preferably a little less involved. However, I do not want a sales job requiring extensive talking, negotiating, or convincing. I value work-life balance and do not want anything involving extensive manual labor, driving, or trades. 

I would be willing to earn certificates, pursue additional training, or even go back to school, but only if it were close to a guaranteed career boost. I would describe myself as logical, able to meet deadlines, and comfortable handling fast-paced environments while also being fine with a slower pace. I enjoy analytical tasks like math but am not good with creative tasks like writing. 

Also, this is mostly unrelated to work and not important, but I love the ocean—so if any job has a chance of being connected to it, that would be amazing.

If any one as any advice or suggested careers I should check out I would Appreciate it!",AnxiousBrilliant3,2,1.0,3,1748196581,2025-05-25 18:09:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kv91co/i_chose_the_wrong_degree_and_feel_lost_what_are/,5,2025
1kv8wdl,Not sure if I should stay at my current job...,"Hi! I've been working remotely for a company for the past few years. About a month ago, I went on FMLA/Short term disability because I was diagnosed with cancer and had  surgery. There was a meeting about having some of us flex onto other job roles. They want to transition us into doing phone work (very call center-esk). I used to work for a call center on a temporary basis and I was very happy when the assignment was over. They wanted to hire me full-time, but I declined because of mental health reasons. I applied to my current job specifically to avoid call center work, but now that's what it's looking like. I go back to work next week, but I need to take fmla/std again in 2-3 months because I need to have a 2nd surgery/more treatments. I wanna ask my boss to hold off on flex training until at least my 2nd surgery is done...but I'm kinda scared to ask? Also, if they do transition our current roles into a more call center-esk job...I'm not sure if I'm willing to stay. I don't mind making phone calls, but taking them back to back was something I wanted to avoid. However, I do need the health insurance due to cancer. Any advice is welcome.

I got in trade school last year, which I had to stop because I wasn’t making enough in winter and had bills to pay. It is electrical, i wanna keep learning and make my own company later on (this is my plan #1) but being a foreigner here is HARD. 

Everything is more complicated to get (loans, status, etc) and that means more money to spend.

I have two jobs rn, restaurant and paint retail.

My second job is a part time one. I’ve worked at amazon, coffee shops and this is the one that i’ve liked the most so far. At least i’m learning a lot about painting.

Going to college looks so far for me, you might know why. 

I just wanna have basic stuff in my life: Education, a job where I can develop and then, depending of how everything goes having a family.

I’m a hard worker person, i know why i came here but sometimes i just need to rant a little bit you know? With that said, what would you recommend me guys?

1kv1y10,Want a Raise Without Asking? Here's How to Make It Happen,"Hey everyone,

Navigating salary discussions can be tricky, especially when directly asking for a raise feels daunting. But what if you could position yourself for a raise without ever uttering the words?

I recently explored this topic in my latest article, [How to Ask for a Raise Without Asking](https://thebrightpost.com/ask-for-a-raise-without-asking/), where I delve into strategies like:

* **Highlighting your value** through documented achievements
* **Initiating career development conversations** with your manager
* **Researching market compensation benchmarks** to inform discussions
* **Timing your conversations** around performance reviews or recent successes

These approaches can subtly shift the conversation toward compensation without the discomfort of a direct ask.

I'd love to hear your thoughts or experiences on this topic. Have any of you successfully navigated a raise without directly asking? Share your stories or tips!

Looking forward to the discussion.",NickBp5779,0,0.33000001311302185,0,1748177965,2025-05-25 12:59:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kv1y10/want_a_raise_without_asking_heres_how_to_make_it/,5,2025
1kv1txh,"How do you become a nurse when you're alone, working full-time, and have bills to pay?","I’m 30 years old, and I really want to become a nurse, specifically starting with an LPN program. I've done my research, shadowed, talked to people in the field, and I know this is the direction I want to go. But I feel completely stuck.

I have no support system, no family to lean on, no partner to share the load. I’m on my own. I work an office job from 8AM to 5PM that barely pays the bills, but it's stable, and it's the only reason I can afford to keep a roof over my head right now.

I truly, maybe naively, believed I would find an LPN program that offered evening or weekend classes, something that understood working adults exist. But almost every evening program I’ve found in or near Nashville, TN starts at 2 or 3 in the afternoon. If I enrolled, I’d have to leave work early every day and that would mean losing my job. And if I lose this job, I lose everything.

I've thought about switching to restaurant or retail work for flexible hours, but even those wouldn’t pay enough to replace my current income. I haven’t worked in that kind of setting in nearly a decade, and it feels unstable and risky, especially when you’re completely on your own.

What really crushes me is that whenever I ask nurses how they managed school, the answer is almost always the same:

 “Oh, my spouse supported me”
“My parents helped with bills and childcare”
“I moved back home while I went to school”



I don’t have that. And it hurts so much to feel like pursuing something meaningful, something that could actually change my life, is only possible if you have someone else footing the bill. Is that the only way this works? Are people like me just shut out?

I’m not afraid of hard work. I’m not afraid of school. I’m not even afraid of the debt. I’m just afraid of having to choose between chasing a dream and staying afloat. And I’m scared that no matter how hard I try, I’ll never be able to afford to take that first step.

If anyone out there has walked this path without a safety net: how did you do it? How did you manage to stay alive and pay bills while chasing something better?",nenanette,1,0.5600000023841858,9,1748177615,2025-05-25 12:53:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kv1txh/how_do_you_become_a_nurse_when_youre_alone/,5,2025

1kv0svv,Torn between 2 courses.,"Hey! I’m currently confused between two career options — Dentistry and Occupational Therapy (OT).
Dentistry
	•	It takes about 5 years for the bachelor’s, and then 3–4 more years if I go for a master’s or specialization.
	•	I’m genuinely interested in dentistry and think I’d probably enjoy doing it long-term.
	•	But the job market feels really saturated, especially in tier-3 countries, which makes me wonder about future opportunities.
	•	Salary-wise, it can be moderate to high, especially with experience. It might end up paying more than OT, but only after years of study and practice.

Occupational Therapy (OT)
	•	The course is 4 years + 2 years for a master’s.
	•	It becomes more interesting later on — I’m especially curious about neuro OT, which seems kind of cool and meaningful.
	•	The demand for OTs is high in tier-3 countries, which makes it feel like a safer option in terms of finding a job.
	•	The salary is moderate, not as high as dentistry in the long run, but there’s good scope and demand right after graduation.",GlumDatabase_,1,1.0,0,1748174234,2025-05-25 11:57:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kv0svv/torn_between_2_courses/,5,2025

1kuzixq,Scored at the borderline in an offline exam — is there still a chance I might get an interview?,"Hi everyone,
I’m currently in a bit of a dilemma and would really appreciate some honest perspectives.

I recently appeared for an offline test as part of a hiring process. Unlike online exams where copying is possible, this one was completely monitored and strict. There were other candidates present as well, but I was the only one who performed well in the test, even though my score came out to be just at the borderline, slightly below the official cutoff.

After the test, the HR who conducted and coordinated the exam told me she would speak to the manager and let me know the final decision. She didn’t promise anything, but mentioned she’d convey the situation.

Now I’m left wondering — is there actually a chance that someone in this position might still be considered for an interview, especially when others didn’t do well and someone from the internal team is willing to vouch for them? Or do companies usually stick firmly to their cutoff scores, no matter the context?

Would love to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation or has insight into how these decisions are typically made.

1kuxecv,Becoming less career-driven and slipping into fatalism because of AI,"I currently work in a corporate job and have been doing so for a number of years. What I've noticed with the rise of AI is that I'm finding it increasingly difficult to keep a career-driven mindset.

In the pre AI era, it was easy to set long-term career goals and work towards them. In my case, my goal was to get promoted and eventually rise up to a Director level position. The pathway seemed clear and I more or less knew what kind of skills and experiences I needed to have to get there.

Today, everything seems to be different. The Damocles sword of AI automation is hanging over us. AI is getting better and better. Since the release of ChatGPT two and a half years ago, I've become increasingly convinced that it's only a matter of time until AI will be better and much faster at everything that I do in my current job. No or only minimal human input will be needed and the job market in my field will dry out.

I should develop new skills that complement AI, I hear you say. But that's not easy for everyone. It's not easy for me. Furthermore, I fail to see how that offers me any real long term prospects. Some jobs will be automated by AI a couple of years sooner than others, but I believe that AI will eventually take over all knowledge-based jobs.

Given the seemingly inevitable future where my skill set has no marketable value anymore, I'm becoming increasingly fatalistic about my career (and honestly my future in general). I don't see the point anymore in going the extra mile to advance my career.

Two jobs are part time during the day which I bounce and forth on. One of the jobs I'm able to have holidays and summer off so I work at my other day job during those times. My third job is full time during the night. I work M-F, getting up at 7am and falling asleep 3am the next day. My day job starts at 8am and my night job ends 2am the next day. Basically I work almost 15 hours (including lunch), not including commute time which is 1-1.5 hours extra.

I'm financially stable, however, I live in a 4 person household where only me and another person work, sometimes just me, gratefully when it's 3 people. I pay my bills and half of rent. I pay a total of 2 car insurances and 3 phone bills, and weekly groceries for 2 people or 4 people. Sometimes I put money towards savings, sometimes I don't.

I recently am trying to lose fat and build muscles so since the beginning of this year, I've been working out 2x weekly, only on weekends, and being on a calorie deficit. However, with lack of sleep (getting minimum of 4 hours and max 6 hours bc I take multiple naps), I haven't seen progress.

I now just started my Master's degree (online school) the beginning of this month and unfortunately have to pay out of pocket due to not receiving financial aid and too busy to even apply for scholarships, leaving me to pay $1K+ monthly. Mind you, I'm only take 1-2 classes a semester. I wanted to take 3 years but since I'm paying out of pocket with no help, it's gonna take me 6-7 years.

I'm exhausted. I'm working 2-3 jobs, working out, sleeping less, going to school, and not getting any financial help. I try to have a life outside of work such as going to sports games, concerts, food events, and hanging out with friends. However, with all my bills and tuition, I now have little to no money to pay for more of these events. I have already paid for some in advance but with gas, merch, food, etc I need to spend wisely.

1kuulkl,How to act in a corporate world,"I just started my corporate job in one of the biggest companies in the entire world, the biggest one in its sector. I was lucky enough to also land a position in one of the most important departments, to give you an idea, we directly report to HQ, same as the office manager. No other department (maybe one does) in the ladder you can say I’m already 2 steps ahead of most departments. When I started, the office manager asked me to keep visiting him every week and update him on my training and progress, which I been doing, when I told my manager about it (2 months into the company, he asked me where I was and I told him I was speaking to him) he said to never do that, that everyone in this world (corporate) is a snake, and I do understand his point of view, he told me that we have nothing to do with him and I should only talk to him or my co worker if there is ever something I need, “we are our only family” in his words, to keep him very limited and formal with others (we are 3 in my city, 15 overall in the whole USA). That’s how small my department is. My question for today is, what do I do? I understand and agree with him, what I say to someone he will say it to the next guy, and so on, but part of me tells me to keep the people in important departments and the managers close, not to the point that we are friends, but to the point that I am on their good side, on the other note, my manager and mentor has been in the industry for 40 years, he has worked in the biggest companies out there and at one point he controlled the whole United States, right now he wants to retire and is looking for a successor (me), thus he is teaching me everything and anything he knows, and I have learned everything like he wanted. Sometimes he is hard to deal with but I got the catch and I handle him pretty well. 
How does this corporate work and ladder work? Is it truly the best option to just do my thing with my department? I do not have to impress anybody but my branch manager, but maybe in a future situation that “I like him” from someone can be crucial.

1kuukpp,Lenny’s Podcast is the best way to learn product - here’s the full reading list his guests recommend,"During my time as a PM at Duolingo, one of the most consistently useful habits I developed was listening to Lenny’s Podcast. It wasn’t just a passive thing - it genuinely helped shape how I think about product, org design, communication, and leadership. Some of my closest friends at Meta, Airbnb, Stripe, etc. all say the same - we’d forward episodes to each other and unpack them like study groups.

Over time, I noticed something interesting: nearly every guest on the podcast would casually mention a book (or five) that deeply shaped how they lead or build. And the same titles kept coming up.

So I finally sat down and organized it all - here’s the full list of the most recommended books from Lenny’s podcast. I grouped them by theme, added who recommended them (including their role + company), and included a short summary of why it matters. If you care about becoming a better builder, manager, or thinker, I hope this helps.

Product Management & Strategy
  - Inspired: A foundational read on building products people actually love (Marily Nika, AI PM @ Meta)
  - The Innovator’s Dilemma: Why even great companies miss disruption (Ken Norton, exec coach, ex-Google PM)
  - Crossing the Chasm: A classic on taking products from early adopters to the mainstream (Emily Kramer, ex-Asana)
  - Obviously Awesome: Positioning done right makes everything else easier (Emily Kramer)
  - Monetizing Innovation: Start with pricing, not just ideas (Naomi Ionita, Partner @ Menlo Ventures)
  - Positioning: Still relevant decades later for how customers perceive your product (Arielle Jackson, First Round)

Leadership & Management
  - High Output Management: Practical systems thinking from Intel’s former CEO (Patrick Campbell, ProfitWell)
  - Dare to Lead: Trust and vulnerability at the core of good leadership (Brené Brown, rec’d by Ken)
  - The Score Takes Care of Itself: Build the culture first, results will follow (Pete Kazanjy, Atrium)
  - Working Backwards: How Amazon builds from first principles (Ravi Mehta, ex-CPO @ Tinder)

But the truth is, most of us in product barely finish books anymore. We want to - but after nonstop meetings, diving into a 400-page hardcover just isn’t realistic.

I genuinely recommend a couple tools that help me keep learning, even with a packed schedule:

1) Snipd: lets me bookmark podcast moments so I can revisit insights later instead of forgetting them.

2) BeFreed: It’s a smart reading & book summary app a bunch of friends in product also use. It breaks down those 600-page books into a 20-minute podcast and a 40-minute deep dive - no fluff, no big words, just clear and practical insights. I usually listen while I’m at the gym or running errands, and if something really hits, I’ll do the deep dive before bed. It’s honestly the only way I’ve been able to make progress on my 400+ Goodreads TBR list and build a daily reading habit - even on days when I have zero time, energy, or motivation. 

(What I like most is, you can request books in their Discord, and they usually add them in a week or two. Makes it easy to keep up without buying books I probably won’t finish.)

Also, if there are other books from Lenny’s podcast you’ve heard and loved, drop them in the comments! I’ll keep updating this list as more episodes come out and more recs come in.

1kuuk2q,19 and trying to see what fits then push for the stars in that area,"There is 3 areas in this and its broken down into a story, what ive done and got, and feed back

- my life
Im 19 and been out of school for 7-8 months now and i have explored many fields and areas that i was interested in but i dont know what i want to do but i have narrowed it down to four options out of all of them because there was alot but here we are still contemplating on what i should do and i cant decide because all four options are great and i enjoy them.

-Air Force 
I tried the Air Force and i did a month in there and was injured and used that to let me leave but now i look back i should have stayed because it was a great career and life ahead of me but i was nervous and scared in there and was given a out and took it but regret taking it now.
-HVAC/R
I went to a 2 year schooling program that gave me the knowledge of hvac and gave me some certificates to help find a job better. Yes we did hands on and i know its small areas and dirty (to my knowledge of the 2 years i did it) i was one of the top student in the class and i was in national technical honors for my class i loved hvac and was good at it but the thing thats stopping me is i dont know if it pays good to pay off my debt and to happy with a family that i can provide for when im older.
-electrical engineer
I tried working with circuits and motors with my friends dads company and was pretty good and it and helped where i could get experience. i love wiring boxes and breakers or whole homes in general but i dont have any clue really for this field because i never went to collage for it yet so i dont know the real deal for it.
-truck driver
I help move the semi trucks for my friends dads company and was able to get some experience because i backed them up and parked them for him when we where short on drivers i do enjoy it but i don’t know if i should go hazmat or try for a gov contract and haul for them and see if i can get a military benefit that way but i currently have a job where i driver for a living and getting my record up and keeping it clean.

Sorry this is long and if your still reading this please reply and give your feed back plus could you add your reason behind your choice and if you want can you give me suggestions on other jobs i might not know about and are good but me that are similar to the options i like already😊",Motor_Usual_3440,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1748149060,2025-05-25 04:57:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kuuk2q/19_and_trying_to_see_what_fits_then_push_for_the/,5,2025
1kuujze,Hi! I’m back again for the next step of my drawn out formal offer. I was offered $115k when the posted range is $110-140k. Could being a bit more direct help with negotiating a higher salary?,"I’ve been through multiple interviews over the past few weeks before getting to this point. I have all of the experience that the position asked for aside from a couple of small factors. It’s a big jump in responsibility and scope from my current job and I don’t think that the offer adequately compensates me for this role.

Before I continue, I want to start by saying that I never named a number for my expected salary. I never had conversations about my current salary or what the change in compensation would be from my current role. I was asked if my expected salary was within the posted range: $110-140k. I said it was. 

This company is a start-up and is urgently hiring numerous positions after receiving sizable funding. I’ve been told throughout the interview process that they are needing someone in this role as soon as possible. Would this work in my favor if I were to ask for my salary to be on the higher end of the range? 

I’d like to ask for $130k. I’ve seen numerous posts about salary negotiation so I have a good outline of what I want to say. However, there’s a piece I’m not sure if I should include or not. On this subreddit I have seen people mention using what seems like a hardball tactic by saying something along the lines of “If the compensation falls closer to 130k, I’d sign the offer today”. This feels really risky, but I also wonder if it could be effective given their urgency. 

Has anyone ever used a similar tactic in their negotiations as an employee? Can anyone who has been a hiring manager/HR chime in if they have seen this tactic used? It feels sleazy but then again this is my first time engaging in salary negotiations, so maybe it’s not.

1kuuhxz,Wanna make money in your sleep?,"As a proud mother of four, my journey has been one of resilience, love, and determination. I started with very little, working long hours as a bartender to provide for my family. Through every late night and early morning, I kept going for the sake of my children, knowing that one day I’d build something greater not just for myself, but for them too. Now, as I’ve grown older and gained more wisdom, I realize that time is the most precious asset — and I want to spend more of it being present with my family.

This realization has led me to a new chapter: creating passive income through my venture, Digital Wealth Academy. My passion for digital products stems from their limitless potential. Whether it’s in health, beauty, education, or any niche — there’s a place for everyone in the digital world. What I love most is that once you create something of value, you can sell it again and again with little to no overhead. It’s a sustainable, empowering business model that gives me both freedom and fulfillment.

If you can commit yourself to learning and growing, you can do this too. You don’t need to have it all figured out — you just need the willingness to start. Whether you’re a busy parent, working long hours, or just looking for more purpose, this journey can be your breakthrough. With consistency, belief, and the right guidance, you can build something that changes your life — just like I am.

Thank you so much for your order — I truly appreciate your support! I hope you’re enjoying everything so far and finding it helpful. Please don’t hesitate to reach out and let me know how it’s going for you — I’d love to hear your experience!

1kuudfh,"Got my first job, but is it really worth it? Please HELP!","So yesterday, i went to X company, and went through 3 rounds, assessment, technical interview and HR Round. Cleared all of em, and now my job is almost confirmed (only thing left is one interview with the director of the company). Now i'd like to specify, this company is huge, really big in terms of world impact and revenue, and also this office i went to is an IT arm of this company, recently launched, so they're tryna build a team. 

Anyways, my concern is that they might hand me a Network Engineer job, as you can see from my resume im more of a webdev guy, and i have interest in webdev too. Now im not the one to cherry pick jobs, in the current job market, the package is 4LPA and a MNC? Sounds good right? but there's a catch.

They've asked me to sign a 2yr bond. and if i got out before 2yrs, i'll be blacklisted from all of their businesses. 2yrs as a network engineer? wouldnt that change my whole career path? would it be harder to get a dev job after these 2yrs? I dont like the network engineer job, you have to be available at any time they call (rotational shifts), and ive heard there's a bit of hardware work too?

1kuuaqo,Leaving Big 4 for a Defense Contractor – Should I Take the Cyber GRC Role?,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently an A1 soon to be A2 at a Big 4 firm in Digital Assurance and Transparency, and I just received an offer from a major defense contractor for a Cyber GRC position. The new role offers a 4-day workweek (4/10 schedule), and I’d be moving from constant overtime to something that promises a much better work-life balance.

The offer also comes with a ~11.4% salary increase, which is tempting considering the improved schedule.

My main concern is about long-term career growth. Big 4 has strong brand value and solid exit opportunities. So I’m wondering:
	•	If I leave now, is it realistic to return to a Big 4 as a Senior later on?
	•	Is it too soon to leave, or is a better work-life balance and a decent pay bump reason enough to make the switch?",adrian2000pr,2,1.0,1,1748148091,2025-05-25 04:41:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kuuaqo/leaving_big_4_for_a_defense_contractor_should_i/,5,2025

Currently I'm like a surplus developer at my job, my last project was finished and there has been no other new projects coming in. People are bored and it's not a good sign. I have a bad feeling about this.

1kuro3b,Job hopping for the 3rd time this year,"Hi,

Right now this year has been rough for me career wise. I got laid off at the end of last year, and I got lucky and got a generous severance package from my employer and a year of free healthcare. It took me about 4 months to get a new job, and it was only min wage. I only accepted it because I had no choice. Then a month later one of the jobs I was in the interview process for gave me a job offer. They paid a lot more, but had no benefits, I quit my job 2 weeks later and at first things seemed much better. Financially things have been looking up for me. But the commute is 2hrs long going home.

  
When I first joined the job I tried finding a new place, but the rents in the area where my new job are, cost a lot more than where I was planning on looking, and those places did not have a much better commute. I can afford to pay the rents, but financially speaking, if I were to move out of my families house now, at the end of the contract, I would be worse off financially than I was going in. By the time I have a big enough emergency fund and the funds to pay the moving costs, I will be half way done with the contract. And also I have to factor in paying for health insurance without any help during the lease, and it's going to be a massive financial burden. 

  
Getting a new job is most likely the only solution to my problems. I have only worked in this job for 1 month, and since I now have 2 jobs where I only lasted 1 month, I'm worried about how bad this will look on my resume. My old employer wants to bring me on a contract with health benefits and better pay, but it's only slated to last 3 months, and they believe it will get extended. The commute is also slightly better at 1.5hrs, but the important part is there is more affordable housing where it is. I'm nervous about job hopping for a 3rd time this year, but I also know my current commute situation is unsustainable.  My other issue about moving out is that I will not be able to pursue things I have been waiting many years to be able to do because I will have less money compared to living with my family. Even a 1.5hr commute would be much better",mustangfan12,3,0.8100000023841858,3,1748138786,2025-05-25 02:06:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kuro3b/job_hopping_for_the_3rd_time_this_year/,5,2025

I’m not struggling or stressed about money or bills or anything like that I can afford all necessities easily, but I want a nice car and a nice apartment and to be able to afford to make trips to other countries and raise a family. All of that requires much more than my $55k. The lifestyle I desire requires $10k+ a month and I was wondering how I could go about climbing to the next level financially.

1kuq1s1,Competitive Job for Graduates in Energy Industry,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently wrapping up my Master’s in Energy Engineering in Aachen, Germany, where I also earned my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. Over the past few years, I’ve gained substantial hands-on experience in the energy sector through internships and student jobs—mainly at large companies like RWE, EnBW, and Evonik. (While Evonik isn’t an energy company in the traditional sense, they are energy intensive industry and their significant energy demands made it an interesting and relevant environment to learn from.)

While I find the energy transition (generation, distribution, storage, implementation in energy-intensive industry, etc.) incredibly meaningful and fulfilling to work on, I’ve noticed that things tend to move quite slowly in these big corporations. In contrast, I had a brief stint in consulting and really enjoyed the fast-paced environment and dynamic and heavy workload.

Now that I’m graduating in September, I’m looking for job opportunities that combine:

•	⁠The technical and data-driven side of the energy sector (including machine learning),
•	⁠With the speed, challenge, and variety found in top-tier consultancies or finance companies.

I know some consultancies have dedicated energy divisions, but I’m more interested to roles within companies or institutions directly involved in energy—maybe even research organizations.

If you know of roles, companies, or paths that align with this mix (or even something a little out there), I’d love to hear your suggestions. I'm very open-minded and want to explore all possibilities.

For the location, I am open for Europe and North America.

1kupkh7,love vs career,"I’m 25 and at a bit of a crossroads. I’ve just finished a finance degree and have a job lined up in my very small hometown. It’s stable, the pay is decent, and it could lead to a solid career. But it’s in a small town — not exactly where I see myself long term.

Here’s the twist: I met someone amazing while traveling and we’ve kept things going long-distance. He lives in Switzerland. It’s real — not just a fling — and I genuinely see potential. I can get a 1 year visa there. The idea of moving there, doing something different (like working in a cafe for a year), and just living feels exciting. But obviously, that would mean stepping away from my career path for a while, and potentially starting from scratch when I come back.

I go back and forth constantly. Part of me says I’m young, I’ll regret it if I don’t take the leap. Another part says I’ve worked hard for this career and shouldn’t throw it away for a guy — especially if I’m not 100% sure how things will pan out.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Chosen love over career (or vice versa)? Would love some honest perspectives, especially from people who’ve made big international moves or taken detours early in their career.

1kupd9i,There was an earlier post saying that you shouldn’t go into nursing if you can’t find a CS job… what should I do then?,"I’ve been out of a job for a full year with 10 years of experience as a backend java engineer. I have a bachelors and masters from a top engineering school that has the word Tech in the name. I haven’t been able to find anything. And I’m most definitely open to 5 days a week in office, anything!

But at this point, I need to consider a career shift. Im running out of savings! I got into this career so I wouldn’t have to worry about shit like this. Im glad i prepared almost 1.5 years worth of savings but when the fuck do I throw in the towel if I’ve been looking for a year?

I was premed back in college so I had a lot of prereq classes, which would hopefully give me a leg up in preparing to apply to an accelerated nursing program.

Why nursing? Because it’s a good way of getting a somewhat decent salary that’s actually in demand without all the schooling involved with medicine, dental, PA etc. Yeah it’s not an easy job, nothing worth doing is easy. But it’s stable and offers job security. I won’t be tossed aside like in tech and I won’t have to constantly keep up with the latest and greatest (I don’t mind doing this but the pace expected in tech is absurd).

I went to a trades type of high school where we had specializations and I studied graphic design, then I did that in college. I wanted to do industrial/ product design though.

1kup0aw,IS THERE ANY REAL SHOT AT GETTING INTO A SOLID LEGAL OR CORPORATE JOB ABROAD WHEN YOU'RE A FOREIGNER WITHOUT A DEGREE FROM A PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY?,"I’ve been struggling with this question for a while: do mid-to-large law firms or serious companies in places like the U.S., Canada, or Europe ever actually consider foreign candidates who didn’t graduate from top schools — and who don’t have impressive connections?

In Brazil, the reality is pretty harsh. The best opportunities in law, finance, consulting, engineering, or in competitive corporate roles usually go to people who graduate from top public universities or elite private schools — kind of like the Brazilian equivalent of a UC Berkeley, University of Michigan, or a private school like NYU or Georgetown. If you didn’t go to one of those, you’re usually overlooked from the start. And referrals are everything — especially in law. If you don’t have an “in” somewhere, you’re just another name in a stack of resumes.

I graduated two years ago from a small, regional private university. Since then, it’s been really hard to get any meaningful experience. I live in a mid-sized city in southern Brazil, and I’ve been unemployed for a while now.

The only job I’ve managed to get so far was through a friend’s recommendation — a small law office with no contract and no benefits. I’ve gone to multiple interviews, and more than once I’ve heard things like “we prioritize people who come recommended by someone who’s already part of our network.”

Hoping to improve my prospects, I enrolled in a postgraduate program at a better-regarded school. But after all that, I was told pretty bluntly: *“it doesn’t really help if your undergraduate degree doesn’t stand out.”*

Lately, I’ve been thinking about trying my luck abroad. Not in some fantasy of becoming a partner at a top firm overnight — I know that’s unrealistic — but I wonder:  
**Is there even a chance for someone like me to break into a mid-sized or growing law firm or company abroad? To be taken seriously? To at least get a foot in the door in a structured environment where I could grow?**

Some people have told me flat out: *“You should give up on that and aim for blue-collar work. The corporate world isn’t for someone from a background like yours.”* And honestly, I’m starting to believe they might be right.

But I just want to know from someone with experience:  
Is there any real path for a foreign law graduate — without a big-name diploma or a high-powered network — to be seen as a potential asset by firms or companies in places like the U.S., Canada, or Europe?

What steps could actually help make that happen?

Any insight or honest advice would mean a lot. I don’t expect miracles — just hoping to understand if there’s a real path forward here, or if I’ve been chasing something that doesn’t exist for people like me.

1kuoemm,Struggling at new job,"I started a new role 12 weeks ago, and while I was initially excited—this being a step up in my career—I’ve found myself struggling due to my manager’s leadership style and her general demeanour towards me.

She tends to be very blunt in her communication (she has even commented that people often wonder how she gets away with being so blunt), and this often leaves me feeling feeling belittled and questioning my abilities, especially when receiving feedback on relatively small mistakes. I understand I’m still learning the ropes, and while I expect feedback, the way it’s delivered sometimes makes me feel more like a child being scolded than a professional being coached. I also recognise that it is somewhat a 'me' problem as to how I take what is being fed back to me, however, drawing on my time being a team leader in a previous role, the mistakes are all small issues that I would have expected of any of my team members and I would have provided a lot more reassurance than what I am getting at the moment. I have genuinely been left feeling quite embarassed with some of the small mistakes I have made, as I really pride myself in being conscientious and taking pride in my work, but feel x1000 times worse after I am confronted with it by my manager. I think I am constantly on edge and stressing out, which causes me to make more small mistakes.

Despite this, I’ve taken on a fair amount of work and have received positive feedback from other team members, which makes me feel like I *am* making progress. However, even minor issues—such as her disagreeing with how I’ve worded an email—tend to overshadow any wins.

I’ve expressed to her that my confidence has taken a hit due to the nature of some of the feedback, and while she has offered some reassurance, I am still feeling deflated. Now I’m left wondering, did I make a mistake leaving my previous job? Am I at risk of losing this one after probation? Am I even cut out to do this job?

I genuinely want to succeed in this job. I was so excited to take this step in my career, but I’m finding my interactions with her increasingly overwhelming and demoralising, where I have been left in tears more often than not (she does not know this). I guess what I’m really asking is, how should I approach this with her in a constructive way? Or is it time to start exploring other opportunities?",ExcellentExercise447,2,0.7599999904632568,4,1748128147,2025-05-24 23:09:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kuoemm/struggling_at_new_job/,5,2025

1kunj0k,"Quit now, or after a week?","Two weeks ago, I accepted a job offer; my start date is Tuesday, right after this long weekend here in the US. I was offered another role at another company (which I prefer) this week, and have also accepted. 

For context, earlier this year I went through the full interview process, and did not get offered the job at Company A (retail). The in-house recruiter I had been communicating with gave me feedback related to their decision to go with another candidate. With that being said, the company thought I was a great fit and told me to reach out directly to her if a role was posted that I was interested in. Fast forward maybe two months, she reaches out saying they had an open position for the exact role I had previously applied for, just at a different store location. She said I wouldn't have to go through the full interview process again, and just wanted me to visit the store and interview with the current store manager, basically as a vibe check. Interview went great, and I was offered the role the following week. We discussed I would put in my two-week notice for my current role and start right after my position ended with my current company. 

Of course, Company A had not been the only company I had been applying and interviewing for. When Company A reached out with this offer to interview again, I was in the final round interview with Company B. Company B required a take-assignment after the final round interview. At this point, I had already accepted the role at Company A, but figured why not submit the assessment since I had already gotten so far along in the process, and I preferred Company B to Company A. Fast forward, I was offered the role at Company B this week, and have accepted. 

There is a one week starting date difference between the two jobs. So my question is, do I quit Company A now (the weekend before I start-date), or do my first week at Company A, and then quit at the end of the week? I wouldn't have to give them a two-week notice because it's an at-will contract, and besides given the short time I will have been at the company I doubt they'll want me to anyway. This was one of my best interview experiences thus far, and every single person I've interacted with has been professional and kind. I really do not want to leave this company with a poor impression of my level of professionalism and decorum, and don't know which option would be better for all parties involved. I've already been fully onboarded, so unfortunately either way, time and other resources have already been spent on me as an employee. Company A also never publicly listed this job, I was contacted directly about my interest first, so I know they have no other candidates. 

TLDR: Quit my job the weekend before I start, or quit after working a full-week (at-will contract). Onboarding has been fully completed, so either way the time and other resources has been spent.",turquoiseincahoots,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1748125567,2025-05-24 22:26:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kunj0k/quit_now_or_after_a_week/,5,2025
1kunfco,Opinions on which career path to try?,"So basically I’m trying to figure out what I want to do going forward in terms of schooling, and I need opinions on which direction to go. The options I’m considering right now are going for a bachelor’s in english and/or communications (either double majoring or choosing one), or going to trade school for welding. If anyone else has any other ideas or suggestions though I’m open to hearing them.

When I initially graduated high school I went to college for aerospace engineering. I had always done really well in english, math, and physics in school, and while english was the only one I enjoyed and was honestly really passionate about going for a STEM major seemed like a smarter idea so that’s what I did. Life took a turn soon after I started though, it was just kind of one horrific life event after another and a lot of self destructive decisions, life really just kind of completely derailed. In the midst of that I dropped out of school, I was going well grade wise but I couldn’t handle the pressure of the major. I was doing an engineering internship at the time though and when they heard I was going to have an open schedule they offered me a permanent position as an engineering technician, which I worked for a year but recently quit because the company is shutting down soon. So I’m 23 now and at a point where I’ve learned a lot life wise from the past few years and am trying to just kind of slow down and rebuild. So I’m starting by trying to figure out career wise which direction to pursue. I want to make a smart decision but also do something that is in line with my natural talents and interests, and will allow me to be happy and live a lifestyle that makes me happy. While I was good at engineering and didn’t mind the work it wasn’t something I enjoyed, and I couldn’t see myself being happy doing it for the rest of my life.

I liked the idea of going back and finishing a bachelor’s, so I’ve been considering going back for english because reading classical literature and analyzing it and writing analytical reports on it has always been something I really, really loved. Like was truly passionate about and was really good at. I’ve always been into spirituality and have always been drawn to classical literature because I feel it has a huge spiritual component to it. And I’ve always been a huge academic so I like the idea of pursuing something that involves analysis and research. Like I was always very very good at writing, not stories or anything but reports and research papers and stuff like that. I don’t know exactly what I would do with that degree is the only problem, however I would or could likely get some sort of writing career which I would absolutely love. The major is just something I think I would be really good at and really love.

I’ve also been considering a bachelor’s in communication. Like I said I’ve always been really good at writing and my use of words. I’m also really good at and really, really love public speaking. I had to take a public speaking class in high school and found that out there. I ended up being really good at it to the point where my school and the local rotary club were sponsoring me to speak at school and rotary club events and to compete in speech competitions (which I didn’t even realize was a thing until then but they were so fun lol). Again I’m not totally sure what I would want to do with that degree, I would likely do something with writing or journalism though. I would love to be a motivational speaker actually or do something like that in a written form, like that would be my dream job actually. I feel like I have a lot to say and ways of communicating it just have no idea how to get an audience or actually make it happen in the form of a career.

I’ve also been considering trade school because when I was working as a engineering technician it was for a machine shop, and I would sometimes go out and help in the shop when needed (and the guys out there were awesome they would bring me out to try things out and teach me because it would help me a lot with my job too). That’s when I learned I’m very mechanically inclined and actually really love working with my hands like that. Which makes sense everyone in my family is like that I just didn’t realize I was too because I’d never tried anything like that before lol. I tried mostly machining but a little welding and brazing too and think I’d really enjoy welding. My only concern is I really love to travel and really want a more flexible and possibly remote career, and I feel like my other options would allow for that more. Trade school would be less debt though which I really like lol.

I just basically want a career I can build and work towards and establish (like that will have tangible results that I can feel accomplished in), and be happy and enjoy while doing so. I really really don’t like the idea of a typical 9 to 5 schedule, I like more freedom and a more flexible schedule. Idk any input would be appreciated.

1kunbvf,How I learned to enjoy networking by treating it like collecting interesting stories instead of contacts,"I used to dread networking events because they felt fake and transactional. I'd awkwardly exchange business cards with people I'd never talk to again. Then I completely reframed my approach.

Instead of trying to ""network,"" I started going to events with genuine curiosity about people's career paths. I'd ask questions like ""What's the most surprising thing about your industry?"" or ""What made you switch from marketing to product design?""

Suddenly, networking became fascinating. I learned about a woman who left corporate law to become a bread baker, a guy who designs video game sound effects, and someone who helps companies name their products. Each conversation became a mini-documentary about someone's professional journey.

The weird thing is, this approach has led to way more genuine professional connections than traditional networking ever did. People remember the person who was genuinely interested in their story, not the one who just wanted their contact info.

Anyone else found unconventional approaches to professional networking that actually work?",Equivalent_Soft_6665,6,0.8799999952316284,1,1748124982,2025-05-24 22:16:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kunbvf/how_i_learned_to_enjoy_networking_by_treating_it/,5,2025

Two jobs are part time during the day which I bounce and forth on. One of the jobs I'm able to have holidays and summer off so I work at my other day job during those times. My third job is full time during the night. I work M-F, getting up at 7am and falling asleep 3am the next day. My day job starts at 8am and my night job ends 2am the next day. Basically I work almost 15 hours (including lunch) daily, not including commute time which is 1-1.5 hours extra. 

I'm financially stable, however, I live in a 4 person household where only me and another person work, sometimes just me, gratefully when it's 3 people. I pay my bills and half of rent. I pay a total of 2 car insurances and 3 phone bills, and weekly groceries for 2 people or 4 people. Sometimes I put money towards savings, sometimes I don't. 

I recently am trying to lose fat and build muscles so since the beginning of this year, I've been working out 2x weekly, only on weekends, and being on a calorie deficit. However, with lack of sleep (getting minimum of 4 hours and max 6 hours bc I take multiple naps), I haven't seen progress. 

I now just started my Master's degree (online school) the beginning of this month and unfortunately have to pay out of pocket due to not receiving financial aid and too busy to even apply for scholarships, leaving me to pay $1K+ monthly. Mind you, I'm only take 1-2 classes a semester. I wanted to take 3 years but since I'm paying out of pocket with no help, it's gonna take me 6-7 years. 

I'm exhausted. I'm working 2-3 jobs, working out, sleeping less, and not getting any financial help. I try to have a life outside of work such as going to sports games, concerts, food events, and hanging out with friends. However, with all my bills and tuition, I now have little to no money to pay for more of these events. I have already paid for some in advance but with gas, merch, food, etc I need to spend wisely. 

I'm tired of having 3 jobs, I want a single job that works 12 hours daily and a pay rate that I would like. I'm a psychology student and have been working as a behavior tech. I want to work in my field that's in an office/hospital setting. But with barely starting my Master's degree, I can't find jobs that will take me. I started my Master's bc I want to be able to have a long lasting career as a therapist or clinician. I don't want to keep this 3 job life anymore. What can I do?

I was offered a position with a company who doubled my salary and promised multiple things.  I ignored multiple red flags and accepted the offer. I am a Learning and Development professional who was asked to revamp the company’s horrible onboarding process which was hemorrhaging with turnover. 

I started of to see first hand how terrible the onboarding and orientation experience truly was. Lack of communication, as a senior leader I had to seek out my own computer for IT and the welcoming was something out of the 1950’s.  At this point and being a part of meaningless three hour zoom calls I was mentally checked out.  I quickly realized that I missed my past position and started making calls.  

As I was preparing my departure I was called in a day before and informed that I was being let go for lack of performance.  I must say I was never given any clear instruction on work to be performed and would not be a part of the cult like environment I was observing.  The company meetings literally praised and worshiped the owners prior to the start of the meetings.

1kufhib,Asked to work almost every weekend - How to ask for compensation beyond basic overtime (Corporate 9-5)?,"
Hey Reddit,

I'm in a bit of a tricky situation and could use some advice from those with corporate experience, especially in Canada.

I work a standard 9-5 corporate job, and recently, I've been asked to work almost every weekend going forward. When I brought up concerns about this with my manager, she said it ""doesn't matter if I work on weekends or weekdays, it's not industry standard to pay beyond overtime.""

I understand that overtime is legally mandated, and I'll be paid for those hours. However, working consistently on weekends significantly impacts my work-life balance, personal time, and overall well-being. It's not just about the extra hours, but the constant disruption to my non-work life.

My questions for you all are:

How can I effectively articulate the value of my weekend time beyond just an hourly rate? I want to convey that the sacrifice of my personal life for consistent weekend work warrants more than just 1.5x my regular pay. To be clear, an extra day off during the week doesn't make sense for my role/workflow, so I'm looking for other creative solutions.

What's the best way to approach this conversation with my manager again? I don't want to come across as ungrateful for the overtime, but I need to advocate for myself and my time.

Is her statement about ""industry standard"" truly accurate for corporate 9-5 roles in Canada, or are there nuances I can point to?
Any general tips on negotiating for better work-life balance or compensation in similar situations?

I'm feeling a bit burnt out at the prospect of losing my weekends indefinitely. Any advice or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance.

Even if I move to a different Indian city, I’d still be a 2–3 hour flight away. But for them, moving abroad feels more permanent. They worry that if I go to Singapore, I might end up settling there for good.

Hi everyone,

I (34 M) have been working as a school counselor/School social worker for the past 10 years (with leadership-role). Over the last two years, I’ve completed a Master’s degree in Social Work. Toward the end of my program, I realized I want to change direction and pursue a career in Human Resources.

This fall I will be starting a second Master's program in Management, Organization and Society. I've also completed 60 ECTS credits in Strategic HR and Management (equivalent to two-thirds of a Bachelor’s degree in that subject, though I need 90 ECTS to formally graduate with the degree).

My goal is to work either as an HR Business Partner or in Learning & Development. I am particularly interested in leadership, organizational development, and talent management. I believe my background in psychosocial work, collaboration, and working with systems-level support in schools could be transferable to HR roles.

I would really appreciate your thoughts. What might my path into HR look like from here? Are there any specific steps or certifications you would recommend to make myself more competitive and land that first HR role?

1kueca6,Career searching with bad driving record.,"Pennsylvania

Hi all — I’m applying for a non-CDL position that may involve driving a company vehicle. I had an ARD for a DUI in April 2023, which has since been expunged. I also had older driving-related offenses back in 2006–2007 (including a DUI conviction in 2007 and an accident involving damage that led to an ARD in 2006), but nothing since.

My criminal record is clean now, and I’ve worked hard to move forward and stay on the right path. However, I know employers and insurance providers sometimes check driving histories, and I’m trying to understand how far back they typically look — especially in Pennsylvania.

Would this expunged DUI still show up in a background check or insurance review? Will older offenses from 2007 matter, even if they don’t show on PATCH or Clean Slate?

I want to be upfront, but I’m also trying to figure out how much of this I need to disclose if the application didn’t ask directly. Any HR folks or hiring managers familiar with Pennsylvania law and company vehicle policies — I’d really appreciate your insight.

I would like to add that I hold all my professional licensing for this position and I exceed all the requirements.

I am a cybersecurity analyst for a LFI. My education includes a BS in CS, MS in Cyber. I hold many relevant cybersec certifications (i.e. CISSP, CISM).

I’m looking for ways to continue to develop professionally and potentially pivot to “new” roles.

AI’s impact on cyber will increase exponentially, and I was thinking that potentially doing a MS in AI from UT Austin or GaTech’s OCSMS with focus in Interactive Intelligence would be a good way to gain a deeper understanding and potentially move into AI governance roles / innovation.

I’m also intrigued by a degree in Cyber Law and moving into a GRC role. I am young with plenty of available time to complete a degree while working full time & the program would be 100% paid for.

Conversely, I feel a bit naive in thinking that adding another degree will allow to me to make a slight pivot in specialization within cyber. Am I overthinking it?

1kud4lh,Need Help to Start a Start-up/Remote Job. Want to make a Major Pivot in Life.,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share a bit about myself and ask for your advice. I’m a leader and entrepreneur with 11+ years of experience in Luxury Retail/Wholesale/Manufacturing(Diamond Jewelry), International Commodities Trading (Iron Ore), and Omni-Channel Retail (Fashion Rental). I love working in Operations, Sales, Support, and Marketing. I also have a Master’s in Computer Science, though I’ve never been in the corporate world and don’t know much about its jargon. What I \*do\* know is how to get things done and make a real impact in any business I take on.



That said, I’ve faced many challenges in Indian workplaces. Some of the common ones are people dealing in black money, evading taxes, giving/accepting bribes, mis-selling products, or adulterating goods. I’ve also seen people target those doing honest, clean work simply because it affects the ones taking shortcuts or being unethical. There’s also a tendency to expect unrealistic results, like getting a baby in 9 days instead of 9 months or wanting instant success as soon as you start something. On top of that, hardworking employees are either overburdened or underpaid, while dishonest people sometimes thrive. It’s frustrating to deal with situations like this, and the list goes on.



I’m now at a turning point where I want to build a business in India that’s ethical, sustainable, and makes ""happy money"" — money earned the right way with the right people in the right place. Over the years, I’ve realized that no matter how talented or hardworking someone is, it doesn’t work if you’re in the wrong environment with the wrong people doing the wrong things. That’s why I want to shift my focus and make changes in my professional, personal, social, and spiritual life.



I also understand there are many young people making a lot of money in high-pressure work cultures. While I respect their hustle and hard work, I’m not looking to adopt a toxic lifestyle. I’m not interested in an unhealthy grind where people skip sleep for days, rely on caffeine, alcohol, or substances to cope, and burn out. I want to work hard but in a balanced, healthy, and ethical way.



So here’s my question: \*\*What are some good business ideas or Jobs that align with these values, focus on integrity, and foster a positive work environment here in India?\*\* I’d love to hear your suggestions/recommendations!",pjp708,1,1.0,0,1748097484,2025-05-24 14:38:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kud4lh/need_help_to_start_a_startupremote_job_want_to/,5,2025

As an FTE at the other company they will handle all of that…
2. When the contract is over I’ll be out of a job, as an FTE I have no deadline but as we know there is no such a thing as job b security.
3. I have strong references to the FTE, director level people who support my candidacy and spoke on my behalf to the hiring managers.

I could take the contract and if I get the FTE job resign… but I feel shitty doing that…

1kubrb9,Thoughts on Account Executive role at Gartner?,"I’d love to get your thoughts on Gartner. I have an interview for an Account Executive position, and I’ve been getting really mixed signals.

On one hand, Glassdoor shows a solid employee rating (around 4 stars), and it seems like Gartner has a good reputation overall. But from reading posts on this sub, I’ve also seen a lot of people mention a toxic or highly political culture, and that your success there is heavily dependent on your manager.

For context, I currently work at a FAANG company in a hybrid BDR/AE role. I don’t love it, but I’m comfortable. The main issue is that I don’t see a clear path for progression over the next 2–2.5 years, which is why I’m seriously considering this move. The Gartner role would mean the same base salary but would introduce commission, which I don’t have in my current role.

Has anyone here worked as an AE at Gartner or have any insight into the culture, expectations, and growth opportunities? The role would be liaising with C-Suite clients, upselling and winning new contracts. Potential path for Enterprise Sales possibly?

1ku96mv,Disappointing raise after month long wait,"Looking for input on my current situation. Have worked for this company for 5 years, making low but survivable pay. Currently at $19.50hr in current position, after a few raises that were hard earned. One month ago, my manager asked if I'd be interested in learning more about a ""team leader"" position that was being created as a result of our company merging with another bigger one. I said sure, tell me more. At the time, HR was still restructuring and working out pay, so they couldn't give me an exact description/pay rate, so I asked that I be given an opportunity to have that discussion before anything was made public or official company-wide, and in the meantime I would just attend some meetings to get insight, and help on some basic projects as a training experience. 

Asked at least 4 times over the next month if/when the details would be available, and kept getting the boiler plate response of ""soon."" In the meantime, they went ahead and did make my position change public to our team, which made me uncomfortable for obvious reasons. The over-all outline of the job was still vague, but I was told ultimately that it would involve overseeing and have direct report staff, managing their time-sheets/pay, as well as the project management side. 

Bottom line, after waiting a month, my manager said, ok the pay rate has been approved, and is reflected in your pay software. I checked and had to do a double-take to even see the difference. It was $1.40, or 7%. To me, that was insultingly, and negligibly low. To go from simply being responsible for myself with no broader scope of work, to effectively being a supervisor (even though they won't call it that), and basically making the same pay tier as people I'm overseeing is ridiculous. I told them that at least $3hr more was my minimum, as it signifies some kind of worthwhile difference. They said the rate is fixed, and non-negotiable.  Where's the incentive to take on all the extra responsibility for almost the same pay as your subordinates? It's particularly disappointing, as I was looking forward to moving into that role, and I feel like they strung me along. I'm sure they could have at least provided a likely pay range up front so that I could have made an informed choice upfront and avoid being in the situation ass-backwards. So now my choice is take the shitty raise, or go back to my original position. 

TLDR: Feel like I got screwed and lead-on for a month only to get a disappointing offer. ",CaptainLysdexia,6,0.6499999761581421,48,1748085245,2025-05-24 11:14:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ku96mv/disappointing_raise_after_month_long_wait/,5,2025

1ku8p3j,Exclusive TCS NINJA TECHNICAL experience,"So on 22nd May I went for the Ninja interview. Coming straight to the point ( not writing any screening , waiting rr) , went in he asked for name , native place and department . He was looking for something , i thought maybe he's looking for my resume . I tried handing over one( I carried 3 xerox of it) to which he said ""no no I don't need that"" ( Aisa kya doc hai mera jo iske pass hai aur isi he nhi mil rha) . Anyways , I was sitting there holding my compse until he said 
""You got good marks in social science , u had a interest in that ?""
I said yes at that time I used to study that (Ratta maar k toh number aate the social science me)
He then asked ""what happened in 1857 ?"" 
I went blank thinking it was supposed to be a technical round, anyways I was not able toh answer that he then tried dragging me into history . I too kept trying to come out of that and then finally he went rigid on ""What was your fav subject in 11th 12th ?""  
(It was supposed to be TECHNICAL, mind it)
I had no other option so I said PHYSICS.
That Elite gentleman tried almost every possible question that he knew from NLM , KE ,  PE and Projectile motion. 
Since I was good in it I answered everything thinking if I'm still preparing for JEE. 
(IT'S TECHNICAL FYI) 

Then he gave me a binary to decimal conversion on paper and vice versa wid logics. I did it 
He then said to write a code for it , i was ok wid it then as soon as I started he said - ""wait ,write for binary to hexadecimal"" 
I never came across all this in LC at least and tbvh i forgot the implementation part still I started writing. 
2 mins after he said ""hobe na"" ( means Nhi hoga ) 
Bro first of all it's FCKNG NINJA , Second give me some time u Einstein's shit. Then they told me if this is the condition in this code what will happen if they'd give me any searching sorting algorithms to write. I accepted it that yes I'm ok with asking them these stuffs . 
They already made the mind of not selecting me still the lady who was sitting there asked binary search from me . I explained everything and then they said "" we are not selecting you for this time , you can leave the venue now""

1ku8718,Go for the promotion or wait?,"I've been in my career field at my company for the last 11 years. We have two major business areas, and I've worked in both of them in both professional and managerial roles. 

I've basically gone as high as I can go - my boss is the Director at our local site and for our Division.

Well, his workload got to be too much, so he somehow persuaded our VP to create a separate Director role to just handle the duties at our site. I'm torn on whether to apply or not because:

1. I want to rotate out of my department and learn something new. I've been wanting to do that for years, and even got a certification in 2017 that I haven't put to much use yet.

2. While I've come to work well with my boss and know his style, I don't think I'd have a lot of autonomy in the role. He's very particular about the way he wants things done.

3. If I were to take this job, I would never get to fulfill my other career goals of learning new departments. 

4. The job requires full-time on-site. I think my boss would allow working from home on Fridays, but that's probably it. Right now I work from home 2 days per week (Mondays and Fridays).

5. I asked my wife and she said 'no' because she's worried about work/life balance and I'd have to travel more (job posting only says 10% travel).

However on the other hand:

1. Director spots do not come up very often at all. It could be another 5-10 years before another opportunity arises.

2. My counterpart and I have worked together for the last 10 years. She asked me if I plan to apply, and I told her I'd need to think about it. Not applying for it would basically have her as a shoe-in for it (I'd be happy for her though).

3. I could rotate to other departments, but it would be as a Director is all. I wouldn't get the hands-on experience that I'd like.

  
What should I do? Right now I'm leaning towards not applying.

1ku7fpz,Feeling Lost (23M),"Hello just making a post as I would really like some advice. Basically in June 2023, I graduated with a first-class honours degree in Media, Journalism and Publishing.

 Since then I've been continuing my job as a support worker, which I have done since July 2022, I worked on a bank contract during university holidays. I now work there 30 hours a week but it's obviously not what I want to do forever, as it's unrelated to my degree. I've applied for jobs in media, PR, Journalism etc. 

I've had interviews and gotten very close only to lose it due to someone with more experience (fair enough). However, I feel my current workplace is becoming untenable. I have been subjected to verbal and emotional abuse by residents, management doesn't seem to care, smoking cigarettes instead of dealing with problems. The management is clearly stressed at the moment as we are due for a inspection, and recently I have seen her take it out on employees.

I am known in my workplace for being organised, calm and collected. However the other day my manager accused a group of us in the office of whispering about her, out of nowhere. I felt offended and upset so I confronted her in the office and told her this was inappropriate to make accusations without evidence. I also told her it was ridiculous that I cannot book annual leave, since January I have been unable to book holiday due to an error with my contract, the management still hasn't sorted this out, despite HR instructing her to send over files.

I don't know what to do, I feel like I deserve better. I get paid minimum wage and I understand that's the nature of social care, but I went to university to try and get myself a decent job where I feel happy. I have done work experience alongside my job, I did an unpaid internship for a non profit, doing their social media. I will keep applying and tailoring my applications, just feel a bit hopeless is all.

1ku6roo,Math teacher considering career change,"38yo, middle & high school math teacher for 8 years. BA in General Studies (no math degree, no teaching degree). I obtained my teaching license by enrolling in an accredited 9-month teacher training program (long after I finished university).   
  
So, my background is a bit odd. I spent most of my 20's as a professional poker player. I know saying this will come with all kinds of assumptions from a lot of people, but there it is. I would say that I was an unsuccessful poker player, but let me unpack that: 

* I made enough money to support myself every year I played. Never that much (biggest year was under $65k), but enough to live. I aspired to much more than this, of course, which is part of why I consider it an unsuccessful endeavor.
* Legal regulation gradually sucked the money out of the games I played. As I saw my hourly rate start to decline, I could see the writing on the wall that it was time to do something else. I'm not a recovering gambling addict, it was an easy decision for me to step away because the trend in declining profit was right in front of my face.
* The main reason I consider it unsuccessful is lost time in career development. In straight up $ terms, I probably ended up about the same as I would've in some other fields.

I'm mentioning all this because it sort of explains why I ended up teaching math (I needed to use it when playing poker). And my favorite class to teach is AP Stats and Probability because I was using it in practice during my poker years. Aside from the math stuff, I believe I learned other valuable skills like how to detach emotion from decision-making processes.

**Today:** I am teaching math at an international school in China (as an American with a US teaching license). Unlike a lot of posts I've seen here, I would say my situation is not bad at all. I don't hate teaching, and also don't love it. I care about my students and work very hard for them. The money here for teaching is not bad, too. After all taxes and expenses, I can save about $40k/year. Could be closer to $50k if I wanted to be really frugal. 

There are lots of problems. Entitled students, helicopter parents, bosses/HR that can have poor communication or sometimes be manipulative. But overall, it's ok. I'm not miserable, and I save a healthy amount. 

So why this post? I want more. I've always been very driven. Even when I was playing poker, while it didn't work out the way I hoped, I was trying to apply myself to something I thought could make me financially independent at a fairly young age. Maybe the real answer is to meditate and find happiness within or whatever, but I'm not here for that now. I'm posting here to get other people's perspectives. Some considerations at the moment: 

* **Stay in education and aim to become assistant principal, principal, etc.** This seems like a decent option, but if I stay in international schools, I'm not sure I fit their prototype. The people in these roles seem to have some combination of connections and prestigious degrees. I think the risk/reward for applying to, say Harvard Graduate School of Education (or similar) and paying their tuition, is not necessarily worth the payoff down the road when it still doesn't guarantee anything. The other way I see people getting these roles is being a good worker and staying in one school a *really* long time. Feasible maybe, but I think it's not the most efficient path to make more money.
* **Become an Actuary.** This is another option I've looked into. Their series of tests are supposed to be famously hard, but I've reviewed some of the material and am thinking about taking 1 or 2 of the tests to see how they go. It would definitely take a serious time commitment studying for some of the later tests. The question is, what is a realistic trajectory to making some of the higher salaries, say $180k++ (first couple years will almost certainly be a pay cut in terms of $ saved/month)? And how much will my lack of traditional finance background hinder me?
* **Make a side (or full-time) hustle with a tutoring business**. In some ways this is the most appealing option because I wouldn't be limited by credentialism. Issues are primarily the landscape I'm in (there are plenty of ready/willing customers who want in-person tutoring in China, but teaching for organizations other than the one who sponsors your work visa here is a no-no, at least on paper). Would need to do more research on viability of tutoring businesses in other countries. Also while I think there will continue to be a demand for in-person tutoring, I think AI is going to make online tutoring obsolete.
* **Something else**. Analyst? Prop trader? I don't know. CPA and find the right niche/location to make good money? Open to suggestions here, as well as more input about other possibilities I mentioned.",ForAiur87,1,1.0,0,1748075281,2025-05-24 08:28:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ku6roo/math_teacher_considering_career_change/,5,2025
1ku6irp,"What should backend developers know about CI/CD, Cloud, and Containerization at the time of interviews?","I am a Backend Software Developer. DevOps and development are separate functions in my current organization. While we use CI/CD pipelines and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP, the DevOps team handles most of the infrastructure and pipeline work. My work has largely encompassed core backend development.

Well, talking of that, yes, I do have direct experience working on Jenkins for CI/CD and Ansible and Terraform for automations. Our deployments are vanilla AWS and GCP configs — nothing overly involved.

Recently, I've been browsing job ads and noticed a lot of them require developers to be aware of CI/CD pipelines, cloud operations, and containerization tools.

Any feedback from interview and hiring experience folks would be appreciated:

* What is the typical level of CI/CD proficiency we can expect from senior backend engineers?
* Which CI/CD tools are typically the most widely used in industry these days (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, etc.)?
* How much cloud awareness do we expect to have? Do I need to become more specialized with AWS, GCP, or Azure — and how many of their services?
* How important are Kubernetes and Docker to a lead backend engineer? How much hands-on exposure should interviewers expect around these?

Any advice from experience would be much appreciated as I prepare for a potential career transition.

1ku666n,Micro PE vs. Credit Insurance MNC? Career advice needed,"Hey everyone, hoping to get some insight from those further along in their careers or who’ve navigated similar crossroads.

I graduated about six months ago from a non-target university, studying Finance. I landed a role at a micro private equity startup. The firm isn’t really known, but I’ve been working as an Investment Associate on the core investments team. It’s been an incredible learning experience. I’m directly involved in sourcing deals, due diligence, LOIs, negotiations, and I’m getting a great deal of exposure. The work-life balance is relatively good for now, but realistically, it’ll only get way worse with time. That said, the salary is decent for my market ($4,000/month tax-free), and I feel like there’s potential in it.

Now here’s where I’m torn.

The other opportunity is from one of the top three global credit insurance companies in the world, for a role as either a Risk Analyst or Associate Underwriter. It’s a structured environment, solid brand name, and much better work-life balance. I’d even have 1-2 days of work from home per week. I’d be taking a slight pay cut (around $2,700-3,000/month), but I’d also gain back about 2 hours of my day thanks to a shorter commute and more defined working hours. Not to mention, the work life balance will remain steady even down the line. 

So now I’m trying to figure out what path sets me up better long-term. On one hand, staying in the PE role means more hands-on experience, a higher paycheck (for now and most likely in the future too), and the potential for interesting exits if I can survive the grind. On the other hand, the credit insurance company is one of the best in the world. It could help give my resume that “stamp” it currently lacks, and might open doors to roles in risk, Big 4 advisory, or broader financial services.

I’d love to hear from people in PE, insurance, or corporate strategy:
	•	What would you do if you were in my position?
	•	Does it make sense to sacrifice brand name and balance now for more intense, high-exposure experience?
	•	Or is it better to join a global MNC and build credibility slowly and steadily from there?

Most importantly:
	•	What exit options realistically exist after a few years in either path?


Any perspectives would help a lot. Thanks in advance.",raeucci,1,1.0,0,1748072753,2025-05-24 07:45:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ku666n/micro_pe_vs_credit_insurance_mnc_career_advice/,5,2025

1ku5pmb,Started my corporate career 10 days ago as an intern – feeling stuck already. Advice?,"Hey folks,

I recently started my corporate journey about 10 days ago as an intern in the logistics team at a firm. It’s a 6-month internship, and to be honest, I’m already feeling a bit stuck.

I’m an engineering graduate with a strong interest in the product management and data analysis domains. I have hands-on skills in Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python. Unfortunately, due to the current job market, I couldn’t land a role in those areas and had to settle for this internship.

I took up this role mainly because it involves working with Microsoft Excel — something I genuinely enjoy and want to get better at. But beyond that, I’m not particularly interested in logistics, and the work doesn't excite me. The pay is also quite low, which adds to the lack of motivation.

My current plan is to finish this internship, gain 2–3 years of relevant work experience, and then pursue an MBA. But until then, I want to ensure I’m building skills that align with my long-term goals.

So I’m looking for some advice:

What can I do during this internship to make the most of it?

How can I pivot toward data analysis or product management later?

Should I start looking for better-aligned roles now or just treat this internship as a stepping stone?

Lastly, will I face any repercussions or have to pay anything from my side if I leave the firm after completing the internship?


Would really appreciate any guidance or input from those who’ve been through something similar. Thanks in advance!

TL;DR:
Engineering grad, started a logistics internship (mostly for Excel), not enjoying the work. Want to transition to data analysis/product roles and eventually pursue an MBA. Seeking advice on how to make the most of the current internship, pivot after, and whether there are any issues with leaving post-internship.

I’ve been self-learning MERN stack development and I’m in my first semester of Computer Science (online, Virtual University of Pakistan). I don’t have any internships or industry-level experience yet, but I enjoy coding and have been building projects on my own.

Lately though, I’ve been feeling demotivated. No income yet, and I constantly wonder if I’m wasting time.  
My brother, who’s in Dubai, suggested I do a NEBOSH safety officer course and move there. He says I can easily get a job with starting pay around 2 lakh PKR/month or more.

Now I’m torn:

* On one hand, I enjoy coding and see long-term potential in tech.
* On the other, the Dubai option seems more stable and pays well from the start.

I’m really confused.  
Should I keep trying with software development and stay patient — or take the NEBOSH route and start earning soon?

1ku3wqh,Should I wok on a company without a Contract?,"I am graduate architect here in PH who is seeking a job opportunity from **large construction firms**, but it was harder than I thought, it took me almost a year to find a job until I found one, a legit one ( or so I thought), I rather not name the company so not to burn some bridges, but on the of my scheduled interview I already noticed a **red flags with the HR**,

So they contacted me first through indeed which I promptly replied immediately and they gave me a contact of the through whatspp, and there we discussed about the details of the position that are opened, they gave me the CAD Operator position, so passed the initial interview with the HR and scheduled me to do some face to face interview onsite for the final one with the head Architect.  
As that day came and I did went to their office, but on arrival I noticed some confusion with the Head Architect that would supposed to have interview with, he was never notified by the HR about this scheduled meeting and this caused confusion around the office, that made me wait for 2 hours, but hesitantly the Head Architect decided to give time for our interview.

To cut the story short I passed the final interview, and after 2 days the HR contacted me that I am hired and requested the time of avialability for my 1st day, which we both agreed that next week I can start immediately, but as the day comes close I noticed that the HR never gave me any documents or agreements, to sign before I star working, because I never experience this before, I'm starting to grow suspicous and concerned that these might be a **Red Flag.**

Now whenever I follow up with the HR she just keep promising me to send the documnets to my email which I haven't recieved yet until now, should I continue with my 1st day without ever signing a contract?",Hanigama_sama,2,1.0,2,1748063586,2025-05-24 05:13:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ku3wqh/should_i_wok_on_a_company_without_a_contract/,5,2025

1ku3kz1,Confused between Tech Career and NEBOSH/Safety Job in UAE — Need Real Advice,"Hey everyone,  
I'm feeling really torn between two paths and would love some honest advice.

I'm currently a self-taught MERN stack developer (React, Node.js, MongoDB, etc.). I’m also in my first semester of Computer Science at Virtual University of Pakistan (online). I’ve built some projects, trying to break into freelancing or remote work, but I don’t have internship or industry experience yet. Still, I enjoy coding and I do see myself as a developer.

Now here’s the dilemma:

My brother is in the UAE and he’s suggesting I do the **NEBOSH safety officer course**. He says I could easily get a job there with a starting salary around **2 lakh PKR/month or more**, which is honestly tempting — especially with how slow tech can be in the beginning. But I'm worried about what I’ll be giving up.

I ultimately want to **settle in Europe or the US**, and I’m not sure if going into safety in the Middle East helps or blocks that path.

So I’m asking:

* Is a safety job after NEBOSH in UAE *mentally exhausting* or relatively chill?
* Will I have time/energy left to continue coding and growing in tech on the side?
* Is it possible to switch back to tech later if I go the NEBOSH route now?
* Has anyone here done this — either path — and what would you honestly recommend?

My goal is simple: I want to **earn well**, **live in peace**, and **build a future abroad**. Should I stick with tech, be patient and consistent — or take the NEBOSH route for quick money and stability?

Would really appreciate your thoughts. Thanks in advance!",hanzalakhan7,2,1.0,1,1748062353,2025-05-24 04:52:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ku3kz1/confused_between_tech_career_and_neboshsafety_job/,5,2025

1ku1puu,Is changing my job title a lie?,"I was recently laid off but have been job hunting for about 6 months. I have spent the last 5 years managing digital advertising and strategy for a company with the title of “digital marketing coordintor” despite my boss and I both working to get my title updated knowing what I was doing wasn't coordination. We were told “Manager” is reserved for people managers at the company.

I have seen part-time low-pay entry level roles at companies in my area hiring as “Digital Marketing Manager” which makes the title i had feel like more of a kick in the teeth.

I have been applying for jobs for 6months with maybe a 5% call back rate. And barely anything that even matched my skillset which left me confused. I did AI help, ATS help, literally nothing. I really sat back and revamped my resume 3 months ago and used what I had learned and there were hardly any jobs but also crickets, i was about to just give up when i decided to just try changing my title from Coordinator to Manager just to see… then bam 9 interviews at different companies in 7days. Then I was laid off. So I did the Digital Marketing Manager (officially: Digital Marketing Coordinator ) and back to crickets.

I just need to know if I am listing it as DMM and when they call my last company and hear them say DMC is it going to look bad or is the title almost as interchangeable as it feels like anymore?

1ku1c6l,How to cope with new job,"I left an office job that I truly loved. It felt like a huge part of my identity—my coworkers were some of my closest friends, and I felt rooted there. But I could see the writing on the wall: the company was headed toward a major reorganization, and the environment was changing fast. I knew I had to get out before it all unraveled.

I took a remote job that offered more money, thinking it was the right move. From the very first week, I knew I’d made a mistake. The culture is cutthroat. There’s no support, no real structure, and absolutely no sense of team. It’s all about “what can you do for us?”—there’s no strategy, just chaos. Everything feels built on personal opinions and politics, not actual plans. The environment is toxic, fake, and constantly shifting.

Just a month in, my boss left, and I’ve felt completely isolated ever since. I have touchpoints with execs, but I’m also expected to have difficult conversations that no one prepares me for. I’m thrown onto investor calls, handed more responsibilities, but all I get in return are cold shoulders, vague feedback, or worse—nothing at all. On paper, it looks like I’m doing well, but the way I’m treated makes it feel like they can’t stand me. It’s incredibly confusing and disheartening.

At this point, it’s affecting my health. I feel miserable and deeply depressed. I’m barely taking care of myself—some days I can’t even shower or wash my hair. I don’t leave the house. I wake up trying to stay hopeful, but the moment I check messages or get pulled into the next fire drill, I spiral into anxiety. The feedback I get is all over the place, and I can’t keep up with the constant shifts in expectations.

I want to quit. I really do. But right now, I feel stuck. I don’t know how to survive this without completely losing myself. I feel like I’m drowning in it—and I don’t know how to keep going.",Latter_Weekend3057,12,0.8500000238418579,8,1748054483,2025-05-24 02:41:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ku1c6l/how_to_cope_with_new_job/,5,2025

I never realized how much I was missing out, I was practically living in a concrete cube for 5 yrs.

My question to all of you is: where do I even go from here especially someone like me whos practically a blank slate to the point where i feel like an empty shell. It's  not like I can even apply anywhere either, I have no experience other than the warehousing gig I did straight outa HS, and everyone wants all these *skills* (god I hate that word with a passion) or 15 yrs experience and a bachelor's.

1ku08ft,Should I Go Back For a Master's?,"I'm 20 years old with a BA in education, but I’ve realized the field isn’t for me. Now, I’m considering returning to college for a master’s degree in finance or business, specifically in data analytics or business administration.

My main priority is securing a decently-paying job in a field I find at least somewhat enjoyable. The key things I’m looking for in a career are:

•Good salary

•Reasonable work-life balance (even if just 9-5 or four 10-hour days with three off but prefer shorter work weeks or flexible shifts)

•Availability across many small to medium cities, not just major metro areas

•Higher level of self autonomy and/or mostly independent work (even if it independently working within a team or with clients)

A master’s degree would cost me about $8,000 to $12,000, and I expect to have $25,000 saved/invested by the end of summer. My monthly expenses are fairly low $300-$500 since I currently live in rural West Virginia. By the end of summer after I finish an internship loosely related to education, human resources, and business, I plan to keep looking into my current career paths or jobs that pay decently that could build experience to a career path, and if I cant find anything I'll consider the master's.

Would love any advice on whether this path makes sense or if there are alternative options I should consider.",AnxiousBrilliant3,1,0.5699999928474426,18,1748050837,2025-05-24 01:40:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ku08ft/should_i_go_back_for_a_masters/,5,2025
1ktzzj5,My new workplace is disgusting?,"Hey so a bit of a long post. I work at a independent small company that prints signs for real estate. The job involves creating these signs by cutting down the print outs and applying them onto wood boards, metal, or other material. We were working out of his house until recently when we moved into this new place. I was working part time up until recently where I’m transitioning into more of a full time role, which to be honest I don’t really want to do.

The new place is an industrial warehouse. The problem is this place is disgusting. When we moved in it was full of bugs, cobwebs, and it smelled bad. My “office” is a small room with four walls, painted gray, cement floor (no carpet, no tiling, nothing), a cutting table, a closet, and admittedly a really nice expensive gaming computer for work. The paint is pretty beat up. The doors to the breakroom do not have handles. Random wires from ethernet or something hanging out of random walls of the office space in other rooms. There is a decent fridge in the break room I guess and he also did buy a lot of air freshners recently. Our office is air conditioned as well, but I found out today that my office is not insulated so it gets hot easy.

My boss expected me to clean up all the dead bugs, cobwebs, and junk off the floor my first work day there. By the way, I accepted this job because I thought I’d be doing graphic design. It turns out it doesn’t really seem like graphic design, it’s more like rearranging premade assets other people made and dicking around with printers and x-acto knives. I'm working in illustrator and Photoshop pretty little. He also expects me to vacuum the throw rug in my room (which I told him I do not want since it is an extra step but there it is…), sweep, and mop my office, the hallway, the front room, and the break room on top of my usual duties.

I know its a warehouse and there will be bugs. But every day I’ve been there I discover a bug. Daddy long legs in the closet with the mop (still there btw), webbed up dead bug in the corner of the same cloest. Spider in the ceiling corner of the bathroom (also still there after a week). Even after sweeping I still find random cobwebs somewhere. A small spider tried landing on my keyboard the other day. Found a beetle on the way to the restroom a few days ago. We just moved in like a week and a half ago at most btw.

My boss is a cheapskate. Instead of getting handsoap for the bathroom he told us to use Dawn dish soap. There is hand soap in there right now, but my coworker put it in there, not my boss.

As I said before, we work with X-Acto knives. At the new place, we do not have a first aid kit. Granted we did just move in a little over a week ago, but even at his house which I worked at since February, there was no readily accessible first aid kit. My coworker told me it was in the other bathroom, but I didn’t know exactly where it was. I should note that we don’t cut on a real cutting table. We cut on a used wood sign balanced between two small step ladders. It has lots of hills and valleys especially after using them a while. They also make the x-acto knives dull pretty quick. One day at the old place (his house) I was in a hurry and the knife got stuck in the table. I pulled it out hard and cut my finger pretty badly. I didn’t know where the bandaids were. I asked his wife where they were but she seemed distracted so I ran out to my car to get one. It bled through the bandaid quickly. I had to put a paper towel over the cut to stop the bleeding which also did not work. I thought I had to go to the ER tbh. My coworker did get the first aid when I returned to the work room, but after bleeding through another bandaid I finally got it to stop after sealing it with multiple layers of medical tape. That happened 3 weeks ago. My coworker has also been stabbed by the blades before, though more out of her own foolishness.

I texted my boss if the new place has a first aid kit. He asked “what do you need that for” (I think because he was confused how I’d be bleeding because I wasn’t cutting anything that day but I’m not sure what he meant tbh). I told him because me and my coworker use x-acto knives and blah blah blah etc etc. He said “Yes we will get bandaids”. That was two days ago and we still don’t have a first aid kit.

My boss disappears for hours at a time, and not always for work reasons. He frequently goes to his church during work hours to do volunteering things..or something. He will also get on me frequently for not working fast enough when I’ve seen him talking to another old guy frequently and getting distracted a lot or watching YouTube instead of working. Normal CEO behavior I guess, but I feel like someone who tells me to work faster should lead by example. He also criticizes me a lot and doesn’t praise me much, frequently questioning how I’m doing things, and when something goes wrong he tends to look to me first since I’m the newest worker.

I should also note that the signs we lift are very heavy. I’m a small guy so I can’t lift much. My only coworker most of the time is a very overweight woman who I am somehow stronger than.

My boss is very anal about silly things like the size of his trash, one time even yelling at me from the street while driving off saying he knows I didn’t cut it down enough because I was pushing it down the trash, but happily sends off poor quality signs to customers. Sometimes they get damaged and he tells us to put sharpie on the marks since “you can’t see it up close since its going in a field off the road”. Sometimes there’s printing errors or minor cut mistakes and we send those off too. At the new place we have a big dumpster but he still wants his trash a certain size, telling me to cut it down before putting it in.

I also feel like I do busy work all the time, or things that my boss does not feel like doing which have nothing to do with what I thought I was being hired for. At his house every Friday I had to take out the trash from the office and wheel the trash down to the curb, including the trash cans which were his non-work house trash. I did it in the rain one time. I had to help him move his stuff to the new place and pack up his crap from his home office, a lot of which had nothing to do with work. This week I had to move the workplace refrigerator. It didn't have anything in it really, but it was really heavy. My boss said it wasn't heavy. I had to awkwardly drag it down the hall to the break room.

Sometimes even when I worked less than 25 hours a week, which was pretty much every week since I started until recently, I would work nearly 7 hours without a break or a lunch break. My boss wasn’t there on those days it was just me and my coworker.

One time my coworker came in with strep throat while we were at the home office. No mask or anything. She was going to work anyway. Our workspace was pretty small. She just said she ""won't talk"". Our job involves being in close proximity frequently. I said no and went home that day.

When I first got the job, my birthday was coming up so I asked the day off. My boss told me ""we don't get days off, except for Thanksgiving and Christmas"". My boss left from Thursday to Sunday one week to see his daughter being married. My coworker was gone one Friday with her husband at some place. I did end up getting the day after my birthday, but it was because it was a slow day anyway.

I would like to add, I do not have a key to the new office. My coworker however does. I'm pretty sure that basically all of the workers have keys to the new place but I do not. Not sure how I feel about that. I've shown up on time at 7 at the new office only to have to wait for my boss to show up.

So the reason I ask all of this is…is any of this stuff I can report to OSHA? In particular the cleanliness of the new office, lack of handsoap, first aid stuff, etc? Or am I just overreacting? I’ve been wanting to quit for a while but it was really hard getting a job for a while and I’m getting paid 15 an hour. My boss told me in the beginning he may pay me 20 an hour, I guess with the full time position, I don’t know if he still is going to. There were times when I felt like I was doing basically nothing and getting paid for it, and it had a schedule I liked initially. However with it switching to full time I have a bad feeling that I am going to get overworked. I've been told by others I'm making good money and that I shouldn't quit. By after I saw the new office, I cried pretty hard on the way home. I worked from 7:20 AM to 5 PM today and cried a lot on the way home too. I also have not been working here for very long (4 months?) and I don't want to disappoint anyone.

I'm starting to realize I'm being overworked too. I worked 7 to 5:30 today and did far more than anyone else. I was there earlier than pretty much everyone. My boss now expects me to clean two printers on top of my existing work, and has expressed that I need to sweep and mop the office every day too.

I have plenty of stories I can tell still. Does this sound like a bit much, OSHA report territory, or should I grow some balls? I don’t know if having bugs in your office counts as bad. Idk. I don’t have much work experience.",Photograph1517,0,0.5,12,1748050025,2025-05-24 01:27:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ktzzj5/my_new_workplace_is_disgusting/,5,2025
1ktzl5m,Am I in a hostile work environment or just being overly sensitive?,"I really need outside perspective because I’m second-guessing myself constantly.

I’m a Senior SEO Strategist in the U.S., working for a company where I manage two direct reports and handle SEO strategy for one of our sites. I’ve been in this role for a while (was promised the title “Manager” multiple times but never received it, despite completing manager training 3 years ago and acting as one ever since).

I took protected leave in July 2024: 3 months of paid maternity leave, then 2 months of short-term disability for postpartum anxiety. I returned end of December 2024, fully reengaged. I’ve been transparent, proactive, and doing more than expected—including identifying one direct report who stopped working for 3 weeks and onboarding a new hire who needed a lot of support.

Since returning, the environment has changed dramatically:

I’ve been publicly criticized and called out in meetings by our VP, sometimes to the point of tears.

I was told saying “I’m doing my best” could get me fired.

I was told “nothing will ever be good enough.”

My manager told me not to “shine too bright” and echoed similar discouraging language.

We’re now (all of my team and other teams) are required to document every task we do, in extreme detail—while being denied the ability to make basic SEO changes (H1s, meta titles, etc.), work on backlinks, or consolidate content (even though my job description includes all those tasks).

I’ve asked for KPIs or formal performance goals this year. I was told “we don’t have one.”

Last week I was asked by my VP about pages not being published.  I was confused and responded saying I was asked not to work on them. My manager and Director backed me up. The VP then said show me in writing where I said this. 

Our VP makes indirect comments like “SEOs have had 2.5 years on this and we’re not ranking” — but I’ve only been active on this site for ~5 months due to maternity leave. And the comparison doesn’t account for differences in resources or site challenges.

On top of that, my job description hasn’t been updated in over 18 months. I’ve changed verticals and am on a totally different site now.

I love my job. I care about my team. But I feel like I’m being set up to fail. I’m managing others without the title, I’m held accountable without authority, and the pressure to be perfect without tools is exhausting. I’m seeing a therapist again because this environment is triggering a trauma response from a past abusive relationship.

Fwiw every annual performance has been very positive.  I regularly ask my manager and director for constructive feedback.  They consistently have none. Im well respected in other verticals. 

Also others have voiced their similar concerns regarding my VPs behaviors. 

I don’t want to overreact. I haven’t formally filed anything—yet. I have a meeting with HR soon and I’m preparing documentation. But does this sound like a toxic environment? Am I being unreasonable?

I’d really appreciate any advice or perspective.

1ktyavf,Looking for Advice: Switching from Full Stack Development to Systems Engineering or Embedded Systems,"I've been working in the full stack microservice architecture field for about 6ish years now, mostly with Java, Spring Boot, React, Next.JS, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, all the usual services you see bundled together. Honestly, I've grown a little tired of it. I've enjoyed it a good bit of the time, but it's mostly been a result of just going along with the flow, as I've only really worked with software consultancies (the ones that are closer to contractors, think Capgemini, Accenture, etc).

I've done DevOps roles in the past, my university degree was basically an embedded systems development degree (com sci and electrical engineering hybrid) and I've always had a bit of a desire to move further down the stack.

If anyone has been able to switch to a different type of software engineering mid career, how did you do it? Were there any particular things you changed on a CV/Resume, framed differently, or just general tips you found helpful for switching.

I've got some very small relevant personal projects under my belt (nothing that'd wow anyone, honestly), and I've got some relevant experience with some of the tech used in both fields in my career to date. My only worry is that if I start to chop out too much of what I've done before in my career, it'll look a little odd to recruiters and my experience will start to look a little hollow.

Happy for any and all advice. Particularly if you've switched or you're in the systems engineering/embedded systems side of development. The one caveat I do have, is that I'm not really willing to put much time outside of work hours into extensive training. I'm happy to take more junior roles in these fields, but I just personally don't have much interest in doing a lot of coding outside of work. I'll do it occasionally, but this is more of a career than anything else to me. A career that I enjoy, but it starts at 9 and ends at 5 for me.

TL;DR - Looking for advice on switching from a full stack web app developer to systems engineering or embedded software development.

1ktxn9t,"Working for best friend as a favour, but not being fairly compensated.","Hi everyone! I'm currently dealing with a situation working for my best friend and it's causing some tension between us. It all started when my friend lost a big contract that was steady income for him. He decided to take a full time job aside from his business and asked me to help him with his business. I wanted to be of help, so I told him I'd help him. He was good at first, and I was very clear about my boundaries and expectations going in and he said it was fine. It's gotten to a point where I originally said I'd work 3 days a week. I'm a single father and I also have my own business I operate. He basically expects me to sit by the phone Monday to Friday and wait for work to come in. I don't get paid any standby time or a salary so if there's no work I go do my own thing. He gets angry when a job comes in last minute or on a weekend (which is the only time I have my daughter) expecting me to drop everything I'm doing and go do his work). It's created alot of tension as I feel like I'm helping as best I can but he's trying to push it to where I'm at his disposal but without the proper pay. I don't want to quit and leave him in a bind, but I also don't like that he's not being fair and compensating me expecting me to wait around without getting paid.

1ktxa5d,I feel guilty leaving a company so soon,"Back in November, I received a job opportunity that included a title bump and 50% raise. It felt like a dream. The only catch was that the office (3+ hours away from my city) was relocating in January, so for the month and a half between me starting and their planned move, I was going to have to commute to the office once a week. 
This plan fell through essentially the day I joined. The office move was pushed out 6+ months. So the last 7 months, I’ve been heading to the office 1-2 days a week and driving 6-7 hours in one day. No one (HR or manager) spoke to me about it, no support or travel expense reimbursement. The work was absolutely brutal too. 60-70 hours a week of crisis mode management. Working lunch breaks, weekends, nights.

I learned and grew A LOT during this time. I went to a music festival a month ago and had a moment to reflect on my life for the first time in 6 months, I’m not an emotional guy but I cried so much that weekend. I decided that I needed a change, so I reached out to my network and today landed a great job offer! $10k raise, unlimited PTO, and the office is 30 minutes away. A company that I’ve always wanted to work for too. 

That being said, I feel terrible leaving my current role so soon. It’s an absolute shit show, and they’re now officially moving the office to my city…but half of the (already lean) team is quitting due to no relocation assistance. My team left behind is already working at their absolute limit, and I cannot bear the fact that I will have to tell my boss that I’m leaving too. Any recommendations on how I can protect my professional recommendations and leave on a good note?

1ktwyro,Am I Unhirable?,"I have been working the same job for almost 5 years now. I’ve hated it for the last two. I am 27 with a degree in Corporate Communications. I graduated two months before the covid lockdown and ended up taking the first decent job I could find, not pertaining to my education.

I manage a small local printing business. My bosses have 4 other businesses, and once they noticed that I could run everything on my own, they pretty much stopped caring about my company and moved on to new things. At first, things were great and I got a couple raises and nice bonuses. Eventually, the veil was lifted and although I like the people I work for, the lack of benefits, not getting paid overtime, and very little support I get from those above me really started to weigh me down. 

Somehow they found out I was looking at another job opportunity and gave me a choice: stay and finally get the help I had been needing, or leave and they would close down the business. I had a 4 days to mull it over and ended up getting pretty pissed off that they would put that kind of pressure on me. When the next meeting day came around, they began talking about all these changes they were going to make since they decided to keep the business open (many of which I had asked for years before), but I told them I had lined something up. I agreed to stick around part-time to help train a couple people to cover my responsibilities until the other job began.

The other job was almost guaranteed…. until the board of directors put a nationwide freeze on hiring new employees about two months ago. I have been applying to all kinds of jobs since, just looking for something that can pay close to what I have been making (26/hr), but I‘ve been rejected by so many. I thought this job would look great on a resume. I helped start the business, turned its first profit, grew revenue by over 200%, and stayed in my position for 4+ years. What makes me seem like a bad hire? Is it because I worked for a small business? Is it because the printing industry is too niche? I’m losing hope on finding a new career path. I have a good cushion because I can work for my dad until I figure something out, but I can’t help but feel like I’m failing. 

Any advice?",RevanchistJax,3,0.8100000023841858,8,1748040810,2025-05-23 22:53:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ktwyro/am_i_unhirable/,5,2025
1ktwy5k,From design engineer to UI UX designer,"Hi, everyone. I just graduated from industrial design engineering. I decided to transition into this domain because although I enjoyed designing machinery, the working environment wasn’t a good fit for me. I was encouraged to explore this direction by my boyfriend, who is a computer engineer.

I discovered that there are many overlaps between this discipline and what I studied. After all, I already have a design mindset and I’m not unfamiliar with the methodologies that serve as its foundation. However, I do have some uncertainties.

Do you think pursuing a master’s degree in this area is necessary to reach a sustainable income level in the UI/UX sector? Or would participating in specialized training programs and building my own portfolio be sufficient to demonstrate my competence? I don’t have a background in programming, but my goal is to work independently on a project basis.

Naturally, my family wants me to pursue a path aligned with my engineering background and secure a position quickly, but I don’t envision a future for myself working on-site in production facilities. Do you think I’m making a wise choice? I understand that this field is highly competitive. Since I’m still laying the groundwork, I worry about falling behind others who have been preparing for this for years and have gained extensive experience.

I’m currently earning $145K total comp ($135K base + $10K bonus) in a medium cost of living city. I work in-office five days a week, and internal mobility here typically only results in a 5–10% raise, which is frustrating.

I just got a job offer for $150K base + 20% annual bonus at a company based in NYC. It’s a hybrid schedule (3 days in office), and the company seems to have a lot of growth potential.

Current job:

$135K base, $10K bonus
MCoL area
5 days in office (some flexibility)
Limited room for growth
No HSA option (all other benefits health, vision, 6% 401K match)

New offer:

$150K base, 20% bonus
NYC (HCoL)
Hybrid schedule
HSA available (same benefits as current)
Strong potential for growth

Some context:

I’m single, no kids
I don’t have to move to NYC—I could commute (about 1.5 hours by train)
My main focus is growing my career
I have $35K in student loans, which I’ll have paid off by June next year

I graduated last year with a degree in Visual Art/Graphic Design and Marketing and have been struggling to find a career job since. I live in rural Illinois so my options have been slim. The few design/marketing jobs I see almost always want a degree and 3 years of experience or they only pay around $15 and require a background in videography, design, and marketing. 

Currently I been working in retail and only work part time (only 28hr/week) at $16.50. The hours are spread out over 6 days a week with me working 3/4 weekends a month and when I do work a long enough shift to get a lunch its only 1/2 hour. The positive is the commute is only 5 minutes from my house so I go home on lunch and it’s a very easy job.

I got 1 official job offer at a small local print job mostly doing small editing and running machines. Positives are an hour lunch, 2 weeks paid vacation, no weekends, and I’ll be able to get experience there most other jobs in my field require. Its a very small office with only a few employees so no health insurance provided and the commute is 20 minutes from my house. They would like to know asap if I am interested and are looking for someone who is willing to stay longer term ~3 years. 

The second job isnt guaranteed but will be having interviews around the second week of June. It makes significantly more ($42-56k) which id expect if I did get it to be closer to the starting range. This is for a more experienced position so I was quite shocked to be offered an interview with no formal job experience. The commute for this one is also 20 minutes and will come with full benefits but I don’t know the specifics yet. 

I am at a dilemma because I would hate to accept the first job then if by chance I get the second one I would have to tell them never mind pretty much right at my start date. But I am also nervous about my chances at the second job and afraid if I hold out hope id be stuck working only part time for much longer.

1ktsmq2,Obtaining a Different College Major Advice,"Let me tell you my dilemma.

So not too long ago I was a traditional college student who was an honors graduate in high school. I ended up failing out of computer science, switched majors, and graduated with an electrical engineering degree. Overall I didn't do bad in college, but not too good either, but not good enough for me to get into graduate school, or at least a good one. And even if I could get into graduate school I don't think I'll do well due to how much I actually learned in college.

I blame my bad performance due to being immature, not knowing what to do after high school, and due to being lazy.

Eventually I was able to get an adjacent engineering job out of college at a top 500 fortune company, but it had nothing to do with electrical engineering; I didn't even want a job in electrical engineering anyways. ATM, I'm a top performer in my group in a large top 500 fortune company.

So my issue is that I want to get into graduate school, and possibly end up in a career field that I actually enjoy.

My plan right now is to go back to community college for computer science, the career field I'm actually interested in, get good grades, and then go to graduate school.

With all this in mind, I now have a new problem. My issue is that my work experience all lies in an engineering field I have no interest in. And if I go to graduate school in the career field that I actually want I'll end up not being able to land a job in that field, and if I do land a job in that field I'll have start at the bottom of the pay scale, which will be less than what I'm actually making. And at the same time, if I do land job in the career field I want I'm unsure if I'll be able to perform in that job role as well as the one I'm currently at.

So I'm thinking about eventually getting a masters in materials science which I somewhat have interest in, and would definitely help me land a different job or a promotion at where I work at. Though I will say that I don't have much interest in job fields related to materials science.

Does anybody have any suggestions on how I should proceed with my career goals?",UtopiaNation,3,1.0,1,1748029343,2025-05-23 19:42:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ktsmq2/obtaining_a_different_college_major_advice/,5,2025

1kts6ep,Mid-Career Pivot: Mechanical Engineer Moving Abroad from India - Semiconductor,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some honest advice and perspective on a big career move I'm considering.

I’ve spent the last 8 years working at a leading semiconductor capital equipment company in India, starting right out of college as a Mechanical Engineer. I've grown steadily from ME-1 to ME-4, currently leading programs that involve full lifecycle development—from concept to global fab deployment.

While I’ve had strong career growth and enjoy my current projects (many of which have had real business impact), I feel a growing appetite for more responsibility—especially hands-on engineering work in a cleanroom and opportunities to organically grow into leadership. Unfortunately, both of these are difficult to find in India’s current semiconductor landscape.

Recently, I came across a job posting for a COO at a similar company, and one key requirement stood out: *international experience, particularly in the U.S. semiconductor industry.* This hit me hard. I realized that if I stay in my current role—despite liking the work—I might limit my long-term leadership prospects. There will always be someone with broader global exposure.

So, after much reflection, I’ve decided to explore job opportunities outside India—preferably in the U.S., Europe, or developed parts of Asia. I’m especially interested in roles where I can stay close to the technology while building the foundation for eventual leadership. I’m open to relocation and don’t have any major personal ties at the moment, so the timing feels right.

A few things I’d love your input on:

1. **Does this thought process make sense to you?** Am I being realistic or too idealistic?
2. **How feasible is it for someone with my experience and background to land a solid job abroad—especially in the U.S. or Europe?**
3. **Are language barriers a major issue in non-English-speaking countries for engineering roles?**
4. **What should my strategy be to make this international move successful?** Any specific tips on companies, recruiters, or ways to position myself?

I have my resume on my profile for reference. I’d deeply appreciate any advice, critiques, or suggestions from this community.",SippinOuttaLastStraw,2,1.0,0,1748028160,2025-05-23 19:22:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kts6ep/midcareer_pivot_mechanical_engineer_moving_abroad/,5,2025
1ktrh89,"Stuck in a job for 16+ years, seeking a way out","Hi there. I'm writing this with a throwaway account. I'm desperately seeking help on how to move forward with my career and life. 
I started a job in 2009 working in an upscale hospitality establishment. It is a small business with one location but a well known reputation, being in business for over 40 years. I started at the front desk and over the years gained more responsibilities. Fast forward to present day and I'm integral to the business. I do almost everything but payroll. I make about 76k a year in an area where cost of living is high and 90k+ incomes are the norm at other places in different fields. 

I am close on a personal level with the owners. I know that if I were to leave, they would be very upset and possibly feel betrayed. I have felt very loyal to this company which makes all of this very difficult.  
I'm not growing and I'm not learning anything new. The job is hard and the demands are high. 
I want to make more money. I want to buy a house and achieve more life goals. I'm middle aged now and I'm feeling old. I don't think I'll ever make more money at this place. While I don't do payroll, I have access to the accounting side, so I see how much the business is making and I know what people are paid. 
I'm afraid. This place has been a comfort zone. I am hoping someone might have some advice or help for me as I try to navigate this. Thanks so much for reading.

1ktrfg5,"Is it smart to write off volunteering experience as ""freelance""?","Basically I'm currently unemployed right now, and as all unemployed people do, I applied to a bunch of volunteering sites trying to gain experience (it's also nice to feel that I'm not a complete bum haha). I'm currently volunteering at 4 different places (market research, bookselling, giving educational talks to kids, and planning an event), and I've been putting them all on my CV as freelance experience. I figured that's a smart move since I've seen discussions on how recruiters DON'T want to hire unemployed people (which doesn't really make sense if you ask me since those people are the ones who need jobs the most!!! but anyway). 

Is this a good strategy? Does anyone have a similar experience?

One of the biggest hurdles has been explaining the career gap. I want to be honest without going into the full extent of my personal trauma, but I sometimes feel that without sharing the deeper context, my gap is misunderstood or overlooked.

1ktr564,"Feeling stagnant, mentor is gone, I don’t know who to talk to.","I (25m) work for a large corporation in the finance sector. Been in my current role for almost 2 years now, it’s my first job out of university where I earned a bachelors in finance and a masters’ in data science. 

Initially the money was good and I guess it still is, my manager told me I would see a “significant” raise when I completed the training program and another “significant” raise around 4 year mark when I hit the next level of employee. I completed the training program and received a 10% raise, which I was mildly disappointed by given the use of the word significant (10% is more standard no?). I know I should have tempered my expectations but I didn’t. I let it go because it also opened the door to better annual bonuses and some other incentives that are decent. 

I was told throughout training that although I would eventually come to manage my own book of business, I will be taking over for a guy that is heading towards retirement, so until then I will be shadowing and assisting teammates. Well, fast forward two years later and this guy still doesn’t have a retirement date set, (I don’t really hold any negative feelings toward him, he doesn’t owe me anything) and I am still sitting on my hands and bugging my teammates to give me work. Meanwhile every one of my peers from training has their own book and I just sit and listen to their wins and stories when we catch up. 

I’m about to hit two years here and i feel like I have basically nothing to show for it, and all I have to look forward to is another “significant” 10% raise in two years (maybe?). I am trying to save up for a house with my significant other and even though we save 40% of our paychecks it feels impossible with the current housing market. We just moved from a two bedroom apartment to a one bedroom to save some more money. The fact that we are a dink family and I have a masters degree and we still felt the need to downsize to a one bedroom apartment has radicalized me (lol).

The thing that has kept me from looking around at other jobs are the people here, my teammates are great people, and my manager is exactly what you want in a manager. (Although none of them came to my wedding that was a year after I started, red flag?) Dude’s beyond chill and understanding and is just a nice guy, but I still don’t really know how or if I should approach him about any of this. We discuss timelines and the organization etc. I just don’t know how to express my frustrations with him. Role is super flexible, hybrid work and I get to attend events and golf occasionally which is awesome. I was assigned a mentor from another business unit and he was awesome to talk to in respect to traversing the org but he left 6 months ago so I feel like I’m on my own here. 

Really the thing that has sped this up for me lately is that my manager informed us we will be bringing on another trainee in July. I have been practically begging for more work for over a year so I can build my career but instead we are hiring another person who will take even more of my work. I don’t want to be grouped in with them but I can already see it coming, as my manager accidentally called me a trainee when we were discussing the new team member. Also, the fact that they will make only 10% less than me day one is infuriating when I have a masters degree and they do not. 

How should I go about discussing this with my manager? Time to test the market? Any advice is welcome.

Anyway, sorry for the long post I guess I needed to vent. Thanks. ",Positive_Remote_2059,1,1.0,1,1748025607,2025-05-23 18:40:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ktr564/feeling_stagnant_mentor_is_gone_i_dont_know_who/,5,2025
1ktr4fq,Unhappy in job,"Hey y’all - 

Got my BS in Elementary Education, I’m fully certified to teach in Texas. If I wanted to, I could get certified to teach middle or high school as well. 

After my first year of teaching, I left. Many factors played into my leaving but ultimately I was not in the right environment. I thought I didn’t like teaching, but now I realize it might’ve been my admin and other factors that played into me not wanting to return. 

Fast forward, now I’m in sales. I met an insurance agent and she offered me a position selling insurance for her agency. I’ve been in the position for 4 months now, and I don’t know how I feel about it. I’m not very happy at work. 

As a teacher, I had a creative outlet within the job. Now, I’m working at a computer and doing all my sales over the phone. It’s just kind of draining. 

I had a one-on-one with my boss, and she said, “I hope you like what you’re doing, I hope you’re having fun.” I’m not really. Not really having fun (not that your job has to be fun..) I would say overall I’m not really happy. And it’s sinking my motivation. My boss said she values transparency, and i think she wants to know if I’m happy in what I’m doing or not. I could tell her I’m unhappy but I’m worried that’ll make her consider terminating me. 

I have the potential to earn more than I had as a teacher, which is a huge driving factor as to why I chose this job, but I just don’t really like what I’m doing. 

Im aware not all jobs need to be fun, lol. But I think doing work that aligns with your personality, gifts, and talents is a good start. I don’t think this job aligns with my personality and gifts as well as teaching did. 

It’s hard. Idk what to do. But it’s summertime, I’m missing my summers off. And also, I’m not really happy doing what I’m doing.

1ktqs0h,"4 years, 4000+ applications, a useless degree, and zero hope left","I graduated 4 years ago with a marketing degree I barely scraped through. My grades were awful, not because I didn’t care, but because I was already burnt out before I even finished. Thought I’d figure it out after. Spoiler: I didn’t.

Since then? Over 4,000 applications. Entry-level jobs. Internships. Volunteer roles. Remote gigs. Anything. I’ve rewritten my resume so many times it doesn’t even feel like me anymore. I’ve done free work “for experience.” I’ve watched jobs vanish mid-process. Ghosted after final rounds. Rejected for roles paying minimum wage.

I know I’m not special. My degree isn’t impressive. My GPA sucks. But I just… I didn’t think it would be this impossible. I thought if I kept going, something would crack open. Something would happen.

Every day I wake up and apply again. Every night I go to sleep thinking maybe tomorrow. And repeat. Four years. Nothing.

Everyone says “network.” I’ve messaged people, joined groups, gone to events. Most don’t even reply. Some are nice but can’t help. Some straight up say, “your profile doesn’t stand out.” Like, yeah. I know.

I feel like I’m screaming into a void. Watching everyone build lives while I’m still begging for a chance to prove I’m not a complete failure.

1ktq2xh,Need advice on changing careers from the arts / design field,"About to start looking for work again after a year-long medical break (got sick last year and my treatment period is almost up).

I’m a graphic artist who’s worked in advertising & marketing the past 5 years, freelancing as an illustrator and storyboard artist on the side. Have a fine arts degree with honors. Basically grew up thinking I wouldn’t want to do anything else besides art, but somewhere along the line, I ended up getting anxious and demotivated to create (had a panic attack once just from opening Photoshop. That’s when I realized just how bad it was.) I know it’s inevitable, but AI in the design field has been deeply discouraging for me as well — as an artist I’d say it hits particularly hard compared to other, more technical fields as it feels like giving off a part of yourself in your work, no matter how personal or professional.

I want to love art again, even if I don’t feel the same joy from it anymore as I once did. I’m thinking of stepping away from it as a career so I can rediscover my passion for it without pressure.

That said, need advice on what I can pivot towards with just a fine arts degree. I’ve always been really interested in psychology and have been thinking about getting an MA degree in it, but I don’t know what jobs I can take in the meantime to bridge towards that. I also wouldn’t mind museum / archive work, I enjoy learning stuff and collecting random info. Aside from that, I’m mostly introverted but can hold my own in presentations / pitches.

Then I was laid off. So I did the Digital Marketing Manager (officially: Digital Marketing Coordinator ) and back to crickets.

1ktksiu,I feel completely directionless in my career - need help please,"I’m 25F and feel completely lost about my career. I really need some genuine advice to help me make sense of where I’m heading and what I should do next or atleast some good leads to GOOD career counseling sessions.

Here’s my story:
I studied computer engineering, and started out as a data engineer. I worked for 2.5 years in 2 known companies. But the truth is — I was miserable. I would wake up crying almost every day. I couldn’t understand the work, didn’t feel like I was learning anything valuable, and lived in constant fear of getting laid off with zero real skills. I just couldn’t bring myself to like it, no matter how hard I tried.

After quitting my second data engineering job, I took career counseling hoping it would give me some direction. It didn’t help much, but I did learn that my personality type is ISFJ — introverted, responsible, and drawn to work that feels purposeful and stable.

Eventually, I moved into a content writer role, and now I also handle growth and marketing-related tasks. It’s not perfect, but it’s more aligned with how I think and work. Still, there’s this lingering confusion — i don’t enjoy it, constantly hearing AI would replace a writer like me. I dont like the chaos that comes with marketing.

Am I just hopping around too fast without giving myself time to grow, or am I genuinely not in the right roles yet?

I’m now considering doing an MBA to pivot to something more structured and possibly managerial — but I have a 6-day work week, and preparing for CAT is incredibly tough with the limited time and energy I have. I’m mentally exhausted, but I also deeply crave a stable career, a decent income, and a job I don’t dread waking up for.

I know I’m not dumb. I’m hardworking and capable. But I feel like I’ve lost the plot somewhere. I just want to find work that makes sense for me — where I can grow, feel confident, and not live in a constant state of anxiety.

If you’ve been through something like this, or if you have any clarity to offer on how to navigate such a crossroads — please help. I’m all ears, and I’m looking for honest, grounded advice.

Thank you so much in advance.

1ktjowa,I am thinking about quitting my job but I'm not sure it's the right time as I don't know what to do after,"It is not easy to write this post as it's hard for me to actually write how I feel and what I want.

I'm paid well when I compare to the average in my country but I doubt I could find a job nearby with the same salary and with that much advantages. The thing is, I hate the company's culture and I find myself not enjoying working with people here.

I don't have any close work-relationships here, the management is absent and useless, I really have no one to talk to when it comes to those things. I feel like if you're not in the favorites you are just expected to rot there for a few years then move on, as there is a lot of turnover here.

I want to work on new projects as I actually need to fill my portfolio and my CV and I havent been able to do anything here. Everything feels clogged, like there is no point to even ask, people will say ""yes"" or ""i'll keep you updated"" but you never hear from them again. 0 dynamic, everything is static.

The product we sell is outdated and not very good, the whole process is terrible and unoptimized, I think a lot here are not competent enough, I don't like my team and there are many underlying problems like useless managers (they don't actually manage anything) and a terrible culture overall.

I have been there for 3 years but I haven't been able to get any sort of recognition so far. I am not very social at work and I have never been able to network and get to know the ""right"" people. I think I'm too  introverted and moody.

I don't see myself as a misunderstood genius or whatever, but I fear I'm stuck there with no way upward, just a good salary. And I'm thinking that it may be my fault, maybe I dont smile or do small talk enough.

I'm thinking of leaving but the market is not easy (web front-end/graphic design), I'm planning on buying a home and there dont seem to be many job offers around here. Plus I'm afraid I'll be jobless in a dead field in a few years because of AI. so I am also thinking about doing something that won't get replaced by a robot. 

A part of me is hoping for something eventually, but I don't know, there is too much inertia here and I kinda feel ignored.  
I could get more motivated if there were some change here. Something new to learn, being trusted with a new project for the company, besides doing the same thing over and over again. I could finally fill my portfolio and feel like I have been doing something those past few years. 

I have dreams and projects but those won't pay the bills unfortunately.

1ktjf1c,How does one decide a specific career path *before* college?,"Hello. I am an 18 year old in the last year of high school. I would be entering college next year. After somewhat of a careful analysis- I have decided to major in either statistics or mathematics with a minor in computer science. I've loved mathematics and some of computer science during the recent years. However, I don't have a pre-baked passion or a very specific career direction to follow in my mind as of now. I strongly feel that I would not be able to find that 'specific' career path or passion unless and until I actually get my hands dirty by engaging in learning and exploring areas of my interest for some amount of time. And even then, I have to acknowledge that my values/interests/etc... may change over time causing me to dislike that very particular career that I thought was the ""one"" for me. 
As of now, I want to get into the previously mentioned undergrads and learn things in computer science and other adjacent fields that interest me and figure out for myself that what is it that I can do that pays decently and ensures that I'm fulfilled with what I do. All I can say right now is that I want to get into math-heavy industry jobs involving computer science. But even that, is a generalized thing to say as the disciplines I've mentioned divide into a whole lot of sub-fields with complicated relationships with each other and varying industrial application. I can't begin to understand the specifics of those to decide accurately that it is a career path that I want to pursue. 
If I had to state my values or my desired work conditions then obviously I don't want to overwork _really_ badly (like all people don't want to do so). I acknowledge that you must never stop learning new things that interest you (at least) to progress in life. And I'm all in for learning. I want to learn several new things while doing my job (thru the job) (is it overly-idealistic?)
My parents believe that I must have a specific career direction/path and job description by the end of HS (or title) to not get lost and end up unemployed. (Otherwise I'd end up like most of the youth roaming around with useless degrees and no job). I feel that they are kind of wrong- how does one narrow so many career options to a few while they have only studied (and experienced) learning (and no working) till high school level. There are a shit ton of things that I don't know of and don't understand adequately to state them as my career path! But, since I have no experience regarding this, I'm taking their advice into consideration. However, I still believe that one must keep a broad and open mindset always open to learning new things and having a goal of helping others (as in, the application of their skills and interests into the industry/society) to progress throughout their careers. 
There are so many things I do not know and understand so I am very very confused about my future career plans. How can I just so simply decide a specific career path with so little knowledge?
Can someone give their advice/thoughts on this and share their experience regarding similar dilemmas(past or present)? If so, it'd be highly appreciated. Thank you.

1kti8z2,Thinking about career move into sales,"I’m 27, from Poland, currently working as an analyst, and lately I’ve been considering a move into sales.

What draws me in is the idea that sales rewards hard work and offers real growth potential if you're willing to put in the time. The environment I’m in now just counts down to 5 p.m. and Friday. Personally, I actually enjoy working, often taking overtime just because I like pushing myself. I also feel the need for more human interaction at my work.

I do have one concern about making the switch: I’m a pretty calm, reserved person. I’m more into deeper one-on-one conversations than loud, high-energy interactions.

So I’ve got a few questions:

* Can someone with a more introverted personality actually succeed in sales?
* Can charisma be learned, or do you need to be naturally high-energy to succeed in sales?
* Would B2B sales make more sense for someone like me, personality wise? Does that depend on the industry?
* Most B2B roles especially at bigger companies seem to require experience, which I don’t have. Should I aim for a smaller company even if the culture doesn’t totally fit (fast-paced and higher energy) and make transition after gathering some experience? Or rather shoot for a bigger company and try alternative ways to break in? With smaller companies I am a bit afraid of no real onboarding given I don't have sales experience that might be a challenge.
* Is it worth investing in courses or mentors if I have no sales experience yet or are there better ways to start preparing after work (skills to build, habits to develop, practical steps)?

I would be very thankful for any advice. Thank you",Impressive-Win2595,1,1.0,0,1748003108,2025-05-23 12:25:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kti8z2/thinking_about_career_move_into_sales/,5,2025

I recently took the board exam but unfortunately didn’t pass. I really want to try again and pass it, but here’s the dilemma—my previous OJT company offered to absorb us, and the opportunity is in Japan. The offer is really good and seems like a great career move.

However, if I accept the job in Japan, I won’t be able to retake the board exam anytime soon. I’m torn between two options:
	1.	Stay in my home country, retake the board exam, and try to find a job here (though local offers aren’t that great), or
	2.	Accept the job in Japan, gain international experience, and possibly give up on the board exam for now.

Mind you, I've been part-time on this M-F shift for a long time trying to get promoted to full-time (for 2.5 yrs now), but my boss decided to pull someone from weekends and gave it to them!

I'm honestly trying to hold it together everyday now. First, I really don't like my job because of the culture. I'm in a male-dominated field, I'm the only woman on my team, and now I feel very ousted and disowned by my boss.

1ktevp3,(fun) What's the weirdest productivity hack for career growth you swear by?,"Here’s mine: voice dictation — aka talking to
my laptop.

I know, it sounds ridiculous. But hear me out.

I used to spend way too much time crafting
the “perfect” email or Slack message or
report. I’d tweak wording endlessly, overthink
tone, and get stuck trying to sound “just right.”

Then someone in a career guidance circle
suggested trying voice dictation. I thought it
was ridiculous, but it’s been an amazing life
hack. Something about speaking things like
emails, messages, etc helps me get things
done faster. It’s helped me communicate
faster, with less anxiety, and get more done
between meetings. Especially helpful when
your brain is fried from context switching 9
times a day.

If you're curious about voice dictation, I’m
happy to help you speed up the process.
Here's a quick review of some tools I tested:

Apple/Windows/Word Dictation (free)

Pros: Free, built-in, easy setup.

Cons: Not great. Honestly better for quick
notes or short emails. For longer reports or
decks, it struggled. Lots of typos, weird
sentence structures. I found fixing the output
often took longer than just typing from
scratch.

Dragon Dictation (paid)

Pros: It’s the classic.

Cons: Feels pretty outdated now. Especially
for Mac users (they abandoned support).
Interface is clunky, accuracy isn’t great for
fast-paced business speech, and it’s just not
great for consulting workflows.

WillowVoice (free)

Pros: This is the one I'm currently using. It's
super fast (under 1-second delay), and the
accuracy is fantastic. It’s great even when I
throw in a lot of industry jargon or acronyms.
You can upload custom terms, which makes a huge difference.

Cons: Mac only (for now).

Dictation has been a serious lifehack for me
in terms of getting work done faster like
emails and messaging done faster. Curious to hear if you guys have lifehacks like this as
well that you discovered.",Krishna_8105,2,0.75,0,1747990890,2025-05-23 09:01:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ktevp3/fun_whats_the_weirdest_productivity_hack_for/,5,2025

1ktdsy9,Can someone please give me advice on what to do ?,"Hello,

I am writing this post because I’m in need of some advice. I’m a college student and currently working as a security guard (25, F). I’ve been in this job for almost a year, and while I’m grateful to be employed, I’ve been facing a number of issues that have left me feeling lost about what to do next.

The first issue is the level of disrespect I’ve encountered. It got so bad that I lost my first job because they scheduled my security training during the hours I was supposed to be at my other job. Secondly, the pay is extremely low. In fact, even the supervisors have admitted that this is one of the lowest-paying posts available. Despite knowing this, I’ve had to endure nearly a year of coworkers constantly showing up late, which cost me opportunities to find a second job to replace the first one I lost. I’m still looking for another job—something I can stick with that isn’t too far from where I live—but it’s been a complete struggle.

My third issue is that although I was working part-time, the pay was still painfully low. I’ve worked hard to build my savings, but I’ve had to dip into them just to make it through each week. I only recently started working 40-hour weeks and am just now beginning to see semi-decent paychecks compared to the \$200–\$400 I was making before. I’m exhausted from constantly being in survival mode.

On top of that, my ex used me to get a new apartment, stripping me of everything I had to help him, and now this job is making me feel worthless. I’m tired. This job has wrecked me financially and has taken a toll on my mental health. I’ve had days where I was extremely sick and vomiting, and when I called off, I was still written up. I’ve also been penalized for things outside of my control, like public transportation delays.

Today, I tried to call a supervisor to be honest about how I’m feeling—I’m extremely suicidal because of all this—and to request just ONE day off. I called twice, professionally, asking how to go about this, but instead of reaching a live person, I was sent a message saying to wait until tomorrow( BY A SUPERVISOR MIND YOU) FOR ANOTHER MANAGER TO ASSIST  ME DURING THE TIME OF 9AM -5PM  knowing that I work the overnight shift and go to college during the day and have little to no time to talk to someone else on top of that they wouldn't even give me their name. That was the last straw for me.

I’m actively looking for a new job while still working here, hoping something better comes along. Does anyone have advice on how to handle this situation or know of any jobs that pay decently—even if they’re not in security? Ideally, something that pays \$20/hr or more. I don’t care what level it is, as long as it gets me out of the security field. I’d love something remote, travel-friendly, or that at least gives me the opportunity to build a better life for myself.

I have big dreams and goals, and I’m tired of being slowed down. Any advice, guidance, or job leads would be deeply appreciated. I’m also open to DMs.

Thank you in advance for your support 💗",Maryonwater,1,1.0,0,1747986192,2025-05-23 07:43:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ktdsy9/can_someone_please_give_me_advice_on_what_to_do/,5,2025

1ktcu5h,Mid-Career Pivot: Mechanical Engineer Moving Abroad from India - Semiconductor,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some honest advice and perspective on a big career move I'm considering.

I’ve spent the last 8 years working at a leading semiconductor capital equipment company in India, starting right out of college as a Mechanical Engineer. I've grown steadily from ME-1 to ME-4, currently leading programs that involve full lifecycle development—from concept to global fab deployment.

While I’ve had strong career growth and enjoy my current projects (many of which have had real business impact), I feel a growing appetite for more responsibility—especially hands-on engineering work in a cleanroom and opportunities to organically grow into leadership. Unfortunately, both of these are difficult to find in India’s current semiconductor landscape.

Recently, I came across a job posting for a COO at a similar company, and one key requirement stood out: *international experience, particularly in the U.S. semiconductor industry.* This hit me hard. I realized that if I stay in my current role—despite liking the work—I might limit my long-term leadership prospects. There will always be someone with broader global exposure.

So, after much reflection, I’ve decided to explore job opportunities outside India—preferably in the U.S., Europe, or developed parts of Asia. I’m especially interested in roles where I can stay close to the technology while building the foundation for eventual leadership. I’m open to relocation and don’t have any major personal ties at the moment, so the timing feels right.

A few things I’d love your input on:

1. **Does this thought process make sense to you?** Am I being realistic or too idealistic?
2. **How feasible is it for someone with my experience and background to land a solid job abroad—especially in the U.S. or Europe?**
3. **Are language barriers a major issue in non-English-speaking countries for engineering roles?**
4. **What should my strategy be to make this international move successful?** Any specific tips on companies, recruiters, or ways to position myself?

I’ve attached my resume for reference. I’d deeply appreciate any advice, critiques, or suggestions from this amazing community.

1ktbord,What career path should I choose if I'm lost ..,"Hie I'm f22 
Qualification: B.A in Arts .
Scroll down for career part . 

CONTEXT :
I always wanted to be social worker or cosmetologist that will answer origiin of universe , humans everything etc at 15 

Life took a turn amidst of loosing two years of school and betrayel my guardian  and finally lockdown  with mental health problems I struggle years with . 

I used to be in yoga , taekwondo, quiz , interschool debates , dance etc . Everything dropped.

Couldn't choose a career because I developed a fear of getting stuck , so everytime I think of a career path I end up feeling suffocated back then. 

In 2022 i was finally better after working on myself but end up in a toxic relationship and he started emotionally abusing me in 2024 with sexual abuse in dec 2024 , night before my internship final college exam . Idk if it was Rape or extreme SA since I felt no pain ,I was scared  .Thought I was toxic too .
I had to stay all night completing internship report awake crying hungry in cold alone.


Asked him to break up he won't saying I have abandonment issues 
( he have extreme childhood trauma ) 
Etc . Parents involved everything a mess 
A legal case that I'll end soon , delay in graduation and all this 

PRESENT SCENARIO and CAREER : 

As of now my I'm feeling better and looking forward  to build a strong career but I'm lost . 

I have always wanted to have either a slow life with swimming classes , taekwondo , nature , travel or being able to do something to help people on ground level . 

I have always loved ancient Indian history , travel , investigation like solving crimes etc.

My dream of a slow life shattered thanks to my ex and idk how to start dreaming again . 

Here I am considering these careers but lost and feeling like a loser for having this stupid degree which I end up taking due to wrong guidance . 


1.  Underwater archeology
( Expensive , not much scope in india , I'm from north india but I love swimming , history and exploring ) 

2. Professor ( I love ancient Indian history , thought my slow life will fit into it but after my shitty experience at college idk if I wanna be one) 

3. Police services or such department ( CBI , NIA) etc : I love investigations and being able to help victims of rape or anything . I wanted to make police station a safe place for them unlike I felt so uncomfortable being there when I was pressured to report my ex for giving death threats in broke up claiming it's his other personality. 

Conclusion : My self love esteem is bad , I always wanted to travel and explore the world and I'm ambitious . 

1. Suggest a career that aligns with my qualifications , intrest and good income.
2. If I get to do further study in distance learning that's great cause I need to work amidst financial problems . 
3. Insights on the career path I mentioned above . 


Strengths :
1. Communication skills , 
2. Good in academics and sports ( as of now might get 70-75% in B.A and physical health is not good either ) 
3. Can learn tech.
4. Photography
5 . Giving presentations. 

Weakness and Challanges : 
1. Financial problems
2. Procastinating and indiscipline 
3. Bad time management 
4. Degree delayed till Feb -march 2026

1ktbb1p,How to prove myself as a nepotism hire?,"Context: Dad works maintenance at a power plant, makes great money, also formerly worked in the control room making the same money but on a different schedule.  The plant is extremely understaffed and needs people to do clerical/office type work there, and the plant manager is creating a new job  with two openings that pays pretty good for being entry level.  He specifically is creating these two positions to be worked by me and his son, and we are being told that if we do well and learn how the plant works we can bid a job in the control room or as maintenance.

The question:

This is no doubt nepotism, and I can’t help but feel guilty even though we’re not getting this job over “more qualified applicants”, because we are the only applicants.  My dad says me and the managers son are gonna get a lot of shit for getting a great job out of high school through family connections, and I can’t say I don’t blame them for giving it to us.

Some facts:

- I like the company 

- most people on my team are wonderful 

- I'm a top performer and clients love me

- I'm already at a senior level, doing what I like and not looking to move up

- I love the work I do

- it's a small industry and I don't want to burn my bridges

1ktapxo,Should I Go Back to College for My Master's?,"

I'm 20 years old with a BA in education, but I’ve realized the field isn’t for me. Now, I’m considering returning to college for a master’s degree in finance or business, specifically in data analytics or business administration.

My main priority is securing a decently-paying job in a field I find at least somewhat enjoyable. The key things I’m looking for in a career are:  
1. Good salary  
2. Reasonable work-life balance (even if 9-5 or four 12-hour days with three off)  
3. Availability across many small to medium cities, not just major metro areas  
4. High level of autonomy and/or mostly independent work (even if it independently working within a team or with clients)

A master’s degree would cost me about $8,000 to $12,000, and I expect to have $25,000 saved/invested by the end of summer. My monthly expenses are fairly low $300-$500 since I currently live in rural West Virginia. By the end of summer after I finish an internship loosely related to education, human resources, and business, I plan to keep looking into my current career paths or jobs that pay decently that could build experience to a career path, and if I cant find anything I'll consider the master's.

Would love any advice on whether this path makes sense or if there are alternative options I should consider.

1ktan5n,(Software engineering) Best tech companies to work for in 2025 that are challenging and interesting engineering-wise but not overly toxic or 60 hour a week-grindy.,"I'm just about to get started in my career at a decent company for a software engineering internship, but just wondering if I can use that for leverage to go to other respected companies. Doesn't have to be FAANG-level, but as long as salary is at least like $90k-100k for new grad I'd be happy. I should also mention I live in the Midwest in the US so either remote or an office in the Midwest would work fine.

Main things I'm prioritizing would be things like actually interesting work at a company that cares about engineering, and also not a toxic culture. I wanna work hard at the job but I don't want it to be some toxic culture where your colleagues don't want to help each other, etc; I'd rather have it value hard work but also others help each other with knowledge and stuff. Like I said before, I wanna work hard at the job and be working on cool and challenging engineering problems, but I also don't want to be working so much that it's like 60 hours a week, if that makes sense. Also don't want to work for a dying company, I'd like to stay for a long time.

What companies are there that could fit the bill? A lot of the other questions I see on this topic are from previous years so they might not be up-to-date. As many as come to mind would be great, some ones I was looking at were like Uber, Cloudflare, Dropbox, and GitHub so also if anyone has any knowledge on if those fit that'd be great too :)

1kt8igv,Need advice as I navigate two interview processes,"I am currently interviewing for two roles at two different companies. 

One is a role for which I have completed a final interview for and am waiting for a potential offer. This role would be up to a 50%+ increase in salary from what I make now ($52k to $80k). This position is squarely in my current industry and would be along the traditional career path. The major downside is that it would require a 1.5 hour commute each way. They mentioned that remote days are possible at certain times, but it doesn’t sound like it is a regularly scheduled thing. I don’t know if I can handle that commute five days a week— does anyone else do that? I’m also wondering if it is even worth negotiating to maybe have one or two solid remote days per week. The main reason I’m considering this role is the fact that it is such an increase in salary. It also seems like a great job. At this time, it is not feasible to move closer to the company. 

The other job I’m interviewing for is only 10 minutes away. I’m earlier on in the interview process so I don’t have a clear idea of where I stand in it yet. This job is something different than what I currently do, but there are several transferable skills and it seems quite interesting. It’s something new and not in my current career path but might be something that could lead to an alternative career. This position would result in at least a 25% pay increase from my current job ($52k to $65k+). This is all in the office but that doesn’t bother me given it is such a short commute. 

Currently, my $52k job is 2-3 days remote per week. One day a week, my commute is 1.25 hours each way. It hasn’t been terrible— it has been manageable. While the work environment is generally good, I don’t see much room for advancement anytime soon and there isn’t room for many significant raises. 

 Just wondering mainly if it is even worth considering the first job or not. It seems really interesting and the pay could be great — just don’t know if the commute is crazy or manageable.

1kt78ne,Should I accept a mediocre offer after losing my dream job?,"Company A – My Current Situation:  
I'm a Data Analyst contractor working for a Fortune 500 company in a very rural area. I've been here for 1.5 years, the contract renews yearly (ends this December), and I'm paid $75K.  
But I'm deeply unhappy. I have no social life. I live in complete isolation. I'm in a long-distance relationship. My seniors are micromanaging It’s not sustainable mentally or emotionally.

Company B – The One That Got Away:  
After 4 intense interview rounds, I landed a Senior Data Engineer role at a data-focused company in a metro city, just 30 minutes from where my boyfriend lives. The comp was $160K.  
It felt like a dream opportunity.  
But the offer was revoked last minute because they couldn't do an H-1B transfer.

Company C – The Offer I Have Now:  
While all this was happening, I was also interviewing with another company. It’s a manufacturing company, not very data-heavy, and located in a semi-rural area (I’d have to fly to visit my boyfriend).  
They offered a normal DE role, $100K salary, and they will sponsor my H-1B, which is a huge relief.  
But the work feels very basic, and I don’t see much growth or learning here.

I’m really torn right now and don’t know what to do. I worked so hard to get a dream job that felt perfect for my career and personal life, but it got taken away because they couldn’t transfer my H-1B. Now I have another offer that’s stable and offers sponsorship, but the work is basic and doesn’t excite me and it is in-person and I am not a fan of the place at all. My current contract ends in 7 months, and the job market especially for H-1B holders is really tough. I’m stuck between taking a safe but boring job or taking a risk and hoping something better comes along. I’m scared of making the wrong choice. What would you do? Take the offer or wait and hope?

1kt4sox,Career pivot dilemma: IT/cybersecurity vs. mechanical engineering—should I separate my LinkedIn or omit it?,"Hello everyone, I could use some advice.

I’ve spent the past few years trying to break into cybersecurity/IT (I even earned my Security+), and I’m still actively looking for roles in that field. But right now my finances are in rough shape, and returning to a mechanical engineering role feels like the smartest financial move—and possibly the best opportunity I can land.

A bit about my background:

* **Degree:** Mechanical Engineering
* **Experience:** 4 years in the oil & gas industry
* **Entrepreneurship:** Left engineering for 8 years to run an e-commerce/marketing business. It did well up until recently, lately it’s been tough and I’ve realized that owning a business isn’t the right fit for me—at least not right now.

I built my LinkedIn around IT/help desk/cybersecurity, since I wanted to get into that field. But I’m branching out my job search to also applying directly on company sites for mechanical engineering roles. My questions are:

1. **Should I create a brand-new LinkedIn profile** focused solely on mechanical engineering?
2. **Or is it better to leave my existing IT-centric profile as is** and simply omit the link from my ME applications?

Has anyone navigated a similar switch? What did you do with LinkedIn, and how did it work out? Thanks in advance!",ChiefRunningCar,1,1.0,0,1747955429,2025-05-22 23:10:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kt4sox/career_pivot_dilemma_itcybersecurity_vs/,5,2025
1kt4heb,Sad after accepting a new job,"Throw away as co-workers know my main. 

I am a female in a very male dominated line of work. I would say 5-10% of the workforce in the department is female. Out of 250ish employees.
I have been in my department for 12 years, and completed effectively a degree level 8 years ago. My job role changed about 5 years ago and I took on more responsibility. For the past 3 years I have been given more responsibility and decision making ability without any job grade increase, recognition or salary increase (apart from inflation)

7 months ago my line manager spoke with the second in comman of the department, who said that my grade needed sorting. I assumed my line manager would have regular conversations with the second in command and would be sorting it, as I was still taking on more week by week. This was not the case.

8 weeks ago I raised this with my line manager, conversations started and I was told my department manager would not agree to anything because of the lack of interactions we have. Our departments combined over 6 years ago and they are 4 seats away from me, and has not put any effort in to get to know their section of the department. 

This left me feeling like there was no progression in the role. I am passionate about my role, and I'm good at it. I applied for a role in a different department and did not expect to get it. They have offered me a FTC of minimum of 3 months. 

I am crushed that it has come to this and no one, other than my direct line manager wants to entertain a job level increase. I wasn't even asking for money, just the recognition.

I have accepted the FTC from a different department. They are offering me the same job role/pay, with no experience in the field of work. I will have less than half the responsibilities that I have now. It's a no brainer right? 

I am so down, sad, about this decision, which I feel I had no choice but to take. Getting a new job should be a happy, but nervous time, but I find myself getting emotional whenever I have to explain to someone I won't be with the department in a months time.

I am at a loss. Have I made the right decision? Everyone I've spoken to says it is, but they're disappointed that we won't be working together any longer. I feel heartbroken.

1kt3y5m,How I 3x My Output by Matching AI Tools to My Natural Work Style,"I used to think productivity was about forcing myself to work harder. Turns out, I was just working against my natural design.

After studying different work styles and experimenting with AI automation, I discovered something game changing: the key isn't working more efficiently, it's working in alignment with how you're actually designed to operate.

Here's what I found for different work styles:

If you're naturally a big picture initiator, use AI to handle execution and follow through. Automate communication of your ideas to teams. Let AI manage project details so you can focus on the next big vision.

If you're energized by meaningful work, AI eliminates the repetitive tasks that drain your energy. It automates busywork so you can spend time on what actually lights you up and helps identify patterns in what energizes versus exhausts you.

If you're a natural guide or advisor, AI handles routine tasks that typically overwhelm you. This was my breakthrough. It frees up mental energy for strategic thinking and mentoring others while automating admin so you can focus on seeing the big picture.

If you're designed to reflect and synthesize, AI provides data to support your natural wisdom. It handles routine decisions so you can focus on deeper insights and processes information overload so you can see patterns others miss.

The result? I went from working 60+ hour weeks feeling drained to working 35 hours with triple the meaningful output.

What's your natural work style? Have you tried matching your AI tools to how you actually operate best?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",Current_Rich_6204,1,1.0,3,1747953042,2025-05-22 22:30:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kt3y5m/how_i_3x_my_output_by_matching_ai_tools_to_my/,5,2025

1kt26hf,"I was a 21-year-old at a $30M startup, got played for ""experience""","Just wanted to share this story

At 21, fresh off some decent success with my own **dropshipping business** (pulling in around $6k/month through **paid TikTok ads and content creation**), I was introduced to the founder of a promising startup in the **beverage industry**. He was 34, seemed like a seasoned entrepreneur, and the connection through my brother instantly built a layer of trust. After showing him my e-commerce work and transparently viewing his business dashboards, I was offered what he called a ""trial"" position at $1000/month. I explicitly asked if my compensation would eventually match my previous earnings, and he unequivocally said ""yes,"" with promises of equity down the line. I even told my friends and family about this incredible opportunity, believing it was a solid, trustworthy start.

I plunged in. For six months, I was effectively their entire **marketing department**. I conceptualized, edited, and managed video content, ran social media, and designed countless ads. Crucially, I was never given a formal title – a red flag I now understand made it harder to formalize my contributions. Despite this, I delivered real results: consistent **follower growth, significant website traffic increases, and a tangible boost in revenue** from my campaigns. I later learned that other employees had similar experiences and exits; the pattern was clear.

After that initial trial, he finally gave me a ""small bump"" to $3000, promising a ""real salary with equity"" in another six months. He even laid out scenarios: ""less equity for more salary, or vice versa,"" further cementing the equity promise in my mind.

Then came the breakthrough. I conceived and edited a series of influencer ads that I fought hard to get approved. They launched, and **almost overnight, our MRR surged from $350k to an astonishing $450k!** It was a massive, verifiable success. But as soon as he saw the explosive potential, he'd swoop in, inject his (frankly, unhelpful) input, and even re-edit the final cuts, often making them objectively worse. It felt like a subtle, insidious way to dilute my claim to credit for the wins. Despite this, I kept delivering, consistently adding value to the business.

A year from my start date, the time for the promised raise and equity had arrived. I put together my case, highlighting my quantifiable contributions. His response? My work was ""subpar"" – a claim that utterly blindsided me, as I'd never received any formal performance review. My stomach dropped.

Then came the ultimate betrayal. When I pressed him on the equity, he outright denied ever promising it. I was incandescent. ""You literally told me \[just a month and a half ago, when the company, already valued at a $30 million 

His parting shot truly encapsulated the manipulation: ""What would you do without me? I gave you great experience. You'd have no job without me.""

That moment was a painful awakening. I was terminated shortly after. I was left with a massive gap: how do you quantify and prove real-world impact when you're caught in a toxic environment, lacking a formal title, a reliable reference, or any structured way to showcase your contributions? This ""experience"" was a hollow victory.",BasicAirport2342,2,0.5799999833106995,5,1747948439,2025-05-22 21:13:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kt26hf/i_was_a_21yearold_at_a_30m_startup_got_played_for/,5,2025
1kt24uu,Should I take an internship in a field that doesn’t match my major?,"Hi, I am a Computer Science major. I was planning to graduate this summer without any internships.

I got offered a Sustainability Data Internship across the country in the Los Angeles area. It lasts for 6 months and pays $21/hour. I am very uncertain if I should take the role.

I know the internship is not directly related to Computer Science, my intended field, but I have heard many people say that having any experience is better than nothing, especially in this competitive market. Also, I figure the internship has indirect connections with computer science-related jobs which I could market on my resume: I would be collecting and analyzing lots of (environmental) data and communicating with people in different departments throughout the company.

Right now, I live with my parents and most of my expenses are covered. I have a lot of money saved up. If I were to take the internship, I’d be on my own and am very skeptical that I could survive in the LA area for 6 months on $21/hour without significantly digging into my savings.

1kt22cd,Torn over offers,"Hey Reddit folks.  I know this is a good problem to have but I am torn over which job offer to accept. Here are the details:

Offer 1 (Verbal) > Startup company but product has been in development for years. I’d be in the low 20s in # of employees. I’d be the first person and responsible for starting up a department responsible for the customer journey.  Spoke with multiple Executives and they seem very straight-forward and no-nonsense people.  The tech they are building is impressive and the goals they have for their business align with the goals I want in a company I work for. They are just about ready to “open the doors” to more and bigger sales/prospects. 

Possible Offer 2 > Established company with several hundred employees. Initial product in market not selling as well so company is pivoting to other revenue streams. A manager from a previous company works there and I would report directly to him.  I will be responsible for building out a team but not an entire department.

1kt22c9,"I was a 21-year-old at a $30M startup, got played for ""experience""","At 21, fresh off some decent success with my own **dropshipping business** (pulling in around $6k/month through **paid TikTok ads and content creation**), I was introduced to the founder of a promising startup in the **beverage industry**. He was 34, seemed like a seasoned entrepreneur, and the connection through my brother instantly built a layer of trust. After showing him my e-commerce work and transparently viewing his business dashboards, I was offered what he called a ""trial"" position at $1000/month. I explicitly asked if my compensation would eventually match my previous earnings, and he unequivocally said ""yes,"" with promises of equity down the line. I even told my friends and family about this incredible opportunity, believing it was a solid, trustworthy start.

I plunged in. For six months, I was effectively their entire **marketing department**. I conceptualized, edited, and managed video content, ran social media, and designed countless ads. Crucially, I was never given a formal title – a red flag I now understand made it harder to formalize my contributions. Despite this, I delivered real results: consistent **follower growth, significant website traffic increases, and a tangible boost in revenue** from my campaigns. I later learned that other employees had similar experiences and exits; the pattern was clear.

After that initial trial, he finally gave me a ""small bump"" to $3000, promising a ""real salary with equity"" in another six months. He even laid out scenarios: ""less equity for more salary, or vice versa,"" further cementing the equity promise in my mind.

Then came the breakthrough. I conceived and edited a series of influencer ads that I fought hard to get approved. They launched, and **almost overnight, our MRR surged from $350k to an astonishing $450k!** It was a massive, verifiable success. But as soon as he saw the explosive potential, he'd swoop in, inject his (frankly, unhelpful) input, and even re-edit the final cuts, often making them objectively worse. It felt like a subtle, insidious way to dilute my claim to credit for the wins. Despite this, I kept delivering, consistently adding value to the business.

A year from my start date, the time for the promised raise and equity had arrived. I put together my case, highlighting my quantifiable contributions. His response? My work was ""subpar"" – a claim that utterly blindsided me, as I'd never received any formal performance review. My stomach dropped.

Then came the ultimate betrayal. When I pressed him on the equity, he outright denied ever promising it. I was incandescent. ""You literally told me \[just a month and a half ago, when the company, already valued at $30 million

His parting shot truly encapsulated the manipulation: ""What would you do without me? I gave you great experience. You'd have no job without me.""

That moment was a painful awakening. I was terminated shortly after. I was left with a massive gap: how do you quantify and prove real-world impact when you're caught in a toxic environment, lacking a formal title, a reliable reference, or any structured way to showcase your contributions? This ""experience"" was a hollow victory.

It sparked an idea, one I realized I had already implicitly used to overcome my own struggles. After that disheartening exit, I was left without a clear path to showcase my skills. So, I took matters into my own hands. I decided to learn **SQL and Machine Learning** by taking on complex personal projects. I created my own simulated real-world data analysis tasks, which became the cornerstone of my portfolio. This dramatically improved my job offers, and ultimately, helped me land the role I truly wanted.",BasicAirport2342,0,0.27000001072883606,1,1747948154,2025-05-22 21:09:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kt22c9/i_was_a_21yearold_at_a_30m_startup_got_played_for/,5,2025
1kt1e1y,What to say when asked why I got fired?,"Hey guys,

I have a job interview tomorrow, and I was forced to say on the application portal why I left each job. Two jobs ago I got fired because I booked my birthday off, they wouldn't allow it, I said I was busy and couldn't come in, and a month later they fired me. It's a reasonable explanation, but this is a temporary position that says explicitly: ""no time off allowed"", so I'm afraid that being honest might worry them that I'll do the same thing again.

Should I give an excuse? Say I got laid off unexpectedly? It was a hospitality job, if that matters. Should I tell the truth? What are some other excuses I can say? Additionally, the firing was very amicable and my manager even encouraged me to put him as a reference.

my family is kind of poor so having a financially stable future is important to me

There is this person from a market role, more senior than me by 1-2 ranks, who always tends to talk down to me in a condescending and patronizing and dismissive way.

Second, and this was over email with both my boss and regional management in the loop: I asked a question about whether one of her plans would be effective at targeting a segment of customers.

Not only did she miss the whole point of my question, she automatically assumed I did not understand her plan and proceeded to over-explain the basics to me. And she did it with a hostile and patronizing tone like “did you notice XXX? The whole point of this is XXX …” complete with the dots.

Perhaps I can give the benefit of doubt that my question wasn’t clear. Nevertheless, it was virtually impossible for me to not know her plan because it has been presented specifically to me before.

She also has a tendency to cherry pick and only selectively reply me.

1ksvcms,Pivoting from Consulting to Real Estate — Smart Risk or Setback?,"Hi all — I’d love some perspective.

I’m currently working in consulting/comms in NYC, but I’ve been offered a 4-month opportunity with a small multifamily real estate investment firm in Boston (through a close family connection). I’d be working directly with the founder, supporting deals, learning modeling, and getting hands-on exposure across investment and development.

I’m genuinely excited about the pivot — real estate has always been a long-term interest, and the work feels challenging and meaningful. My fiancée and I are planning to move to Boston long-term to be closer to her family, so the relocation makes sense personally as well. 

My concern is that after this 12-month stint, I’ll be back on the job market in a tough economy with no formal RE degree or traditional analyst training. I’d likely be competing for junior roles at Boston-area firms, despite being 4 years out of undergrad — and this would be my 4th job in 4 years.

I’m willing to grind and learn, and I’ve already started modeling courses. But I want to be smart — is this a smart on-ramp into real estate, or does it risk leaving me stuck between tracks?

What should I do?","Would like to know your perspective on this. So basically, our department got a big project and my name was suggested to manage it. This is the type of projects that could possibly change the trajectory of the team's future which will be working on. It involves a lot of negotiations with important customers, a lot of stress, a lot of traveling back and fourth and even months of staying in a foreign country and obviously no possibility of remote work. The issue is, my mother has cancer (stage 4), and my sister is the primary care giver, so if I leave, everything will fall on her shoulders which is really unjust towards my sister. My mom's medical situation is tragically unpredictable and I don't want to leave her side now when she needs me the most. The project demands a lot of commitment which I don't think I can offer now. I already struggle with my current projects and can not really focus long enough to finish my daily tasks, I always think of my mother and how I would rather leave work to stay with her. So, obviously, I will struggle as well if I take this new project. I also live with my partner who has been my rock through everything and whom I don't wish to leave. In times like these I wish I can be the irresponsible asshole who would say fuck everything and care only about my future, but I don't.

1ksv7m9,Absolute Career Dead End,"I am at a dead end with my career and I honestly have no idea where to go from here. A few things first. I have a bachelors degree in a liberal art that generally would require a masters or doctorate to really get anywhere meaningful or gainful, but it’s my passion so I studied it. For the last 5 years out of college I have worked for the state legislature where I live. It’s a fairly low paying job but I like the benefits and the flexibility I get. However, I cannot stand dealing with the general public anymore. I don’t mind people generally but day in and day out of people bitching about their problems to me is too much. I need to find something that will help me pay the bills better and will not have me interfacing with the general public/customer service etc. The issue that I have now in my job search is experience and the skill set I received from that experience. There are very few skills I can rightfully say I have picked up from this job that would translate into anything outside of customer service. No special skills in moving legislation, or advocacy of legislation, or grant writing or anything. Those are not things that I have the chance to learn in my current position and there is no opportunity for moving up because I’m about as high as I can be. The only things I can really put on my resume are the vague basics that pretty much any Joe schmo can put on (effective communicator, organized etc.). The obvious answer which most people will say is that I should go back to school. I’ve explored that option and I just can’t afford it right now and my stress from my current job on top of school stress would just drive me crazy. I just feel like I’ve pigeonholed myself by taking this job which I thought would be a great stepping stone. Instead it feels like a stone weight around my ankles. If anyone has any advice on how to target my job search or expand my skill set aside from going back to school I would be greatly appreciative because I know I belong somewhere that isn’t having rich white people yelling at me about potholes, to quote Plankton from Spongebob “I went to college!” ",QuindariousGooch95,2,1.0,1,1747931599,2025-05-22 16:33:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ksv7m9/absolute_career_dead_end/,5,2025
1ksuty7,Coping with a job I feel stuck in and trying to find the best way to move forward,"I 27M have been working the same role since 2022 1.5 years after graduating college and I am struggling to get a good footing on setting a clear pathway to getting out of this role without going crazy. I currently work in technical support for a EMR software company. During my tenure here we have only been downsizing and I feel like my business unit's management hasn't been doing a good job to accommodate it's employees for this in terms of career growth. When I started out I was hybrid but after only three months in the role they let everyone go 100% remote. In addition to this there was a lot more hands-on learning and more people within got promoted. Since going remote I feel like a corporate slave working a call center with little or no growth. I have expressed my concerns to my manager but I feel like he either writes me off as not caring after our conversations and does not make promises. Either that or he just directs me to company resources with little direction. 

I really want to quit this job and focus on other things but I unfortunately cannot quit because my father recently lost his job due to failing a physical examination for his CDL. I do have the funds to support myself but my parents are now struggling financially as of recently. I also know how brutal the job market is. I feel burnt out and unhappy in my position. I have applied for and have been accepted to graduate school but I would have to do it part-time and maintain employment. 

I feel like every time I try and commit to change I fail having to start over. How do I break this cycle and move forward?

1ksuta8,"BCom grad, ex-RM confused about tech switch & courses","Hi everyone,

I’ve completed my BCom and have been working as a Relationship Manager at a  firm for the past 2 years. While the job gave me good exposure to the finance world, I’ve been seriously considering a career switch to the tech field.

The problem is, I’m not from a technical background and I’m feeling overwhelmed with the number of options out there. I keep coming across courses and bootcamps that cost ₹50,000–₹60,000, and I’m not sure if they’re really worth the investment.

I’m open to learning and ready to put in the effort, but I want to make sure I take the right steps. So I’m looking for guidance from those who’ve been through a similar transition:
	•	What’s the best way to break into the tech industry coming from a non-tech background?
	•	Are these expensive courses worth it, or are there better low-cost/free options?
	•	Should I start by learning a specific skill or explore a broader path first?
	•	Any specific platforms, resources, or tips you’d recommend?

Would really appreciate any advice or insight from this community. Thanks in advance!",Calm-Photo-2167,2,1.0,1,1747930646,2025-05-22 16:17:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ksuta8/bcom_grad_exrm_confused_about_tech_switch_courses/,5,2025
1ksus79,"If You Feel Stuck or Unsure What Comes Next, You’re Not Alone. AMA","I’m posting this for anyone who feels stuck, uncertain about what they want to do with their life, or is just quietly frustrated, like you’re going through the motions without any real sense of direction.

You might be working at a job that doesn’t excite you. Maybe it pays the bills, but it’s not something you care about. Or maybe you’re in a place where you’re thinking, *“I don’t even know what I want... I just know it isn’t this.”*

If that’s where you are, you’re not alone. And there’s nothing wrong with you.

The truth is, a lot of people never really learn how to figure out what they want from their lives – let alone how to build something around it. We’re trained to follow a script: go to school, get a job, keep your head down. But what happens when you look up one day and realize that script doesn’t lead anywhere you actually want to go?

That’s where I might be able to help.

I come at this from two sides. First, I’m a Psychologist and long-time mentor. I’ve spent decades helping people figure out what matters to them, what kind of life they want to live, and how to move from being stuck to building something they’re proud of. I’ve taught in MBA programs, worked with aspiring founders, career changers, and people who just wanted something *more* – even if they weren’t sure what that looked like.

At the same time, I’ve also spent years in business. I served as Chief Data Officer for Time Inc., Chief Data Scientist for Samsung, co-founded multiple startups, and now work as a Venture Capitalist. So I understand what it takes to build something real—whether it’s a career, a company, or a whole new chapter of your life.

I recently created a program that brings those two perspectives together. It’s designed to help people build what I call *Positive Impact Ventures –* businesses that solve real problems, do some good in the world, and also provide a strong financial foundation for the people building them.

But I didn’t come here to pitch you anything. I came here to offer help.

If you’re feeling stuck or uncertain – if you’re trying to figure out what’s next, or even just wrestling with the question of *What do I really want? –* I’m happy to share what I’ve learned. Whether or not you ever take my course, I’ll do my best to offer something useful.

So, if you have questions about starting over, launching something new, finding direction, or just getting unstuck, I’m here to help. Ask me anything.",Economy-Ebb5976,2,1.0,1,1747930576,2025-05-22 16:16:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ksus79/if_you_feel_stuck_or_unsure_what_comes_next_youre/,5,2025
1kstzvp,Should I take this job? Longer commute for something that would be a great stepping stone,"I'm 24F currently working in environmental consulting making $68k base working 40 hrs a week. Hybrid schedule, 3 days per week, 30-45 min commute by public transport to work.

My dream job would be in renewables, process engineering.

I got an offer for $90k base for a production/process engineer position in biogas operations. The only thing is it's a 45-60 mins drive away each way or 1.5-2 hrs commute each way. It's also in a small town away from the city.

 I love where I live in the city, I love my apartment and roommate and being close to friends. My lease ends in November so moving isn't an option for the next 6 months.

Should I take it? What factors should I consider? How was your experience with a long commute?

1ksrtx2,To continue or not,"Hello,

I have studied mechanical design engineering and am currently employed as a PLC programmer. My big passion is music and I wanted to study conservatory (which requires some time off during the week), which led to many companies refusing to hire me, thus I landed on this position. After a year and half I am a bit torn between continuing as a programmer or trying to get back to engineering. 

My main points are - I would like to do both, I enjoy doing the logic of operations and seeing the machines actually do something and I certainly like designing, however I am really lost sometimes. I really feel the missing IT knowledge and also the absolutely unexpected and wild working hours are both blessing and curse, but mostly the latter (and I still wasn't on commissioning somewhere far away). However I enjoy the higher pay. 

I would like to ask people from automation workfield, if anyone had a choice between those professions, whats your take on this? I feel like I would do this position only in current company, which doesn't do long business trips (we do a lot of commissioning in our manufacturing hall) but I don't want to rely on this and also I don't want to specialize too much in PLC while my career is still starting..",rehorkova,2,1.0,1,1747923386,2025-05-22 14:16:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ksrtx2/to_continue_or_not/,5,2025

1ksocxd,"Feeling stuck and burnt out, should I leave after 9 months if a new opportunity comes?","Hi everyone,

I’m hoping to get some outside perspective because I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed lately.

I joined my current role about 9 months ago at a well-known tech company in the UAE. On paper, it seemed like a great move, but the reality has been far from ideal. Since I joined, the company has gone through an IPO, multiple rounds of layoffs, and a noticeable shift in culture that feels increasingly toxic.

My manager has been difficult to work with micromanaging, not supportive, and at times making me feel like I’m constantly one misstep away from being fired. I’ve tried to stay focused and do my best, but I’m often anxious, mentally drained, and can’t seem to perform at the level I know I’m capable of.

Now I’m in final stages of interviews with another company in the same industry, for a manager-level role that would offer a healthier environment (I hope) and a strong salary increase. But I can’t stop overthinking the fact that I’ve only been in my current job for 9 months.

Would leaving now hurt my CV or reputation long-term? Or is it fair to leave when the role just isn’t aligned with my growth or well-being?

For context:

My current title is senior specialist
The new role would be a step up (manager)
I’ve genuinely tried to make things work but feel like I’ve hit a wall
Would really appreciate any thoughts or advice. Thank you.",Only-Manufacturer951,1,1.0,1,1747913445,2025-05-22 11:30:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ksocxd/feeling_stuck_and_burnt_out_should_i_leave_after/,5,2025

1ksnnih,New job at end of FMLA??,"How do I go about resigning while on FMLA?

I injured my hip in March and have been out of work. The first 4 weeks I had a great deal of difficulty walking and my job a lot of physical manual labor in a greenhouse.

I've been working with the VA to file FMLA and STD paperwork. They have been extremely slow and uncooperative, but I finally got the paperwork submitted 2 weeks ago.

I've had no income since March and my funds are dried up. I've sold personal items that people were willing to buy. The STD requested additional information that I'm still waiting for the VA to complete.

My biggest issue is that I'm out of money for gas, food, and my next cycle of bills. The job is 40 miles away & I drive a gas hog.

There is also that things weren't going well at my job and I have no reasonable expectation that my satisfaction will improve.

1ksl3ct,"When things come easy, sometimes they cost you later…","I’ve been reflecting on something lately. When I joined my second company, everything felt almost too easy. I applied, got a call almost instantly, the interview was a breeze, and I was selected right away. At the time, I was thrilled. It felt like things were finally falling into place.

But now, looking back, I can see how that “ease” came with a hidden cost.

From day one, the signs were there. They assigned me to a project without informing me, and because I didn’t report (obviously—I wasn’t even aware!), they deducted almost a month’s salary. Then they claimed to offer a hybrid work model but forced us to come into the office five days a week, with zero flexibility—even during menstruation, when work-from-home could’ve made things more manageable.

After months of hard work, I got rated with a lower band during evaluations. The reason? “Your work was not highlighted.”
Translation: They didn’t notice or care to acknowledge the effort I was putting in.

This has been the most toxic environment I’ve ever experienced. And it taught me something valuable: companies that don’t invest in the hiring process often don’t invest in their people either.

But I’m not letting this define me. I’m studying hard, sharpening my skills, and growing stronger every day. I will never let myself be treated like this again. I’ll build a future where I choose the work culture, not the other way around.

To anyone else stuck in a toxic place: it’s not your fault. But it is your power to rise.

If you have been job hunting recently (via recommendations/ cold email/ cold message/ careers page/applying via google form etc etc etc), or have ever done that, you might have probably seen this line in one form or another.Lately, I’ve been going through multiple rounds of interviews — from telephonic calls to back-to-back Zoom and Google Meet sessions of 45 min to 1 hour, submitting Pre work/ assignments etc. And after all that effort, I often receive this message: “Thank you for your interest. We were impressed by your qualifications and professional accomplishments. However, we will not be moving forward with your application.”And honestly, it’s confusing. If you were truly impressed, why not proceed? What was missing? 🤣 I understand that it’s not feasible for HR teams to give detailed feedback to every candidate. But leaving someone with a vague “you’re great, but not for us” doesn’t help either. It creates a frustrating cycle of second-guessing and uncertainty.It’s disheartening, not just the rejection (we as humans can tolerate endless number of rejections, so rejection is never the issue) , but the lack of clarity. If a profile doesn’t fit, that’s okay. But let’s stop sugarcoating. A little honesty can go a long way.

“We were impressed, but unfortunately.…” sound familiar? If you have been job hunting recently (via recommendations/ cold email/ cold message/ careers page/applying via google form etc etc etc), or have ever done that, you might have probably seen this line in one form or another.Lately, I’ve been going through multiple rounds of interviews — from telephonic calls to back-to-back Zoom and Google Meet sessions of 45 min to 1 hour, submitting Pre work/ assignments etc. And after all that effort, I often receive this message: “Thank you for your interest. We were impressed by your qualifications and professional accomplishments. However, we will not be moving forward with your application.”And honestly, it’s confusing. If you were truly impressed, why not proceed? What was missing? 🤣 I understand that it’s not feasible for HR teams to give detailed feedback to every candidate. But leaving someone with a vague “you’re great, but not for us” doesn’t help either. It creates a frustrating cycle of second-guessing and uncertainty.It’s disheartening, not just the rejection (we as humans can tolerate endless number of rejections, so rejection is never the issue) , but the lack of clarity. If a profile doesn’t fit, that’s okay. But let’s stop sugarcoating. A little honesty can go a long way.

I’ve received two internship offers: one for a Sales & Marketing position at a Big Tech company, and another for a Product Marketing role at a major European bank. I previously completed an internship in the asset management industry, and now I’m trying to decide between these two new opportunities.

I’m very tempted by the Big Tech brand name on my CV. However, I’m not particularly interested in pursuing a career in pure marketing. My long-term goal is to transition into strategy or consulting within the finance sector.

1ksjjvg,New boss problems…,"I’m no discouraged and all over the place in my head and need advice….. I currently am a director of a department where I work and recently we got a new executive director and I believe I have a target on my back.

So this new executive director starts and at first all is very well but very soon things went south. She have been hammering my department like crazy with extra work making it impossible to do my normal job.  I am a pretty laid back, calm and collected individual and have never raised my voice at work towards anyone. Well recently we had a situation arise where my word was not being trusted and this new boss went above me to talk to my contractors and demanded things that were impossible. I got angry and we lashed out at one another. I told her I have everything under control and told her how things were going to go no matter what she says or who she called, she had no concept of the situation or how to resolve it. So she basically insulted my department saying since she’s met me (2 weeks ago)  I’m dropping the ball left and right. I have only ever been praised by the regional and corporate, even the VP for my work I have done since starting and been told how amazing the building was since before I came. I have been told it’s night and day difference. 
So long story short everything went exactly as I said. The next day I went and talked to her to clear the air. She apologized and said she underestimated my knowledge and said she felt we needed that to understand each other better. We had a pretty good conversation and I thought all was well.

Acouple weeks go by and things are worse than they ever been and it’s impossible to meet all theses deadlines… my assistant got fed up and put his notice in, my boss didn’t even bat an eye to resolve the situation. Almost was happy my assistant was leaving and put his job up for grabs within hours. Well my assistants wife worked as an executive director next door to where my new executive director came from and they were close if not possibly friends. My assistants wife called and said it was good he put his notice in because she caught wind from the employees there  that she had plans to running my and my assistant out so she can bring her people from her old building into mine and replace me…. I wasn’t sure if I could believe that or not but lo and behold the next day this guy from her old building applied for my assistances position. 

Now I’m certain that this plot is true and happening. I have no idea what to do. I work hard but she’s making it impossible and I believe it’s to force me out. I’m scared to call my higher ups and tell them of this ploy over fear that nothing may happen and I’ll be stuck working with her in an uncomfortable situation.  I’ll forever feel like I have a target on my back. It’s extremely stressful. I don’t want to give up but a part of me wants to just throw in the towel and walk.

1ksjiol,Customer meeting with my leadership turned into a complete bitch fest with no internal support,"Me and my local operations team were criticized for over an hour in a customer meeting of 30 people. Half were my customer and half were from my company, including senior leadership. The tone of the meeting became personal and unproductive, and no one from our leadership team stepped in to redirect or support me. There were national sales associates there as well who are just as familiar with these issues but didn’t provide needed context of how complex these issues are. 

Much of the criticism came from one single customer location, despite that I currently support nine separate customer locations in my city. The feedback presented did not accurately reflect the my 7 years involvement or my efforts to engage this customer over time.

For months, I attempted to build consistent communication with this location, but the previous manager was unresponsive and even advised the new manager not to attend meetings. Regular meetings only began in February with him being new to the role. Despite these challenges, I’ve continued to push for progress and support the customer relationship. A lot of the issues are billing related and are in different departments than what I can control. My many emails and follow ups to these departments to fix the customer issues have gone completely ignored.

After the meeting, the locations manager called to personally apologize, acknowledging the unfairness of how the discussion went south and that it was not his intention for the blame to fall on me.

I didn’t get defensive and instead took my lumps on the chin, but I’m very very upset by the lack of support from my upper management team and their willingness to allow me to get thrown under the bus like that. Should I email them tomorrow and ask for a meeting to try and explain my side? Or just move on? Im worried this is my new normal as the VPs are all new in their roles.

1ksiuta,Job hopping.,"Hey everyone,

When we say job hopping from one company to another, does that mean getting the same job and job title at a different company to increase your overall pay? Or does it mean once you gain some experience you can job hop to a different title which you never had before and still make more money?


For example: I am a R&D Engineer, do i get another R&D Engineer job or i can change careers for example into a Quality engineer? Could changing careers still start you at a starting salary? Or is it based on the skillsets developed by the job?m

I know it might be a straight forward answer but I wish to know because I am getting confused.

I’m currently undecided about whether I should specialize more in the technical field or lean towards management in my Master’s studies. That’s why I’d love to hear from people with relevant experience, especially in the following situations:

- To those who started in a technical role and later transitioned into management:
Do you regret your decision? 

- And to those who moved into management but eventually returned to a more technical role:
What motivated you to make that switch? Do you regret it, or are you happy with your decision?

1kshtdc,Im finding it difficult to collaborate at my internship,"So in our internship, we are 5. And theres another person ive been assigned to work with. We have an upcoming project to create stickers for a conference. We were set to collaborate for this project, and i mesaged and told her we could book a room to do some collaboration and brainstorming together. she agreed to this, and I asked her what time works for her, and we also agreed on a time. 

She sent me a file which she said we could use to collaborate and place our ideas, and tonight i opened the file, and its so full. she already added up to 30 differnt ideas and designs and even did the research as well. I thought this was very nice, but felt some type of way because i thought we were going to do the brainstorming together. She always takes initiative by creating ways for us interns to organize our work. if we are given a project for example, she would email us all and send maybe a figjam or figma board for us to place all our ideas. Which is always really helpful. But there never really is a point where she asks us to come together to decide how we might want to present, if everyone is onboard, etc. 

I think the other interns are feeling overwhelmed by it, although i appreciate it. 

with this project now, im unsure how we would collaborate and brainstorm as it seems shes already done most of the work. Theres about 21 sketches, shes done the research, wrote out the task, and placed the visual and colour guides. I find this helpful to kick off the meeting, but I honestly feel some type of way and im unsure why.

1kshhgq,Quit my job partially because of a frequent peer review process,"I recently resigned from a position with a large well known company in the industry I'm in to go work for a much smaller company. Most would see it as a downgrade, but I got a 10% pay increase which would have took me 3 to 4 years to make in merit increases, I got one extra work from home day and overall I feel this new place could be a much more low stress environment. 

  
One driver for me hating my job is we have a constant peer review process where we present a ton of slides to management and let management grill us for 2 hours over every minor detail. Questions are asked that aren't' directly related to our role and we are made to feel inadequate about our job after it's done. This takes place several times over the course of a 2 year project. We are also often on more than just 1 project at the same time. I would be ok with sending some documents and getting some mark ups but spending countless hours pulling slides together and rehearsing how to present this info, then have all these objections live in front of an audience is just something I hate (Audience = usually several reviewers and then a few attendees just there to observer.  This constant big brother looking over your shoulder made me tired after 4 years. I started to dread Sundays and even worse was coming back from Christmas holidays. I worked 10 years at another large company before this one and never got that sense of dread to come back to work. I felt like that was a sign that I needed a change. 

  
I feel like I made the right decision but I still have my doubts about leaving an established company with such a strong background in the industry for a smaller relatively new company, but it always goes back to how I hate having to present all this information to my senior management in my department. I do feel this company really over does it with this process but I also catch myself thinking that maybe I just need to suck it up and it's part of the corporate life.

1ksfxsv,Employee advice," I need some advice on how to address a team member. One that's normally very negative every day. 

Short history. I've been at the company for 5 years but the supervisor for 1.5. This is my first job outside of the military and though I've adjusted really well. I do tend to lean into the policy maybe a bit to much. But now that I'm a civilian my heart grew three inches (grinch) lol. 

The person that's in question has been with the company for 20 plus years. And I truly believe they have complained every one of those days. She's in housekeeping and when I mean she complains I mean over every little thing. I'll give some examples.  She's complained because people brought food for lunch. She's complained because a corner of the paper towels fall to the floor when you rip it out of the dispenser. Another time because a single small office trash can was added to a two person office. Last one she hates when people put anything but paper the size of a post it note in the trash.

 And she doesn't only complain to me. She goes after those individuals that make the ""mess"" and tells their boss. I've literally have people telling me they feel reluctant to put anything in the trash because of her. Even got them to take their own trash out. That landed her on a PIP. However months later the issue is rearing it's ugly head again. 

Her performance is not to anyone standards. Her personality affects the culture and atmosphere of the organization. She refuses to use cleaning products that smell good because she says everyone is complaining. But don't assume she cleans. Because that's not happening. 

Over the year she's been out for pto from time to time. When that happens we bring in a contractor. Everyone loves them,  they clean, it smells good, they do everything you would expect. Many people report back to me and their leadership about the performance and how you can see a noticeable difference in the building. 

Anyways last week she was out for medical reasons. Turns out she was in the hospital. The first two days she notified me of this. The other three days nothing. Our police says we have to be notified of absence and after three days of no call no show we assume you quit. But because we knew she was in the hospital. We let it go, just asked for a note. With no note given, no answer of calls or text hr sent a letter. Not to fire but to seek information. And to be honest at this time we didn't know if she was even alive. We'll Monday comes. She's a no show but calls near lunch. Hey I've been out of the hospital but I'm not coming in this week. Um ok. Our police says you need to give me notice of that. 

On one hand it's been so peaceful and because my heart has grown three sizes I understand the situation. But on the other this lady is clearly not following the policies, not communicating to me or hr and now I want to open the book and find verbiage to correct this. 

Should I let it slide given the situation or find that verbiage. ",ZestycloseRaccoon884,1,1.0,0,1747880985,2025-05-22 02:29:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ksfxsv/employee_advice/,5,2025
1ksfrle,Should I leave a new job after just one week for a higher-paying opportunity?,"Hi everyone,

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and would really appreciate some outside perspective.

I recently accepted a full-time position as a technical analyst at a stable company. The pay is decent (about a 20% increase from my last job), the benefits are great, and the company culture seems supportive. I'm just finishing my first week.

However, I just received another offer for a project management role at a different company. The pay is almost double what I used to make, and the responsibilities are more aligned with my past experience and career goals. That said, the offer comes with some risk: it’s a six-month contract through an external agency, with the possibility of renewal but no guarantees.

I don’t have any kids or major debts, and I have the emotional and financial support of my partner. I don’t yet have a full emergency fund, but taking the higher-paying job could help me build one fairly quickly. Still, I feel anxious and guilty about the idea of quitting a job I just started, even if it means better pay and faster career growth.

What would you do in my position? Stick with the safer job, or take the risk for higher pay and potentially better long-term prospects?

They have a super strict no-PTO policy for the first 6 months due to very intensive training, and they require a doctor’s note for sick days. I’m struggling with how to handle the cases and all the intricate steps to take; I feel like everyone else has it figured out while I’m lost. On top of that, they test us on content we learn weekly, and we need over 80% on each test or we get fired. 
Before taking this job I was a sub and enjoyed working with and mentoring students. The pay was about the same (~$35/hour). The main difference in benefits is healthcare (medical/vision)- this new job offers partial employer-paid benefits, while I qualified for cheaper/free healthcare through the government marketplace as a sub due to lower, inconsistent income. I’m debating if I should:
1. Show up, struggle through, and do the bare minimum until they potentially fire me, which would allow me to collect unemployment and job search
2. Quit cold turkey and return to subbing while applying elsewhere 
3. Stick it out for the experience until they let me go, though that would limit my ability and time to interview for better opportunities.

I was with my previous employer for 15+ years but was laid off during Covid. Tbf they gave us plenty of notice and I got a good severance.

Got another job where the culture & people were better, but longer commute (about an hour each way). And after Covid they made us back in office 3 days a week.

1kscx5j,Potential new job,"Hello all! I am in a tricky situation and need advice. I am only able to work until the end of summer due to a school required full time internship starting in the middle of August. I started a part time paid internship at the beginning of this month and am working part time at my other job. I was hoping both of these jobs would provide me a steady amount of hours and income for the three months I can work this summer. I was planning on working 20 hours a week at the internship at $17.50 an hour and 20 hours a week at my job at $15 an hour. 

Unfortunately, the internship is chaotic and my other job is barely giving me the hours I asked for. For example, I asked for 20 hours a week and I’m getting at most 12-15 hours. My schedule week by week is insane, including working sometimes 6 days a week but only working short shifts. On top of all of this I am in a major life shift so I’m trying to keep my sanity during all of this. 

Here is my dilemma. I have been offered a position with guaranteed 40 hours a week at $15 an hour with a simple commute and way less responsibilities. The only problem is that I would have to quit my internship this week which could potentially result in me losing a whole week’s worth of shifts. It would also mean walking away from a job where I feel comfortable and it is very close to home as well. This job would give me stable income and hours that I definitely need though, and the commute isn’t really that bad. They are also offering me a position when I’m done with school at higher pay. 

So here are my options:

Option A - work two jobs, at $15 and 17.50 an hour, 40 hours a week not guaranteed, also working some weekends and having a lot of responsibilities and an insane schedule during an already busy time in my life 

Option B - work one job at $15 an hour, consistent hours, stepping slightly out of my comfort zone, and having just a bit more of a drive BUT having a guaranteed job when I need to come back

1kscfz1,"Totally lost at sea in my career, and need a reality check.","I work for a financial institution as a subject matter expert in a niche corner of finance that many people find intimidating/very technical & obscure (this matters, I promise).  It's a bit of a pigeonhole, and I've been doing this work for 10+ years in total now. 
The thing is.. I can't tell if I'm absolutely horrible at the subject I've been an ""expert"" in for a decade now, or if my self-perception is just warped by a subtly bad work environment. Maybe both. 

The background: I report to the E suite, but the person who oversees my work is a senior colleague who I don't directly report to. He comes from a high-profile, international institution, and is more than a decade my senior, background exclusively in this niche subject, relatively prestigious education, etc. His experience/background has him set up as the keystonen of our small team, which gives him a lot of power but no accountability bc he's not a manager, though he does attend all my reviews with our boss. He has incredible leverage here, because if he left we genuinely would not have the resources to keep doing what we're doing as well. He's very smart, very capable, and unfortunately also notorious around the company as a rigid, antisocial, judgemental b*****d. He genuinely loves to see people in other departments screw up/not understand our work so he can revel in how stupid and unsophisticated they are compared to the high-flying traders he used to be surrounded by (why has he deigned to work for this comparatively humble employer..?  great question).   Simply put, he's a hypercritical bully, and in my estimation, kind of not emotionally/mentally normal in some capacity. In over 5 years working ""under"" him I seriously don't think he has ever said anything encouraging to me, once. I have very good relationships with other departments and have literally had people call me after interacting w/ him to ask wtf his problem is and why he has such a nasty attitude, so this isn't an incompatibility between just us. His negativity is a running joke on our team. 

Now, you might be tempted to think, ok. This guy is probably the issue right? He's mean and makes you feel bad at your job; so what, he makes everyone feel bad. But the trouble is .. I'm worried he might be right. He's unnecessarily cruel, but usually pretty spot on although very exaggerated.
 I did my degree in Econ, was a good student (scholarships, minor publications, etc), no issues understanding pretty complex concepts & generally recognized as not a dum-dum,  but I'm seriously, seriously bad at math. Idk if its because I have some kind of learning disability (I never learned multiplication tables in school, have a hard time with directions/maps, have to count on my fingers for simple stuff.. yes really). I also was taken overseas year 1 of high school and dumped in a public school where I didn't speak the language at all. I was fluent by the 3rd year but .. obviously didnt learn shit in the meantime, essentially entered adulthood with a 7th grade education. I never finished HS or got a GED, just kinda went back to the US as soon as i was 18, enrolled in uni and went from there. Had to take basic algebra 3 times to pass in uni, only sort of started clicking with math when i got to stats (yes, its pathetic, I know). 
Anyway, in my jobk there's a lot of quantitative elements but a fair amount of art/intuition to it as well, so ""wrong"" isn't always an objective measure. He is the final word on when something is  ""wrong"" and he seems able to spin it so that my input/results are always wrong or irrelevant. I admit, I'm naturally weak at quantitative work. My primary education (or lack of) can't have helped, & if money weren't a factor I would probably have pursued a career in museology or art or literature or something - never finance. I do make mistakes, and get absolutely raked over the coals for them. Granted, there's often little room for error. On the whole,  I don't think I'm THAT off base with my output, it's improbable for someone to be SO consistently wrong and stay employed for years, right? It hurts my growth that he henerally keeps anything but the most basic knowledge from me and rejects my requests to be taught anything.. I'm just expected to do it right, and then cut down when it isn't, no comment when it is. There are VERY few open resources for my field, it's usually learned in live time through shadowing/mentoring so I've tried to self-educate but kind of hit a wall. I lowkey hate this industry and feel so stupid and incapable ALL the time, for having to work so hard to be maybe average at best in a field not suited to my strengths, and for getting myself here and spending a whole decade doing it.  

I just need some opinions/perspectives: is it normal to still feel like a fraud 10+ years in, accounting for the fact that the work is genuinely challenging to most people? is it possible for people who clearly suck to never get let go in favor of a better hire? Is my confidence just being unduly sucked into the black hole of criticism and judgement of my colleague, given the otherwise good reviews (and continued employment)? Is it normal or sustainable to just quietly despise the whole industry you're in, but stay in? I feel torn exactly in half between the evidence that I actually am just stupid/at the ceiling of my intellectual capacity, and the evidence that my colleague is a gaslighting bully who is fucking with my self esteem. Both seem equally likely at the moment.. I dont know if there's some way to gauge which/how much of each it might be. I don't know what to do. Stories/tips on mid-career pivots to other fields would be welcome too.

Though this is my plan currently and I do have a long way to go to achieve these goals, I do have a few questions. I have tried to research the benefits of being a certified electrician that is an electrical engineer however, I have noticed there is not a lot of people that have chosen to combine the two. I did come across someone that was thinking of doing the same thing and some experience engineers seemed to agree on the sentiment that someone with hands on experience with troubleshooting, and maintenance provides a more unique view to the designing of systems by way of practicality for maintenance and learning from past problems. I do believe that this combination of skills and knowledge are extremely valuable in today's work force. So, to get to the point of all this.

1ksbqk6,Got a surprise second interview (coffee chat) after a VP interview at a big bank—what should I make of this?,"I recently applied for a position at one of the big banks and, to my surprise, got contacted for an in-person interview pretty quickly. The first interview was at a branch and lasted about an hour with both a recruiter and a VP. The recruiter said I’d hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP said more like 2 weeks realistically—so I figured I’d just wait it out.

But then the next *day*, I got a call inviting me to meet the same VP again, this time for an informal coffee chat. She said the first interview was “only an hour” and she didn’t get to ask everything. We met today at a local coffee shop, and it felt pretty relaxed. She was friendly and asked a lot of personal questions about my background and stuff then at the end when we were parting ways she told me she still has two more people to speak with by the end of this week (it’s Wednesday now). Before we wrapped up, she said I have her email and to feel free to reach out with any questions.

For context: I’ve only been working in banking for about 4 months, and this would be my first job in finance outside of retail banking. I’m a little nervous because I don’t have much experience, so I’m trying to read between the lines.

1ks9rk0,"Stay in “unskilled” job in state agency after maternity leave, or quit for a year to finish school before trying to enter job market?","I work an “unskilled” job (think something like janitorial/guest services/security) within a state agency that’s relatively low-paid, not very respected and doesn’t have a ton of upward mobility within my department. However, I’ve been able to pick up volunteer/ shadowing opportunities with other departments l, extra projects within my own department and network with others in my agency. I’m a part-time public administration student also, so I’m technically “in” the government sector already, even if I’m not in an administrative title.

I’m going on maternity leave in a few months and debating on if I want to return to my current job or go full time with online school (would probably find a flexible part time gig to help with bills). I’d be relying on mainly student loans and retirement savings to supplement my partner’s income, but wouldn’t have to pay for daycare (which would eat up most of my earnings at my current rate).

Pros of Going FT with school and leaving job:
1. no infant daycare 
2. ability to focus more on school and finish a year earlier
3. potentially picking up a part time internship or volunteer work to gain experience for another job
4. not having a work schedule with such varying hours , which may not work with daycare hours anyways if i can’t negotiate a schedule change
5. a break from juggling a FT job on top of something else like I’ve been doing for a decade

Cons of Going FT school / leaving job:
1. more debt
2. less retirement savings between withdrawing and not working
3. loss of health insurance
4. potential loss of opportunities to transfer to other departments
5. loss of networking 
6. having to look for a new job upon graduating and potentially just accepting a role like what i have now

Thoughts? I definitely have time to decide, but want to hear how others feel.

1ks9jvt,Should I ask for a salary adjustment now or wait? Big pay gap with colleagues for the same role,"Hey everyone, I’d appreciate any advice or opinions on my situation.

I’m an engineer with about 3–4 years of experience, currently working in a mid-level position at a tech company in one of Germany’s major cities. The company operates in a trendy deep tech field and is backed by a very large global tech group as well as other big players in the industry.

My role is a mix of technical work and product/people management. I work directly with all the tech leads, make decisions about product development, and have quite a bit of responsibility — arguably more than what would be expected for someone with my years of experience.

When I joined the company late last year, they offered me a salary below my expected range. I tried to negotiate but wasn’t successful. I still accepted because the role seemed like a great opportunity and I made it clear I’d like to revisit the topic after proving myself.

Now, 6 months in, I’ve learned a few things:

* Salaries at this company are generally lower than what you’d expect given the wealthy parent companies.
* I joined with a couple of other people doing *the exact same role* as me in different parts of the company. While our backgrounds vary slightly, our levels of experience and skills are pretty comparable.
* I recently found out they’re earning **15–20% more** than I am — we’re talking about **\~500€ more net per month**, which is a *huge* difference.
* Salary reviews only happen once a year, and I’d have to wait about 9 more months for the next cycle.
* Based on what I’ve seen in the market, similar roles in the same city/industry are offering **40–60% more** in gross salary than I currently make. Not to mention, this company took nearly a year to find the right candidate for this position due to how specific and rare the skillset is.

So… I’m wondering:

1. Should I raise this now and ask for a salary adjustment (either to align with my colleagues or more in line with the market)?
2. Or should I just wait for the regular salary revision cycle?
3. If I do ask now, should I aim only for parity with my colleagues, or push for a bigger correction based on market value and the high demands of the role?

Would really appreciate hearing how others would handle this. Thanks in advance!",xmuhrad,1,1.0,1,1747862567,2025-05-21 21:22:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ks9jvt/should_i_ask_for_a_salary_adjustment_now_or_wait/,5,2025

1ks9dkn,What I learned from applying to 937 jobs in 198 days (and finally getting 2 offers),"After 937 applications, 198 days, 28 interviews, and 3 take-home tests… I finally landed my 1st full-time job!

I’m a recent college grad with a degree in marketing, and I was applying to entry-level roles across different industries.

It was hard—not gonna lie. There were a lot of rejections, ghosting, and weeks of silence.

But I made it through. And if you’re in the thick of it, just know: it’s totally normal to struggle, and it doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.

Here are some lessons I learned along the way—sharing in case it helps anyone else going through this wild post-grad job hunt.

Job Application Tips:

Cover letters

I sent them at first… and then I stopped. After about 50 apps, I realized they weren’t moving the needle for me.I only wrote them if the company specifically asked for one. Otherwise, I focused on applying faster and more often.

Reaching out to hiring managers

This was surprisingly effective. Out of 28 interviews, 9 came from jobs where I messaged someone. I didn’t message every company—just the ones I really liked. Even when it didn’t lead to an interview, I sometimes got helpful info or encouragement.

Resume

At first, I had one general marketing resume I sent to everyone. It barely got me any callbacks.

Once I started tailoring my resume to each specific job, everything changed.

I used free tools like MaxDay AI to help get keywords required for target jobs and tailor my resume fast.Might feel tedious at first, but trust me: customizing your resume is worth it.

Interview Tips:

Practice

I used ChatGPT voice, recorded myself answering questions, and practiced in the mirror. There are a bunch of free AI tools now to simulate interviews—super helpful if you’re just starting out.

Rehearse your story

Learn to tell your story in PAR (Problem, Action, Result) format:

•	Pick 2-3 stories: a win, a mistake, a conflict, a team project, and something you’re proud of.

•	Even if your only experience is internships, class projects, or student orgs—it still counts.

•	Try to include a number: “Increased engagement by 20%,” etc

Study the job description

Highlight the top 3–5 skills and think about what experience you have that matches. Figure out which of your stories plug into which skill.

Ask thoughtful questions

•	Founder or C-level: Ask bigger-picture questions about the company’s vision, growth plans, or competitive edge.

•	Team leader: Ask about day-to-day responsibilities, team workflows, current challenges, and what success looks like in the first 3–6 months.

•	HR: Ask about company culture, onboarding process, benefits, and what kind of people tend to thrive there.

Make an impactful intro

Keep it clear, short (around 30s) and confident. Something like:

“I’m \[Name\], a recent marketing graduate with internship experience in social media and product launches. At \[Internship\], I helped grow our IG engagement by 40% and learned how to collaborate across departments. I’m excited about this role because \[insert why it aligns with your interests or goals\].”

Know your ""why this job"" answer

Be specific. “I love your mission to help small businesses grow” or “This role is exactly where I want to build my career in X.”

Always Be Closing (ABC)

End every answer by tying it back to the role.

“That project taught me how to stay organized under pressure—and I saw this role mentions project coordination, so I’m excited to build on that here.”

Turn their questions into conversations

If they tell you their biggest challenge is, say, brand awareness—tell them how you worked on something similar at your internship or in a class campaign. It doesn’t need to be fancy—just relevant.

End strong

At the end, always thank them, express genuine interest, and say you’re excited about the role.

Other Notes:

Expect the long game

It took me more than 6 months to land something. I didn’t hear anything for 3 weeks. I thought I was failing. I wasn’t.

Reflect after

What went well? What didn’t? It’s not about beating yourself up—it’s about getting 1% better each time.

Focus on growth

I started to look at interviews as a chance to grow—not just win a job. I met cool people, learned new tools, and figured out what I actually want in a company.

If you’re still job hunting, hang in there. Keep learning, keep going. You will get there.

Ask me anything—happy to help.",Alternative_Rock_836,66,0.9800000190734863,1,1747862133,2025-05-21 21:15:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ks9dkn/what_i_learned_from_applying_to_937_jobs_in_198/,5,2025
1ks9bvg,Jumping from Junior to Senior Data Analyst - should I go for it?,"Couple of weeks ago I was asked by a hiring manager from a different department if I was interested in applying to join his team to become a senior data analyst. I'm currently 10 months into my role as a junior data analyst, with a masters in AI. At the time I told him that it's too soon for me to go for it as I'm too inexperienced for the role given the expectations.

Fast forward to this week and I meet the hiring manager again, this time I ask how the search is going, to which he asked if I was planning on sending my CV through. He then encouraged me to do so and said he'd make sure I'd be in the running as a candidate for the position. According to him I tick all the boxes but he needs to convince his director that I'd be the right person for the role. I politely declined again but after having an hour long chat after work, he's convinced me to at least send my CV through.

I have multiple worries about this: drama at work if word goes out, higher expectations, increased workload and stress.

It would be a nice pay bump and certainly great for my career but I'm still hesitant on applying for the reasons mentioned. Should I just go for it and apply - even if word goes out to my manager that I'm looking for other roles internally?",sadnchilled,1,1.0,0,1747862017,2025-05-21 21:13:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ks9bvg/jumping_from_junior_to_senior_data_analyst_should/,5,2025
1ks8y46,Need Advice: Take a 1-Year Contract in India or Stay in a Stable Gulf Role?,"Hi all,

I’m at a crossroads and would really appreciate some outside perspective.

I currently have a fairly stable, well-paying role in the Gulf in the food sector (not industrial manufacturing, but a service-heavy environment). I recently received an offer from a top-tier FMCG company [Mondelēz International] in India for a 1-year contractual role in regulatory affairs with a possibility of extension.

Here’s the dilemma:

Gulf job is steady and aligns well financially, especially since I’ve would be soon initiating a home loan, which takes up around 25% of my salary.

The India role would offer a similar gross salary, but after taxation and higher living costs, I’d only retain about 30–35% of my income monthly. The contract is via a third party with verbal assurance of 1.5 years max.

On the flip side, this role is much more aligned with my long-term goals — working in regulatory, innovation, and R&D functions with global collaboration and exposure I don’t currently have.


I’m struggling between:

Playing it safe and staying in the Gulf where I can save more and repay my loan comfortably.

Taking a calculated risk to move into the kind of work I actually want to do long-term, but with financial compromises and job uncertainty in the short term.


Would love to hear from anyone who’s faced a similar choice — comfort vs. growth, stability vs. alignment.

1ks8se1,Career Advice Needed,"Hello guys. I am new to this reddit but Ive been watching for a while. It seems as though people give genuine advice so Id like to ask for some direction if possible. 


Background:
I am 25 years old and I joined the tech space initially as a consultant and apprentice. I started this job 3 years ago but as an engineer. Building little applications and functionality but that only lasted 1 year. After that I was switched over to doing integrations, then worked as a security analyst til present day where I work as essentially a “Deployment Coordinator.” As of now, I help with this business by transforming there data from one system to another, helping them facilitate code sprints and essentially be an additional hand with building assets for the team. None of this requires code. I enjoy my work because I have found a way to manage people better over my years here but I dont have a challenge and there is a very apparent ceiling in how much I can make at my job. I haven’t been able to get past 55k. Which got me into thinking about what I see myself doing long term. Outside of work I am an artist. Musician and aspiring engineer. I want to build things and use my music however I see fit. I will say I do not have a degree and I got this job through an apprenticeship.  My job now my leads are confused as to why I haven’t been promoted. The company itself has shady practices. 

Ask:

I see myself doing work that isn’t micro manage-y and I want the opportunity to build and test things as I would do at home. My goal is to make my day job congruent as my interests at home. Which leads me to believe that I want to be a product manager. Someone who can build but doesn’t and also facilitates larger initiatives for the company. 

Since I haven’t coded in a while is it more reasonable to go for associate product manager. Or Do you think with my range of experiences I can just shoot for the Product management job?

If I should go for the product manager, where do I actually start. Ive revised my resume and Im getting no traction. I see so much for myself and I genuinely need more money for my day to day. Inflation kicking ass right now.

1ks8s9k,Will my political portfolio ruin my chances of getting a different job?,"I’ve spent the last six years working in political nonprofits and have unfortunately had a few back-to-back bad experiences that are making me want to leave it behind me for good. My work has all been with cause driven organizations working on issues like child, well-being, immigration, climate, elections (including campaigning), and more.

My specific expertise has been in communications, including social media, graphic design, and writing among other things. My portfolio encapsulates these things, but all of it is political content. For example, I have samples of mailer design encouraging people to vote for certain candidates. Another example is a T-shirt design for pride, or a social media post explaining the importance of participating in the census. There are very few, if any, work samples that don’t center progressive politics or a cause.

Will this hinder my chances of finding work in a corporate environment, or otherwise in an environment that isn’t inherently political? I fear that as a candidate I may be interpreted as too divisive or controversial. If so, what do I do short of completely redoing my portfolio with samples that aren’t from previous work?

1ks8oym,Need advice for Recruiter/Coordinator interview - first time in this role !,"Hey everyone! 

I could really use some help preparing for an upcoming job interview.  

I’ve been invited to interview for a **Recruiter/Coordinator** position at an employment agency. This would be my first time in this kind of role—previously, I’ve worked as a salesman, kitchen staff, and currently as a bike repairman/salesman.

My Concerns:

1. **No Bachelor’s Degree** → The job posting listed one as a requirement, but they’ve seen my resume and still invited me.  
2. **Language Skills** → They want fluency in **Polish, Bulgarian, and Dutch** (I’m Croatian, so I know a few words in these but nowhere near fluent). Maybe they’re testing me or are open to training?  
3. **Zero Recruitment Experience** → How do I sell my transferable skills (sales, customer service, problem-solving)?  

What I’d Love Advice On: 

✔ How to prepare– What should I research about recruitment/agency work?  
✔ Common interview questions for this role (especially without direct experience).  
✔ How to handle the language gap – Should I address it upfront? Should I try to search and learn some more words which I can learn or is it going to be irrelevant ? 
✔  What recruiters/coordinators look for in candidates like me ?
✔ Any red flags I should watch for, underpaying etc. (since they know I lack some requirements).  

I really want to make a good impression—even if I’m underqualified, I’m eager to learn.

1ks6pxq,Should I quit or carry on,"I recently left a comfortable job I’d been in for 6 years in a field I have all prior experience in - web and content management. I was happy in the company but I knew I wasn’t learning. I was getting Exceeds in my reviews and bonuses plus yearly pay rises. Ultimately I was bored and I knew deep down I wasn’t excelling in developing should I ever want to move jobs. I’m 35. 

With this at the back of my mind, one opportunity arose I took seriously and applied. It was for an amazing corporate global company, in a subject matter I love, but the role was slightly different to what I’ve always done.

Turns out, it’s completely different. It’s advertising, paid media, creative effectiveness and neuro science for TV commercials. Amazingly interesting but I have no idea what I’m doing. Everything is AI driven and I realised this was going to be tough 1 month in. I’m just entering 6 months. I’ve had very little feedback. In the interview they assured me I’d be on a 6 month development plan but so far I have had no one to learn from. My manager is nice but has been with the company years and doesn’t give me much hands on help. I don’t think she knows much about the day to day. 

I’ve started documenting my tasks in a spreadsheet so she can give me direction on what I’m doing. I’ve also started logging what is working and where I need help.

As I would consider myself someone who cares about what I do and how I show up - I’m massively struggling. The job pays well and I am looking to start a family soon so leaving isn’t a great option. 

How do I keep my head above the water and survive, not thrive, without caring so much? 6 month has been hell with weekly upsets that I am frustrated and miserable. I have just hired a career coach to help navigate this.

It is a shame, I was very excited but not sure how to handle feeling like this. ",Ecstatic_Bat,3,1.0,2,1747855672,2025-05-21 19:27:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ks6pxq/should_i_quit_or_carry_on/,5,2025

1ks6cc6,Which tech field do I pursue?,"Background: graduated with a digital design degree last yr (covered a wide range of fields and disciplines such as VFX, 3D Art/CGI, Web Design, VR(Virtual Reality), Augmented Reality. Got into an internship, working as an e-learning intern, where I got to create graphics for e-learning courses (basically graphic design type of illustrations) and flyers, for 7 months. This is where I learned graphic design, and developed my skills a bit. As I've recently completed the internship.

I've been reflecting about where I wanna go career wise, and came to the conclusion that yes, I liked graphic design and can tolerate it, but ONLY if I'm getting paid. If I'm doing it in my free time to level up my skills, I find it very boring, feel like I'm wasting my time and I'm demotivated (lowkey burned out from it and don't wanna do it as a proper career maybe a short term career) I LOVE web development/web design (did a project in university), and definitely found it to be one of the things that I could do long term, however, everyone has been telling me that it is the worst tech field to pursue due to no job security, super saturated (ik every field is saturated, but they say that its a bad case for this particular field.

  
I've been speaking to relatives, family members, friends, done a bit of research and feel like tech is the right field however I wanna make sure that I take the right decision. My ADHD is slightly on the extreme side; I'm poorly organized, I burnout quite easily, overlook mistakes at times, and have a hard time focusing on things I don't enjoy. If I enjoy it, its a different story.

With that being said, I'm looking for a career that best fits my profile. I have a creative mind but like challenges (not overwhelmingly challenging though). For example, I've taken a game development class during uni where I had to complete a project where I created a unity game, which I've found to overwhelmingly challenge, mainly due to not having the basics down properly (no previous knowledge of unity coding, and had to learn everything in 3 months, but was still lacking). As a result I've burnt out and definitely don't see myself doing game dev.

Here are the options I'm considering:

1) Software Development

2) Software Engineering 

3) Cyber Security

4) Cloud Computing 

5) AI/ML

I would greatly appreciate advice picking one. Whichever one I pick, I wanna dedicate time to fully learning it and create a body of work which I can hopefully use for a career, so I wanna make sure that I make the right decision.

I interviewed for a job three weeks ago. I had two interviews: one video call and then an in-person panel where I met the whole team and got a tour. They told me I’d hear back by “the end of next week,” but it’s now been over three weeks and I haven’t heard anything.

I followed up once and was told a decision is still pending, and that “the wheels of the state move slowly,” since it’s a position contracted through a state agency. But now it’s been another week since even that message, and I’m still waiting.

Is this kind of delay normal for state-affiliated jobs? Or should I assume they’ve probably chosen someone else by now?

1ks58ho,CS Career Guidance / Personal Finance,"Context: 27M I'm a veteran who is going to school using the VR&E program, which allows up to 48 months of benefits. My counselor approved me for a BS in Computer Science and Engineering, and I'm finishing up my first semester. From this first semester of learning coding, I am confident that this type of work is something I will like, or at least be able to tolerate physically and mentally compared to what I did in the military (fighter jet mechanic).

 

Predicament: I will still have my post 9/11 GI Bill available to me after my BS. Now, I'm rated as 100% P&T as per the VA, which allows me a one time student loan TPD discharge. I can opt to delay this (which is legal as per the law) up until my education is finished. Meaning, I can take out the maximum federal loan limit and expect it to be forgiven upon graduation. Should I go straight for a Masters after the BS so that I can continue to cover my living expenses with student loans, or start my career earlier and get more education later on but be unable to utilize student loans? 

  
I know that I am still quite some time from this decision but, with the state of CS and the job market overall, I'm leaning towards buying myself more time by furthering my education and making a living out of it at the same time. But, I know that there is the opportunity cost of gaining experience and potentially getting a well paying job afterward. So, for those that are familiar with this career, what would you do?

  
Please keep this from being overly political or prodding in on my personal situation. I know how fortunate I am to be in this situation (even though the constant pain says otherwise).",AkoyPinoy,1,1.0,0,1747852125,2025-05-21 18:28:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ks58ho/cs_career_guidance_personal_finance/,5,2025

1ks46fx,Study master in UK or work in Spain?,"From 2019 to 2023, I (24M) studied Spanish, Catalan and Japanese at university in the UK. During my year abroad (2021–22), I spent time in both Barcelona and Tokyo. I became very attached to Barcelona—partly due to a relationship and job offers nearby—but ultimately decided to return to the UK for my final year. Tokyo was more difficult; I struggled with homesickness, didn’t enjoy where I was living, and often compared it unfavourably to my time in Spain.

After graduating, I returned abroad to give both countries another chance. I worked as an English language assistant in Madrid (Sept 2023 – July 2024) and then in rural Japan (Aug 2024 – Mar 2025). I loved Madrid—made close friends, felt independent, enjoyed city life, and had a fulfilling role working with children. Life there felt easy and fun compared to my experience in the UK, where I live in a quiet city with not much to do as my friends have moved away and I would live with family.

Japan, however, remained challenging. I lived in a remote industrial town with little to do, had distant colleagues, and often felt isolated. Despite enjoying teaching the children, I found the lack of structure and support frustrating, and the distance from friends in Tokyo made things harder.

I’ve since returned to the UK to explore new career options. My former employer in Spain offered me a position again and is actively helping with my visa process. I’m now preparing documents and working part-time to save money, with the possibility of full-time work later on offered by the company.

The pay is 1000 euros per month and I can work part time online to get more money. This is what I did before. I currently don't have a lot of money, however, saving up before October when I'm expected to start teaching, I will have around 5-6k saved up from part time jobs in the UK during summer.

I am scared that if I let this opportunity to go now, I may not have it in the future.

However, I have doubts about Spain. I enjoy teaching but don’t want to do it forever, and staying in Spain long-term is complicated without EU citizenship. I’m also conscious that others my age are progressing into more advanced roles.

I’m considering a few options:

* Stay in the UK, do a Master’s, and try to build a language-related career here.
* Return to Spain for a year, then pursue a Master’s in Translation in the UK.
* Work in Spain for a year, then study at a Spanish university while continuing part-time work.
* Try to stay in Spain long-term via a work permit or further study.

I’m torn between two paths: returning to a fun, fulfilling lifestyle in Spain with some uncertainty about long-term career prospects, or staying in the UK to build a stable, language-focused career with clearer professional development—but a less enjoyable lifestyle.",dbgnihd,1,1.0,0,1747849605,2025-05-21 17:46:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ks46fx/study_master_in_uk_or_work_in_spain/,5,2025

I wear a lot of hats, as I'm responsible for inventory management/procurement for the department and an off-site storage warehouse, creating marketing materials, and making interoffice deliveries around town twice weekly. 

From a quality control standpoint, my record is nearly spotless, and I take pride in my time/task management and organizational skills and the systems (checklists, time blocking, task triage, etc) that I have used for over a decade as a student and in prior work environments.

The problem I am having is that each of my personal systems have blind spots in them that have eroded the credibility I have with my manager in terms of my decision making. If I block time to focus on completing a time consuming task, I'm procrastinating on the tasks I have yet to begin. If I pause what I am doing to get a start on other tasks to avoid the former, I appear disorganized. 

I have a similar issue with my communication methods. If I take initiative to do something proactively, I am not communicating effectively. But in similar situations when I ask for clarification, I am not demonstrating being able to think for myself.

I worked at an agency for 3 years but ended up seeking new challenges — partly because the marketing department wasn’t a high priority for the company, and management left a lot to be desired. I then landed a fully remote job, where I stayed for 3 months, but quickly realized that working fully remote was having a negative impact on me, so I decided to move on.

After that, I was unemployed for 3 months, but was fortunate enough to find my current position at a large global company working with well-known international brands. I’ve been here for 5 months now.

**New Offer:**  
I’ve recently received an offer from a small agency. The work would essentially be the same, but with a significant salary increase, more freedom, and greater ownership of client relationships. It feels much more aligned with my interests and the kind of work I enjoy.

**Challenge:**  
I’m a bit torn between staying in my current, safe — but somewhat boring position, or making the leap to something a little more ""fragile"", yet potentially much more rewarding.

Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.",Ruzzah91,1,1.0,2,1747843984,2025-05-21 16:13:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ks1tkk/switching_jobs_within_a_short_time_period/,5,2025
1ks1owk,Asking recruiters,"Good evening as I'm new to reddit I don't properly know how it works but I'm asking my biggest question in hopes of answer.. I'm currently studying marketing at a university. I'm good at my studies and often told that I suit what I'm studying and will do really well in future. Now even though I go to the best school of my country it's still a third world country and opportunities are really limited as far as I can understand. I'm open to going outside of my country but it's unlikely any big companies will hire someone like me. My dream is to work for redbull. I was impressed as a kid by their marketing and it was the only thing that I wanted to buy after watching an ad. Now redbull is illegal in my country as most of it's citizens are Muslim and I can't have redbull myself but I still want to work for them. I'll be really grateful if someone tells me if it is possible at all, what are the requirements and how it is done. Other than redbull I'm mostly interested in gaming tech companies. I don't play games but I like watching eSports so I'm extremely interested in gaming companies.

1ks0ph1,"How to professionally ask if I can give advice to a coworker in my department without coming off as ""trying to tell them how to do their job?""","So I have been in marketing for 8 years, and before that I was in sales for 10, with a few years of overlap in between (Small Agency where you could bring in clients to get a bonus). 

I'm used to being hands on where I have to jump in and create campaigns myself (HubSpot, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.). So I have a good amount of knowledge around a variety of marketing areas.

I'm at a new job right now and things are going great. I have my own hands on work I'm doing, but mostly I  am doing the strategy part and having others build things for me.   
  
Often time's I'll ask questions in teams in our marketing group chat and  I'll get an answer from someone on the team. (Who is responsible for X, how long does it take generally to get this type of content back, do we have this type of asset already, etc.). 

On meetings, if I say something like ""currently I'm working on X but I need to figure out how to do Y"" someone will message me or speak directly on the meeting about how to find or do it and it's awesome.

On the last meeting, someone mentioned they were doing targeting of some kind but if they targeted specific titles their list would get too small. In the past, I know that if this happens instead of doing inclusion targeting (target everyone with CEO as a title), I instead do exclusion targeting (exclude titles that wouldn't make sense for this type of campaign).

  
I wanted to message the person and tell them this, but thinking back in the past I know there are some people that might be put off saying ""don't tell me how to do my job"" even though we are in the same department and work on the same kind of campaigns. 

  
However, I want to show that I am open to collaboration and team work. So how can I respectfully ask if I can give feedback? I know even saying ""Hey, I have some experience in this area, would you be open to feedback?"" still kind of puts them on the spot, because saying no can be seen as rude. 

So is there a way to realistically navigate this without coming off rude or putting the person I'm talking to on the spot to where they feel like the HAVE to say yes even if they don't want to?",Live_Profile843,0,0.5,0,1747841317,2025-05-21 15:28:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ks0ph1/how_to_professionally_ask_if_i_can_give_advice_to/,5,2025
1ks0a00,Unsure of what to do… I am miserable. need advice,"Hello, I’m not quite sure if this is the right place to post this, but I could use advice. I am 24, and was working at a place for a very long time, back and forth through college, and then full time after i graduated. That place was not great, and I definitely had Stockholm Syndrome being there. I eventually got the courage to leave there and start a new job- and this place has been okay so far. The people are much nicer, but I have been there over a month now and I still feel like I have not learned much. I try to ask for clarification or ask a question and really don’t get many answers. My direct manager doesn’t work with me all of the time, so i only see him occasionally, so i’m learning from the other employees. I was essentially thrown into the deep end, I was literally working by myself the second week there. I feel very very lost sometimes, and I’m confused on who to ask what- and I also don’t want to appear like an idiot because I don’t know certain things. 

I also just learned that they apparently hired me to work a “Lead” position, which is like being my managers right hand person, so now I’m having to learn all of these extra things too. They mentioned it might eventually happen, but I didn’t think they were literally bringing me into the company to be doing this more advanced job right away. And they are really working me to the bone already. They also have very few people working in my department, and i came with experience, so they schedule me when it’s super busy too. 

Another problem is I have is setting boundaries- I told them I had open availability, but now I’m trying to schedule myself into therapy for my mental health, and I also feel like I need as stable of a schedule as they can give me, Like i know it can’t be perfect, but i’m frustrated when i’m only supposed to work 5 days a week and they schedule me 6, and they also don’t check people’s days off so i always end up work like 8 or 9 days in a row. I’m exhausted already and i’ve only been there a month. I just need advice on how to succeed while also taking care of myself and protecting my peace. Thank you in advance.

1ks05um,Should I leave the family business?,"I am looking for guidance on whether I should leave the family business. I feel like I’m stuck and will never make it past where I am now.

For context: I work for a company started by me and a family member 4.5 years ago. The company is in the construction industry and most of our work comes from a larger company that we contract through for repair and installation work. When I started I was supposed to just help get the company off the ground until more employees could be brought on once more work came in. I was in college at the time and felt that it wasn’t really for me but wanted to stick it out (and probably would have) but as more work came in and we got busier, I ended up working 10 hour days and decided to not further my education.

To get to my point, the problem I’m facing is that I feel like I’m stuck in this everyday cycle of working here. I don’t see any opportunity for growth within the company. I have gotten several raises but I know that I can only go so far in this company. The company is consistent but doesn’t make a ton of money. My family member takes money out from it twice a year but not very much and he works a full time job outside of this small (6 employee) company to keep his family afloat. Also, there’s always tension between the company I work for and the companies we get our work from with no formal contracts so things could turn sideways at any point (and they did earlier this year but they brought us back on). Things are always shaky and uncertain (luckily nothing devastating has happened). My boss wants to keep putting money into this company and I don’t understand why when it makes minimal profits.

I enjoy my job and what I get to do but I’m young (mid twenties) and want to make sure I’m doing the best I can to ensure a good future for myself and my future family. I make more hourly than others in the same industry/position make ($20/hr with $15/hr being average) but like I said, I don’t see much potential for more money and I’d like to make more.

I recently built my own house and thoroughly enjoyed it so I have a little experience in all of the trades. If I were to leave, I’d likely try to find a job in plumbing or electrical because they interest me. I’d be willing to take a pay cut ($18/hr minimum) to learn these trades more and try ti grow within a company or start my own eventually. I don’t have much experience other than construction.

1krzy5c,Back to back setbacks,"I was doing well at work for a long time. I got promoted, had a good rapport with both peers and seniors, and genuinely enjoyed what I did. But after my last promotion, things started to go downhill.

I was assigned a technically challenging task, to investigate why two queries meant to generate the same report were returning different results. Honestly, I didn’t have the technical depth to solve it on my own, and I struggled. While I worked on it, I was also handling my regular responsibilities and building automations that improved team workflows.

Then, somewhat unexpectedly, I was put on a PIP. The reason given was that it had been two months and the task was still pending. Looking back, I can understand why they were frustrated, and I take full ownership of not asking for help sooner or escalating appropriately. At the same time, I wish it had been handled more constructively. I was let go soon after.

A couple weeks later, I took the first role I could get. It started off okay, I was in a supportive team, and the managers were encouraging. But then I got moved to a different team, where the environment was very reactive. Feedback swung wildly from praise to criticism, and fear seemed to be a common management tactic. Our manager openly said they are not save their own job and we need to save ours 

Eventually, our whole team was put on a PIP with a restructure as the negative outcome. I was told I was doing better, but now as the original PIP is ending, they’ve extended it by another 4 weeks with termination as the negative. If I don’t meet expectations, I’ll likely be terminated again.

I’ve always taken pride in being someone who doesn’t give up easily, but I’m honestly feeling lost right now. I’ve made mistakes, I own that but I also feel like I haven’t been set up to succeed. I’m trying to reflect on what I can learn from this, how to bounce back, and what kind of environment I’d thrive in going forward.

I’ve prepared for the worst, but I keep wondering: does it make sense to pull the plug myself before it gets to that point? Would quitting on my own terms be better for my confidence and my resume in the long run? Or am I just running away from a tough situation?

1krz9cu,Feeling extremely lost and hopeless,"I quit my last job, came to Norway to pursue a masters degree. Was a great decision and I do not regret it. 

I really want to stay here, I love it. But I just cannot seem to land a job. I just get flooded with rejection emails, always that there are more candidates better suited for the roles. 

Every so often, when I've applied and forgotten about a role, I randomly get a rejectiom email. I cant even remember applying, but they're kind enough to remind me that I'm not good enough for it.

My CV is fine, in fact, when I do get an interview, or feedback, thats the first think they say. I have 5 years of professional full stack software development experience, worked for a really good reputable company. A have a lot of projects I've worked on, really enjoy coding in my spare time etc. 

I managed to land a job, but they've sent me a draft contract, but have suddenly gone completely silent on me, and have not responded to any of my emails lately.  I am not sure if they've ghosted me, or if these things take time.

I've had some interviews, they all say the same thing ""I'm very good to talk to, obviously have very good skills and strong background and experience, but unfortunately on this occasion, they have decided to go other candidates"". 

I feel completely defeated, deflated and when I just dont think I can feel any worse, I get hit with another rejection email... I'm getting towards the end of my degree, running out of funds, and completely unsure of my future. I'm beginning to feel desperate.

I've got an assessment to do by the 26th, it's leetcode based. I've done a few, I'm average in these. I don't feel like I have energy to get through this, especially when I have a thesis to write. I joined my course late (not my fault), felt pretty rushed through it, and have not really been able to catch a break. Now my head just constantly feels compressed. I'm from the UK originally, and I'm not sure I want to go back there.  

Now, I'm completely burned out. I don't have the energy to do anything. I don't think I can focus on my thesis, or look for any more jobs. But I don't think I can do anything else either.

1kryzyt,My boss is blocking my career growth being selfish (I know thats not rare lol),"I work almost 5 years for a home office big Company that pays well and have a good overall culture.
I have been promoted by former boss from intern to senior from 21-24. 
From 24 to now, I have a new boss, boss of my boss and director. 
They like me, I have high performance since joined the company, its on my reviews, my bosses and director agrees with It.
But i'm stuck in the same area since 21 and my company rewards, on long term, people that moves to another similar areas. 
The area I'm in is not core to company and I'm already tired because I just accumulate activities and end up doing much more than someone in a 1 tier higher position. I want to move to a similar area but on core.

The problem is: they (my bosses boss mainly) promised me at the beginning of the year that they would move me up with a promotion in the middle of the year. But, as I said, I'm here since 21 and have high performance, my bosses knows they kind of needs me untill end of year and they cant replace me with another senior. My direct boss has no voice, so I talk almost only with my bosses boss.

My bosses boss gave me 2 options:
1. Move me, and they would be ok with It
2. Move me inside the same area 🥴, but another team, without promotion, but with temporary salary boost, because 2 employes are going to get parental leaving very soon, and promissed the promotion in the end of the year, and, If i wanted, promotion with moving to another area.( He basically wants to have a high performance guy on that another team that is low performing and is going to have temporary losses.)

And I have another two options:
3. Try an internal process to a completly diferent area, but my bosses boss told me he would ""open my chair to the market"", so, It would be with great pressure. 
4. Go to the market

When I told I wanted the first option, my bosses boss replied like: ok, but Will be in the same position or Just in the end of year (in other words, it was not a options). And they ""think for a week and come back with your final answer"".

My problem is: 
1. I dont live in capital and dont want to, but now Im having a salary of capital, living in countryside, wich gives me outstanding life standart,and can home office with my wife (she works from office). I would have Just home office options, which are rare and usually dont pay as well as my company.
2. My bosses boss is going to get parental leaving (4 months) on september, so I'm not giving credit to promisses (again).
3. I already agreed not moving at the beginning of the year to help him and because he promissed moving me with promotion in the middle.

1kryovb,Dislike every job after ~2 years,"Looking for some advice from others who have been in similar situations. 

I have been working for most of my adulthood (17 years). I've never not had a job, and have worked mostly administrative/operational/leadership roles in tech and travel. I have worked abroad for the last 6 years, at first in person and now remotely for 5 years. 

I am generally a high performer and get good perf reviews and incentives to stay with the companies I work for I.e. promotions, equity (not much but still). I'm a good all rounder with a strong corporate skillset and stakeholder management skills. I should be content in most jobs, particularly the one I have now. 

The issue is that I grow tired or fall out of love with every job after about 2-3 years. I recognise career mobility is normal but that's not what's happening here. I get sour about the job. I start resenting everything about it and the cracks start to show in my motivation and ultimately delivery. It weighs on my mental health (alot of desk crying) and I try to maintain a brave face but those who work closest to me notice the change. 

I have some mental health issues, which I've had to take time off for in my current role last year, and am now trying to manage alongside grieving for my Dad who passed suddenly in my home country in January. My employer has been kind, but my workload has never been higher and I am cracking under the pressure and feel miserable at my desk every day. 

I feel I've been in generalist roles for too long and it's time to specialise more. I have some ideas where I would like to pivot but no desire to undertake more learning. 

I'm just worried I will end up losing what I have in my current role, to just end up hating the new job in 2 more years. This cycle of ""yay new job!"" > ""oh wow I'm learning so much"" > ""ok I love this, I found my rhythm now"" > ""hmm some cracks are starting to show"" > ""I hate this fkng place"" > ""my life is misery bc of my job"" is exhausting me mentally and emotionally. 

I am venting here in the hope someone can relate to my predicament and give me some advice. I am 35 and I can't cope with this constant stress in my life much longer, especially when work is such a big part of my life and I just want to get satisfaction from what I spend 40-50 hrs a week doing. 

Thank you for reading. ",scrabbleabble,87,0.9900000095367432,30,1747836361,2025-05-21 14:06:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kryovb/dislike_every_job_after_2_years/,5,2025

1krybjw,Would a university accept a psychology thesis that explores fantasy literature as a tool for self-understanding and emotional coping?,"Hi everyone! I’m asking on behalf of a friend who is a final-year psychology student and is passionate about fantasy literature, but she’s worried that her idea might not be taken seriously by her university. I want to convince her but I have no idea about her degree so I want advice for her and I hope here there is someone who can offer it. 
 She’s concerned that linking fantasy—often seen as a less “academic” or “serious” genre—with psychology might be dismissed as escapism or superficial. Because of this, she feels hesitant about proposing the project, even though she believes deeply in its potential and personal meaning. And I do too.

Her plan is to explore how reading fantasy literature can help young adults develop emotional awareness, self-understanding, and psychological resilience. She wants to investigate how readers project themselves into complex characters—especially those who struggle with trauma, guilt, fear, or internal moral conflict—and how, through symbolic identification, fantasy becomes a powerful space for emotional processing and self-discovery.

This project is inspired by her own experience: during difficult times, reading fantasy helped her understand and process emotions that were otherwise hard to name or face. She wants to show that fantasy, far from being mere escapism, offers a unique, symbolic distance that allows readers to engage deeply with painful inner realities—often more vividly and honestly than realistic fiction can.

Her approach would be grounded in theories from narrative psychology, emotion regulation, symbolic processing, and existential psychology, somrthing about some autor called Jung too (I think, not sure about this, I think she mentioned it) combined with literary theory focusing on authors such as Tolkien, Joe Abercrombie, Patrick Rothfuss, and Brandon Sanderson.

She is also considering including a small qualitative study (such as interviews or open-ended surveys with readers) to explore the real-life impact of fantasy on emotional coping. Furthermore, the project aims to highlight potential clinical applications or educational uses of fantasy literature as a tool for emotional support and self-therapy. Specially for young adults.

I want to encourage her to pursue this idea because I truly believe it has strong academic and personal value. If anyone has advice, insights, or experiences related to this kind of interdisciplinary project, it would be incredibly helpful! I don't know what to do to convince her and at this point I need more opinions about this!

Thank you so much!

The only reason I took it up is because it seemed pretty tempting, lot of opportunities and I was generally somewhat better than my peers in school.

1krxxci,Would I be dumb to leave my IT internship to do construction sales?,"Hello, I am 21 years old and recently went back to college and also acquired a year round paid IT internship. I started about a month ago, but wow, it is so boring and I'm not learning anything. The guy who is supposed to train me just locks his office and leaves me out, which I am not completely mad about because the job site is so behind on tickets that he just wants to grind them out as he is the only other IT person there. He says he’s an introvert and I know he’d find it offensive for some reason if I said that I want to learn more, he basically gets triggered about any slight inconvenience. I honestly don't even have an interest working in the computer science field, but I went for it because I don't know what else to do. Even if I don't like it, at least I'll have some form of a safety net.
My real passion is in entrepreneurship. I am very interested in starting my own construction company as there is real potential in my area. The issue is I have no construction experience. Granted, I can get someone with experience to help me along, but if I'm not providing any real value to them, I don't see why they would even talk to me about it. I also just need some excitement in my job - the concept of 'eat what you kill' sounds very interesting.
I need anyone reading this to be honest: do you think with my age and current standing, would it be a dumb decision to leave and join construction sales?

1krxw6i,Drop education program to pursue something stem?,"I’m currently in a program to be a middle school teacher. However, I’ve been having a lot of doubts. 

I’ve wanted to be a teacher for as long as I can remember. I still love the idea, but I’ve interviewed several teachers now, along with learning more about the education system in the US, and I just don’t feel like it’s the right fit for me anymore.

It sucks because this used to be my dream, but I’ve been losing sleep because it doesn’t feel “right” anymore. 

I’m considering something in STEM, probably something a bit more advanced that would require a masters or phd. My biggest strength is being book smart. I excel in school. I thrive when I am being challenged intellectually. I think I need this stimulation; teaching the same school-aged content over and over again would likely bore me to death. 

It’s just hard to make this switch because I’ve never really even considered doing anything else. I always thought I’d be a teacher. 

The people in my life close to me are like a 50/50 split with their advice- half are thinking I’m just getting cold feet and I shouldn’t quit my dream, and the other half think that teaching wouldn’t make me happy and they think I’d do best at something else. 

I’m not going to make any life-altering decisions based on other people’s opinions, ultimately the decision will be made by me and me only. I am just looking for input or new outlooks that I haven’t considered.

1krxfu4,Is staying at my current employer hurting my odds of a career change?,"Hey folks, kind of confusing title I realize, but let me explain.

I have always heard that being a “job hopper” is frowned upon by organizations as they may look at your resume and see you disappear every 18-24 months and think you’re a flight risk. 

What about the opposite of this? 

I have been at my current company for 15 years, everyone at work celebrates it saying oh man 15 years that’s amazing, good job. 

However in my head I often think to myself yeah now I’m the “old guy” on the team and I feel like the walls are slowly moving in to make me a “lifer” at the company

Is staying at a single company long-term also viewed negatively? Like if someone sees 15 years at one org they may think you can’t teach an old dog new tricks ? 

I feel like there is likely a hiring sweet spot that is more then a job hopper but also less then the lifetime guy

Thanks! 

I’m 39 and have worked for my father for 4 years at his dying ad agency in a small town. He is 75 years old and though I have talked to him about exploring my taking over the business numerous times, he is unable or unwilling to take the steps necessary to even explore that possibility. I just had a kid, and I’m not comfortable continuing to work for him indefinitely as he takes everything day by day and refuses to look down the road, plan, and aggressively go after new business. He’s slowed his hours down to about 4 a day and in general is just taking his foot off the gas. 

I am a one man video production crew and editor making web videos and tv commercials. I’m also a stills photographer. I also edit radio spot and write and do ad layouts so I’m proficient in most of the creative agency stuff and know my way around the Adobe suite. In previous roles I was an event planner, staff coordinator, and customer service representative in banking and hospitality. 

I don’t feel particularly specialized in any of the things I’ve done beyond the creative stuff.

1krslqw,Job listing reposted after interview,"I applied for a project manager role in April and got through a screening call, an assessment and two interviews. After the final interview I received some feedback through my recruiter that they liked me, thought I would be a great fit for the company but they made an offer to someone with more relevant project experience. 

I have since found the job listing again on more than one platform with a revised, slightly lower salary than I had set and I fear that my recruiter either did not negotiate with them correctly, or they didn’t want to hire through her (they asked me why I went via a recruiter). I would be happy to go lower salary wise because this is a side step for me. My recruiter has now ghosted me. I feel like the interview went really well and they did mention that the nature of the role is such that it doesn’t matter what type of project experience you have and that from a technical perspective my experience is good (which is what makes me think the recruiter didn’t do her job well). 

I’m a bit confused and, whilst I did reach out to the directors directly to thank them for their time out of courtesy, I’m not sure if I should contact them again and ask to be considered, or do I just let this one go?

1krs1pf,Should I get a CS degree if I want to create my own app in the SWE field?,"Hey all,
As the title states I’m hoping to gain some skills with CS to help me create an app idea I’ve been thinking about. Now I know ideas don’t go to far and it’s about the execution and I’m sure this idea has been thought of many times before (and so on, as I’ve heard plenty before), but I’m worried about what I’ve been hearing about the over saturated of the industry and how it’s hard to get a job after your degree. 
How true is this? 

I’m planning on working outside of my coursework on personal projects, networking, improving my soft skills and language proficiencies, but I want to get a realistic idea of how difficult it really is to get a job after graduation. I plan to get a source of income through a job after graduation while working on a minimum viable product for my app to showcase my idea to pitch to others. I’ve heard before that many times businesses fail and it’s always good to have backup options, I like to be optimistic, but also cautious and prepared as that is important for many aspects in life. 

So my question: Are all of the reports that it’s hard to get work true, or is it about more how you apply yourself and what additional skills you bring other than a degree in order to get hired?

1krr51r,"Feeling stuck at 27 with low-paying job,  what are my options?","

Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some serious advice regarding my career. I feel quite stuck and unsure about what direction to take next. Here’s a quick rundown of my situation:

* I completed Hotel Management in 2018 and worked with a 5-star brand until late 2019.
* I lost my job due to COVID and then had a long illness that kept me away from work for over a year.
* During the second lockdown, I started a premium gifting brand online. It ran for 2 years and made a decent profit but wasn’t sustainable long term.
* I eventually joined an IT company as an operations executive. For the past 2 years, I’ve mostly done data entry and now moderate UGC (user-generated content) on a website.
* My salary is ₹20,000/month with no perks or real growth. I’m turning 28 this year, and honestly, I can’t survive on this income anymore.

I don’t know what to do next. An MBA is financially out of reach for me. I considered data analytics, but I’m not genuinely interested in it. I want to do something that helps me earn well and build a stable future, but I’m totally lost on what that could be.

If anyone’s been in a similar situation or has advice on possible career paths or skills to learn (ideally low investment), I’d really appreciate your help.

Thanks in advance.

**TL;DR:**  
Hotel management grad, worked in hospitality until COVID + illness, ran a small business, now working in low-paying IT operations/content moderation job (₹20k/month). Can’t afford MBA. Not interested in data analytics.

1krqo9o,Career change,"Context: I been with my current company (insurance) for 3 1/2 years working in CRM(customer service) I started as customer service rep after a year I became a tech specialist (still talking otp with angry customers) and then I got promoted to my current role (retention specialist) which is like a dual role where I retain customers and sell policies, though this role pays a little more it is more stressful even though the roles prior to this one were also stressful, nothing beats this role. my attendance use to be good until I got into this role. the metrics for this role is the hardest but I do still get awards and always get customer compliments and always told how good of a rep I am but I strongly feel underpaid and overworked. This week alone 3 customers told me I need to be in a better role, something like management (which I have no desire) I can elaborate on why later

Why does this matter? I am currently trying to move internal and I feel like because of my not so good attendance (due to me taking off because of the high stress level and juggling finishing up my degree.) it will prevent me from moving internally. In addition before I got in this role I tried to move internally to a different department and kept getting denied and the same story for a few of my co-workers it seem like they only want to promote you within the same department. The time I did apply I was given a generic response of not having experience or skills. 

Let’s talk resume prior to completing my degree. I was already somewhat overqualified in terms of skills I acquired but I really like the company overall so I wanted to get my foot in the door and I figured by time I completed the academic requirements my experience from my current roles with the company would help. Sn: I worked in processing at another company while working this role to help with my resume , completed certifications and had my associates degree(I know it doesn’t hold any weight in the corporate world) 

However I now have my bachelors degree in organizational leadership , one extra certification and I’m currently preparing to study internationally for the summer under a business admin program intern that will provide a certification for the AI coding course and college credits towards graduate school if I apply for my masters this fall. 

I took the intern this summer for the experience academically, socially and professionally. It is a business school, it’s in France. (I am From the us)…. I forgot to mention I requested personal leave from my employer until I return from the program abroad which is only for 5 weeks. (Still waiting on approval) I made up my mind I’m going regardless of their answer. 

Now let’s get to the point. The point is I now have the skills , I have the experience, I have the academic background and I want to apply to a different role with my company to a different department and I’m not sure if I will have any luck. I’m not even I’m sure I can because my attendance. My sup says it needs to be under 6 to apply I’ll be at 7.5 by time I leave when I return I think it will at 6 if I return. I planned on applying with other companies for when I return just in case but I can’t for the life of me picture myself coming back from abroad working back in customer service dealing with screaming customers but I have stability with my company and its a refutable company. Should I stick it out til I’m promoted, if I am or should I just seek other companies and prepare to leave? I really want an analyst role and to be out of CRM all together . 

I started at 45k with over time I made like 50 I got promoted then base salary was 48k made 60 with over time now my current role which was the last promotion base pay is 53k don’t know what it will be with overtime because I haven’t worked much this year o and I forgot to add I work from 11am -8pm whole day gone and it’s hard for me to go to sleep at night bc of the screen time

1krpsah,My Job Search Was Breaking Me Until I Found A Better Way,"I remember those days so clearly. Waking up, coffee in hand, and then facing the mountain of job applications. LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, Monster, ZipRecruiter, and so many other sites. Each one wanted my info, my resume, sometimes a cover letter. It was like a full time job just to apply for jobs. I'd spend hours, literally hours, applying to maybe five or ten places. Then the silence. Just nothing. It was so draining, so frustrating. I started feeling like I was just wasting my time. My confidence took a huge hit.

I kept thinking, there has to be a simpler way. Why isn't someone fixing this? I was so desperate for a solution. I talked to friends, read articles, watched videos. I just wanted to get my resume out there without all the repetitive clicking and typing.

One day, I stumbled across something. I was looking for tools to help with online applications, because I was truly at my wit's end. I found a site called speedy-apply.com. Honestly, I was skeptical. I thought, 'this sounds too good to be true.' But I was willing to try anything.

It promised to help with applying to jobs across all these different sites. You just tell it what you are looking for, like 'remote customer service jobs', and it handles the rest. I tried it. And it changed everything. Instead of hours for a few applications, I was able to send out so many more in a fraction of the time. It made the whole process less painful, less soul crushing. I still had to wait for responses, but at least I knew I was getting my name out there efficiently. It just really helped me feel like I had some control back in a very crazy process.

1krp8wz,Joined a startup and discovered the codebase is a disaster while the founding dev is leaving. Should I ask for more money?,"Just started at a tiny startup last week and found out the founding developer is leaving with almost no notice. I'm now realizing that the codebase is in terrible shape and I'll basically be taking on a much bigger role than I signed up for.

**What I discovered:**
- Used a type-checking tool and found 10,000+ type issues in the main app
- No documentation or tests anywhere
- Security issues including hardcoded credentials
- Zero modern development practices

**The type safety problem:**
For non-technical folks: TypeScript is a programming language that helps catch errors early by defining what kind of data should be used where. Proper typing is like having guard rails that prevent many common bugs and make code more maintainable. Finding 10,000+ type issues means the founding dev effectively bypassed these safeguards either by using ""any"" type (which defeats the purpose) or using no types at all. This isn't just a cleanup task - these issues are likely the root cause of many bugs in the queue and make the codebase significantly harder to maintain or modify safely.

**The team situation:**
- The founding dev who built most of this is leaving immediately
- Other remaining dev has been there several months but doesn't have much experience with modernizing codebases
- Found out the founding dev had minimal experience when hired
- Founding dev is confrontational when I point out issues, gets defensive about the code

**The compensation problem:**
- I prioritized cash over equity during negotiations (asked for highest possible cash offer)
- The founder threw in 500 shares as an afterthought
- The other remaining dev has 24x more equity than me (12,000 shares)
- My salary is only slightly higher than the other dev

**My experience:**
I have 3 years of professional coding experience from my own startups and apps. Given my background in building and maintaining production systems, I'll inevitably be leading the charge on modernizing this codebase. The other dev, while knowledgeable about the current system, doesn't have experience with the kind of architectural overhaul and testing implementation this situation requires.

I'm essentially walking into a situation where I'll need to lead a major rebuild effort rather than just contributing as a regular developer. This feels like a completely different job than what I interviewed for.

Given that I specifically optimized for cash during my initial negotiation and already signed a contract, did I make my bed and now have to lie in it? Or is it reasonable to approach leadership about adjusting my equity now that I understand the true scope of the disaster I've inherited?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",MarcoManatee,1,0.550000011920929,34,1747801937,2025-05-21 04:32:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1krp8wz/joined_a_startup_and_discovered_the_codebase_is_a/,5,2025
1kror1a,Has anyone negotiated a separation agreement that made them eligible for unemployment benefits after being put on a PIP?,"So I was put on a PIP a few weeks ago and, long story short, I’m frankly done with this place. This job has caused me physical health problems due to stress and the thought of continuing makes me want to vomit. I have a checkin with my manager tomorrow and I can’t even think of what to say (in my defense, I was out of the office for 2 weeks due to a death in the family and just returned this week). 

The silver lining is that my spouse will be inheriting a generous amount of assets from our deceased relative, so we have a financial cushion that will allow me to take some time off to recover and not stress too hard about money. I could quit with nothing lined up, but I’d be much more comfortable receiving a few months of unemployment. This will allow us to keep the funds in an investment account and (hopefully) gain some returns before we need to touch it.

1krohqx,It’s hard to be enthusiastic,"Every job I’ve worked, I always started off very enthusiastic and willing to learn. I know it sounds corny, but I’d be so excited to participate and work in a team. But every job I’ve been at, I’ve been ostracized and “othered” so badly that it made it impossible to do my job. Sabotage, miscommunication, cliques, backhanded comments. It just makes it difficult to work within a team when everyone is so miserable and shady. I’ve noticed a pattern, it’s always usually my coworkers misbehaving and not the supervisors. I’ve had issues with supervisors too, but most of the issues are with my peers. 

I even tried changing my personality to being aloof and less inquisitive. Didn’t work and I’d just be left out even more. I don’t care about being friends with people; I’m saying they don’t like me so they don’t update me on important things or conveniently “forget” to add me to group chats, essentially leaving me out of the loop. It’s a problem that affects my productivity and even when I communicate it clearly and assertively, they still do it. People don’t respect me.

1kroa7g,Almost 40,"Quick background; single, no kids, BS in STEM (that I haven’t used in years), and I’m approaching 40. 

Currently I’m a truck driver, and although it pays well, the hours are long and it does not allow me to live the lifestyle that I would like. 

I’m just looking for input and advice from strangers on the internet. My goals are basically the best way to achieve FIRE although I realize that is probably unrealistic. 

I have practically 0 saved for retirement and I’m currently about $100,000 in debt. CC’s, car payment (upside down about 10k) and student loans from my old STEM degree. 

Currently I’m a local truck driver and life style creep has just gotten out of control. I’m planning on getting rid of my apartment and going back over the road ASAP. I plan to stay out for long hitches and live minimally and I’m hoping to save approximately $50,000/year after I get most of my debts paid off the first year (cc’s, pay off car negative equity and sell). Once I have about 150-200k saved up I plan on buying a home outright in my low cost of living medium Midwest city. Hopefully a duplex so that I can have some additional income and concentrate on the next chapter of my life. 

Once I have my home paid for and I know I have shelter and security I feel like I’ve got two options. 
1.) I may go back to school for a graduate degree of some sorts. A masters in accounting or a MBA come to mind but ideally I’d like to get a degree that would allow me to work remotely. 
2.) I’ve also thought about staying in the blue collar field(s) and going to welding school or diesel mechanic school. 

I’m also still eligible for the armed services. It’s been something that has always interested me but I’ve never jumped at the opportunity. I’m not sure it would even be financially wise at this point unless I got the GI bill and do employers still respect military service on resumes? I personally do, but it is worth at this point in my life to go to the military (active duty 4 years) for the benefits (GI bill, veteran status). I realize some military members reading this last paragraph will say something along the lines of “those are the wrong reasons to join” and I respect that opinion but I’m still asking if it would assist me with career advancement in the civilian world after my 4 years.

I am currently serving in the military as a Spanish linguist. I obtained my Associates in Spanish in APR 2024 and I should be obtaining my BA in Spanish sometime next year. In addition, I am currently working on my BA in English with a concentration in Creative Writing. My original plan was to become a teacher, work my way up and gain valuable teaching experience, obtain my PHD and then become an English professor at a university. This is a very streamlined career path that I was satisfied with; however, I am currently stuck in a dilemma. I do enjoy teaching and mentoring--I do it for work; I am a job trainer and I am currently a team leader. However, my current circumstances are very laid-back and I have a good amount of autonomy with what I teach, how I teach, and when I teach. Within my current position, I am only responsible for a handfull (around 3-4) people.

I am passionate about teaching and mentoring others. I feel like it gives me great joy. The only issue is that I believe teaching in a school setting will ruin that for me, and I will lose my spark due to deadlines, the very rigid cirriculum, the larger quantity of students, and the possible parental issues that come with teaching. While I have the resilience to handle all these obstacles, I am afraid that I won't want to do it long term.

So, if teaching does fall through, what are some other career paths I can take with the degrees I listed above? I have been looking at working on some certifications like the Certified Associate Business Analyst (CABA), Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM), and a Microsoft Excel certification, but I am not sure how well these would transfer.

I ETS in 2 years and want to have this figured out by my 1 year mark. I still have a Skillbridge I can take, and I will have my GI Bill available to use once I do get out.

If anyone has any tips or guidance, I would appreciate it greatly!",Apprehensive_Math908,1,1.0,1,1747796919,2025-05-21 03:08:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1krnrs3/i_feel_stuck_and_im_not_sure_what_to_do/,5,2025

1krnchj,Layoffs and being seen as a job hopper,"To make a long story short, in 2022 I left a small company to work at a Fortune 5 company (chasing higher pay). Unfortunately for me, they begin restructuring almost immediately and after 1.5 years and surviving several rounds of layoffs, I was let go. 

I saw the writing on the wall and was able to land another job with less than a month gap. I've been at this new job for a little under a year now and it just isn't the right fit. I've unfortunately bumped heads with my manager a couple of times and he is one to hold a grudge. I try very hard not to rock the boat but he's challenging to work for. He actually has so-so turnover among his direct reports, with most either transferring after a year or leaving the company altogether. The most tenured person under him has only been here 1.5 years. Needless to say, I would like to find something new. 

My current company is under a hiring freeze so an internal transfer is not an option. I recently started browsing on job boards and I'm trying to plan ahead. How should I explain my job hopping history and why I'm looking for a new job already?

Job hopping progression:

3 years at Company A (left to switch careers) > 2 years at Company B (left for more money) > 1.5 years at Company C (layoffs) > Less than 1 year at current Company D  (what reason should I use??)",Strickfrik,5,0.8500000238418579,9,1747795571,2025-05-21 02:46:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1krnchj/layoffs_and_being_seen_as_a_job_hopper/,5,2025
1krn9j1,Floodify,"

To keep it short, I've been struggling financially lately, and I was honestly saved by a side hustle I found through Floodify.

I discovered the platform from an ad. It seemed legit—before signing up, I did a bit of research on the founder through LinkedIn. The details matched, and the profile looked authentic. After that, I started linking some of my old accounts and even created new ones. I really put in the effort. I also referred a few friends, which helped grow my income both through referrals and the volume of accounts I managed.

Eventually, I was able to gather around $200—huge help for my daily expenses, especially since minimum wage in the Philippines doesn’t really cut it. I'm still consistently working on it, linking accounts, and trying to maximize what I can earn.

I’m just wondering, for those who’ve been on platforms like this or have experience with similar side hustles—is it sustainable long-term? I really hope their business sticks around.

1krkhoa,Manager problems during mid year,"My manager asked me to provide names of people I worked with to reach out to for mid year review. She took over the role a few months ago and is new to the team, I joined the team over a year ago. So I obliged. During the mid year she admitted she never reached out to them. I pressed for why and got evasive answers like what difference would it make or what would you expect them to add?

Has no interest in documenting anything I do well. This was obvious by the review that noted none of the measurements of success I hit for the half that she outlined for me, and we talked about routinely how I was meeting them (ie not falling short). All that was noted are things like “missed a team meeting and did not update us in advance”. Ok I’m sorry I missed a single meeting out of dozens 6 months ago, my record is still better attending than my team mates. Even added I did not provide progress on one of 50 tickets I completed. I in fact did update her weekly on it and the requestor. She never bothered to ask that before writing? I’m at a loss for how dishonest she is. When I bring this up she ignores it and changes subject. She ended the review by saying she wants to put me on a performance plan. I see the writing on the wall I know. I just don’t understand how she can get away with blatant lies and omissions for my review to justify this.

I’ve always been a “jack of all trades” type—decent at a lot of things but never felt particularly amazing at any one thing. Since elementary school, my dream was to join the military like my dad. I started the recruiting process last summer and felt like I was finally moving toward something I believed in. But a couple of months ago, my waivers were denied, and that pretty much crushed my dream and the only solid plan I had. With no backup plan, I scrambled and applied to a bunch of colleges last minute. I actually got into UMaine and was really excited about it. But my parents wanted me to go to a community college instead because it’s more affordable. I never expected or asked them to pay for my education and I told them that, but they still pushed for community college. So now I’m enrolled in a local community college majoring in Addiction and Recovery Services. It’s a meaningful field, but it’s not my passion. The school doesn’t offer anything in international relations, which is what I’m actually most interested in. I also love history and anthropology, and I’d love to do something related to those fields, but I worry about job prospects and financial stability. I’ve always wanted to travel and explore the world, but now I feel stuck—like I’m settling out of pressure and fear. I'm wondering if I should just power through two years at community college and try to transfer to UMaine to pursue international relations.

Just an update. 

So the next day I woke up to many emails from my student asking if we could speak. I ignored them originally. By day three, I was still getting emailed so I finally met up with him to speak after class. I told him that I take responsibility and I shouldn’t have let it get that far. I also told him, that I need this job and if he could keep it to himself. He agreed and said that he hadn’t told anyone and that he wouldn’t. 

He told me that he would like to see me again. I told him no and to let it go.  That was the end of that conversation. 

The following day was the last day of class before commencement and graduation. He came to class and it was like nothing ever happened. He is a senior so I was internally grateful because that meant I wouldn’t see him ever again in life after the last class. 

This past week I was in my office hours. My co worker said that there was a delivery for me. It was a bouquet of flowers and a hand written card from the student saying how much I meant to him and how he really wants to see me again and he enjoyed my time. 

I ignored him. And I haven’t heard from him since. 

Throughout this whole debacle. I realize that I was wrong because I was the professor in the situation. I am HAPPY that this whole saga is over. I am going to take the summer to let everything blow over and I’m just going to be continue like the whole thing never happened. I just want everything behind me.

1kri3fo,Got a callback for a second interview—need advice!,"I could really use some advice.

I applied for a position at one of the big banks and was surprised to get a call a few days later to schedule an in-person interview. The interview was about an hour long with a VP & the recruiter at one of their branches. The recruiter told me they’d be in touch with a decision within 3 weeks, but when he exited the interview, the vP told me ""I know he said 3 weeks but you'll be hearing back in 2 weeks realistically. So I figured I’d just wait and see.

To my surprise, I got a call the *very next day* asking if I’d be open to meeting again for a coffee chat with the same VP to answer more questions as the first interview was ""only an hour and dint get to ask everything"". It’s scheduled for tomorrow at a local coffee shop.

I honestly don’t have much experience—this would be my first job in finance—so I’m a little nervous and unsure what to expect from this kind of second meeting (I work in banking right now but it's been only 4 months). Is this a good sign? Should I be preparing for a second interview or is this more of an informal vibe-check?

Also, what should I wear? I wore a full suit to the first interview (no tie). Should I dress the same for this one even though it’s at a coffee shop?

1krhlth,Is this long of a wait after an interview normal?,"Hi all—
I interviewed for a job three weeks ago. I had two interviews: one video call and then an in-person panel where I met the whole team and got a tour. They told me I’d hear back by “the end of next week,” but it’s now been over three weeks and I haven’t heard anything.

I followed up once and was told a decision is still pending, and that “the wheels of the state move slowly,” since it’s a position contracted through a state agency. But now it’s been another week since even that message, and I’m still waiting.

Is this kind of delay normal for state-affiliated jobs? Or should I assume they’ve probably chosen someone else by now?

Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who’s been through this.",cashby93,1,1.0,0,1747778701,2025-05-20 22:05:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1krhlth/is_this_long_of_a_wait_after_an_interview_normal/,5,2025

I ended up not getting the job but got put on the shortlist. I got a call for a job yesterday in the council that is perfect for me. But, i had a holiday planned a while ago, and i will be gone or 5 weeks from the end of June to start of August. The job goes until November and i would really like to have the job.

It’s a challenge and requires problem solving which an anxious brain like mine loves lol anywho, just looking for advice from anyone who has gotten an MBA in either or maybe has any suggestions based on the above or from their own experience.

1krfhpb,New director is an absolute micromanager,"We have a new director at work. She is not my direct supervisor. Our unit manager is my direct supervisor, but this woman definitely thinks she is.

She is driving me absolutely crazy and I don't know what to do. I spend a whole lot of time crying now, which is something this job wasn't doing to me before.

Examples:

I received an email from an outside agency. Money related: I was asked to make sure a certain account was terminated. I did, and let the person who emailed me know that they may reach out to her. Three days later, the agency called me to get her number again. I emailed that person to let her know they were planning to reach out. The director (who was cc'ed on the email, along with my supervisor) sent me a separate email letting me know I should explain myself so the receiver knows what I'm referring to. Explain myself? The other agency initiated the email with me. Wouldn't they know what I'm talking about when I say the other agency is going to be reaching out?????

Today I got an email from our executive assistant, sharing that an angry client was trying to reach me. I let the EA know that had tried to call the client late last week, and she was probably just returning my call. The concern for the EA was that the client was angry, which I already knew. Director again emails Mr separately and asks if I could please call the client back. Are you kidding me??? Did she think I didn't know to do that?

During her first week, she tried to write me up because another department decided to change a policy AFTER I had completed the task related to that policy. It was understood by me and my supervisor that I would follow the new policy moving forward. The director tried to write me up for not following a policy that wasn't even written when I completed the task. I headed straight up to HR and HR confirmed that this was absolutely not protocol and the write up was shredded.

I really, really need this director to grasp an understanding that she is not my supervisor. If she has an issue, she needs to take that up with my supervisor, who can then come to me, instead of the director overriding my supervisor. In none of these examples was my supervisor aware that the director was going to have these conversations, and she's not happy about it. I have been in my position for 5 years, I have been in my current field for 18 years.

I do not know what to do. I am so upset, I'm tired of feeling like I'm living under a magnifying glass, and I am especially tired of crying over my damn job when I'm 52 years old, but this shit is really getting me down.

1krf16a,Career and life advice would be appreciated,"Hello everyone, to keep the introduction short, I am 19 from Serbia and mostly passionate about two things: learning languages and travelling.

I am aware that neither of those things could be considered careers per se but I have the following issue: even if I wanted to ""sell out"" and do something purely for the money I would have no idea where to start.

Not to mention, Serbia is currently experiencing a huge protest of students (im talking ongoing for 6+ months) so studying locally is not an option. I have heavily considered going to Germany, as I do speak the language completely fluently, but I would need to get to applying soon, and I have so many doubts, so I have been procrastinating.

One doubt would be, what to study? On one hand the obvious choice would be something language-related, but what? The main options would be studying linguistics or the German language itself. The first one is problematic, because again, my passion is in learning languages. Sure, I would probably somewhat enjoy learning about language acquisition methods, and I do find phonetics, development of language, and grammar intriguing - but my real ""joy"" comes from simply talking to people and especially experiencing new languages. For that same reason, I dont know if I could dedicate my career to German specifically.

I would also value earning potential, mostly because I want to reach financial independence. Having the necessary funds to be able to travel wherever I desire is the main goal of that. The problem as I mentioned earlier is, I wouldnt know what to study, even for money. I have considered Economics and IT, both fields I do actually find quite interesting, and I have a decent knowledge of general math, and am great at statistics, but the more you look into it - the more you realize a high earning potential is not guaranteed. But then again, finding a job is probably easier than with a linguistics degree?

I have done a little bit of language teaching online (some advertising through reddit, mostly instagram, some real life referrals) and have been able to my surprise see a good amount of interest despite no official degree. Part of me wishes to try my luck building up an online career teaching German (yes despite no formal education in it) as it is my favorite language.

The thing that makes the whole equation harder is that I am also in a long term relationship (8 months, but have been practically ""together"" for much much longer), and our plan was actually to go to Germany together. Now, I would feel almost like a traitor bailing last minute on that, and for what? To pursue a career that pays ""decent"" but has no long-term security? It just all feels so wrong...

I dont know what to do, I think its very expected of me to go to university, but I wouldnt know what to study. Part of me wants to just start working straight away, but any local company would honestly pay way less than I earn with tutoring right now, so its a tough decision.

Thank you so much for your advice.",Sudden_Shelter,1,1.0,0,1747772253,2025-05-20 20:17:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1krf16a/career_and_life_advice_would_be_appreciated/,5,2025

It’s been overwhelming since I’m extremely socially awkward and sometimes things don’t come out as I intend it and this makes for really awkward situations, espically at work where there are a lot of unspoken social rules. 

During our scrum meeting today, the project manager was asking if we had any blockers. Since my part was waiting on the project manager to complete their part first, I said it’s not too much of a blocker but I was wondering if I would be able to receive their part any time soon. 

As soon as I said “any time soon” I felt I chose the wrong dialogue option since they seemed a bit offended. The project manager kinda echoed the phrase “any time soon…?” and laughed a bit, before explaining it they would try and get it to me today. 

I feel extremely terrible and awkward after I realized I had offended them. After asking some of my friends about the situation, they mentioned I might have come off as passive aggressive, which was completely not my intention at all. 

I will be working with this project manager for the foreseeable future and I feel really bad about offending them. Would it be too much if I reach out and apologize for my wording or is it a small blip that they might forget and I am overthinking the situation? How often does this happen in corporate?

On the one hand, everything is new for her and completely different from her previous job, so she already doesn’t feel very comfortable there — something most people can probably relate to. Most of the people there are okay and nice to each other.
The problem is that she has to work with someone in a leadership position, and this old guy has absolutely no understanding of anything. He snaps at her, shows no empathy at all, and she comes home in tears, feeling so awful that we don’t know what to do anymore.

1kr9mhm,Career planning - which route to choose of 3 great options,"Hi all,

I'm looking for career advice.
I'm in my early 30s, 4 years into my career, currently working as an IT Project Manager in Northern Europe (temporary role covering parental leave).

Educational background:
- M.Sc. + B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering
- B.Sc. in Finance, dual degrees from two top European universities

I'm ambitious and career-driven, but recently became a father and want to balance work with family. I care a lot about salary, but also crave purpose and leadership. Long-term, I’m aiming for a management path rather than being a specialist.

I have THREE JOB OFFERS on the table — all related to IT + supply chain. Here’s a breakdown:

OPTION 1: STAY AT CURRENT COMPANY (PERMANENT OFFER)

COMPANY:
- Large retail firm (~25,000 employees)
SALARY:
- ~$97K
PERKS:
- PMI cert (during work hours)
- 30 days vacation

PROS:
- Strong internal network (half the top management including the CEO knows who I am)
- High-profile projects (50–100 staff), very visible role
- Good wage growth potential
- Young, social work culture - many colleagues are friends

CONS:
- Company is financially shaky
- Work feels meaningless (e.g. my work enables layoffs)
- Stressful, less time for family

EXIT OPPORTUNITIES:
- Management consulting
- Senior PM roles
- Starting my own firm


OPTION 2: DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE

SALARY:
- ~$97K

PERKS:
- 35 days vacation
- Paid OT
- 33% higher pension
- 4 hrs/week gym time
- PMI cert 
- Exec MBA or army leadership education sponsorship possible

PROS:
- Strong sense of purpose. I'm highly patriotic and can think of few things more meaningful than working for the defence of my country
- Exciting projects in 1–2 years
- Very family-friendly
- Good potential to climb the ladder if I join now – my country is massively spending on defence

CONS:
- Slow wage growth
- Fewer leadership opportunities short-term (smaller teams)
- Frequent travel (1–1.5 weeks/month)
- Older workforce, less social
- Starting from scratch with contacts

EXIT OPPORTUNITIES:
- Defense consulting
- Roles at large defense companies


OPTION 3: ENERGY SECTOR

COMPANY:
- Mid-sized firm owned by a large European energy company (~600 staff)

SALARY:
- ~$130K

PERKS:
- Company car
- 30 days vacation
- No overtime pay
- No education support

PROS:
- Highest salary
- Will lead important projects

CONS:
- Smaller teams (10–15 staff)
- Sector is okay, but doesn't excite me
- May get similar/better offers next year

TL;DR

I'm torn between:
- MEANINGFUL WORK (Option 2)
- HIGHEST SALARY (Option 3)
- BIGGEST LEADERSHIP OPPORTUNITY & NETWORK (Option 1)
- BEST LONG-TERM GROWTH + BALANCE

What would you prioritize at this stage of my career/life 

Appreciate any insights.

1kr9fb3,What should my mom expect from a workplace harassment investigation in Canada?,"

Hi everyone,

I’m looking for advice on behalf of my mom, who’s going through a really difficult situation at work. She recently filed a formal workplace harassment complaint after experiencing what she believes is discrimination related to her pregnancy.

Her doctor recommended that, due to pain and complications, she avoid long commutes and instead work from home 1–2 days a week—a request that’s entirely feasible for her role. When she brought this up to the HR coordinator, he responded in a condescending tone declining her request entirely, saying things like “you don’t really do anything anyway” and that her job “isn’t important.” He also told her that when she returns from maternity leave, there may not be work for her, and that someone else will likely be taking over her responsibilities along with other tasks.

She found this really upsetting and degrading—especially since, in Canada, it’s illegal to eliminate someone’s position or penalize them because of pregnancy or maternity leave. Because of this, she filed an internal harassment complaint, and the HR manager disregarded it and basically said she is over reacting. She then submitted a formal complaint to the provincial workplace board.

This manager has apparently had multiple complaints made against him in the past, which makes the situation feel even more discouraging. In this situation, the latest update is a mediator has been hired and is conducting interviews. 

Has anyone been through something similar? I’m really worried for her as this is a rough situation, and she really does love her job. She is good at it and enjoys the environment before this all happened. 


Any advice, stories, or support would 
be so appreciated. Thank you!

1kr9dww,"23 y/o dual citizen with a bachelor's degree, knowledge of multiple languages, and no idea where to start","I am 23 years old and have no idea how to market myself or where to look. I have a bachelors degree from Rutgers University; I majored in political science (1) and global studies (2) with a minor in psychology. I studied abroad in Ireland at University College Dublin while at Rutgers as well. My cumulative GPA is a 3.1. I know this is nothing special, but it is far from terrible. It is also a consequence of my first years in college when I didn't know what to do; I have made the Dean's List in most of the semesters I can recall.

I speak multiple languages; I am fluent in Bulgarian. I have a significant understanding of Russian as I took it in high school- I can perfectly understand it both written and spoken and can speak it myself. My only problem is declining words when I speak. I studied Latin during this time as well and can understand all of the Romance languages at least in written form.

I never truly applied myself and have never had an internship or a ""real"" job that wasn't retail (Best Buy, supermarket). I'm also quite introverted and basically made no real connections in college.

I am also a complete dual citizen as I was born in the USA to parents from the EU. I also have almost no college debt. I guess that means I have decent ingredients but I have no idea how to come up with a recipe.

Growing up, social studies / history / geography were my favorite subjects which is why I chose political science. I realize it's not as lucrative a field as something like finance, but I still think there are many good options and paths.

Ultimately, I botched lots of interviews because I didn't know how to answer leaving my previous job.

I'm young (mid-20s), but I can't help but feel like my reputation is tarnished beyond repair.

1kr8q99,Considering a Career Move: Higher Ed Admin vs. Special Ed Leadership—Need Advice,"I’m 27, three years post-grad, with a background in education. I have a B.S. and M.A. in Education, along with teaching certificates in Childhood Education, Special Ed, and TESOL. I’ve worked as a classroom teacher, but I’m currently in higher education administration at a large, well-known university, earning $70,000/year. I've been in this role for a year.

While I know I want to stay in academia long term, I haven’t quite figured out in what capacity—whether that's teaching, administration, leadership, consulting, or even ed tech.

Recently, I came across a job listing for an Assistant Director role at a high school special education program (connected to my alma mater, which makes it personally meaningful). It pays $90,000, and I’ve made it to the first round of interviews, but I'm torn. Here's how I see things:

Current Job (Higher Ed Admin – $70k/year)

Pros:
Large, prestigious institution with excellent benefits (especially health insurance and retirement).
Very relaxed environment with lots of free time, WFH days, and PTO flexibility.
I was just accepted into their M.A. in Educational Leadership program, which I can attend tuition-free through remission (not sure how beneficial, just applied since I was bored and to make the most of the benefits)
Easier internal mobility—once you're in the system, it's easier to move around departments and up the ladder.

Cons:
I’m SO bored. The work is easy but uninspiring.
I miss student interaction.
Limited growth/salary increase unless a higher-level position opens up—and even then, it's competitive and unclear when that might happen. It may take multiple years for $90,000 role 

Potential New Job (Assistant Director – $90k/year)

Pros (so far):
I'd get to work closely with students again, which is fulfilling for me.
Better title and higher salary.
Follows an academic calendar—so summer and winter breaks

Cons (potential):
It's a much smaller school, so I’m concerned about limited upward mobility and more workplace politics.
Not sure about the benefits yet, but likely less robust—especially around retirement and health.
If it doesn’t work out, I’d probably have to leave the institution entirely (unlike my current job, where internal transfers are more doable).
There's a risk of going from being bored to being overworked—still unsure of the workload.

TL;DR:
Do I stay in a stable, well-paying (but boring) higher ed admin job with great benefits and internal mobility? Or do I jump into a more fulfilling but riskier and possibly more demanding leadership role in K-12 education for a $20k pay bump and closer student interaction?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s navigated a similar crossroads in education or admin.

1kr8dvq,What would you do?,"I wanted to get some career advice. What would you?

After high school, I started working at a private small/medium sized manufacturing company ($50M revenue - 150 employees). I worked my way from daily production into supply chain/operations while attending college and eventually became the CFO after about 8 years of working for this company.

Due to various reasons (burnout, company culture, growth opportunities), I decided to leave and take a Senior Analyst job at an F100 company. I’ve been here about a year and a half.

I took a significant pay decrease ($140k to $95k) with this move and justified it by the huge improvement in work life balance, less day to day pressure, and the experience of working for a large corporation.

In the year and a half since I’ve been gone, my old company hasn’t hired a replacement, one of the owners is retiring, and it seems they would like me to return.

I assume the pay would increase, to at least $180k, if I were to return. I am still on really good terms with everyone there and there wouldn’t really be hard feelings.

My hesitation is that I would likely have to commit to this company for at least 5 years. I would lose any potential “large company” exposure I am getting now. And I would be back at square one while finding a new job once the remaining owners decide to sell their business upon retiring (they are in their 60’s). Lastly, as a smaller and older company, they have very antiquated procedures and the culture is very strongly driven by “we’ve always done it this way”.

The positives are obviously pay. I would nearly double my compensation, and be almost guaranteed to get raises each year.

What would you do? Would you take the huge bump in pay at the sacrifice of work life balance and increased stress? I am almost 30 and am trying to consider the rest of my life and career as well.

I joined in an ongoing big project couple months ago and we have 4 months to go. i m part of the coordination team. admin, fin, resource plan etc. I came to help and gain experience but i found myself drowning into tasks and deliverables which i had not much experience or capability to finish. the project is big and complex with lots of steakholders and deliverables. it is not going well and it is effeecting my health since last 2 months. i m going to see my dr soon. i cant sleep properly, i cant eat properly,i cant work properly, i will consult if this is burnout. i know you might think what is the big deal, just work and move on. 

now there is another side of this story, there are some tasks i feel like i m not doing well, i either dont have the capacity or i m not able to provide the right answer( simplified). i questiob my intellect, my skills and abilities. not sure how i reached to that point. normally if u dont perform you should be pulled out from the project but there is no such leadership or ownership. i m 40 btw, i ve worked in various teams.

if i quit the project team probably wont be engaging me in any future project and eventually i ll be out. which is fine at this point. i really tried for days and nights to give my best.

my family says they cant recognize me and i honestly having hard time going to work everyday. anyways what would you do in such situation? how can i gain confidence again? how can i push myself to finish this project? or i just leave it saying i m sick? ( which i m - phyisically and mentally)

1kr7xks,Money vs Passion,"Hi everyone,

I recently completed a combined BS/MS program in mathematics at a top 10 university in the US, and I’m currently facing a difficult career decision: Should I go into industry now or pursue a PhD?

On the industry side, I’ve received an offer from Meta for a machine learning engineer (MLE) role, and I’m currently negotiating the base salary and RSUs.

On the academic side, I’ve been offered a full-time research position for 1–2 years with a leading professor in my field. This is a rare and valuable opportunity that would put me in a very strong position to get into a top 5 PhD program afterwards.

The field I'm interested in is not computer science or AI/ML, but rather a theoretical discipline. If I complete a PhD at a top 5 program, it’s very likely I’d be able to secure a tenure-track assistant professorship at a top university given the nature of my field of interest.

Financially, the MLE path is the clear winner. I expect total compensation to be around $250k+. In contrast, taking the academic route means 1–2 years of full-time research, followed by 5–6 years of a PhD, and then 6 years as an assistant professor with relatively low pay. Assistant professors in my field typically make around $180k, with salaries rising to $250k as an associate professor and $350k+ as a full professor—assuming you make tenure.

The MLE job doesn’t quite align with my interests or personality, but I don’t hate it either. I think I’d be able to tolerate the work fine, and the work-life balance seems okay (around 40–45 hours per week).

The professor path is grueling as you well know—low pay, long hours, high stress—but I genuinely love teaching and mentoring students. While I wouldn’t say I’m obsessed with research, I find it intellectually rewarding and meaningful especially when it connects to real-world impact. One of my undergrad advisors once told me that I had the potential to “become a superstar,” which has lingered with me as a kind of hopeful burden. And to be honest, becoming a professor in this field has been my dream since high school.

One limiting factor: I’m currently 27 years old. I don’t think I have the luxury of trying both routes—academia and industry—before settling down. Marriage and family are also important goals for me, and I feel time is a bit tight to explore everything.

So, I’m torn: Should I follow my childhood dream and do something that truly aligns with my values? Or was that just a naive fantasy from a younger, idealistic version of myself—and should I take the high-paying job now and secure a comfortable future?

I’d really appreciate your honest thoughts.

1kr6xu9,"Mid-career shift from software engineering to public interest law — scared, curious, seeking insight","I’m currently a US-based software engineer with a master’s degree and 5 years of experience. I love the flexibility my job provides—remote work, flexible hours, a solid salary. I also genuinely enjoy problem solving and programming.

But I get no fulfillment from the actual product I’m building. I’m tired of working for private companies on projects that feel like they only exist to make stakeholders richer. I’ve been interested in civic tech since the beginning as a potential way to bridge this gap—using my skills for something meaningful—but it’s a niche area in an already competitive job market. The federal government’s recent budget issues haven’t helped either; I had two exciting job offers rescinded late last year due to cuts, and 18F was been shuttered.

Additionally, while I don't think AI will replace developers fully - at least not for a long time - it is replacing parts of my work I used to enjoy, and making the market that much more competitive.

In my frustration, I took the LSAT in February and ended up getting a full-ride to my local law school. I’ve long been interested in public interest law, and I keep coming back to this idea that I want my work—the thing I spend most of my life doing—to matter. Law seems like one way to make that happen.

But here’s the catch: I’m 33. Giving up a salary, benefits, and job stability to go back to school for three years is a huge pill to swallow. I keep wondering: Is it too late? Will it be worth it? Would I be better off staying in software and continuing to try to find a meaningful niche? Or is it smarter to take the plunge now, rather than continuing to try in software just to end up in the same position in a couple years.

**TL;DR**: I’m trying to decide between continuing in tech or pivoting to public interest law (with a full-ride law school offer). Have you made a similar transition—or considered one? What’s your take on the future of software, the realities of law, or finding meaning in work? I’d appreciate any honest advice or sage advice you can offer. 

I'm not sure how to make this decision at this point besides just going with my gut?",mouse_rising,2,1.0,3,1747752999,2025-05-20 14:56:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kr6xu9/midcareer_shift_from_software_engineering_to/,5,2025
1kr6gyc,Accept job in another industry or wait for company to present role verbally discussed? (Potential layoff),"When I first started looking for work around 5 years ago, the healthcare industry was doing well and so there was a lot to choose from. However, now there is almost an absence of healthcare business analyst roles. 

And unfortunately due to budget cuts, my manager informed me I may be let go but this is still in discussions in the background on if and when this would happen. She also told me, she had me in mind for another role and thinks I may be able to get shifted onto another project to keep me employed here. However, that team needs to draft the job description and get approvals. Then again, this is all word of mouth and may not actually happen (this was communicated to me 3 weeks ago). 

So instead of waiting around for something that may not happen, I've been sending out applications to any role that is remotely a business analyst role. There has only been a handful of healthcare ones and I have only gotten interview requests from fashion companies. 

Should I wait it out or just jump ship into another industry (given the limited jobs)?

Being in my 20’s I went where I could make a living. I worked my way up from being a runner and lighting assistant to eventually directing and being a DOP for big brands.

1kr566e,"Overworked, underappreciated. Please help!!!","So i’ve worked at my current position for just over 2 years. I work for a small pharmacy, with about 15 coworkers (all of whom are part time barring 1 other lady). During my time there, I have completed lots of training in my own time (which everyone else is now getting paid study time for), and have taken on several responsibilities -stock management/ordering, service lead (paperwork, promotion, implementation etc.) and more, as well as promoting exceptional customer service, and being generally one of the fastest/efficient/accurate dispensers. I worked very hard to achieve everything that I have, and have flown past members of staff who have worked there for 10-15 years in terms of responsibilities and knowledge. 

A few months ago, my boss decided he was going to have somebody new come in and ‘run the dispensary’, which I was a bit unhappy about as this was something I’d basically already been doing, and I have previous supervisor experience but wasn’t even considered for the role. Since the girl has joined the team (nearly a year ago now), she hasn’t progressed her customer service skills very well at all, ignoring customers in the shop and not answering the phone when other members of staff are busy. Despite her being the ‘team leader’, the whole team still relies on me and my knowledge heavily (both her and the pharmacist included) and I am constantly barraged with questions, being asked for help, asked how to do this/that etc. Every time we have a new member of staff join the team she expects me to train them. The team still come to me with problems or grievances, and ask me what I would like them to do (and yes i’ve tried the whole ‘ask the supervisor’). Every time I go on Annual Leave the whole place seems to collapse, and my work is never covered -even cleaning duties are neglected because I seem to be the only one that does these. I have addressed this with my boss before, and he says he will sort it but never does. The last time I went to him, he told me I should be talking to the supervisor -I told him I already had, on 3 occasions and nothing had been done, to which he said he would ‘speak to her’ and guess what? Nothing was done.

Despite this, I do love where I work. I love my team, the patients, the environment and there are positives. But I am doing all of this, for the same wage as everybody else (some of whom, their only responsibility is to come in and serve in the shop/answer the phone, or dispense), and receive no real recognition or gratitude for everything I do. I really don’t want to leave, I just want to be appreciated/compensated for how hard I work, but a family member told me that if I’m going to ask for a raise I have to be prepared to leave -and I don’t know if I am. 

What do I do? Ask for a raise? Leave? I have no idea and it’s causing me so much stress. I don’t know if this is relevant, but I also have ADHD which my boss basically refuses to acknowledge because he doesn’t want it to ‘hold me back’ (I swear he is actually a nice, decent guy he just comes out with bizarre things). Because of my ADHD pharmacy has become an extreme passion of mine and plays a big role in my life.

1kr5398,Waisted worth- a degree that means nothing,"I have a doctorate in podiatric medicine, but most days, it doesn’t feel like it means anything. I carry the weight of intense medical training—deep knowledge of anatomy, pathology, pharmacology, surgery—and yet, I constantly feel like I’m not seen as a real doctor. It’s like the world doesn’t recognize the depth of what I’ve learned or the value of what I can offer. That invisibility has slowly eroded my self-esteem. I worked so hard to earn this degree, thinking it would open doors, give me a purpose, and let me make a difference. But instead, it’s left me feeling stuck and forgotten.

What hurts even more is the realization that I feel boxed in. Outside of podiatry, it’s as if my degree means nothing—like I have a trade certification instead of a doctorate. There’s no clear path forward if podiatry doesn’t work out. I feel like I invested everything into something that the world doesn’t really respect or understand, and now I’m left wondering who I am without it. That loss of identity… it cuts deep.

I currently make $135k base with a 10–20% bonus, and I work fully remote. It’s a small team, so I wear a lot of hats, including:

•	Designing and maintaining ETL pipelines

•	Product management and roadmap planning

•	Pre- and post-sales solution architecture

•	Ad hoc SQL and technical problem-solving

•	Implementation consulting and client onboarding

I really enjoy solving hard workflow problems, writing SQL, thinking through product ideas, and working closely with sales on technical solutions. I’m less excited about project management or operations-heavy tasks.

I should also add that I feel really valued at my company, and I genuinely like and respect my boss. It’s a supportive environment, even if the business side has been shaky. I’m not in a rush to leave, but I want to understand what opportunities are out there that better align with the work I enjoy and could help me grow my career and compensation long-term.

Roles I’ve considered:

•	Solutions Engineer / Sales Engineer

•	Product Manager at a larger or more stable company

•	Analytics / BI roles (though I’m not a traditional data analyst)

I’d love any advice on:

•	What kinds of roles or career paths I should be targeting

•	How to position my experience on a resume

•	What are realistic comp expectations?

I’m feeling pretty lost in my career path and could really use some perspective. I recently had my first baby, which has made me more motivated than ever to find a role that offers better long-term growth and financial stability.

Currently, I’m working in Recruitment with HR but my academic background is actually in finance. 

I have:
	•	An Associate’s in Business Management
	•	A Bachelor’s in International Business
	•	An MBA in International Finance

Despite that, I’ve never actually held a finance-specific role. The closest I’ve come is working in a bank setting, but not in a finance analyst or similar capacity. Now I’m wondering if it’s too late to pivot — am I only qualified for entry-level finance positions (like analyst roles)? Or could my degrees and work experience (even if not directly in finance) open the door to something mid-level?

I’m struggling with feeling like I invested a lot in my education and haven’t really been able to use it the way I hoped. I want to build a future for my family, and ideally be in a role where my hard work and education can really pay off. But I’m unsure of where to start or how to position myself for a transition.

Any advice or encouragement would mean a lot — especially if you’ve made a career pivot like this yourself.

1kr04cj,I got let go for not going above and beyond for minimum wage and I don't know what to do,"Long vent ahead:

I worked for a small e-commerce company in marketing, and I was completely on my own — handling social media, graphic design, video content, website updates, Meta and Google Ads, and even some administrative tasks. There was a lot on my plate.

I know I agreed to the salary at the beginning, but I was desperate for a job at the time. I had bills to pay and no real leverage to negotiate. I also fell for the classic line: ""There will be a pay increase later based on performance.""

Before me, they had someone in this role for three years, from the very beginning of the company. When I started, it felt like they expected me to instantly perform at the same level — even though I obviously needed time to adjust. I did my best with the information I was given, but I was very aware that I was significantly underpaid for the amount and type of work I was doing. Over time, that really wore down my motivation.

I did what I was asked to do, but I didn’t go above and beyond by, say, filming high-end videos, researching competitors in depth, or guessing the company’s priorities — especially since the boss was often too busy to give me clear direction. The previous person apparently got used to guessing correctly, but I didn’t always know what was expected beyond what I was told to do.

Today, I was told that I take too long to finish projects, that I’m not good enough, and that they already have someone lined up to replace me. That really hurt. The truth is, I kind of liked working there despite everything I’ve just described. I was hoping to at least stay until the end of my contract (which ends in four months), but now that’s clearly not happening.

I haven’t signed anything yet, and I don’t intend to screw myself over further with some agreement that leaves me broke for the summer.

I know I didn’t go ""above and beyond,"" and maybe some would say I was ""quiet quitting,"" but I really don’t think I was that bad. I completed all tasks I was given — I just didn’t overextend myself without proper support or compensation. Now I’m being pushed aside for someone else, and I don’t know what to do or how to handle it.

I graduated from a Tier 3 college with a B.Tech in CS and landed an MNC job through campus placement—typical mass hiring stuff. After some Java training, I got placed in a backend project, but honestly didn’t get much exposure (pretty common in these big companies). Then, due to some business issues, I was put on the bench, and I’ve been there for around 6-7 months now.

During this time, I picked up a few things—Spring Boot, microservices, Spring Batch, ActiveMQ, etc.—but I didn’t give it my full effort. I’ve been trying to clear internal interviews but struggling. I’ve technically been working for 1.5 years, but it feels like my real skill level is way behind that.

Now I’ve finally been moved into a support project, and the team says there’s barely any coding involved. On top of that, it’s not even Java—it’s in some legacy language called Progress.

To be honest, I’ve become so reliant on AI tools that I feel like I’ve forgotten how to code on my own. I want to start rebuilding my skills from scratch. But now I’m also wondering—is Java backend still the right path for me? Or should I explore something totally different?

I know the first 3–5 years of a career often shape what direction we go in long term, and that’s what has me confused and worried.

If anyone has been through something similar or has any advice, I’d genuinely appreciate it. Thanks in advance!

1kqwszo,Need help getting over the job offer I didn’t take,"I was recently offered a job at a tech company. I wasn’t really unhappy at my current job, I just thought there could be something more exciting out there for me. Something where I would grow more and have more mentorship. 

The job offer I got was great - higher salary and looked like a social and fun office. But…..the company seemed pretty unstable. They have had several CEOs in the last five years, have lost money consistently over the past 2 years, has laid off 30% of their employees over the past 2 years, and their stock is at an all time low. They kept telling me that this is their growth period and things are looking really promising, but I just wasn’t comfortable given the economy and possible recession. Even though the work seemed interesting. 

My current company actually counter-offered and promoted me and gave me the same salary as the tech company. I have a good manager and it’s not a super high stress environment and is very stable. I should be nothing but grateful, but I’m still sad - I feel like maybe I made the wrong choice. I think a new energy and mission would really help inspire me and get me out of my funk. I feel like I just turned down a great opportunity and it feels bad. How can I get over this opportunity that I declined?

I had asked my manager for general feedback on how I’m doing work wise, this wasn’t a check in or review, just something I wanted to know because I wanna make sure I’m continuing to be the best I can at my work. There was a lot of valid feedback, and some accountability in areas that I agree I can improve. They mentioned I was underperforming in some areas and not meeting their standards, but they won’t hold it against me because we’d never had this talk before or touched these topics. Again I asked on how I was doing, I’m not in trouble, and nobody has really mentioned it else where on my work - so it was a little bit of a surprise but I wanna make sure I’m being proactive in improving.

1kqss59,How to ask for a raise? After 3 months?,"Hello! Today my boss asked me to move positions on my team. I’ve been on the team since early February (4 months at the start of June). It would be a lateral move and very similar to what I am doing now (title is the same just ______ of ____region) I’d be working with a different region & have slightly more clients (going from 29 to 35). I work remotely with some travel now. With this move, I expect to travel slightly more (per the gal that was in the role before me. She traveled about 1-2x per month sometimes where I was projected to travel maybe 2x between now & the end of 2025). 

The reason my boss is asking me to move to this role: she said I have more experience that aligns with this role & region and the “pool” to fill the position isn’t great (I’m assuming they’ve maybe found someone to fill my role who doesn’t want to move). Traditionally, you live in the region you work in. Since I’m in my region now, they said that since I’m literally on the boarder of regions, they won’t ask me to move (if I want, I can though).

The biggest thing that is holding me from not switching my region is the fact I just spent 3+ months building relationships & partnerships and have been working my butt off to fill vacancies in my team. I just don’t want my hard work to go to waste. 

I guess my questions are:
1. Should I even ask for a raise? 
2. If yes, how do I do that without seeming like I’m just going to do it for the money?

1kqsq46,f30 advice for career,"For context, I grew up in New Jersey until I was 20 years old. My family moved down to a Florida town, I wound up finishing college there, getting a job with a global company and have been with them ever since. I'm in an account manager role making over 6 figures.

  
When I was 28 I moved back to NJ to be with a boy that I had met through work but coincidentally he lived in the area I grew up in, which made it a no brainer to take a chance and move back up to NJ. I wound up getting a promotion within the same company which made it also very easy. As you could expect, he and I broke up. I still live in NJ and work for the same company. Just very much so burnt out from sales and feeling like I have golden handcuffs because of the money. 

  
After 7 months of a terrible break up, I've settled into life still in NJ and was introduced to my friends cousin and we hit it off. I grew up with his cousin, know his family, and really enjoy spending time with him. While at the same time, I've been recruited to come back down to Florida to take a job at the same company, no quota, and will get me a different experience/skills for my resume while still making 6 figures. This job is really similar to a rotational where they like to keep you in the role for 1.5-2.5 years and provide additional opportunities after that time.

I have this idea in my mind that I'm 30 and I very much so want a family and to settle down but also really enjoy having a stable job where I don't have to worry about money and am very fearful of the job market right now. 

My options are:

\- Stay up in NJ, ride out my current role and eventually find a new organization to work for, likely still in sales. With this option I could really give this new relationship a chance. But I risk burn out and potentially not having a great year in sales. 

\- Move back down to Florida, get this new experience, potentially do long distance, and after the 1.5-2.5 years are up  figure it out from there.



I know this job offer is great, and I'm generally in a good position compared to my peers, however, I feel so torn between my options. It feels like just as I started seeing this man, I was presented this opportunity and now have to pick between the two.

Recently I left my first-ever job, which not only **destroyed my hands** (literally) but also **my mind**. I cry every day before bed because of it.

I always thought that I wanted to work with art/illustration for movie and game studios, but now I am **afraid** of even thinking about it. What would I even work with?

1kqr3s3,Should I sacrifice stability to improve my mental health?,"TL;DR: my company keeps moving the goalposts on me. I have to be four days in office to “collaborate” with no one. Should I try to leave good money and stability?


I’m currently a “Senior Project Manager”, which is just a glorified senior analyst title. I’ve been at my company, a large regional bank, for almost 3 years now. The first two were in an area where the director had no idea what he was doing, and I had no opportunity or meaningful work (they hired me to do Tableau but insisted on remaining in SAS and not using Tableau…). No raises, no bonus, no help for conferences that I want to go to. I also started that role remote, but got called back hybrid, though luckily I’m only 5 actual minutes from the office.

Last year, I had enough and finally got a new role. I was between 2 roles, one was a pay grade higher, but required a commute to big city downtown. The other was a pay grade lower and was remote. I went with the remote role because that is something very valuable to me. The entirety of my team is in different states. I am the only person in my state.

This role has been really good so far. I’m actually doing work I enjoy, I got a raise despite the new hire timing, and I got a (though prorated) **real** bonus for the first time. I also think this is a very stable role as my team/department is a direct money maker. Back in February I got sent hybrid, AGAIN. This time, though, my larger organization (subset within the bank) is assigned to a different office—I now drive 30 minutes to be the only person on my team in this office, and I drive past the earlier-mentioned office that is 5 minutes from home. I’ve asked my boss, who is in another state, about a transfer (not even remote), to the other office, but they won’t budge.

On Friday, our CEO sent an email that since RTO was implemented they saw “immediate financial and cultural results” and so he is increasing us to 4 days in office starting September.

I’m at my whit’s end with the moving goalposts and bullshit “collaboration” that doesn’t even happen. It’s been crippling my mental health and destroying my work-life balance.

Which brings me to my dilemma. Do I stay at an otherwise good and stable job that is draining me, or should I attempt to jump ship in a volatile market and economy? I know there are pros/cons to both sides, and that only I can make this decision, but I just feel stuck, overwhelmed, and downtrodden with it all.

1kqqvuy,"I’m halfway through my architecture degree, but I’m falling apart — is it okay to walk away?","Hi everyone, I hope you’re doing well. 
I’m 22, living in Bangladesh, and currently halfway through my architecture degree. On paper, everything seems fine. I have a CGPA of 3.6, I’ve never gotten below a B+ in design studios, and I’m genuinely passionate about architecture. I’ve poured my heart and soul into it for the past 2.5 years.

But behind the scenes, I’m struggling — really struggling.

From the very beginning, our department makes it clear: architecture has to be your everything. Your work must always come first. And because the workload is so intense, it becomes nearly impossible to put yourself or your health first. Over time, I internalized this and I started believing that it was normal to sacrifice everything else just to keep up.

Every semester, I push myself beyond my limit, losing sleep, skipping meals, isolating from friends, and spiraling into cycles of anxiety and breakdowns, especially around studio deadlines. I struggle with anxiety in general, and this environment has only worsened it. The emotional toll is relentless. The physical effects have been just as bad. I’ve fallen sick almost every semester from the stress, and it’s beginning to wear me down.

Still, I always told myself, “Next semester, I’ll do better.” But that “better” never really comes.

This semester, things got so bad that I dropped out midway. And for the first time, I felt the illusion break. I started questioning everything. Do I really want to spend the next 2.5 years feeling like I’m barely surviving? Even if I finish this degree, at what cost?

I’ve recently been thinking about switching majors. The idea of a career with more structure and maybe better work-life balance feels… hopeful.

But at the same time, I’m terrified.

In my household, switching degrees halfway is really frowned upon. It took a lot for my family to understand, and even now, everyone’s upset. I’m scared people will think I’m flaky or weak — the girl who couldn’t handle it. And what if they’re right? What if I’m just running away?

Architecture has been such a huge part of my identity. The people, the culture, the pride — it’s hard to imagine walking away from it. But deep down, something doesn’t feel right anymore. And I’m tired of pretending that this constant suffering is normal.

At the same time, I just can’t bring myself to give up on the dreams I had when I first chose to study architecture. I feel like the last 2.5 years of hard work will go to waste. I absolutely love the work, but I hate this system. 

I’ve also been thinking ahead about my future plans. I hope to pursue a Master’s degree abroad — ideally in the USA, Canada, or the UK. If I do choose to stay in architecture, I’m curious about what the career path might look like in those countries. Would it be worth it in the long run, both in terms of opportunities and work-life balance?

So I’m here, hoping someone has been through something similar.

1kqq70x,1:1 with HR *after* being laid off - what do I ask?,"TLDR - I got laid off and HR offered a 1:1 call. I’d like to take the opportunity, but I’m not sure what to actually do with it!

TIA for any advice or insights - I was laid off as part of a restructuring 4 days ago. I have been laid off before and am familiar with most of the steps in the process. I’ve already reviewed my personal finances, started working on my LinkedIn/resumes/etc, and have started pursuing unemployment. As part of the layoff call, they offered direct 1:1s with HR if requested.

I’d like to take them up on the offer as I’m not really in a position to turn any support down. However… I don’t really know what to do with that time, what questions to ask, or what value it would bring me. I already have very clear answers to next steps which is what most resources online suggest (e.g., severance, COBRA, unemployment, etc). Any questions I genuinely have are unlikely to be answered such as why I was chosen, the company’s next steps, and how they’ll navigate further uncertainty. I see many recommend using this time to negotiate severance, but with the company doing layoffs for financial reasons and little luck historically for people to negotiate salary here, I don’t think this is a fruitful venture (will still try tho, trust me).

Do I just cancel the call? Do I ask the questions they won’t answer anyway? What would you ask if you could go back? ",kaiteb78108,8,1.0,8,1747696477,2025-05-19 23:14:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kqq70x/11_with_hr_after_being_laid_off_what_do_i_ask/,5,2025
1kqprx1,Salary Negotiation for Internal Promotion?,"I have been with my current company for almost 5 years now, there was an interim in between where I left for 13 months to try a different industry and they invited me back. I started in product development engineering as a new grad and now am a Key Account Manager (sales).

My current manager is a Sales Director and handles two accounts, under each account there are three Key Account Managers (6 direct reports total). I am currently under Account A as a Level I, my base salary is $118,810. Last week, a Level I salesperson left under Account B. When I was an engineer, I covered both Account A and Account B for some time and today I got a call today asking if I'd like to move to Account B given my history and skill set. This would come with a promotion to Level II at $128,000.

I was told if I remain with Account A, I would not be promoted, at least not soon. This is understandable as with Account A, we are their primary supplier so there is not a lot of room for remarkable sales growth which is a metric we are measured against. Also, there is another salesperson on the team who is a Level II already but has been there for 4-6 years. Likely, they would need to promote her before ever promoting me. They are a larger account but privately held and operate in North America.

With Account B, they are technically a smaller account, but they have a more global presence and they are publicly traded and have a strong foothold in Canada/UK. I'd go from covering 3 customer sites in Account A to covering 10 customer sites. This role would likely come with more autonomy/ownership as Account A is so large, there are a lot more key players that decision-making on the individual level can be diluted.

I will be moving roles, I've decided that much. What I'm struggling with is what/how to negotiate. I do not have a car now as I primarily fly to my customer sites and that would not change. However, the previous salesperson did have a car so I am coming at a lower benefit cost to the company. The issue is, the person who left was making $99,300 as a Level I. I know another salesperson within the organization (but different account) is making $128,500 as a Level II. Therefore, I don't think their offer is completely out of line with their standards but I'm wondering if a 7.74% raise is enough for this internal promotion. In the transition period, I'd start to be involved in Account B while supporting Account A until a replacement is found. In addition, I would no longer be eligible for a merit increase in October (and the next one would be October 2026). Typically, these are around 3% on average which would land me at $122,374 which makes the promotion only a 4.6% increase. They said in 6 months there would be a salary reevaluation based on relationships/growth opportunities which is very broad and I'd need to understand better the metrics I'd be measured against. Therefore, I will not be holding my breath on that...

Any advice on how to handle this? Negotiate and to what regard?

I really don’t want to be stuck job hunting in another few months and I also really need health insurance.

1kqovp6,The complete beginner course to digital marketing,"If you’ve ever said:
“I want to make money online but I have no idea where to start…”
Same. That was me just a few months ago.

I found myself spending hours on YouTube and TikTok trying to piece together strategies — and getting nowhere.

That’s when I found DWA (Digital Wealth Academy). It’s a complete beginner course that teaches everything about starting and growing an online business through digital marketing — and you don’t need to show your face or have any experience.

Here’s what’s inside:

How to pick a profitable niche

Setting up your digital marketing systems (step-by-step)

How to sell digital products or affiliate offers

Building faceless content that converts

Full tech support (you don’t need to be “good with computers”)

Access to a supportive community of other beginners

I promote this course myself because it’s the only one I’ve found that doesn’t leave beginners confused and overwhelmed. It’s helped me actually start — not just think about starting.

1kqmtar,How can I pivot from a business analyst to financial analyst ?,"Hi guys,

I’m been pondering deeply on something that more often than not surfaces and that is to switch careers. I’m in the tech space as a business analyst with around 5YOE, but my interests lay more in the finance space. 

I know it is 2 different worlds apart, but I do somewhat have minute entry level finance and investment knowledge. 
I’d eventually want to take up professional finance courses and qualifications to up skill.
You might wonder why I want to switch? Firstly, I find my calling more toward the financial field. Secondly, business analyst pay isn’t the greatest unless you’re at a top notch firm. Thirdly, the barrier to entry to become a business analyst is extremely low - I’ve seen companies hire any Tom dick and Harry with no formal qualification or business analysis experience, as a business analyst (usually starting them at a junior level). This worries me as now the market could adjust and just flood BA roles, which in turn would drive salaries down or stagnate. I’ve seen people who were previously recruiters or even call center agents get BA roles because they know management or served a tenure at company - this is very threatening to a certified/qualified BA as myself.

What is the best way to pivot my career into finance given that I’m already an intermediate profession? How can I go about approaching this at my current company? Do you think there’s good scope in the finance field (financial wise)?

Current contract role: 
pros 
- specialized security engineer role- overall long term desired career goals
- higher pay and job outlook 
- potential hired-on permanent after 1 year and if so- high paying field. (currently few months into) 
- easy work, wanted someone more junior like me 
- if stay for full contract length; since more technical, can learn highly demand security skills to pivot to another employer

cons
- (strongest con) long commute with RTO 5x in office - could get caught for not fully abiding
- limited structure for new grads, feeling like i’m under performing
- no training opportunities like FTE employees are offered
- contract role - can fire anytime but position is needed and directly related to company’s profit


FTE role:
pros 
- stability and job security 
- FTE - not treated as a second-tier employee
- more structure for someone early on in career. designated mentor etc
- great work culture and can grow within company
- mostly remote with only 1x a week in office
- benefits - insurance, 401k, and PTO 
- potential cybersecurity audit rotation after 2 years 

cons 
- starting immediately in 1 year rotation in my non- desirable field + less technical 
- lower pay but almost comparable when factoring commute, benefits, less taxes
- 3 year rotation is a bit long for a new grad like me with some experience (2.5 years in IT) 
- overall less technical rotations. only interested in 1 rotation
- may not get cybersecurity rotation and will waste time by not being in desired industry",Flat_Debate4809,1,1.0,0,1747687151,2025-05-19 20:39:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kqmjgx/should_i_leave_or_stay_at_my_contract_and_take_a/,5,2025

1kql108,"Only have an associate’s degree, not sure how to find a comparable job","
I’m completely lost and totally unsure what to do. I want to leave my company but I feel stuck. Here’s a little background. 
I started with my company (a big name non-profit retirement community) when I was 16. I served tables in a formal dining room. I had a lot of family issues happen between ages 17-20 that, in addition to just being a lazy kid, I decided not to finish college after my first year of technical college. I continued working in culinary until I transferred to sales 4 years ago. I met with the sales consultant who advised that I finish my associate’s degree. Before my transition to sales, I finished the last year needed for my degree. A bachelor’s was technically required for my position, but having made so many relationships within, they were happy with the associate’s degree. 

I really enjoyed working in sales. The goal, as expressed by management, was that I would take over the sales department once my trainer retired. The community was small enough that it should have been easy to manage. To make a very, very long story short, I was instead transferred to a larger community in a different state, about an hour away. 

I’ve been here the last three years, and I’ve come to hate clocking in everyday. The community isn’t nearly as friendly, my coworker who has been so toxic has just accepted a promotion to become my direct manager, the other departments on campus really do not like the sales department, and management has made it clear that I won’t be able to transfer back to the original community. The list goes on why I want to leave. 
The problem is I make decent money at 29 years old with only an associates degree, between $90k-110k yearly based on the number of sales made. I feel that if I leave, I wouldn’t be able to accept another job making comparable money because of my lack of education. I also have come to hate sales, I could probably apply for more sales positions but I’m really not interested in that type of work anymore. 

What can I do? Are there well paying jobs/employers who wouldn’t mind an associate’s degree? Of course I understand starting with a new company means I might have to start at the bottom again and work my way up, but I can’t go from $100k a year to something like $35k. I also have no idea what type of work I’d rather do instead. The drawback of being with one company so long is that I have little experience with other types of jobs or work. 
My biggest regret is not going to college and I’ve put myself in such a box. I’d love to go back for a bachelor’s at some point, but I can’t stay at this job for two more years while I finish my degree. 

Tldr; I have only an associates degree and I don’t know how/if I can leave my $100k a year job that I’ve come to despise and still make decent money.

This is too much. We need one universal, standardized platform. Or just go back to email attachments to HR. What was wrong with that? 

What do HR people do anymore if all these platforms use Ai to score you? Only to then get a call screener before you can even be invited to an interview with HR. 

Corporate America is intolerable and nauseating. Why should any human be subjected to this treatment in order to make a living? 

That is what we are doing really, isn't it? Finding methods that make it POSSIBLE to PAY for LIVING. ",shamalammading,3,1.0,1,1747682918,2025-05-19 19:28:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kqkqtg/too_many_job_application_platforms_a_practice_in/,5,2025
1kqkc37,"Laid off unexpectedly after years of loyalty – need advice on next steps (Recruitment Manager, 8 YOE, India)","Hey Reddit,

So… I just got laid off, and I could really use your advice on how to navigate this situation smartly and peacefully.

**Context:**

* I’ve been working in the **staffing/recruitment industry** for 8 years, currently as a **Recruitment Manager**.
* **CTC: ₹12 LPA**, which hasn’t increased in 2 years despite high performance.
* Last year, my team delivered **100% growth** over the previous year, but I was given less than **1 month’s salary as a bonus**.
* I consistently worked **11–12 hours a day**, sacrificing work-life balance. Recently, I started setting boundaries (leaving on time, taking breaks), which led to accusations that I’m ""losing interest.""

**Toxic environment:**

* My boss is difficult to work with — **rude, manipulative, and constantly shifting blame**. He’s pressured me to compensate for other teams’ failures.
* Despite building the team and processes from scratch, I was **denied a promotion**. Instead, they **hired a new Sr. Manager above me**, and I was made to report to him instead of the VP (whom I previously reported to).
* They also **started hiring more people despite no business inflow**, which felt odd.

**The layoff:**

* Last Friday, I was **informed I’m being let go** because they “can’t afford” me and think I’m “too expensive.”
* I was **offered 1 to 1.5 months** to find a new job (my notice period is 3 months).
* They **won’t assign me to any team or project** during this period.
* They mentioned giving me a **5% hike (finally)** but only in the **full and final settlement**.
* No prior indication was given — no performance warnings, no PIP, no real feedback.
* All communication is coming from the new manager; my original boss is avoiding me and being passive-aggressive.

I’ve taken Monday off to process this and plan to go in tomorrow to discuss terms.

**My questions:**

1. **Should I resign peacefully and move on quietly?**
2. **Can I push for severance, or is that rare in India?**
3. **Is it worth getting legal help here?**
4. **How do I manage the upcoming job search with a potential gap and current market slump in recruitment?**

I don’t want to burn bridges, but I also don’t want to be taken for granted after giving so much. I’m worried about how this gap might look on my resume and how long it might take to find a new role in the current market.

Any advice, guidance, or similar experiences would help. Thanks in advance.",Deranged_hermit_zero,2,1.0,1,1747681974,2025-05-19 19:12:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kqkc37/laid_off_unexpectedly_after_years_of_loyalty_need/,5,2025
1kqjlgy,"Final year student with low WAM and no experience, how to bag an entry-level job?","Hi everyone,

I’m currently in my final year of an actuarial science degree with a 61.42 weighted average mark (unfortunately a few unintentional fails ruined my scores). ALL I WANT is to land an entry-level role in ANY related finance or data field. Does not have to be actuarial, I am open to any kind of role be it a financial analyst, credit risk analyst, data analyst, business analyst, management consultant, you get the gist. Literally anything along those lines, a position that my degree is somewhat relevant to.

However as I mentioned, I have a low WAM (weighted average mark) and no prior work experience or internships, which I see as a quite difficult hurdle to overcome. As far as it currently goes, I've been rejected by nearly every graduate program/internship I have applied for, right after the online assessment stage. I've managed to to get to the penultimate stage of one graduate program, a government one (it had easier requirements).

I’ve been studying hard and I’m committed to building the skills needed, but I’m not sure how to stand out or improve my chances given my academic record and lack of experience.

If anyone here has been in a similar situation or has advice on how to approach job hunting, networking, or what employers really look for beyond grades, I’d really appreciate your insights. Also open to tips on improving my resume and cover letter. I am based in Australia.

1kqiuuv,Is this role change a sidestepm,"So, I've been with this IT infrastructure company since February last year, starting in support and then moving into Account Management around January this year. Things have been a bit up in the air since my boss left about five weeks ago – never even had a probation chat with him. Then today, during my probation review, they dropped the news that they're reshuffling the team, and I've been offered this Business Development Coordinator role.

Basically, I'll be looking after contract renewals, sorting out any disputes, and trying to find ways to sell more to our current customers. My only other colleague in Account Management? He'll be the one handling all the hardware orders and getting quotes out. Before, we both did a bit of everything – finding new leads, putting together contracts, and managing projects. Now it sounds like they're splitting those tasks right down the middle.
Honestly, I'm a bit worried this might be a step back for my career.

The thing is, the contract side of things has been kind of neglected for a while, so I get that it could be really good for the company. And to be fair, having the freedom to set up the processes and get it all organized actually appeals to me – I was never really the hardcore sales type anyway.

What bugs me though is that management calls were a big deal in the AM department. I was making them all the time, whereas my colleague hardly made any, always saying he was swamped with quotes. It feels a bit unfair, like I'm being moved into this role because I just did what I was told, not what I actually enjoyed doing (which is what he got to focus on).

Plus, I'm also thinking about my CV. Will 'Business Development Coordinator' look as good as 'Account Manager'? I was even planning on getting a project management qualification.

They did mention that it'll be easier to track success in this new role, and there might be some internal projects down the line, but it sounded a bit vague.

So, being straight up, does going from Account Manager to Business Development Coordinator sound like a downgrade, or will it not look as good on my resume?

1kqil6b,"2-Year Gap, Need Help Choosing Between IAQS (Actuarial Science), BMS Capital Markets (BSE), or NMIMS BSc Finance for Singapore WM/Mumbai IB","**Background:**  
Hi everyone! I’m 20 and finally starting college after a **2-year gap** (personal reasons). I’m torn between three programs and need advice to align my choice with long-term goals in **Singapore Wealth Management (WM)** or **Mumbai Investment Banking (IB)**. Here’s my shortlist:

1. **BSc Actuarial & Quantitative Science (IAQS)**:
   * *Pros*: Heavy quant focus (Python/R, risk modeling, Bloomberg), actuarial exams prep.
   * *Cons*: Less ""core finance"" (no M&A, FX, or IB technicals).
2. **BMS Capital Markets (BSE Institute)**:
   * *Pros*: Practical finance (derivatives, M&A, compliance), BSE industry links.
   * *Cons*: Light on coding/advanced analytics.
3. **BSc Finance (NMIMS Mumbai)**:
   * *Pros*: NMIMS brand, broad finance curriculum.
   * *Cons*: Generic syllabus; needs self-upskilling for WM/IB.

**My Goals:**

* **Singapore WM**: Interested in structured products, portfolio analytics, or family offices.
* **Mumbai IB**: Open to boutique IB roles (M&A, ECM) if WM doesn’t pan out.

**Key Questions:**

1. **Career Alignment**:
   * For **Singapore WM**, is IAQS’s quant edge (Python, risk models) more valuable than BMS CM’s finance focus?
   * For **Mumbai IB**, does BMS CM’s capital markets curriculum outweigh IAQS’s lack of IB technicals (DCF, pitch books)?
2. **Placements & Gap Impact**:
   * How do placements at these colleges fare for WM/IB roles? Will a 2-year gap hurt my chances?
   * Does NMIMS’s brand compensate for its generic syllabus vs. BSE’s niche focus?
3. **Further Studies**:
   * If I pick IAQS, can I pivot to WM via SMU’s MS in Wealth Management?
   * If I choose BMS CM, will an MBA later (ISB/SPJIMR) help break into IB?
4. **Skill Gaps**:
   * For IAQS: How do I build client-facing skills (critical for WM) alongside quant rigor?
   * For BMS CM/NMIMS: Should I grind Python/CFA Level 1 alongside college?

**What I’ve Learned So Far**:

* *IAQS*: Strong for WM structuring roles but risky for IB.
* *BMS CM*: Better for Mumbai IB but weaker for global WM.
* *NMIMS*: Safe choice but requires hustling for niche roles.

**Ask**:

* **Singapore WM Professionals**: Do actuaries/quants have an edge in WM, or is core finance preferred?
* **Mumbai IB Analysts**: Does BSE’s BMS CM have a pipeline to boutiques like Ambit/Avendus?
* **IAQS/NMIMS Alumni**: How did your program’s syllabus impact internships/placements?
* **Gap Year Students**: How did you address the gap in interviews/applications?

**Priority**: Minimizing risk while keeping doors open for WM/IB. Open to certifications (CFA, FRM) and internships.

Because market was really f*cked up I got job this year at very less pay as an Associate consultant. I am planning to do an MS from either of the following places US, UK, EU. I am more inclined towards marketing as a career. 
My BG: B.com in Accounting and Finance (3 year), PGDBM (1 year), MBA in International Bsiness (2 year).

Now my query:
Is it worth pursuing MS in marketing? Does it help in getting a good pay job (given present market conditions)
If yes, which colleges are the best in terms of education, brand value and ofc high paying salary. 
If not, which other course I should pursue to get better salary. 
I may not go in finance field because my MBA wasn't in finance and I don't wish to do any certification related to this field CFA, CPA etc
I am not interested in Analytics field because not good with numbers. HR is out of question (because no education in this field). 
Supply chain not interested hence marketing.

To add to this I am very knowledgeable in the space and the product really sucks making it harder to sell and potentially impacting my personal brand. I also find the role really unchallenging. I don't really have any chance to flex my brain at all in the role.

One saving grace of this role could have been the role out of a new product which I would love to lean into but this is being massively gate kept by the product manager. Noting on this that he has zero knowledge on the product and if I were to leave now the product would go no further.

I'd love to know people's thoughts, do I just start applying for new roles, suck it up for a bit or maybe try speaking to my manager? Massive pros of the role are that it is super flexible which really suits me.",Lou_91,2,1.0,1,1747669405,2025-05-19 15:43:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kqey2e/i_want_to_leave_my_job_6_weeks_in_advice_needed/,5,2025
1kqenzg,Joining the rest of the job market after 3 decades,"It seems my overdeveloped sense of loyalty has kept me bound to one employer for so long that I have spent almost 30 years working for just one organization. I have some questions regarding cold-calls, and ChatGPT if anyone is willing to offer their opinion.

First, some context: There were rewards for my career, but in the end, I find myself forced into early semi-retirement and back into the job market. I am VERY good at what I do but have little to no collegiate paperwork and tons of field experience and military experience both relevant to my field in construction and facilities management.

I truly don't need much to supplement and manage a meager life, even supporting my daughter and grandson whom I rescued from an abusive marriage recently. However, I want to work for someone I WANT to work for rather than am required to work for to support my family for once or at least one with no stress, so I am being perhaps overly selective in my application submittals.

Having said that, I have been unsuccessful in catching the eye of the company I have been applying to thus far. I have now begun cold contacting members of that company through Linked In. The last time I was looking for employment, over 30 years ago, this was the norm by walking into the office and arranging meetings. Are cold contacts through Linked In the same avenue? Is there a better way? Are there reasons I should not be sending these sorts of messages directly to the HR recruiting division for engineering of that company?

GPT? I have begun teaching myself how to use it. seems intuitive. Been using it much like the Pirate code, Taking what it offers as guidelines then refining it myself. My questions are whether one is better than the other e.g. GRONK vs. CHAT, and whether the subscription is truly worth it?",Great-Stranger-7690,2,1.0,4,1747668724,2025-05-19 15:32:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kqenzg/joining_the_rest_of_the_job_market_after_3_decades/,5,2025

1kqe84t,The choice between living abroad and a proper career,"From 2019 to 2023, I studied Spanish, Catalan and Japanese at university in the UK. During my year abroad (2021–22), I spent time in both Barcelona and Tokyo. I became very attached to Barcelona—partly due to a relationship and job offers nearby—but ultimately decided to return to the UK for my final year. Tokyo was more difficult; I struggled with homesickness, didn’t enjoy where I was living, and often compared it unfavourably to my time in Spain.

After graduating, I returned abroad to give both countries another chance. I worked as an English language assistant in Madrid (Sept 2023 – July 2024) and then in rural Japan (Aug 2024 – Mar 2025). I loved Madrid—made close friends, felt independent, enjoyed city life, and had a fulfilling role working with children. Life there felt easy and fun compared to my experience in the UK, where I live in a quiet city with not much to do as my friends have moved away and I would live with family.

Japan, however, remained challenging. I lived in a remote industrial town with little to do, had distant colleagues, and often felt isolated. Despite enjoying teaching the children, I found the lack of structure and support frustrating, and the distance from friends in Tokyo made things harder.

I’ve since returned to the UK to explore new career options. My former employer in Spain offered me a position again and is actively helping with my visa process. I’m now preparing documents and working part-time to save money, with the possibility of full-time work later on offered by the company.

The pay is 1000 euros per month and I can work part time online to get more money. This is what I did before. I currently don't have a lot of money, however, saving up before October when I'm expected to start teaching, I will have around 5-6k saved up.

However, I have doubts about Spain. I enjoy teaching but don’t want to do it forever, and staying in Spain long-term is complicated without EU citizenship. I’m also conscious that others my age are progressing into more advanced roles.

I’m considering a few options:

* Stay in the UK, do a Master’s, and try to build a language-related career here.
* Return to Spain for a year, then pursue a Master’s in Translation in the UK.
* Work in Spain for a year, then study at a Spanish university while continuing part-time work.
* Try to stay in Spain long-term via a work permit or further study.

I’m torn between two paths: returning to a fun, fulfilling lifestyle in Spain with some uncertainty about long-term career prospects, or staying in the UK to build a stable, language-focused career with clearer professional development—but a less enjoyable lifestyle.",dbgnihd,2,1.0,1,1747667672,2025-05-19 15:14:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kqe84t/the_choice_between_living_abroad_and_a_proper/,5,2025

I feel bad saying this because he’s nice and means well. We have problems that pop up sometimes. I’ll point out the problem and root cause and how to fix it moving forward. He will say that’s not the problem so then he will have me on a goose chase looking here and there for the problem. Hours go by wasted… then the original problem I proposed to him is the problem.

1kqdgh3,Leaving a job too soon?,"Hi Redditors,

I have been at my current employer, a large public university, in a salaried role for \~2 years. I was in an intro-level position in student affairs for the first \~18 months. At the end of last year, I moved into a new role, still with student affairs, with more responsibility and a slight bump in salary. Since moving into this role, the funding for my department has been slashed, and I have lost my full-time supervisee. Additionally, the part-time grad who works with my department will leave at the end of 25-26, and we won't get funding to bring another student on. So, in a year, I will be the only person in my entire department, which administers programs for thousands of students and even staff members yearly. My supervisor and I have had conversations about scaling back our offerings, but I'm still worried I'll be doing more than one full-time job's worth of work without an appropriate bump in pay. 

Would it be a bad idea to apply for new jobs and leave this role before I've hit a year? If I do decide to apply soon, how do I spin my situation in interviews when asked about the quick turnaround, without pointing fingers/playing the blame game/sounding whiny? I will note that I am confident the funding for my current role is secure, but I am worried that reduced capacity/impact will render my job pointless anyway, which may eventually mean bad news if I choose to stay. 

For additional context, I will likely have to leave my unit and move to a new area at the university, since this unit has a very flat structure with virtually no room for promotion. Any advice is appreciated, and I'd love your thoughts on both options - applying soon and leaving early, or sticking it out til early 2026 and applying after the 1-year mark.

Thank you in advance for the wisdom!",Clear_Net2309,2,1.0,3,1747665798,2025-05-19 14:43:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kqdgh3/leaving_a_job_too_soon/,5,2025
1kqdf4c,My boss expects me to gather performance data for him,"Me and my boss are in a weird sudo partnership. I joined the team in February and was told I was responsible for, but not in charge of, 2 junior team members. This was because my boss explicitly doesn't have the time to manage this sub team
 It's stressful but not without some success I'm actually pretty happy with and I have gotten a lot of praise for what I've done.

The big issue we have right now is the numbers came out for the first quarter of the year. When we looked over the numbers I'm doing 52% of all of the work for the entire year to date. The expectation was I should at most be handling 15% (because I'm supposed to handle the really difficult stuff the 2 juniors can't on top of projects and managing them neither of which show in the numbers). My boss and I talked it over and he only has data on the raw work done. There is several details he can't see such as how often the juniors are answering the phone, how quick they are moving, how much of their work is actually work they escalated to me to do that they then took back (yes that happens).

My worry is if I turn over this data it paints a damning picture for one of the team members who I've had personal friction with. While the data is accurate and sourced in a spreadsheet that anyone can verify I am new to the team and my bosses boss warned me to be very careful as the company will get rid of me before them due to some politics stuff.

I wanted to ask if there are people who recently landed a job in tech - roles in Data or AI - what did you do differently? I have been applying to roles for months now and all I get is rejection. I am interested in Data Engineer/BI Engineer roles and I have great expertise working with patients and claims data in the healthcare industry. Additionally, I have handled multiple interoperability projects for Epic EMR, HL7, CDA and FHIR. My profile does not get selected even for the healthcare analyst kind of roles and I really want to understand what is it that I am missing. 

I am on h1b visa which may be a reason of rejection. However, I fail to understand why no company (not even pharmaceuticals) wants to work with me, even when I have those skills. What I have tried so far:

\- Sending out customized emails to talent team and senior leadership of pharmaceutical companies.

\- Constantly applying to roles on LinkedIn and Indeed.

\- Networking with a lot of ex-colleagues on LinkedIn and ask for referrals/contacts. 

\- Visiting career portals of a few companies and direct apply to the roles.

\- Reached out to professors from my university (from where I graduated in 2022) to seek out help/contacts.

1kqcfkt,Undergraduate losing their mind : Computer science or International studies?,"Hello, thank you for taking time to check this out. Im a high school student who is graduating in a week. And I’m concerned for my future. While doing research to apply to unis, i applied to uni 1 to its Engineering School-Which later i was gonna pick computer engineering, i got rejected even though i passed the entrance exams just fine. That was tough to accept but i moved on. Applied to uni 2 - Bachelors in Computer Science, which i passed. But now, a week from my graduation and I’m getting a fuzzy feeling in my guts. I don’t wanna force myself into a STEM major, just for the “future jobs” thing. Im truly thinking this is a redirection to what i really want.

Here’s some of my arguments :

I’m passionate about everything that’s learning, research, reading, philosophy, literature, writing a thousand words assignments rather than solving a math problem. All of these also happen to be interests i do in my free time, sometimes ditching my maths homework to do hours of research about a topic that is completely unrelated.
•	⁠Im passionate about languages; i speak Arabic (with its extensive dialects), French, English, Spanish, i could use just a couple intensive Italian and Portuguese classes and i’ll be fluent. And i’m interested to learn more…Languages i aim to be fluent in : Chinese, Korean, Russian, Catalan..
•	⁠I consider myself someone quite smart, i do surprised myself with my ability to strategise, to figure things out, to critical thinking skills, my sense of understanding (which makes a strong appearance in language learning, resonating with people…)
•	⁠I am very social, i mean not your typical extrovert but i could be, I’m usually slow, calm and collected. But i can be very engaging and friendly, i am open minded when it comes with dealing with different mentalities. Safe to say Im great at making connections and maintaining quite engaging conversations. I’m not shy and not afraid to speak up about either my feelings or my thoughts.
•	⁠I am passionate, and i always have this feeling inside of me who wants to do more, explore more, i am a very curious cat and i love to learn and squeeze out my potential.
•	⁠I am open to cultures, mindsets again, to the world basically. I don’t get repulsed by anything.

And I swear on everything i love i did not glaze or lie about one thing.

When in the contrary, i do feel like in comp science (the “safe” choice). I have a strong feeling I’m gonna get burned out, and yes sorry for the jury in my uni interview-i lied, i don’t enjoy maths, at-least not the way someone who could go into STEM careers would.

My plan is a bachelors + masters + of course building great skills on the side like learning more languages…

And for the $$$ (give me your opinions below) : Of course i do wanna be stable, i am aware no $$ will come easy but i guess as long as I’m doing a major or a career that i am not going to hate, or put money in for nothing, or go into 4 years or more of something i don’t enjoy. I think i’ll be okay.

I thought “i’ll learn to love it” but i am wrong and i do not want to make the wrong choice. Please i have nobody to ask. Give me your honest opinion. I did not know where to post this so If i need to post this is another community please kindly help me. Any real opinion, any advice would be appreciated!! THANK YOU SO MUCH IN ADVANCE

1kqazp7,Trying to quit a job that is ruining my mental health but manager wants to convince me to stay,"I started a new job early in the year that seemed like an exciting prospect and opportunity for me to make consistent money and learn a new skill. Training was done over 10 weeks and then I was qualified to take on the role officially. The training period was stressful, but the stress felt manageable because I chalked it up to learning curves and growing pains. But I haven't been able to fully settle into the role and have realized that the job itself is consistently stressful and unpredictable and I've grown to dread going to work and feel drained after every shift.

  
I explained all of this to my manager - who has a habit of being condescending and undermining others' perspectives - and they are basically convinced that I can 'positive thoughts' my way into wanting to stay. That is making resigning even more stressful than I think it should be?

  
Even though I've said that I can't mentally cope with doing the job, the manager says that I do it well so I can't be struggling that much. They also tried to guilt trip me by reminding me that in my interview I mentioned being passionate about the work in question. I responded by saying that it's because I care about the work that I recognize that I can't continue doing it in the context of this job/work environment, my mental health deteriorating further will ultimately make me perform badly.

  
It feels frustrating to have to keep having to explain this repeatedly to someone who seems determined not to accept my decision.

I have a bachelor in economics and until now I have worked in marketing in industrial technologies. I want to change my job, but I feel like I don't even know what my options are. So here are some info in case ypu would like to help me understand my possibilities:

\- I wouldn't like to work in marketing forever, right now my position is marketing manager and project management for a knowledge exchange group in the lifestyle industries. So online/offline marketing, press communication, content creation and event's organization.

\- Also, I don't want a job that takes my entire life, I have always worked for very small companies where capacity is always pushed to the limit and roles/responsabilities are flexible depending on who can take over in that moment.

\- I love animals and I would love to work in any way with something related to that, but I feel like my career until now has developed so far away from it and I'm missing the necessary studies for it.

\- I would see myself well in a big company, where i can start having my specific role and then perhaps grow into a position with more responsabilities. Unfortunately, for that the easiest way would be to work for the Italian/ Spanish market, which I already tried for 1 month and really didn't like working in the Italian market specifically.

Thank you to anyone who will send some help, share their experience or give me any type of inspiration.

1kq9z9f,Why is my manager ignoring me all of a sudden?,"I (23F) just got my first office job about a month ago at a big company as an HR Assistant, so I don't really know how to deal with office politics and all that.

One of my colleagues (lets call her A) is currently on leave, so she handed me one of her tasks, which is managing the transmittal logbook. The task is not hard, but yesterday I made the mistake of not handing a letter addressed to the HR manager (she's about 50 ish years old) directly to her. Instead, I handed it to the HR Manager Assistant because that's what A instructed me to do, ""Any letter regarding blablabla just hand it to the manager assistant"", she said.

The manager seemed upset about it, and the fact that I have opened the letter, because again, I was told to record what the content is about so that it would be easier to refer back in case anything happens. The assistant also seemed to refuse to take any accountability for not handing the letters even though she have read and checked all the letters I gave her.

However, because I am still under probation, so I didn't dare to argue with them. I just take a mental note to check all letters properly and not make the same mistake.

But today, I noticed that my manager kind of purposely left me out?? She didn't completely ignore me but she only talked to the other new girl, and only called her to help explain regarding the project that BOTH OF US worked on together, so that kinda hurt my feelings.

1kq99ws,Transitioning from Physiotherapy Background to Health Tech or Business,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some career advice. I have a background in physiotherapy and am currently studying Medical Technology (MedTech) at FH Wiener Neustadt. While I’ve applied to MSc programs in Germany in physiotherapy related areas . I am also applying in MSc such as digital health, biomedical engineering, and health economics, I’ve realized that physiotherapy may not be the right long-term fit for me.

I’m more interested in office-based roles—particularly in health tech or healthcare-related business sectors. I’m also curious about areas like finance or business, especially as they relate to health, startups, or digital innovation.

I’ve spoken with recruiters in Germany who emphasized that practicing as a physio requires German language proficiency and formal recognition, even as a student. This further pushed me to consider non-clinical paths.

I’d really appreciate any advice on:

Career paths that combine health, technology, and business
MSc programs or certifications that could support this pivot
Job roles in Germany or elsewhere where English is sufficient (e.g., in medtech or digital health companies)
How to evaluate whether business or finance is truly a fit, or just something I’m considering because others are doing it.

Previously before I came into the picture my department is managed by an external hospital team. There is this old senior person who was here 10 years ago and she still has connections to the team that I work with (a separate department from mine, but important). 

Currently we still buy services from the external hospital team, because although we have budget for a permanent full time headcount (to work alongside me), there have been no suitable candidates. So we pay the external hospital staff by the hour.

Since this lady is super senior she has been informally chatting with the team I work with and managing it, even though I make decisions. She has been overstepping her boundaries by not accounting for her presence. 

Is it ok to not pay her? I'm going on long leave soon and have to rely on them. I forsee that she will bypass my decisions. What can I do?

1kq8sm6,Just started my career and I want to quit to do a language year,"Hi everyone, been having a dilemma recently. I am in my first full time job as a consultant. I have been there for more than a year now and I am 26. I don’t hate it and the hours are not too bad. It is a job I can tolerate for the next years.

Before my job I did a undergrad and graduate degree and was supposed to go abroad during my graduate degree time  but due to covid, everything kinda didn’t work out like I wanted it to do.

I have this huge desire to go to Japan for a language year. Been there in my exchange and I love it. Have also studied the language a bit. I got a scholarship that I applied for, it’s for studying in Japan for a year. And I am unsure if I should take that opportunity, because that mean I would quit my job that I have been only doing for over a year now.

Just a bit of context, I used to always do things by the book. Went to school, did my undergrad and graduate degree. Have pressured myself a lot to have a career and be successful, therefore having  a lot of phases where I was deeply anxious and depressed.

Now that I have been in therapy, I just have the need to do one thing for myself and that would be this language year. Career wise it wouldn’t bring me anything, the Japanese language. 

But because I feel like I didn’t allow myself to do things I wanted to do in my early twenties, I want to make up for it with this trip. I hope that makes sense.

But I am very worried about finding a job after the year is finished and to be behind all my peers, as I didn’t start my career that early due to doing a graduate degree and my depression.

Would love to hear your honest opinions.

Ps: I just paid up any loans I had and saved up some money that would be sufficient enough together with the scholarship.",Material-Cry-1861,0,0.5,2,1747652337,2025-05-19 10:58:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kq8sm6/just_started_my_career_and_i_want_to_quit_to_do_a/,5,2025

1kq82al,Career advice for a single woman,"Please help me decide if I should stay with my current employer or take the job offer from a new company?

I’m 33 years old, single. My main concerns are: money,  work-life balance (I travel almost every month, and join activities to meet people), and career progression

__Option A: I stay with my current employer__
- I get promoted (from assistant manager to manager) and will have a 25% raise within 6 months
- I might be able to do more or less the same tasks for the more money, but on a regional scale.
- This company is very stable (fortune 500) and I have no concerns for retrenchment 
- I can go on holidays while working remotely
- Filing for PTO is very easy
- I started to play the office politics, I might get promoted again if I do it right
- I don’t hate my job, I’m good at what I do

__Option B: I take the job offer__
- I get a demotion (from asst manager to analyst) but I get a 65% increase from my current pay
- I will be very busy (based on what I gathered from the job interview) but unsure if doing overtime the norm
- The company has been around for around 20 years and has presence in a couple of states. Given the economic climate, I am unsure of its stability
- This is a remote job but don’t know if I can take holidays while working remotely.
- I don’t know if I can take PTOs easily
- Promotion is unlikely in the near future


The prospect of finally being a manager and being able to travel while working are the two things that I find is worth staying for. But I did the math. If I take the job offer, I can finally start saving up for a house because of the huge pay bump and still afford to go on holidays to places on my bucket list.

Also worth noting that I am 33 yo and single. I want kids. I think my future husband might be living in a different city or country, or probably in a some HIIT class that I will take in the future. 

I don’t want to make the wrong decision and regret it.

1kq7n3s,Need Career Advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m graduating at the end of this year with a double major in Business Law and Human Resources. I’ve been seriously considering doing a Juris Doctor (JD) to deepen my legal knowledge—particularly around environmental law and sustainability.

However, I don’t actually want to practice as a lawyer. I’m more interested in policy, CSR, and sustainability strategy—ideally working in a space where I can influence environmental outcomes through governance, compliance, or organisational change. The issue is, doing a full JD feels like overkill (and a big financial commitment) if I’m not going to use it to practice law. I’d love to build on my business law background, but I’m not sure what the best path forward is.

Has anyone here made the switch from business/HR into sustainability, ESG, or environmental policy roles? What kind of qualifications or experience helped you break in?

I’m also keen to hear about:
	•	Any short courses or certifications worth doing?
	•	Organisations, networks or associations I could join in Australia?
	•	Events or industry nights where I can meet people in the sustainability space?

Sooo anyway. In spite of my anger about that situation, I would like to move on to a new situation pretty quickly, and because I have some savings, I'm thinking of taking a sabbatical of sorts. One month of rest and recalibrating to the normal sleep schedule and while I'm doing that, I would continue to apply for jobs everyday like I already do but I would actually have time to fill out the bigger applications on companies' websites I actually want to work for. 

I apply through Indeed and Linkedin everyday. And I have gotten opportunities I've squandered just because I'm too exhausted to get my week's work done and interviews. Yet. I don't make wnough money to sustain myself. The decision to walk away is still hard as I'm scared for the future and because I once thought I could make this my career.

1kq5fd2,Careerchange because of sick familymember,"Last July, I started working for my new employer. Around the same time, my brother became ill, though at that point we didn’t yet know what was wrong with him.

I quickly noticed that I was struggling to find my footing in the new role. I even found myself occasionally browsing job websites. And had a lot of anxiety to go to work.

This past January, we were told that my 23-year-old brother is terminally ill and has only a short time left to live.
Part of his treatment took place in a department where I worked ten years ago. After a few weeks, everything became too much for me. I experienced severe anxiety about work, was deeply sad, and realized I had lost all passion for my current field. I called in sick and am now at home.

What does feel right to me is the thought of returning to that former role in healthcare. It gave me a lot of fulfillment at the time, and I left back then to turn my hobby into my profession.
Now that I’ve been back on that ward, I feel that healthcare position might actually be what I’ve been looking for all along in my career. Before my brother’s illness, I never considered going back because I thought too much had changed—but that turns out not to be the case.

I am in recovery at a stage where I want to start working again however not in my current position.

Would it be wise for me to seriously consider making this career switch?",capraf,2,1.0,0,1747638295,2025-05-19 07:04:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kq5fd2/careerchange_because_of_sick_familymember/,5,2025

1kq4f3o,"Is it conflict of interest, different personalities, what is it!","I will be brief in my post, I want to keep this as vague as possible without risking exposure into the wrong places. 

I (30f) am a venue manager of a bar, we host functions.
Someone within the company (10 years above my age/has a close relationship to the business owners) and also looks after a certain significant section of this venue, and is insisting on making a large scale change to the business which would impact in a few ways - causing myself and my employees to have to work harder, loss of control of stock just to name a few. I am certain this will negatively impact profit and over all company culture.

I have stated reasons why I do not want to go ahead with this change in great depth, considered positives and negatives and also contacted the owners directly asking for their advice to which I have been supported in my logical reasoning not to go ahead, however this person has decided to make the changes anyway as they feel the change will offer options for a minority of customers.

I am struggling to make informed decisions as the venue manager, I don't like that I can't have the final say in my position, I feel like there is a conflict of interest with their relationship to my bosses. 

I don't want to look like I am not flexible, but I want to stick to my fair reasoning and ability to make decisions. I want to appear confident, and support the business and my employees.

If there is anyone out there that has any advice at all, or if I can answer any questions to help clear things up please reach out!!

1kq3ydu,Advice for Med device start up role,"I work for a big med device company. Before joining this company, I worked at a start up. I have decided that I want to go back to a start up as in my company, I’m forced into a non technical role as it’s “good for my career”, technical paths are not very lucrative in terms of visibility and salary. There is a lot of favoritism and I don’t want to be part of this organization. It’s not healthy for my mental health. Also, I’ve no interest in becoming a program manager at the moment. I am an electrical engineer (EE) and currently working on a not very EE project. I interviewed for a couple of startup but I don’t feel confident enough, when asked about core technical EE questions. TBH it’s because in my current role, I am solving a lot of biomedical problems (therapy interaction with body) and not core circuit level work. I should have brushed up on my transistors and circuits before the interview but I’ve been interviewing for 1-2 months and there’s always something that I don’t remember as I haven’t worked on the real circuit for couple of years. 
Specific example, the interview I gave last week (6hrs tech round & haven’t heard back from the manager yet so don’t know about the results), I was asked circuit problems from BJT to led drivers. In my EE days, I use Internet and simulations for my design and don’t remember a lot of circuits by heart. I was able to explain basic questions like boost converter, SPI or Opamp because I worked on them. But didn’t remember output from a flip flop or clamping ckt with zener diode. 

Luckily, I can move to a new project at my current role and re-gain all the knowledge. That means I won’t be able to leave my current role and go through things that I don’t enjoy (mostly, associated with my current project). I am thinking of taking a break from job hunting and work on getting back to core EE. I have no problem in getting interview from big companies and startups. I want to have more experience to do well at interviews. For now, suck it up at my current role. Maybe I will try again in 6 months. Am I doing it right? Any advice?

I’m trying to figure out what finance-related careers are high paying (including bonuses), offer good work-life balance (not trying to burn out in my 20s lol), have clear career progression, and come with some/any exit opportunities (maybe pivot into corporate strategy, VC, etc.)

1kq2fjc,Which option to choose for mother with young family?,"For background, I am a mom (36f) of two children (5 and 1.5years) who works in the finance industry. My husband works in a trade. I am from Canada for reference. 

I have been with my current company for over 5 years, and have done well for myself. My team has faced high turnover due to terrible leadership. When I became pregnant with my second, I had a high risk pregnancy that required a bit of time off work (for appointments) and also man… I was exhausted from all the hormonal changes and having to care for a toddler and work a full time job. During my first trimester I could feel the vibes were off with my boss so I confronted them about it and essentially told me I was underperforming. No valid reason other the fact that I wasn’t going above and beyond my required tasks. Anyways, I had to suffer through micromanagement and just toxic comments from them until I finally went on maternity leave. Fast forward to today, I’ve returned back from maternity leave with a brand new team but same leadership style. Micromanaging. Passive aggressive behavior. Belittling. I have tried to keep my head down and have a positive attitude and just do whatever they tell me to because: 1) aside from the fact that they’re terrible people, I’m quite good at my job and enjoy the work 2) company perks, work life balance, and compensation is great 3) i have a hybrid work arrangement that allows me to work from home some days. 

My dilemma now is… 

1) do I stay at this comfortable job (but with toxic team) as I have young kids and the work life balance is important to me?

2) look for a new similar role at a different company.. however all these roles requires you to be in-office and it takes 1.5hrs each way to commute to (moving isn’t an option) and for similar to lower-ish pay and more responsibilities? Also I’d have to learn the new job again which takes considerable amount of effort and everything else that goes with starting a new job. And who knows… will the grass actually be greener?!

The decision is hard to make mainly because I am the breadwinner in the family ($200k annually, my husband makes $100k) and we ideally want to stay within this income range. Also keep in mind my kids are still young and I have to factor in the fact that they would have to be in daycare for longer hours if I’m in the office more, etc. 

Please help me pick which poison to pick 😭

1kq1yy9,Am I an idiot for considering a career change?,"33M, live in RI, I’ve been on the road working in powerplant construction and inspections for a large company for ten years. I have a degree in engineering, have a company truck/gas card, expenses paid for, etc. the company has been extremely good to me, I enjoy what I do, I enjoy the people I work with, and I’ve learned a lot. I’m currently making ~$97K.

I am also in the military reserves as a helicopter pilot, of which I have flying requirements I have to maintain (and have struggled in doing so). Because of this, and my desire to buy a house and start a family with my wife, I am considering a new job. I love the job I have, and it’s not so much the traveling that’s an issue, it’s the things going on at home while I’m away that is, if that makes any sense.

I can stay in company and apply for the next up position in an adjacent department, which would be a bump up in pay (have no offer, but if I can guess, I’d wager about $30K, nothing to back that though), and the rest of the benefits. The job would be 1/3 of the travel and a smaller footprint. Instead of leading every job, I’d be overseeing probably 3-6 jobs.

I think I’d be good at it, but I also somewhat dread the inevitable transition to staff life. And also, despite the pay and bennys being good and consistent, what good does it do for flying requirements if I’m at home more but also more busy?

I’ve considered a switch to becoming a firefighter. No experience, but I wanted to do it when I was younger, then thought I’d rather be a volunteer, now getting the itch again. I’ve gotten a bit more information on average pay, it would be a pay cut, and obviously lose current vehicle, but given it’s a public sector job, there are alternate benefits as well. I’d be starting from the bottom, and have to front EMT-B (allegedly can get for free at community college), and unsure about hiring afterward. Everywhere I look, people are promoting the job, and the work schedule seems to be rather conducive to reserve duty.

I realize that financially/on the surface, this may scream like a mid life crisis. Just looking for some additional input.

1kq0r4l,Go back to old job for career growth or stick with new job that may be below my experience level?,"Sorry if this is long, I’m trying to have a solid decision by tomorrow and am coming up short. I left my job of 5 years at an insurance brokerage 2 weeks ago, I was working with our account executives to manage accounts. Here were my reasons for applying and leaving:

1. Poor management. Manager above mine had a clear bias against me after I returned from a short term disability leave after the death of my husband. Told others on the team I don’t deserve good things because I got paid to do nothing for 6 months. This woman trash talks everyone on her own team and shares private and performance related info about team members to the other team members. It’s awful. She tandem managed us with my direct manager and they spent more time complaining about their jobs than helping us. We flagged we had an account imbalance that left me with half of my renewals in one month and their response was “sorry, nothing we can do”.  
I had been promised a promotion by June if I stepped up and took on work for the role above mine, but at my review in Feb I was told there was no timeline for it and I was still expected to do the higher work if I wanted it, they just couldn’t tell me when it’d be. They did it to another girl too in the role below me, they’ve been giving her the runaround for 2 years now. When I gave my notice they told me the promotion would probably happen in August but how could I believe it? Decided to leave anyway
2. No bonuses this year, after we did more work than ever. Just my position didn’t get one, this is the first year we didn’t. Feels like shit after all the work we did. 
3. Hard mandate on 3 days RTO. It was flexible before but now is a hard mandate. 
4. They took away the role below mine so all that work was being rolled into my role. Once I’d be promoted that wouldn’t matter as tasks are different, but for the next few months it would be significantly more grunt work. 

I found a new job with another brokerage and started last week. Unfortunately it seems the role was not exactly what I thought when I applied, and it is pure admin work, seems to be below my skill level and experience, same thing all day every day pretty much. There is growth opportunity, but into a role that is more of the same. I was having a rough week adjusting (didn’t help that my new manager called a 5 hr meeting on day 1 and just jumped right in to firing off info on their new systems and all that) and learning that it wasn’t quite as advertised and reached out to my old job to see if they’d consider having me back. Stupid I know. However there is more clear growth there in a higher level of work and position that would be coming if they do promote me in August like they’ve said they will. There are also a lot more opportunities for other roles up and laterally from that position I think, it’s less specialized and more skilled than my new admin job. I worry with my new admin job I’ll lose my skill set for account management and my career will be at a dead end. Now I need to decide if I’m sticking with the new job or going back to the old one. They’ve said I can have it back, but I feel like I’ll be under more scrutiny as far as my in office time and just everything based on the convo I had with the office head, with leaving and coming right back. He insinuated I lack critical thinking skills in our phone call Friday as I made a “poor decision” by choosing the new job and he’s not sure “he can trust me to critically think when I’m promoted”. That upset me quite a bit as the new job looked way better on paper, I was critical thinking. 

Here are the pros/cons of each:

Going back to old job:
-83k salary + OT with chance for 100-105 and a 5 figure bonus with the promotion I’ve been promised in a few more months (nothing in writing though)
-have to be in office 3 days a week, 20-30 min commute+parking charge
-Work day is flexible. For now even on office days I would only stay a few hrs from maybe 9-1. I know I am not micromanaged and can leave to go to the gym over lunch for an hour+ and usually don’t end up working until the true end of my work day because I am efficient. Nobody cares as long as the work is done. I can often step out for errands/appts whenever during the day. 
-love the team besides that awful manager, but she sits in another city
-more potential for growth I think, both with promotion sooner and then into other roles down the line 
-promotion would be hard work, my work-life balance would suffer a lot. Expected to check emails and phone on vacation with that role, significantly more responsibility
-no idea how I’ll be treated if I do go back, i worry they’ll give me a hard time on everything 

New job:
-90k base, 5K bonus for signing, team bonus at review time
-fully remote, team is spread all over the country 
-easier work, may be more mundane. Seems very much below my experience level. It’s interesting enough, but doesn’t call on much of my past experience and they hire people with no insurance experience for it 
-chance for growth but in a very niche thing, into a role that is more of the same. May be able to pivot out of the group in a few years and having that specialty experience can bring in more money in the industry down the line
-I’d have a specialty line of work, which tends to pay down the road 
-not sure what the day to day will look like as far as flexibility with my day once I get more into it. My hrs are 8:30-5, not sure how strict they manage that even if the work is all getting done.

Sorry this is long, I’m having a hard time and need an answer by tomorrow. Truly no idea what to do. I was convinced I’d go back to my old job but then today had a sense of “i need to keep my fully remote unicorn of a new job right now”. Trying to make the best decision for my work life balance and day to day, but also my career long term.

1kq0gea,Should I risk asking to delay my new job for a bonus from my current company?,"Hey everyone, I could use some perspective on a career dilemma.

I’m set to start a new job at Company B on 21st July — offer is signed, date is confirmed. I’ve already tendered my resignation to Company A, with my last day planned for 16th July. Everything was moving smoothly… until my current boss asked me to consider staying until end of August so I can get my annual bonus.

A few points:
	•	I’ll be heading back to my hometown in early July, so I only have 5 days of leave left — not enough to extend comfortably or take a break.
	•	The bonus is nice, but not life-changing. More like a month or so of salary.
	•	I’m worried that asking Company B to delay my start (just 1 week before I’m supposed to begin!) will make me look unprofessional or non-committed.
	•	But I’d hate to miss out on “free money” if it’s just a few more weeks…

Would it be risky to even ask Company B about postponing? Or should I just move on and stick with the original plan?

Appreciate your thoughts — especially from anyone who’s faced this kind of situation.

1kq0480,Half the office left,"I work for a large corporation but our local office has about 9 employees running the office and we were a very profitable branch. Recently, 4 people left to a main competitor and those 4 were a detrimental part of our business strategy and without them we may struggle to be profitable (that’s yet to be seen). Management has said they are working on replacements but I’m concerned about my job security. It was a pretty messy resignation with emotions running high- mainly management unfortunately. 

Given that those 4 left and due to the circumstances, I expect to be contacted by said competitor. I have no non-compete clauses but am concerned about possible solicitation violations. 

I want to be as honest as possible with my current employer to keep a good reputation but without screwing myself. If I do get contacted by the competitor, would it be wise to let management know I have been contacted? Or should I go thru the process with the competitor, get an offer and then go thru the circus with my current employer then?

1kpztw0,Quant vs Doctor?,"Hey everyone, 

I'm a math major currently trying to decide if I want to go to medical school or go into the industry right after college. I was pretty set on going to medical school, but now I wonder if the ROI will be worth it compared to being a quant. I know a lot about medical school and being a doctor, and not a lot about quantitative analysts and their lifestyle. 

If I were to go to medical school, I'd like to become a radiologist, which have salaries ranging from 300k to 800k in practice. I'm well aware of the loans, the work, and the resident salaries and years needed. 

But a lot of quants I talk to like to brag about the lifestyle and pay as well. I can agree with the fact that the pay cap is essentially limitless, but I feel like there's also some hidden risk like the amount of work you'd be doing for that much. And it's not really that easy to be hired at some top hedge fund.

1kpzl91,Coding or Digital Marketing?,"22 | M

I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Currently about to finish my Bachelor's in CS, have done 6 months of internship/job in coding. Sucked for me, my colleagues said you weren't given good enough guidance and I think am not just built for this, as I really never had that good old ""just build a project"" cuz in recent years I've never everr had a single hunch to just build something out of coding. Can I do it if I really put my ass into it? Why not? Will I make a fortune in it? Probably not as I dont seem to have that drive for this.

Now about digital marketing, it stared off with me just having a dream of doing ecom, which I did. I ran a PL store on Shopify using FB ads which surprisingly for my first time, ran slightly over break even for 3 months. Also did a HubSpot Email Marketing Cert. I'd say I enjoyed it quite a lot. But can I make this a full time career? I know u might be thinking, ""just to into ecom, why a job?"" Well I still need to learn (and earn) alot for THAT kindof ecom you know? And also considering all of this AI boom BS, is it good to jump into this field?

Currently deep in the job hunt, and the sheer amount of time I spend tweaking my resume for each specific role is becoming a major drain. I know it's crucial, but it feels like a full-time job in itself!

What are your go-to strategies or hacks for making this process less painful and more efficient? Maybe some AI tools?

1kpyjdr,Curious about career growth and AI impact in Compliance/AML — considering a potential partner in this field,"I’m in the arranged marriage process and met someone I vibed really well with. He’s a B.Com graduate, currently working in the Compliance domain, specifically Anti-Money Laundering (AML), at a corporate firm. He earns around ₹15 LPA at 30 years old.

I’m a BE graduate myself (working in a tech role), I am curious about the long-term career potential and stability in his field. I don’t know much about AML or Compliance, and I want to understand:

1. What does the career ladder typically look like in AML/Compliance? Are there strong growth prospects (both role-wise and salary-wise)?

2. How is AI expected to impact this field? Will automation pose a risk to job security, or is there scope for adaptation and staying relevant?

3. Would it be wise to bet on this domain in the long run, especially if I’m looking at shared financial goals and lifestyle compatibility?

Any insights from people in the field or those who’ve seen this career path unfold would be greatly appreciated.

1kpy550,Is my manager allowed to talk to me about my performance when customers can hear,"So to preface, me and a few of my colleagues were on a pretty busy shift around 2 weeks ago and it wasn’t the best in terms of group performance, but was good in terms of sales. While I think I had a pretty good level of performance that shift, completing tasks when asked and with a lot of efficiency, my supervisor had apparently thought otherwise and told my manager about the shift as a whole and some things I had said to them afterwards, complaining about the shift and how my other colleague had taken a while to finish washing up towards the end of the shift which delayed us clocking out for a good 10ish mins. 

Now I am unsure on whether my supervisor had mentioned specifics or what, but today I was pulled aside several times while on a busy shift by my manager to discuss the situation with customers coming in almost every time including when they essentially ridiculed me for not performing well, not respecting my supervisors authority (which for the record they had mentioned on that shift while my other colleague was not present that they had joked and hurt their feelings when they were being serious) and saying what I had said about my other colleague which I admit was not my place to say, but when I had mentioned that I genuinely thought I had performed well that shift and essentially didn’t get why my performance was bought into question by both my manager and my supervisor to which they essentially just undermined my opinion in front of customers as we were busy and repeated what she had already said in a more harsh tone which actually really upset me.

Now I am completely understanding about why my manager had the talk with me and do regret saying the things I said about my colleague, but I did not appreciate that they did it in front of customers and at a volume that meant they could hear everything they were saying to me. I also didn’t appreciate being labelled as the one undermining my supervisor’s authority by not taking them seriously when I was actually really sympathetic when they told me my colleague did that to them and tried to make sure I didn’t do the same. 

To make matters worse, I had to continue the rest of my shift, being another 3 hours after, with my manager acting like nothing happened and they didn’t just accuse me of things I did not do and point the blame to me in front of customers. I genuinely felt like crying on the spot, but I did not want to be deemed as unprofessional and get sent home.

I really don’t know whether I was in the wrong at all or if my manager should have talked to me in the store with the customers and my colleague that was on shift being able to hear what was being said, but I do know that I was really hurt by it and I don’t feel like I am comfortable continuing to work in my current workplace and I don’t know where to go from here. I’ve begun to apply for new jobs and really hope I can get a position somewhere else as I don’t want to continue working somewhere I feel I will be put to blame for things I didn’t do.",Throwaway_o31o,1,0.6000000238418579,21,1747612728,2025-05-18 23:58:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kpy550/is_my_manager_allowed_to_talk_to_me_about_my/,5,2025
1kpxwmj,Client might be getting too personal,"I work at a consulting firm and lead work with a client with whom my boss (the company’s founder) is very involved because she is high profile and needs a lot of attention. 

She is deeply insecure, and she needs and expects constant praise. She has never had a single complaint about my work except to say I am not enthusiastic enough about her and her project (the work I do supports this project). 

Recently, she said to my boss two things that concern me: 

1) She told him that I didn’t say something on a call that I actually did say (and obviously it is something she wanted me to say). My colleagues back me up on this. She is either so twisted now about me that she truly believes she heard something else; or she’s purposely lying.)

2) She brought up something that happened in my life recently (a geographic move I made, which she only knows about for business reasons), and said she’s worried about me because she wonders if it went ok. Based on nothing. No rationale. It feels like an attempt to manipulate … 

For context: My boss has said he knows that this is about her, not me. And that there is not a performance issue here. (And i’ve been with him a long time, so he knows my performance has always been excellent.) I am trying to keep this short so I won’t go into how I have tried to address this and also my stellar record of client relationships for more than ten years. 

That said, should I be concerned enough to talk to him about having someone else work with her? It kind of feels like she’s coming for me now.

Is this behavior crossing the line on her part or just part of handling a difficult client?

I’ve handled many over the years so I am used to it. But this seems different. 

Thanks for any perspective on this. ",procatlady20,6,0.8799999952316284,9,1747612019,2025-05-18 23:46:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kpxwmj/client_might_be_getting_too_personal/,5,2025

1kpxeqc,2 months in and I hate my job,"I graduated from college with a degree in Econ and a minor in business info systems in May 2024. I had interned at a Fortune 400 company 2 years prior and enjoyed the time I spent there and became interested in the finance route. I only spent about 2.5 months very aggressively applying to jobs (I applied to 50) and landed a role as a personal banker at a bank. It wasn’t super ideal but it was a start since I needed more money and wanted to see if this would get me closer to what I thought I wanted (financial advisor, licensing, etc). In this economy/job market I knew I needed to take what I can get. I spent about a month at training when I ended up landing an interview at the company I interned at basically in a call center. I knew this wasn’t ideal either but it’s mostly WFH, slightly higher pay, and at the company I always wanted to work at so I thought it would be a good stepping stone. I’m about 2 months in and I’m pretty miserable. I thought I was just overwhelmed by the amount of info thrown at me during training and felt anxious about making mistakes. That has settled a bit but I still dread going to work and spend almost every day crying before and after work. I feel like I’m now making more mistakes because my anxiety makes it hard to focus. The team and my manager are very nice but this job doesn’t feel like the right fit and I almost feel like finance itself isn’t for me. I’m feeling extremely depressed, stressed, anxious, and stuck. My manager at the bank said I could reach out if things don’t work out but I feel like I’m giving up and feel embarrassed that I can’t handle this job right now only after a couple months. I don’t want this to reflect badly since the industry is smaller than you would think. Should I try to stick it out or reach out to my old manager to get my job back? I know entry level jobs are never perfect but I don’t think I should be crying every day. My mental health feels at stake to the point that I don’t have an appetite and can barely sleep. What do I do? I feel desperate and alone and not like myself at all. How can I pivot into something else eventually? I’m just scared and stressed every day. I feel like a failure.

I’ve spent much of my career supporting my community by helping people find opportunities, whether it’s through education, apprenticeships, job searches, or even navigating benefits applications. My work has ranged from guiding school leavers to later-life learners, with a focus on ensuring people have access to the resources and support they need to create a fulfilling career. It all stems from something my parent once said: “We spend so much of our lives working, why not do something we love?”

I want to help people find direction, as I believe everyone’s path is unique. Whether through apprenticeships, full-time jobs, or further education, different opportunities appeal to different people based on how they learn and live. With this in mind, I’m curious—what do you think is most important when seeking career advice? What areas do you feel need more support, or what would you find most helpful in career counselling?

1kpuf33,"After 4 Years, My Company Wants Me to Sign a New Contract — Overreaching Clauses? Need Advice","
Hi everyone, I’ve been with my company for 4 years in a customer service/sales support role at an insurance tech company. I’ve consistently performed well, taken on more responsibilities, and worked well beyond 40 hours a week.

Now they’ve asked me to sign a new employment contract, and after reading through it carefully, I have serious concerns that some of the terms are overly broad, one-sided, or possibly not legal—especially around classification, IP, and post-employment clauses.

Here’s what’s standing out to me:

1. Exempt Classification (No Overtime)

I’m being labeled as an exempt salaried employee.

My actual duties are mostly task-based: customer service, policy changes, quoting support, etc.—no managerial or strategic authority.

I regularly work over 40 hours/week.

This feels like misclassification under FLSA, and I’m concerned I’m being denied overtime unfairly.

2. Intellectual Property Clause

The company claims ownership over anything I create during my employment—even if I make it on my own time and it’s only somewhat related to their business.

They can also claim ownership of things I create for up to 1 year after I leave, if it's related to their business or built on knowledge I gained there.

There’s no carveout for personal projects or pre-existing work.


3. Future Employment Disclosure

I’m required to share this contract with any future employer.

The company also reserves the right to contact future employers directly if they suspect a conflict of interest.

This seems invasive and potentially harmful to future opportunities.

4. Bonus Structure

There’s a possible $20K annual bonus, but:

Goals are undefined and can change,

You must hit 50% of every goal across all product lines just to qualify,

It feels like it’s designed to be difficult to actually earn.

5. Legal Disputes

All disputes must be handled in Delaware, not Florida (where I live and work).

I would also be waiving my right to a jury trial.

This heavily favors the company and could be a major hurdle if anything goes wrong.

6. Licensing Responsibility

I’m required to hold an active insurance license, but the contract doesn’t clarify who pays for CE credits, renewals, or additional state licenses.

7. Catch-All Job Duties

The job description includes a vague “other duties as assigned” line and expectations to help other teams with backlog.

There’s no mention of workload protections, caps, or tracking.


Questions:

Am I overreacting, or are these real red flags?

Is the exempt classification likely illegal based on my job duties?

Has anyone pushed back on IP clauses or post-employment notification language successfully?

Should I consult a Florida-based employment attorney before signing?


I want to continue growing in my role, but not at the cost of my time, creativity, or future freedom. Appreciate any advice—especially from anyone who’s been through something similar.

But a year ago i got the opportunity to work as a pre-sales engineer at a SaaS company (i said why not try the business side) but now it’s getting boring and i don’t feel like i’m growing career wise. So i now want to pursue a career in cybersecurity by taking a masters degree but is it possible to switch careers after i get my masters or is it difficult because as presales my experience is irrelevant to cybersecurity.

1kprik6,"Lateral promotion, no raise","I was recently “promoted” to supervisor, but the pay was lateral. They bundled my annual merit increase as my promotion. I had a very serious conversation with my manager about the pay expectation and nearly passed on the promotion because there wouldnt be additional compensation. We came to an agreement that it would be easier to push a raise mid-year with HR than part of the promotion. So I accepted the promotion with the stipulation and understanding that a mid-year raise would be part of the deal. It’s common in our industry to do promotions like this, which is backwards, but I was willing to wait until the summer timeframe that was discussed. Now, my manager just told me that my raise is no longer a priority. He claims that our counterpart team has had terrible turnover (bad management), that getting backfills has been prioritized. 

I am livid. I love my job, but the false promises,  lack of follow through, additional stress, and priority being over a bad manager has me questioning when enough is enough. I’d much rather push and advocate for myself, push to get what I need from my manager and company than just up and quit. I have invested nearly a decade in the company’s improvement and I love my team. My manager and I have had a great working relationship up until the past few months. However, I’ve felt a shift in the working relationship with my boss, and it feels like he is either annoyed with me for pushing for reasonable compensation or some sort of rumor is going around that I’m not aware of. 

I don’t believe this is an issue with my ability to do the job. I picked up two of the “problem children” on our team. They went from below standard to completely flourishing. I provide them with clear weekly deadlines and expectations. I will personally sit with them and train each person patiently for as long as they need and have no problem answering the same question more than once without acting annoyed. I treat my team with respect and like an adult and they in turn care about the work they do and have been willing to jump in and help with more specialized projects. I haven’t seen a single missed deadline by these two people on my team once the expectation, respect and training was cleaned up. I can’t understand why all of a sudden im being told my raise is no longer a priority. How do I advocate for myself?",calicat1289,1,0.6700000166893005,19,1747594715,2025-05-18 18:58:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kprik6/lateral_promotion_no_raise/,5,2025

1kpqivn,Career shift from graphic design,"Hi,
   I am a graphic designer and illustrator and I just can't sell myself. I am so stressed all the time and can't find joy in what I do anymore. I can't make a portfolio or work on projects. I feel stuck and my brain is so crowded that it gives me headaches. I was thinking to make a career shift to a more stable job that doesn't need a social media presence as much. Also that is not a continuous work from home that ends at the office hours. Like data analyst? 

This is my situation and skills: 
I am in UAE
A multimedia graduate
I am 32
Single mum with 6 yo 
I have 6 months I can study in.
I love to draw and I am good at it I just need income that's stable. So I can support myself and child.
Fast typist
Good at guessing for instance (I can see products on the counter and guess their total price without calculating)
I love computers and I know some coding
Not so good at math
I speak English and Arabic
Patient 
Listening skills 

I need a job that is focused and stable and secured, done with too many specialization or the need to market myself. I just want to raise my child in  peace and secure our future.

What do you think ?

1kpn0w3,[23M] Confused about what to pursue next – Need Career Guidance,"Hey everyone,
I’m 23M, graduated with a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering in 2021. I worked as a Service Advisor at a car dealership for 3 years but recently resigned due to the pressure of unrealistic sales targets. I’ve made up my mind not to return to the car dealership/customer-facing industry again.

It’s been 3 months since I resigned, and I’m currently job hunting. I have basic knowledge of AutoCAD 2D, and I’m open to learning new things — but preferably while on the job. I don’t want to end up spending money and time on some course and still end up stuck without getting work.

My parents are pressuring me to relocate 400+ km away for a job, but I hate staying in PGs and don’t enjoy the food. Plus, the salary wouldn’t allow me to save anything after expenses. I’d rather work from my hometown for now and eventually try going abroad (thinking of UAE) once I gain some experience.

If anyone has suggestions for stable roles (ideally 9–6, non-customer-facing) that fit my background — or has been in a similar situation — I’d love to hear your thoughts. I’m feeling a bit stuck and don’t want to rush into another bad decision.

1kpmdmp,What should I do,"Hi all,
I could really use some outside perspective.

I currently work in Human Resources at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The role is stable, Monday–Friday, 7–3:30, and offers solid benefits and flexibility. However, growth and challenge are very limited. I’ve been in this role for under 2 years and am still career-conditional.

Here’s the issue: due to the looming federal RIF (reduction in force), I’m at risk of losing my job, especially because I work in HR — not an exempted position. There’s a court hearing this week, but even if the RIF is temporarily blocked, it’s expected to continue playing out in the courts.

Meanwhile, I received a full-time offer from Target for an Executive Team Leader – General Merchandise role (ETL GM) at $85K. It’s a strong offer with leadership opportunities and growth potential, but it’s a major lifestyle shift: evenings, weekends, high pressure, and 50-hour workweeks. I’ve worked for Target before and enjoyed the pace and team culture, but I also value my current work-life balance and time with family.

I also have the Deferred Resignation Program at the VA, which would allow me to receive a paycheck until September even if I start a new job — giving me some financial overlap.

My long-term goal is to grow in Human Resources, ideally in a business partner or strategic role. But the private-sector HRBP market has been rough — I’ve applied to ~50 jobs with no traction.

Here’s where I’m stuck:
    •    Do I take the Target role for stability and growth (but sacrifice work-life balance)?
    •    Do I stay at the VA and risk the RIF, hoping HRBP roles open up soon?
    •    Is there a smart way to delay or negotiate the Target offer?
    •    Will Target hurt or help my future HR career path?

Any honest advice is appreciated. Has anyone else been in a similar boat?",ShoppingRecent5282,1,1.0,0,1747581497,2025-05-18 15:18:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kpmdmp/what_should_i_do/,5,2025
1kpm519,Going Back to School at 34 – Feeling Hopeful but Also Anxious About Age Discrimination,"Hey everyone,

I'm 34 years old, and this fall I'm heading back to school at my local community college. It's a huge shift for me, but one I feel oddly at peace with. I already have a Bachelor of Science degree in Biopsychology — how I ended up with that major is a story for another time. If I could go back, I wouldn’t have chosen it. The reality is, to do anything meaningful with that degree, I’d need to go on for a master’s or even a doctorate, and after graduating, I was completely burned out and had zero interest in more school.

So I went straight into the workforce, taking low-level jobs in corporate environments — jobs that, frankly, were soul-sucking and paid terribly. My last role was at a health insurance company, and I was the last one in my training group to stick it out before I eventually got laid off. I’ve been stuck in financial debt for most of my adult life thanks to attending a private university (a decision I now consider a huge mistake), and I’ve never really been in a career that gave me purpose or stability.

Recently, I went to my local career force center after getting laid off, and they offered to pay for me to earn an associate degree in accounting at my community college. I’ve decided to go for it. Thankfully, I can afford to take classes full-time because I don’t currently have housing costs and other major responsibilities weighing me down. My plan is to not stop at the associate degree — I want to go all the way, get my bachelor’s in accounting, and then take the CPA exam.

But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t worried about one thing: my age. If everything goes according to plan, I’ll be entering the job market as an entry-level accountant at 38. I’m trying not to let that intimidate me, but I can’t help but feel nervous about how I’ll be perceived by hiring managers — especially when some of them might be a decade or more younger than me.

I’ve already started to notice some age-related friction, particularly from Gen Z coworkers or hiring folks in my past experiences. I’m worried that being older might make me less ""vibe-compatible"" in workplaces that prioritize youth and culture fit. It sometimes feels like Gen Z workplaces expect you to be part of a certain aesthetic or energy, and that if you don’t fit it, you’re just… not picked. I know not every Gen Z person is like this, but the trend has me anxious.

Anyway, I’m doing this for me. I’m finally getting a second chance at something stable and meaningful, and I’m actually excited to study again — this time, with a clear goal in mind. I guess I just wanted to share and see if anyone else out there has gone back to school in their 30s or even 40s, and how it worked out for you? Or if anyone's broken into accounting later in life and what your experience was like?

Appreciate anyone who reads this and shares some wisdom.

1kpln4p,Mechanical R&D engineer looking to pivot into product strategy,"Hey everyone,

I’ve always loved **product development** — the process of creating something from scratch, solving real problems, and turning ideas into tangible value. That passion is what led me to study **mechanical engineering** and work in **automotive R&D**, where I’ve been involved in **new product development** for the past few years.

But lately, I’ve realized that what I really care about isn’t just the mechanical side. It’s the **big picture**:

* What problem are we solving?
* Who is the user?
* Why will this product succeed (or fail)?
* How can we test, improve, and launch better?

That’s why I’m now pivoting toward **general product development and strategy**, 

To prepare, I’ve passed the **PSM I** and **PSPO I** exams from [Scrum.org](http://Scrum.org), and I’m studying product strategy.

I’m still working full-time, but I’m looking for ways to **get hands-on experience after hours** — helping with side projects, MVP validation, user interviews, feature specs, roadmapping, etc.

**If you've made a similar switch from engineering to product consulting or digital product roles:**

* How did you do it?
* What helped you get your first real experience?
* What would you do differently now?

Also — if you're working on a product and wouldn’t mind **a structured, product-focused R&D mind** helping you think through strategy or execution — I’d love to contribute.

1kplkn9,"I make 150k a year without a degree in a non-sales, trad corporate environment at 30. Here are some tips that helped propelled me to success.","I wrote this in response to someone else, but thought this sub might be interested in how I did it as well.   
  
I'm constantly upskilling as soon as I'm comfortable in my job - I look up at the positions I want and use coffee chats with folks about what makes them successful in those roles and posted job descriptions as a task list of skills I need to work on and demonstrate so I'm prepared for the time when the position is open. A lot of my friends get comfy in their current position and wait, if they upskill at all, until the position they want is posted and then they scramble trying to close their deficits, never in time for them to actually take advantage of the opportunities. If they don't do that, they wait for their managers to lay out the plan for promotion for them and get upset when they're expected to have agency because 'nobody ever told me I needed that skill'.

If I can't receive an opportunity to utilize a skill in my normal work, I make them for myself by building business cases around stuff I want to do that will materially help our team and present it to my managers.  Not every suggestion will be taken, but with practice and refining your skills, eventually an opportunity will pop up where the time or money savings are too good to pass up. 

I also say yes to out-of-scope work for the same reason, and regularly ask what I can deprioritize on my normal tasks so I maintain my work-life balance to take it on. They're going to hire someone with those skills regardless, you're only shooting yourself in the foot experience-wise at this job and your next if you don't grab those opportunities yourself.

I self-advocate. My managers either know exactly where I want to go or if they're touchy about keeping people on their team, what skills I want more work on so that I can build my resume experience. I also track all of my big successes and achievements across my career in a google doc and in my 1:1 before promotion time, because human memories are short and prone to recency bias, I remind my manager about all the great work I've done for that time period. I learned to keep my mouth shut as well - if you say you don't want to do more than what you currently do/you don't want to manage people, folks will automatically take you out of the running when opportunities come up.

I shout out members of my team who helped me on projects, which leads to an environment when they shout me out for helping them, increasing my advocates come promotion time. My coworkers aren't my competition, they're my network, and they talk me up to their managers, who won't argue with my manager when they put me up for promotion.

If I'm going to complain about something, it's coming with a short-term, bandaid fix, and a medium-term good enough solution, and a long-term perfect world solution, unless it's completely out of my wheelhouse to solve. If you're regularly making more work for your manager or complaining without solving anything, you're going to struggle to get ahead.

Dear god, take feedback, there's a lesson to be learned in everything you receive whether it's valid or someone's a sensitive little bitch. If you work with a difficult person, look at what the folks they successfully work with do to connect with them or how they get them to do things. If someone's telling you you're longwinded, take that as a note to be more direct in your approach when you message that person. Doesn't matter if you're the smartest person in the room, if people find you difficult to work with and you're not in one of the few IC roles that just care about your production, that shit will detract from your mobility. Even the most toxic places I've ever worked have had lessons I took away and still use to this day, like following up verbally received instruction with written confirmation of assigned tasks.

You need to refine your application package, and I don't just mean keyword matching your resume. Pre-select experience you have that matches the skills they're looking for in the job description, and practice responding to interview questions with those stories in mind. I recommend the STAR method (framing the story in situation, task, action, and result), and make sure that 'I don't know' is never a complete answer. You can explain what you would do in that situation, or what steps you'd take to figure out how to solve the problem even if you don't have an answer right in front of you. I volunteer with multiple programs that help low income adults with and without degrees get into trad corporate work and it's wild some of the answers they give to basic questions.",Conscious_Can3226,149,0.7900000214576721,16,1747579368,2025-05-18 14:42:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kplkn9/i_make_150k_a_year_without_a_degree_in_a_nonsales/,5,2025
1kpl9na,Should I believe tarot reading about my career?,"This might sound a bit random and unserious but I really need some advice. 😂 I’m a fresh grad with 3 years of experience in marketing, and I recently got into the igaming industry as a social media specialist.

When I got hired 6 months ago, a tarot reader actually told me to stay in THIS company because there are a lot of opportunities daw for growth. He said even if I get a better offer somewhere else, I shouldn’t be swayed.

Pero now I’m honestly starting to get bored. My tasks are becoming super repetitive na, and I feel like I already know everything I need to do. It’s like I’m not learning anything new or growing anymore.

I originally wanted a supervisory or team lead role, but since there wasn’t any opening for that during the time applied, they placed me in a specialist role—though to be fair, the pay is higher than usual naman. The only time I could possibly move up to a supervisor position is if my current supervisor resigns na (which she did say she plans to do naman eventually).

Recently, I came across another igaming company hiring for a social media and digital ads specialist. I applied just to see if they’d consider me for the role I actually want or at least match my expected salary (which is 20% more than what I’m earning now). They said they can naman.

So here’s my dilemma: should I take that tarot reading seriously and stay here for at least a year, or should I go for this new opportunity na? 😅",joshhnr,0,0.33000001311302185,5,1747578540,2025-05-18 14:29:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kpl9na/should_i_believe_tarot_reading_about_my_career/,5,2025

Nonetheless, I need to major in something that is profitable to an extend, so philosophy is out of the table, even though it interests me a lot. Psychology is another interest of mine but I know you have to put a lot into it.

I tried asking on forums and doing my research but no luck. Still, I like the idea of combining tech and healthcare, the two things that I'm the most interested in. Last year I wanted to do BME but chickened out and picked pharmacy because it seemed ""safer"" however it just didn't feel right. 

2. Med School – Applied, but already didn’t make the cut for one school by two points. Not sure how to feel about it honestly. It’s such a grind—burnout, barely any social life, minimum wage during residency which is 5+ years, night shifts and before all that 6 year study program… just the dream. Pay gets better later, but I'm not sure I could do it and living with my parents until I'm well over 30 doesn't sound the best.

3. Physiotherapy – Might get in depending on entrance exams. My mom's dream. I don’t really know what the job actually looks like, and it seems like something ex-athletes go into… I’ve never even done a sport. But I’ve heard it pays well and has decent job prospects. Applied because of my parents and cousin telling me to give it a shot.

4. Vet School – went into one of the lectures and shadowed a vet for a day. It was cool, but I’m still unsure. The pay’s not great unless you leave the country. I applied mostly because I liked seeing all the animals on campus when I was still doing pharmacy.

As for me, I like science and tech, and I really enjoy hands-on stuff—building, creating, coding. I’m good at science, but my math and physics aren’t the best (thanks to some pretty useless teachers in high school). I feel like I could do well in medicine, but it might not make me happy. It's a lot of memorizing and not much creativity. I also think just getting a degree in whatever and seeing where it takes me is an option. I'm just pretty lost because I thought this year would give me much more insight than it actually did.

1kpl1fz,I built a custom companion for your financial journey,"
Hey guys ✌🏽

After seeing there is no solution to the problem of ""Ok what do I do to actually make money by myself"" other than general tip, BS courses, visualization and the like, and after trying a few things out until I got some cool stuff going it got me thinking, other people probably have this problem too!

Then I went ahead and built a Custom Tailored platform that aims to solve it, it covers everything from brainstorming ideas to generating structured plans and giving mentorship and guidence while pushing you forward all the way and evolving with you.

It's no BS quick getting rich scheme, rather a guide for people who would put in the work to reap the seeds they sow.

I've designed it mainly for side hustling / creating a business

I reckoned some of you might find this helpful

I'll put out 10 beta keys, and I'd love to hear back if this is relevant to anyone!

1kpko7m,Need Advice: Worried About BGV Process at New Company (Termination History Involved),"Hi everyone,  
I’m looking for honest advice or experiences regarding background verification (BGV) and how deep companies go into checking past employment.

Here’s my situation:

* In my **first company**, I worked for **1 year 2 months**. I was initially given a **termination notice due to poor performance** with a 30-day period. However, with **1 week left**, they suddenly issued another **termination letter citing misconduct and violation of company policy**, which is **not true**.
* I didn’t sign or acknowledge that second letter, and returned my assets.
* They later issued me a **relieving letter which is clean**, with no mention of misconduct or anything negative.
* In my **second company**, during their BGV process, they somehow found out about the misconduct remark and ended up **asking me to leave after 6 months**,
* I’m now in my **third company**, and have been here for **1 year without any issues**. I just got an offer from a well-known company and I’m worried the same BGV issue might repeat.

# My Questions:

1. Do companies typically verify **all previous employers** or just the most recent 1–2?
2. Can companies **access internal records** like “termination reason” even if a **clean relieving letter** is provided?
3. Since I didn’t sign anything and have a clean relieving letter, do they really have “proof” of misconduct?
4. How can I handle this situation if the new employer brings it up? Should I disclose it proactively?
5. Anyone faced something similar and passed BGV later?

Would really appreciate any input. This situation is affecting my peace of mind, and I just want to move forward honestly.

Thanks in advance!",NetanZeldov,1,1.0,0,1747576898,2025-05-18 14:01:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kpko7m/need_advice_worried_about_bgv_process_at_new/,5,2025
1kpjufc,Should I attend this second in-person interview?,"Not sure if this is the best place to ask but I'm currently a uni student in the UK trying to secure a placement year. Honestly, its quite late in the game now and I was just about to give up. But I recently got an invitation to a second interview taking place at the company site. And while I really want to secure a placement, this is quite a bit of a inconvenience for me at the moment. Its a 5 hour train ride one way and it takes place in the same week before I am scheduled to fly out to Canada to do a summer internship. Train fares are not the cheapest, and on that week I rather just prepare for my trip, get the chance to chill with friends before I leave and also get some remaining uni work done. The trip would be worth it if I was guaranteed the placement, but if I make the effort and still end up not getting it idk. I know its potentially sacrificing short term stuff for long term benefit, but right now it just feels like a lot. I'm also considering postponing my summer internship a week or two to give myself more time to prepare for it, but the thing is, if I do that I can't do the placement anymore because I would finish the internship too late. I just really wanted to get as much work experience as possible but maybe an internship and a placement back to back would be too much for me. But I just really want to set myself up for success in the future, and have something to show for when I graduate.

1kpj193,Almost Got Fired Over Lies — Now I Just Want to Leave This Job,"So I work for a company as an IT staff. We don’t have a proper office yet — it’s still under construction — so we’ve been working out of our boss’s (the VP's) rest house. At first, things were going fine. But just recently, during my day off, my supervisor called and told me something that genuinely shocked me: I almost got fired.

Why? Apparently, my boss claimed I was lazy. He said I didn’t do anything except use my phone at work, that I ignored a task for over three weeks, and — the worst part — that I allegedly called the company a scam.

When I heard that, I thought: What the actual hell? That’s the complete opposite of how I work.

When i arrive. Since we only have a few computers, I usually can’t start working until the previous shift is done. But even before my shift officially starts, I try to help out or switch places with coworkers if needed. I’ve even gotten frustrated (not mad, just disappointed) when there’s nothing left for me to do because I get bored easily.

When I finish my tasks (often ahead of schedule), only then do I check my phone or watch YouTube — which is allowed in our setup. The moment another task comes in, I’m on it right away. That’s how I was raised: work is work. My coworkers can vouch for me (I do have great relationship with them).

As for the task my boss claimed I “never finished” — it was about getting approval for a messaging app. The issue was, the opt-in form had to be implemented on our website, which I don’t have access to. I told my boss this both in person and via email. He told me it was ""handled"" and to try again. I asked if I could edit the website myself. He said no — and, incredibly, admitted he doesn’t even know who handles our site. Eventually, someone else (our finance officer, who followed my instructions) got it approved. Still, I never got any acknowledgment or apology — just accusations and bad-mouthing.

Turns out, the real reason behind all this drama was because of one of my boss’s relatives. She’s not even that close to him — maybe an aunt or godparent — but she helps out at the makeshift office and handles salary distribution. She apparently doesn’t like me.

Why? Because I respectfully (literally no rude wordings or tone. I asked full of respect) asked her husband about my salary once. I didn’t get her text and missed it, so when she showed up, I immediately apologized — multiple times, even bowed while saying sorry the whole day I cant look at them on their eyes because of embarasment. She said it was all good and not to worry. Then the next day, she called me and said i should apologize to his husband because i accused of calling them thieves. Again, I apologized. Her husband said it was fine and I could go. I thought it ended there.

But no. That incident, plus whatever lies she spread, led to me being painted as some “lazy scam-caller” who almost got fired — all while I was on my day off. I’ve since talked to my boss. He says I’m not getting fired, but it’s clear he was easily manipulated.

Honestly, my motivation for this job is completely gone now.

I worked during my grandma’s wake.
I worked while sick.
I worked even when I was at home.
I’ve always fulfilled my responsibilities — and this is how it all turns out?

My supervisor is the only one who supports me. He knows how I work. But my passion for this job has disappeared. I’m now actively looking for a new opportunity.

If anyone is hiring for remote work, I’d appreciate it if you could reach out or drop a comment.

Experience:

IT Technician

Client Support Representative

Data Entry / Encoder

Operations Dispatcher

Experience includes working in both government (municipal) and logistics settings. I’m open to working with American, Filipino, Australian, or New Zealand clients (preferably NZ since my family is based there).

It would be entirely shot taking in that with my qualifications, it would probably a bit of a stretch, so I was wondering if it made sense to even try if there might be some tension for even applying (with low chance of success).

1kph8gd,Job Offer Battle,"Hello all,

Currently working as a Family Law Paralegal in a small-mid tier firm and have run into quite the predicament regarding a job offer.

Some background, I started at the current firm I am at as a legal admin in Jan 2024 and have worked my way up and was promoted to paralegal in Sept 2024. Since I have enjoyed my job and have been working well, I was learning the ropes of being a paralegal for the last part of 2024 and the start of 2025 in which bills were not my top priority but more so learning the job. Since in or around Feb 2025 I have hit and exceeded my billable target consistently and in fact bill more than some people who work full-time at my firm. In short and not to toot my own horn I am a top performer.

The owner of my firm is also very popular in a LOTE (language other than English) community in my city and I too speak this language. Recently I have completed and am about to get a NAATI certification (a certification allowing you to issue certified translation documents in Australia for official uses) as a translator and have been promised translating work by the current owner of the firm.

So here is the current situation: I attended an interview at another firm this week in which they were very impressed by me and claimed I was the top applicant and they were very much impressed by my knowledge, presentation and spoken ability. In other words I secured the job. My current TC (Total Compensation) is $65,000 plus super on a pro-rata rate of 3 days per week. The TC that I have been offered by the firm I interviewed at is $90,000 per annum + super + a monthly bonus which is 35% of however much $$$ I bill excess of my billable target, so if my target was 10,000 and I billed 13,000 my bonus would be in or around $1,050.

The offer blew me away, I am still a uni student (2nd year) and being offered this much is staggering. The offer is for a part-time position and suits me well.

The dilemma I have now is, do I go to this firm and risk loosing the translating work from my current firm?

I would greatly appreciate any advice anyone has regarding this and if you have questions about anything I haven't covered please feel free to ask.",Life_Manufacturer611,1,1.0,0,1747565645,2025-05-18 10:54:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kph8gd/job_offer_battle/,5,2025

1kpgpqa,Value of UpGrad’s Online MS in Data Science & AI (IIIT-B + LJMU) in the Job Market?,"Hey folks!

I’m currently working in cybersecurity (2 years experience) and recently enrolled in the online MS in Data Science & AI offered via UpGrad in collaboration with IIIT Bangalore and Liverpool John Moores University.

The curriculum looks solid, and I’ve seen some posts where people mention they got placed in decent roles after completing it. Also, the dual credential and exposure to both Indian and international coursework sounded like a good deal — especially for someone looking to transition or expand career options without leaving a full-time job.

However, since it’s completely online, I’m curious: 
How is this program perceived by employers, especially in India and internationally? Is the degree from LJMU/IIIT-B seen as credible and valuable in the data/AI job market? Anyone here who’s done it or knows someone who has — did it actually help in getting interviews or switching roles? And does it really give you the hands-on exposure needed to succeed in DS/AI roles?

Would love to hear real experiences, success stories, or even drawbacks.

I’m looking for some advice on a career path decision and would love to hear your thoughts. I’m currently considering two possible directions, and I want to choose the one that makes the most sense long-term in terms of growth, market demand, and compensation:

	1.	DynaTrace Expert / Monitoring Specialist (operations-focused) – This would be a solid, well-paying role with a deep technical focus on Application Performance Monitoring, primarily using DynaTrace. I’m interested in the topic, but I’m a bit concerned it might be too niche and limiting in the long run.

	2.	DevOps Engineer – This path involves working with a broader range of technologies (CI/CD, containers, IaC, cloud, etc.). It feels more dynamic and in-demand, but also potentially more stressful and chaotic. That said, it seems like it could open more doors in the future.

My background is more on the operations side, but I’m open to growing and learning.

Right now, I’m doing a DevOps internship at a startup, and I’ve got a full-time offer for a DevOps Engineer role with a 5.5 LPA package.

But honestly, I’m really confused about my next step.

From the beginning, I’ve had this strong desire to study further—either M.Tech from IITs or maybe MS abroad. But the job I’m currently in is very hectic, and I know I won’t be able to prepare for entrance exams like GATE or GRE alongside it.

Finance is also a concern. I can manage expenses for about a year, but not much beyond that. I’m also interested in trying for BARC, DRDO, or other government exams because I feel those are worth a shot too.

So, the idea I’ve come up with is this: instead of going full-time with a hectic job, maybe I can take up something less intense like working as an intern, part-time, or even teaching at a coaching center, and prepare seriously for all these exams in parallel.

Is this a practical plan? Or should I just take a strict 1-year drop and focus completely on exam prep?

Hi all – thanks in advance for reading and for any advice!

I’m 28, living in Chicago, and recently moved back home to save money and get a car. I currently make around $60k as a patient care coordinator at a large hospital. I’ve been in healthcare since I was 19—mostly in patient registration, front desk, and admin assistant roles across three hospitals. I’ve always stayed in jobs because they felt comfortable, but now I’m realizing that’s limited my growth.

I have an associate’s in Healthcare Admin and I’m going back for my bachelor’s (and eventually master’s) in Business Administration starting July 2025. It’s a self-paced program, and I’m hoping to complete both degrees within 1–2 years.

The challenge is that I feel stuck under a micromanaging boss who doesn’t really give me space to show what I’m capable of. She’s been at the company for 33 years, doesn’t have a degree, and is close friends with many of the higher-ups, which makes navigating around her tricky. She’s a nice person, just very controlling, and while I don’t want to cause tension, I do want to find a way to show my skills and potential without stepping on toes.

I know I want to stay in healthcare, but I’m not sure what direction to go in. I’m friendly, organized, and constantly take on tasks outside my title—like managing front desk staff schedules, handling billing/insurance issues, adjusting physician templates in Epic, and more. Sales reps always comment on how personable I am and how I remember names and build rapport.

What I do know: I’m interested in healthcare operations, project management, or practice management. I want long-term growth in a role and career. I’m open to certifications, volunteering, and side projects to build experience.

I’d love to grow within my current organization (it’s huge), but I just don’t know how to get noticed or move up without going through my current manager. I’m also unsure what direction suits my skills best—every time I try to list out what I’m good at or enjoy, I hit a blank.

Any advice on certifications, career paths, networking, or even who to follow on LinkedIn (or Chicago-based groups) would mean a lot.

1kpciiw,Did I get fired?,"I got fired because I didn't know i had adhd, autism and generalized anxiety

They asked me if I got my diagnosis and didn't directly fire me.
I'm not sure if I got fired. My boss told me her door was always open and I would tell her what problems were occurring and offered ideas..which ended up her thinking i was mouthing off.
I also was really burned out and didn't know as such. 
They gave me a well see warning..which ended up being ""can you quit or get fired"".
The warning was weird too. They said I was late a lot and I was usually the first one there. And the guy who said I was had not even been there for a year...the majority of my time there. 
They seemed like they made a lot of stuff up.

I wasnt even directly fired. I was just randomly called and told I was agreeing to be let go.

This job was the only thing I've been there a year in a while..I probably should add this on my resume, but they were awful. 

How can I list this?
Also, should I say i was fired if it was literally my adhd being undiagnosed??
And before I left...they made a big deal boyfriend being adhd friendly.

1kpccex,Reading is the most underrated career cheatcode - daily reading rebuilt my brain and my career,"I got laid off from Amazon after COVID when they outsourced our BI team to India and replaced half our workflow with automation. The ones who stayed weren’t better at SQL or Python - they just had better people skills. 

For two months, I applied to every job on LinkedIn and heard nothing. Then I stopped. I laid in bed, doomscrolled 5+ hours a day, and watched my motivation rot. I thought I was just tired. Then my girlfriend left me - and that cracked something open.

In that heartbreak haze, I realized something brutal: I hadn’t grown in years. Since college, I hadn’t finished a single book - five whole years of mental autopilot. 

Meanwhile, some of my friends - people who foresaw the layoffs, the AI boom, the chaos - were now running startups, freelancing like pros, or negotiating raises with confidence. What did they all have in common? They never stop self growth and they read. Daily.

So I ran a stupid little experiment: finish one book. Just one. I picked a memoir that mirrored my burnout. Then another. Then I tried a business book. Then a psychology one. I kept going. It’s been 7 months now, and I’m not the same person.

Reading daily didn’t just help me “get smarter.” It reprogrammed how I think. My mindset, work ethic, even how I speak in interviews - it all changed. I want to share this in case someone else out there feels as stuck and brain-fogged as I did. You’re not lazy. You just need better inputs. Start feeding your mind again.

As someone with ADHD, reading daily wasn’t easy at first. My brain wanted dopamine, not paragraphs. I’d reread the same page five times. That’s why these tools helped - they made learning actually stick, even on days I couldn’t sit still. Here’s what worked for me:
- The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: This book completely rewired how I think about wealth, happiness, and leverage. Naval’s mindset is pure clarity. This is the kind of book you highlight every single page.

- Principles by Ray Dalio: The founder of Bridgewater lays out the rules he used to build one of the biggest hedge funds in the world. It’s not just about work - it’s about how to think. Easily one of the most eye-opening books I’ve ever read.

- Can’t Hurt Me by David Goggins: NYT Bestseller. His brutal honesty about trauma and self-discipline lit a fire in me. This book will slap your excuses in the face.

- Deep Work by Cal Newport: Productivity bible. Made me rethink how shallow my work had become. Best book on regaining focus in a distracted world.

- The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel:  Super digestible. Helped me stop making emotional money decisions. Best finance book I’ve ever read, period.


Other tools & podcasts that helped 
- Lenny’s Newsletter: the best newsletter if you're in tech or product. Lenny (ex-Airbnb PM) shares real frameworks, growth tactics, and hiring advice. It's like free mentorship from a top-tier operator.

- BeFreed: A friend who worked at Google put me on this. It’s a smart reading & book summary app built for busy young professionals who want to learn more in less time and actually get an edge. You get to choose how deep you want to read/listen: 10 min skims, 40 min deep dives, 20 min podcast-style explainers, or flashcards to help stuff actually stick. I usually listen to the fun podcast version on the subway or at the gym. I tested it on books I’d already read and the deep dives covered ~80% of the key ideas. I recommend it to all my friends who never had time or energy to read daily.

- Ash: A friend told me about this when I was totally burnt out. It’s like therapy-lite for work stress - quick check-ins, calming tools, and mindset prompts that actually helped me feel human again.

- The Tim Ferriss Show - podcast – Endless value bombs. He interviews top performers and always digs deep into their habits and books.

Tbh, I used to think reading was just a checkbox for “smart” people. Now I see it as survival. It’s how you claw your way back when your mind is broken.

If you’re burnt out, heartbroken, or just numb - don’t wait for motivation. Pick up any book that speaks to what you’re feeling. Let it rewire you. Let it remind you that people before you have already written the answers.

You don’t need to figure everything out alone. You just need to start reading again.

1kpas4a,How to ask for a demotion/step down without getting fired?,"Hi there,

I have a law degree but I’m not a licensed attorney. I have worked in contracts for over 9 years. I work for a cybersecurity company. I was hired with the idea that I would take the contracts function away from the COO and possibly manage people in the future on a team. I was very successful because I’m really good at working with contracts and people tend to like working with me. One of my coworkers has said that I’m the best he’s seen in his 17 year career. Basically, everyone including the CEO loves my work and probably me to a certain extent. I recently was promoted to manage my department of one and then hired my first person and it isn’t going well. I still report to the COO but I do not enjoy working for him. I really do not enjoy any of the aspects/responsibilities of managing people and a department and I think I would like to step down to my previous role. My COO has told me he isn’t confident that I’m planning the direction of the department well. We recently hired a CFO who was the head of the contracts function at his previous company. My plan is to approach the COO and tell him I think the CFO would be better for managing the people/department, and that I’m better for doing the actual contracts work. I don’t think it’s that big of a risk because basically everyone loves me and if he fired me he would tank us being able to close any deals this and the next quarter in time without spending an absurd amount of money on outside legal fees. It would also be dumb of them to dump a great individual contributor because they don’t want to manage people.

1kp66d2,"2 years after graduation, and it feels like I have wasted 2 years at a mentally draining contracting job where I am mistreated,  constantly work unplanned overtime, and accomplishments are overlooked. Wanting to quit with nothing lined up","I (M24) am currently a contractor for F500, but I feel like my time over here is coming to an end as my mental health is deteriorating. I have lost faith in leadership, do the work of several people with no support, work gets overlooked/unnoticed and under appreciated, people getting fired, etc. We also work with sales reps who get 0 accountability since they are the ones making money for the company, so any errors will be put onto the team, so management tends to side with them. I constantly wake up 2 hours before my alarm in cold sweats and anxiety. 

Not to mention, going through all of this as a contractor when your other full time colleagues who perform the same tasks even less as you are getting paid more than you with benefits is absolutely the worst. I was fixing on transitioning from a contractor to a full time employee, but had that stripped away from me as a former employee was coming back, so that full time role was given to him. Also, my contract manager gets the final say if I become full time or not. The relationship between my contract manager and I is shaky as she refused to give me 5 days of bereavement, and if i went above 3, I’d be terminated. I had to travel outside the country for the funeral so 3 days of bereavement wasn’t possible. Luckily, my manager was able to convince her, but the fact that she gets the final say in becoming contractor to full time makes it feel like a dead end at this point. 

I graduated from a high ranking university in Supply Chain Management. My current job is within Supply Chain, but when I compare the responsibilities and tasks to my SCMT fellow alumni, it lacks a lot in skills that are lucrative in the SCMT job market. Skills such as power BI, microsoft office, and whatnot. I know have a lot of potential, but with this current shitty job market of high expectations and requirements, I just feel hopeless.  

I learned a lot on this job and am an employee that a lot of people rely on, but i still feel useless and a failure honestly. My colleagues compliment my work ethic on a daily basis and give management good word on my work. On the management side, I think this just their way of just giving me more work to do with no pay increase or anything. Just a pat on the back and a thank you.

I’m 30 and live in California and I have my whole life. I was smart and got good grades for most of my youth. But then I found drugs.

Essentially how studious I was and the confidence I had fell apart. I never got any higher education outside of a few classes at a JC. I have experience mainly as a waiter and in car sales. To be honest I was very successful at both. When my confidence is high and I’m taking care of myself I really shine when it comes to speaking to strangers and relating to them.

I managed to earn a bit into the 6 figures selling cars but this was during Covid when selling cars was incredibly lucrative. Despite that I was certainly one of the best salesmen there.

I’m willing to go to school, I’m willing to move, I have help from family financially. I’m blessed in a lot of ways.

1kp3x74,Advice? Scaled back work time but losing grip,"I’ve been with my company for almost five years now, working in a fast-paced industry. About three and a half years ago, I moved states to open a new branch. It was a huge step, but one I took with pride and determination. Since then, I've poured everything I had into building it up — hiring, training, developing people, and managing the day-to-day chaos that comes with growing something from the ground up.

Over the years, I’ve worked 12–14 hour days routinely. I felt like I had to — not just for myself, but for the people around me. Many of them relocated from other states to come work with me. I felt, and still feel, a deep sense of responsibility for their success, not just my own. I’ve trained people, built teams, let people go when I had to, and tried my best to create a structure that people could grow in.

Since January, I’ve been trying to scale back — leaving work earlier, around 2 or 3 p.m. instead of 6 or 7. I’ve been using that extra time to go to the gym or take care of things around the house. It’s been nice to finally catch my breath after years of nonstop work.

But I’ve also noticed something else — a growing feeling of disconnection. I don’t feel as in control as I used to. The field teams sometimes struggle because I’m not as available, and when they can’t reach me, there often isn’t anyone else who can help. That weighs on me. It feels like I’m letting people down. At the same time, I need this space for myself and my family. I can’t keep burning out.

So here I am — caught in this tension between giving everything to the job and reclaiming some time for my life. I don’t have an answer right now. I’m just wondering… how do you find that balance? How do you keep your business or team strong without losing yourself in the process?",InformationProper904,0,0.5,2,1747517584,2025-05-17 21:33:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kp3x74/advice_scaled_back_work_time_but_losing_grip/,5,2025
1kp3l53,Unpaid IIT Madras Internship vs Local Industry Training – Am I Throwing Away a Golden Opportunity or Just Dodging a Costly Mistake?,"Hey folks, I’m in a bit of a dilemma and would love some perspective.

I recently got two internship offers:

1. **Research Internship at IIT Madras** under a faculty (completely unpaid). It would cost me **\~₹30,000** in total for travel, stay, food, etc. It’s lab-oriented work, and from what I’ve heard through contacts, **there won’t be many students around** right now, so the networking opportunity is going to be limited. I’m **not very interested in research**, to be honest. I applied because some friends were applying too, and I wasn’t sure what I wanted at the time.
2. **Vocational Training at a Government Industry** in my **own city**. Also unpaid, but **no significant expenses involved**. It involves learning about **industrial operations and real-world plant systems**, which might be more relevant for a job in industry later on.

Now I’m questioning everything:

* Is it a mistake to reject an IIT Madras internship—even if it doesn’t align with my interests?
* Will the lab/research experience *actually* help if I’m targeting **industrial roles** and not academia?
* Do companies even value faculty-guided research internships from IITs in the hiring process?
* Will missing out on an IIT brand name now close doors for me later (MS/Jobs)?
* Should I invest in something I’m not passionate about just for prestige or resume boost?
* Or is it smarter to go for something more aligned with industry, even if it’s less “prestigious”?

Any insights from students, grads, or professionals who’ve faced something similar would be *super* helpful!

The role is extra help/at will so they can terminate us any day without prior notice, and they told us during training if we tell them we got a new job they will walk us out the same day. We also don't get PTO during this first half year and require doctor's note for sick days, especially if 3+ days. We can only take an unpaid day off for emergencies but have to tell our training manager which may raise red flags that we're interviewing elsewhere.

 I have been struggling a lot financially as of late and really need to get a secondary job. I currently work as a caregiver and have been for the last 5 years but on top of needing the extra income I really need a change. I love my job but itch for growth and a change is getting overwhelming. I looked over my resume and have altered it to focus less on care giving and more emphasis on the skills I have acquired from working (can lift over 50lbs, able to be on my feet for long hours, problem solving skills, etc) but I’m always rejected. I’m not sure what I need to do or how to go about it. I believe the main problem is my lack of experience in the roles I applied for. I’m just lost at how I’m supposed to gain experience if never given the opportunity to acquire it. If anyone has any advise on what i should do or if someone from an employers perspective can fill me in on what is looked for and what is passed on it would mean the world to me and I’d greatly appreciate it. <3",anon36947,1,1.0,0,1747511422,2025-05-17 19:50:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kp1n7n/advise_on_gaining_experience_to_change_careers/,5,2025

I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with my job search and hoping to tap into the collective wisdom here. I'm from India and have a BSc in Physics, along with experience in billing and basic  accounts (using Tally). I'm looking for entry-level opportunities in Europe (anywhere), ideally remote, but I'm open to office-based roles with a stable environment.

I'm being upfront about the fact that I experience anxiety, and panic attacks most of the time  which makes the job search process particularly challenging. I really need a role that doesn't involve a lot of unpredictable travel and offers a sense of routine. Remote work would be a huge help, or a role that allows me to settle in before potentially transitioning to an office.

I'm really willing to learn new skills  something specific to improve my chances. I'm actively looking into online courses, but I'm not sure where to focus my efforts.

I'd be grateful for any advice on:

1.What types of entry-level jobs should I apply for ?

1koupvo,Career advice for an aspiring teacher,"So right now I am at a crossroads and have to make a difficult choice. For starters, I have worked in education for three years now. My first two years I was a on-site sub and got lots of experience teaching a variety of grade. My third year I taught a 4th grade class full-time in Oakland with an emergency credential.

This year I had been applying to multiple schools for the teacher education programs with the intent to earn my masters and credential within one year. I was fortunate to have been accepted into Berkeley's program, which I am excited to have the opportunity to do. I was an awful student for most of my life so it means a lot to me for achieving this goal. However, a few days ago, a teacher at my previous school mentioned that there is a position opening up and recommended that I should apply for it, and receive my masters and credential through the ACOE Reach program. If it were any other school I would say hell no, but that school is very special to me. It was also my goal to earn my credential and somehow return. The opportunity feels very serendipitous. 

Part of me feels crazy for passing up on Berkeley. I know that I would learn so much from being there and would help me grow as an educator/person. But, financially would be very strenuous. The program/cost of living is around 60,000 and my only means of finance is loans and a 20,000 stipend. The financial uncertainty causes a lot of anxiety for me, especially since the program starts 6/16 and I haven't received any further financial information. If I apply for the teaching position, I feel like I'm losing out on a unique experience, for my and my SO. But I would still be making money and working towards the same end goals (masters and credential). The hard part is that all of this basically needs to be decided in 3 weeks since, our lease ends (so we'd have to move to Berkeley) and the program starts. 

Both of these options are great, but are both so life changing/different. I would appreciate any wisdom or advice, thanks teachers.",kdiamo16,1,1.0,0,1747493255,2025-05-17 14:47:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1koupvo/career_advice_for_an_aspiring_teacher/,5,2025
1kouhc2,Manager giving a hard time,"Hi, I work at a reputed IT organization that offers a low salary while demanding excessive effort. During my interview, I attempted to negotiate with HR, but they responded with a thinly veiled threat of withdrawing the offer, leaving me with no choice but to accept their terms.  

Initially, things were going well. I built a strong rapport with Tom (my client manager), who appreciated my work but wanted me to mainly increase my speed. However, trouble began when Sanjay (my payroll organization manager) entered the picture. He seemed to dislike me from the start, though I only realized it later.

Sanjay actively worked to create a rift between me and Tom. He brought in Vikram (a newly hired team leader), convinced him that he was better suited for my role, and pushed for my replacement. Vikram, despite lacking my expertise, became Sanjay’s go-to person because he blindly followed instructions—an ideal ""yes man"", but kinda short on results.

Tom continued to support me, but Sanjay kept applying undue pressure, making Tom doubt my capabilities. Eventually, Tom decided to move to a different team due to personal reasons related to work hours and family commitments. With Tom leaving, Sanjay now has a clearer path to push me out.

Sanjay is far from a good leader. He frequently makes demeaning remarks such as:  
- ""You guys can’t do a single thing properly, but you come asking for leaves.""  
- ""I’m not going to approve your night shift allowances"" —citing the fact that we log out 10-15 minutes early, despite this being a negligible difference.  

Beyond these remarks, his requests often seem irrational. The entire team has recognized his pattern of targeting me, but I’ve usually managed to defend myself. However, the toxicity persists.  

Recently, another dispute occurred. In a group chat, I tried to be diplomatic with one of his asks and said:  
""I understand your frustration, but please try to understand my situation.""

Sanjay responded, claiming he was being lenient and understood our circumstances. Later, although nothing I had said was wrong, I felt bad for my assertive tone and sent him a private apology—but received no response.  

The next day, mea few team members were called into a meeting with Sanjay and Rajesh (his manager). The initial discussion covered the return-to-office mandate. Then, everyone except me was dismissed.  

Once alone, I faced an onslaught of accusations from Sanjay, including:  
- Claiming I take ""more than 4 hours of break"" in a 9-hour shift (I never exceed 1.5 hours and am sharp with my timings).  
- Insisting I don’t complete assigned work (he deliberately and immediately reassigned my tasks to Vikram, after asking me once for namesake).

I attempted to clarify my position, but my responses ended up sounding defensive. Before closing the meeting, I was instructed to follow more structured office timings which I agreed to. In response, Sanjay condescendingly told me not to use “big words like frustrated” and ended the call which I then realised was probably his way of revenge.

The Path Forward

I am torn between two choices:  
1. Neutralizing the Situation – Finding ways to de-escalate the tension, which I doubt will be worth all the effort.  
2. Walking Away from the Toxicity – Leaving the organization altogether, which is a harder choice especially due to current job market and my financial situation.  

Currently, I’m searching for a new job, but it's difficult due to my three-month long notice period and my higher salary expectations, which are merely slightly above the market average, after leaving some room for negotiation.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this. Am I overthinking it, or is there a better way to handle the situation?
Any advice, thoughts or insights would be incredibly helpful.

1kottct,How do I deal with feeling used by a coworker I helped during training?,"I'm a guy in my late 20s. Growing up, I dealt with a lot of disrespect—both in school and at home. I've worked hard over the years to grow past that, and I try to be emotionally aware and helpful to others.

I recently started a new job, and during training, there was a woman in her late 30s who was going through a divorce and dealing with a lot of stress. She's also an immigrant, and early on she confided in me about her personal struggles once we completed our 3 week training and we were now working on the floor in the office. I wanted to be supportive, so I helped her a lot with her work—explaining tasks, answering her questions, and just being there when she seemed overwhelmed.

But after a few weeks, I started to feel drained. She relied on me constantly and often interrupted my own work. She was also putting pressure on other teammates, and it became exhausting.

Now that things are coming together, she’s doing great—completing 8 tasks a day like most of the team. I'm still only at 5. She barely acknowledges me anymore (she even privately sent this appreciation card thing we have at work to another coworker and it was shared during a team meeting but she never mentioned me). She only reaches out when she needs something, and even then, sometimes not for days. When I recently asked *her* a question, she responded slowly.

I’m honestly starting to resent her. I feel like I supported her when she was struggling, and now that she’s thriving, I don’t even exist to her. I know I shouldn’t expect anything in return, but it feels like I was just used as a stepping stone.

I talked to my dad about it, also an immigrant, but he just yelled at me to stop complaining and “work harder.” He told me I *should’ve* supported her because she was stressed and he seemed easy going on her—and now that I did, I should move on. But he tends to dismiss my feelings in general, and it’s really starting to wear me down. He's just telling me to ""work harder"" do 9 or more a day which isn't even realistic.",Green-Soil2670,2,1.0,6,1747490779,2025-05-17 14:06:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kottct/how_do_i_deal_with_feeling_used_by_a_coworker_i/,5,2025

1koskfl,"Bully supervisor, what should I bring up to my boss about the situation and what should I 'let slide'?","I have PTSD and a hard time with communication. Im working with a supervisor that has seemed to pick me out, I over explained a mistake I made and she decided to bully me after and im unsure of how to proceed without causing more drama. I feel like she being subtle  but also gossiping to my direct supervisor who I dont see as much of. I dont have a relationship with my supervisor like she does, obviously, so I'm not sure how to discuss this. Its important to note I work with a vulnerable population so being watched/cameras/being checked in on is not uncommon or what im complaining about. 


Ive only had a few expierences with her but its only been a few weeks that ive worked here and things are escalating, they include: 

Giving me odd looks when I go to do my work tasks, and then I noticed she would sometimes run off into the back offices (where the supervisors all hang out) and my supervisor would pop up. Theyd never say if anything was wrong but it was clear that my supervisor was checking on me over a 'worry' of this supervisor. 


I left a room that needs to stay locked at all times its not in use. Its a commonly used room and people go in and out all day. Its a very small work space so she can see me all day when she is there. I left the room and she came up to me and asked in a rude tone ""did you lock that? 😒"". Ive never seen anyone asked that, and ive never left the door unlocked so i figure she wanted it open. I said I did lock it, sorry if she wanted in there and she responded ""no...its supposed to be locked"" and just walked off. I just responded with an ""okay.."" 


I ignored those things, thinking that was the vest thing to do but they are escalating. Bad supervisor tried to make the person I work with do an activity they didnt want to.  Even though shes not my supervisor shes still technically my boss and in charge. I already asked my cleint if they wanted to participate and they declined I watched while she tried to block my client into a certain area until my client became very upset and the supervisor threw up her hands said ""never mind then"" and walked off, leaving me to sucessfully calm and help my client. A few of my coworkers also saw and were not happy with her but im not sure what happened because it was mentioned to me by my direct supervisor that my client shouldnt be forced to do those activities....as if I was the one who did it.

There was also a toy that I was told belonged to a client when it was the property of the work place, making it community property. Since I was told that it belonged to my client I obviously made sure no one else took it as we are supposed to. No one told me it was community property throught the day, the girl that told me it was his personal property actually told me the next day that it was community property and I told her I disnt know. Then my supervisor was hinting at that I take things from other clients for my client and I had to state that ""no, i wouldnt take something from someone and give it to someone else unless it was their property"" but I didnt connect it to the toy so I didnt bring it up or directly discuss it. 

 I emailed her asking to talk about the situation. I feel like communication here is more like highschool gossip than actual communication and i dont know how to handle it. I dont read social situations well, i do my job well and Im reliable but I can not navigate social things and this feels far more social than professional.",Open_Examination_591,3,1.0,2,1747487212,2025-05-17 13:06:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1koskfl/bully_supervisor_what_should_i_bring_up_to_my/,5,2025

1kor25v,Torn between 1099 vs W2 for a sales manager role. Please advice.,"Hey all, I was recently laid off from a company I gave the last five years to in sales leadership. I’m currently on the hunt for a new role—specifically something stable like a W2 Sales Manager position with benefits, structure, and long-term growth.

I’ve been sending out hundreds of resumes. Literally. Out of all that outreach, the only company to get back to me within the same day was offering a Sales Manager position… but it’s a 1099 role.

The offer sounds strong on paper—high commission potential, leadership responsibilities, and no income cap—but of course, no benefits, no tax withholding, no PTO, and no long-term security. When I do the math, even with a $150K+ gross earning potential, after expenses, taxes, and trying to save responsibly, it feels like I might end up with about the same net as a much lower-salaried W2 role.

So now I’m stuck in this weird place. Do I take the 1099 opportunity just to stay moving and build some income while continuing to look for W2 roles? Or is this the kind of thing that ends up looking like a short-term grind with no long-term payoff?

Would love to hear from others who’ve faced this dilemma—or who’ve taken 1099 sales manager gigs. How successful was it for you? Would you do it again?",CoatTiny8470,1,1.0,1,1747482434,2025-05-17 11:47:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kor25v/torn_between_1099_vs_w2_for_a_sales_manager_role/,5,2025
1kor0ob,My (28f) boss (50sf) and her boss (40sM) are making me keep a feelings journal to get promoted.,"A few days ago I had a meeting with my boss (f)'s boss(m) (who used to be my boss, before f was promoted to be my chain of command). In this meeting, I told him I didnt get any actionable support on a situation I brought to my boss that multiple people in my office were uncomfortable with. Her resolution was ""I'm not uncomfortable with it, if the situation gets worse then we'll do something."" 

To me, this was her taking no action. When he brought the situation to her attention, she informed him that she did take action and told him what her resolution was. He then brought me into the room and asked why I lied about it, and I stated that to me, that was no action and that the rest of the team also felt that way about the way she handled it. 

Here's where we get to the main problem. He asked me why no one else would come to her about this issue. I made the mistake of blurting out ""because no one finds talking to her productive."" He then took this as I was making a massive accusation of her being difficult to work with and I can't say things like that without concrete evidence. 

I clarified that I wasnt accusing her of anything. He and I have discussed previously that she is inflexible. Her word is law so most people dont come to her for things, because after she makes her judgement there will be no changing it.

He again said I cannot make this statement without concrete evidence and if I wasnt going to produce it I was creating a narrative about her and it needed to stop now. 

I refused to give evidence so I didnt involve anyone else. I also didnt have anything documented so he called any examples I had conjecture.
 
Now, yesterday I get my promotional development plan back with only 1 action item. To keep a journal of my feelings and interactions that cause me to have strong reactions to review with my boss weekly and her boss monthly. They stated I was professionally immature in this aspect and not ready for the next step in my career. 

I feel like this is not only infantilizing, but could also be incriminating. I want to ask for an alternative action item, but I feel like anything I say now will be interpretated as ""throwing a fit.""

1koqy0v,Need advice: Should I study Computer Science in China with a scholarship or wait for Europe/US?,"
Hey everyone! I really need some help and advice.
I'm a Moroccan student, and I'm about to take my baccalaureate exam this month. My grades have always been good, and l'm hoping to score above 16/20. l've been researching scholarships and came across Chinese universities that offer full scholarships for international students — especially in Computer Science, which is my dream major.
But I still have some worries and questions, and I'd really appreciate honest opinions: • Are Chinese universities good for Computer Science (especially for undergrad)? • Is it true that there are very few job opportunities in
China after graduation for international students? •
I'm considering studying in China for my bachelor's, then applying for a fully funded master's through Chevening in the UK or another program in the US or Europe. Is that possible or realistic?
Or should I take
some time to prepare for IELTS/TOEFL and apply directly to universities in Europe or the US instead of going to China?
I don't have a big budget, so getting a full scholarship is really important for me and my family.
I'm so confused and feel stuck between options. If anyone has gone through a similar situation or has any advice, please help me decide.

1konrnn,i need advice on if i should taking a new job offer or stay at my current place,"I currently work for a large chain company at their main corporate location (I’d rather not say the name for privacy reasons). I’m in the IT department working a Level 1 Help Desk role. I make $24.50 an hour and the job comes with great benefits. Honestly, the work is pretty easy and I’m already very comfortable in the role.

I recently received a job offer from a different company that installs fiber optics and works in the renewable energy space. They’re offering $27 an hour for an IT Level 2 position. This new job is hybrid—2 days working from home, 3 days in the office—and the office is only 5 minutes from my house. From what I can tell, there seems to be a lot more room for growth at this company, especially in areas I'm interested in.

However, I'm unsure about making the switch. The new company uses different technologies, so I’d have to re-familiarize myself with a whole new set of systems and tools. It’s a bit intimidating to start over when I’m already so settled in my current position.

Also, I’m pretty sure that if I tell my current employer about the offer, they’ll try to match or even beat it to keep me. That would mean even more money to stay where I’m already comfortable.

So now I’m stuck between two options:

1. Stay in my current job—stable, easy, all in-office (30 min commute), but familiar and possibly better pay if they counteroffer.
2. Take the new role—more money upfront, shorter commute, hybrid schedule, room for growth, but with new systems to learn and a bit of uncertainty.

1konaxh,Cybersecurity Professional Pursuing MS in Data Science & AI – Career Switch or Strategic Combo?,"Hey everyone!

Here’s a bit about me:
I am 24F. I did my B.Tech in Cyber Security & Forensics and have been working in the cybersecurity domain for the past 2 years. So far, it’s been a solid journey – I enjoy the field, and it’s definitely a critical part of the tech world.

Now, I’ve recently taken a step that’s both exciting and slightly nerve-wracking. I’ve enrolled in a dual MS program in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence from IIIT Bangalore and Liverpool John Moores University. It’s a remote program, so I’ll be doing this alongside my full-time job.

My reasoning:
	•	AI and Data Science are booming fields.
	•	I didn’t want to be siloed in one niche – I want to future-proof my career and stay versatile.
	•	The program has reputable institutions behind it, so the brand value is there too.

Now here’s where I need your input:
	•	Am I making the right move, or am I spreading myself too thin?
	•	Will this be seen as a career switch, or can I merge cybersecurity with AI/DS in a way that makes me even more valuable?
	•	Are there roles or paths that combine both domains where this “power puff” combo of specializations can shine?

Any advice, suggestions, or even “things I wish I knew before doing this” would be deeply appreciated!

1kom1m9,UPDATE: I got a final warning without any previous warnings,"I posted recently on here but I have updates to the situation 

I was supervising the self check out lane at the Whole Foods store I work at, and someone comes over with NON-alcoholic wine, but it still asked me to ID him. But at my store I was trained that I don’t have to ID everyone, I only have to ID people that look 40 or younger in the employee’s opinion, the employee is aloud to bypass the screen and does NOT have to scan/see the customer’s ID if they appear to be older then 35. Also for some reason non alcoholic beer doesn’t require an ID, but non alcoholic wine does.


This customer looked like he was around 40 years old or so, but I ended up asking to see his ID, but the rule is, once I ask for an ID, the customer than HAS to provide an ID, which I don’t remember being told that rule during my original training. But anyway, he got a bit upset and asked if I could just bypass it. I did because of the other rule that if someone looks in my opinion 40 or older,  I can bypass it without getting into trouble, But Because I asked first to see an ID and because he did provide it. I got final warning. I had no previous warnings and I’ve been working here for 8 months, never called out once, and I’ve been on time every single day. And it jumped straight to a final.

Also, it escalated to HR somehow and it took them 5 days to come to that decision. So I was scared I was gonna get fired for 5 days straight while still having to go to work without knowing if I’ll have a job or not the next day. 

Was I in the wrong here? I need a second opinion. Thanks

1koki2s,How can I make a persuasive case for why I (and my coworkers) deserve a living wage in my upcoming compensation and classification meeting?,"I (F, 30s) am a preschool teacher at a private, for-profit program in the US.  We are in the south, so cost of living is among the top 10 in the country for affordability.

We are paid double minimum wage, and “competitive” wages compared to other preschool and childcare facilities in the state. Still, according to the MIT living wage calculator ([livingwage.mit.edu](http://livingwage.mit.edu)) a single adult with no children would need to earn at least $6 more per hour to support themselves. With 1 child, you would need an additional $21 per hour. 

I have more than 10 years of experience and a bachelor’s degree. I’m good at what I do, and dedicated to continuously learning how to keep improving. As part of an AZA accredited zoo, we offer an incredibly unique program with a nature-based curriculum and daily trips in the zoo. But I don’t make enough money to have my own apartment without it being more than 50% of my income.

When I last brought up our wages to our coordinator (after learning the summer camp staff — largely teenagers — would be making 75 cents more per hour than the year-round teachers) they reminded me that all teachers are underpaid, and maybe I was just in the wrong field and would be “better off flippin’ burgers”. They also told me I “wasn’t a tree and could leave if I wanted”. This was disheartening and insulting. I don’t think “other people are also underpaid so you shouldn’t complain and if you don’t like it you can work at McDonalds” is a good argument. 

I don’t expect to actually get a raise. I don’t expect HR or any of my superiors to agree with me or take a single step to better financially accommodate the teachers. But I think it is important to not just accept that teaching is underpaid and undervalued in our society. I think it is important to push back and remind everyone that that simply isn’t right. 

I’ve sat through these meetings before and the HR rep shows us charts and numbers that paint us as fortunate workers of a generous company, ignoring the fact that despite calling what we do a “career” and insisting we are “valued”, our education level or years of experience have no impact on our compensation, and our pay is only compared to other employers, not to cost of living. 

I want to be civil and fair and advocate for myself and my coworkers. I’m honestly seeking a new career path because I know this won’t change anytime soon and I can’t wait around for the whole system to be revamped. I do genuinely love this workplace and its mission. However, I would like to gently point out to them their metrics of fairness are based on selective information that allows the organization to succeed by demanding workers be less than independent.

So. What do I say on Monday when they tell us we will not be earning a living wage and that because other people also aren’t earning a living wage, this is fair. (Without coming across as hostile).

**TLDR**; Early childcare educator in a for-profit program wants to politely address that teachers deserve a living wage in upcoming comp and class meeting. Not expecting results in this lifetime. ",trainhops,4,0.6299999952316284,25,1747456000,2025-05-17 04:26:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1koki2s/how_can_i_make_a_persuasive_case_for_why_i_and_my/,5,2025
1kojpyl,New job dilemma,"So I don’t want to go into specifics obviously, but I was recently offered a new job with a title increase and a considerable raise too. However my dilemma is that I’m not good at my current job… kind of. 

I’ve been at this current company for a long time and when I was junior I worked really hard and was good at my job and was on top of my work and was promoted a few times eventually working to a middle management job. But after a few years I just stopped trying and started doing the bare minimum sometimes even less than that and it’s just gotten worse over the last couple years. For the most part my current company hasn’t noticed and years of goodwill have been carrying me for a long time.

When I do try at my current job I actually do a pretty decent job and I know what I should be doing 85% of the time. But my worry is that I’m going to go to this new job and have no idea what I’m doing. 

I’ve been convincing myself that a new job will respark the work ethic and interest in my career that I had years ago but I don’t know if that’s possible.

Most people in my family do not get full blown careers so I tried to choose the “smartest” choice.

So I’m seeking guidance ALSO where I am In the USA college for me is debt free, so I not worried about paying it off for ether degree. I’m also already been excepted to a liberal arts college so I’m also in a college.

I originally wanted to aim for accounting because I had heard it was the smartest since it was well paying and stable and recession proof. Also since most adults cited how they wished they went into it. I’m not math savvy but I do understand financial stuff pretty well, even if it’s not my favorite thing to do. I don’t need to be super passionate about a career I just want it to be ok with doing it

recently now between everyone talking about the layoffs, offshore, and AI for accounting I’m not sure if I want to. I’m only doing accounting for the stability, nothing is truest stable I’m aware but it’s the main reason why I’m going for it

Then on the other hand there’s speech pathology b am actually truly interested in. I like learning about psychology and medicine. As a personal thing when I was a kid I had a speech pathologists who touched my heart taking my current hyper-fixation whether that be bugs or Pokémon go help me speak better, ever lesson helped so much just to help me feel alive. I cried the day she left my life when the practice closed she meant so much. I have worked with kids and I love some days I’m frustrated some days but overall it was positive. I know it always be needed and in my area there’s a shortage.

Though I’m aware that’s not sunshine and rainbows. Most SLPS on Reddit and YouTube seem to hate it, saying how stale it is, how there’s no growth, how they can escape, etc.) I don’t want to go for this job and sunk all my time away and end up needing to change or be burnt out. Yet even when touring my college the kids I get along with and I feel most comfortable are all people who are I communications and arts, it feels I don’t want to be foolish but everything about speech pathology aligns with me.

I’m scared I’m not “passionate” enough. In reality I just want appropriate job I can make it in NYC with Im not sure what to do so if I can get advice from People majoring

1kohdjz,80k or 100k,"I need to decide which company I'm going to work for this weekend.

Company A: 100k flat (after promotion)

* Current company
* I love the team
* High stress although is supposed to change
* Culture is more laid back
* Room for growth
* I feel valuable here
* Good one on one training
* Manager is a real bro and I can talk to him on a personal level

Negatives:

* Software is lackluster
* Plays favorite (I'm the favorite right now)
* Don't see a long term future / retirement here
* No set raise dates, took quitting to get a promotion/raise

Company B: 80k + monthly commission bonuses $0-$6000 ($1200-$2000 average)

* Worked here before at a different location, loved it.
* More professional relationships, not as personal
* Low to moderate stress
* Culture is more professional, no ""locker room talk""
* I wouldn't get as much attention here
* Yearly performance reviews / raises opportunities
* Great talent work here
* Growth opportunities
* \#1 company in this industry

Negatives:

* I haven't worked with these people yet - total gamble
* More isolated / not as social
* Lower base pay, higher potential pay

I've never had to make a harder decision in my entire life. The money would essentially be the same, however a guaranteed 6 figures would be nice. Company A, I don't see a long-term future with. Company B I think I could retire at (I would be replacing someone who was there 23 years). If certain people left company A, I think I wouldn't enjoy it as much, and company B I enjoyed despite nobody really talking to me. 

  
There are very important pros and cons to each and it's difficult trying to decide which ones are more important to me. I am at the point in my life where I am looking for a resting place, but I also enjoy the social aspect and freedom I have at my current job.

I have been feeiling immense guilt since then because I didn't finish the year and it's right before the holidays.

But anyway it means that I won't get a great reference and I feel like my teaching career is basically over.

Prior to this, I did a PGCE plus 2 previous years abroad.

I now have to suck it up and go back to the UK and I don't know what to do next.

I thought getting out of my toxic classroom would bring relief but the manner of my exit has had me beating myself up for not being stronger and toughing it out for longer.

Plus, I'm under just as much if not more stress worrying about money, my future, and the destruction of all the good will I had built up in my career and CV up to this point.

I feel like my career and life is over and I don't know what to do next.

Does anyone have any advice?

I considered potentially sucking it up and grovelling back for any kind of other role (since I've already been replaced) at my last school but I fear that's just backtracking rather than a good decision since I'd probably not be welcomed with open arms.

I’m supposed to get their official counter offer on Monday. I have an offer at a different company for a nearly $20k raise with lower levels of responsibility. I told my current company this and that for me to consider staying the offer would have to be higher than what I’m being offered at the new company due to gaps in responsibility. I’ve been discussing with my current company for several months about a promotion and raise due to them giving me more responsibility without compensation and it took my resignation for them to finally offer. I know from what I’m saying the clear answer is to go to the new company. But, I have unlimited PTO currently and we are actually encouraged to use it. I haven’t had any issues taking time off when I want to. I also don’t have to track my time and we are trusted to work as much as needed to get things done. This makes my work really flexible and I’m able to log off early when my work is done. I’ve worked more than 40 hours in a week maybe twice in the 1.5 years I’ve been there. At the new company, I don’t have unlimited PTO and have to wait for it to accrue. I’m getting married in a year and am already planning to save up as much PTO as I can for that if I take the new position. I will also have to track my hours in the new position & work a full week regardless of workload. I’m in the very early stages of my career and I like the idea of a new workplace, but I know I will miss some of those benefits from my previous position. I am grossly underpaid right now which is why I’ve been looking for something new and this bump will have me working at market value at the new position. The flexibility I will be losing is what is tripping me up more than anything. If my current company gives me a counter offer with a salary that I’m much more comfortable with, is it worth it to take it? How much more should I ask for from my current company? I know it will have to be a decent amount more than what I’ve been offered because of the disparity in responsibilities between positions. Both of these positions are completely remote as well.

I have just had an interview for a job a weird shift schedule - atleast not one I am used to. Basically, Week 1 and 2 are just normal 8-16 days working monday til friday, week 3 is on-call work from 7pm-07am monday til friday + 2x24 hours covering the weekend. Week 4 is a rest week and then you start over from week 1. I asked the company whether duty allowance (is that the right word?) was part of the salary package, but they said it was not - the fourth week would basically be the compensation. To add some context, my current job pays me around $13k a month ($6.7k base, $1.5k duty allowance and $4.8k bonus), but a completely normal office job would probably be around $6.7k a month. So when I came up with my salary requirement I said $8.3k as a rough estimate, because I have absolutely NO IDEA how many of the hours when I am on-call I'll actually be working and because those hours are predominantly evening and night. I also based it on the number of hours i'd be on-call, which totals at 104 hours. In my opinion, 1 week off hardly makes up for that and I'd need a higher salary than i'd usually require to conpensate for that. It seems like the company thinks I am way off so I would like to recieve the opinion of others. Am I completely off or is the company trying to screw me?

My question is, how do I go about explaining the gap on my resume caused by my health? 

My current doctor has already said that they would be willing to write a letter explaining that I indeed went through quite a medical experience, but my anxiety surrounding talking about my health experience still persists.

1koc5b3,What exactly is “logical thinking” at work?,"Whether in the interview process or in the communication with the mentor. I am often asked ""What is your **logic** for doing this?""
After several interviews and actual work experience, I found that if a person can express ""logical thinking"" clearly through language. Then his interview performance and work ability will basically not be bad.

Logical thinking is actually the most important content in the interview, accounting for more than 80% of the interview content, hidden in various questions. Preparing the interview question bank in advance can certainly solve 80% of the interview problems, but once the interviewer pays attention to the 20% of the questions that are not prepared, how should you deal with it?

Of course, it depends on your thinking ability and expression ability, that is, ""logical thinking"". The simplest manifestation of logical thinking is to ""start from the end"" when analyzing a problem, starting from the purpose, and then reversing the process and means of implementation, so as to broaden your thinking at multiple levels.

You can find more interview cheat sheets related to the position, and then try to answer them yourself using the **STAR rule**, and review them with the logic of starting from the end! If you don't know the specific example goals or practical applications, I recommend you to use some GPTs or Beyz interview assistant (15min free trial of all functions). The logical framework of AI is very complete, but their shortcomings are also obvious. There is only a framework, but no actual content that can impress people. So some people's answers seem to be standard and excellent, but they look empty and robot-like in the eyes of the interviewer.

What we have to do is not to blindly ""resist"" AI, but to use these free and open functions for our own use. You can even practice logical thinking by doing math problems (if you want...)

In short, practice more! And there must be something ""substantial"". It can be written text, training records in Beyz, or even a video. Then review it based on ""logical thinking"" and summarize your experience. 

Your interview will definitely be different half a month later! Come on!!! No one can answer fluently without preparation, and opportunities are always reserved for those who are prepared!",CreditOk5063,1,1.0,0,1747430292,2025-05-16 21:18:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1koc5b3/what_exactly_is_logical_thinking_at_work/,5,2025
1kobwr7,AI Engineer Burnout – Want to Transition to Product Management (Need Advice),"Hi everyone

I (24M) currently working as an AI Engineer in a service-based company, but in reality, most of my day-to-day work revolves around backend engineering.
I have 5.5 YOE in AI/ML. But:

- I'm severely underpaid compared to market standards.
- I’m on-call constantly, and I’ve been overworked for months — can’t even recall the last time I had a workday shorter than 14 hours.
- My skill set includes AI/ML, LLM fine-tuning, and  backend work (python-based).
- I’m also pursuing an Executive PG program in AI/ML from a top IIT in India to solidify my foundation.

Now here’s the twist — I want to transition to a Product Manager role. I know it's a different ballgame, and I don’t have direct PM experience, but I genuinely enjoy solving user problems, understanding product value, and connecting technical depth to business outcomes (tbh not being on-call everyday is also an indirect motivator).

Questions:

1. How realistic is it to transition to a PM role from a technical background like mine?
2. What steps should I take to make myself a strong candidate for APM/PM roles (courses, certifications, side projects)?
3. Are there any companies/startups that are open to hiring PMs with strong tech experience but no prior product management history?

Any advice, resources, or stories from people who’ve done this pivot would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance!

1koblqt,Should I wait to put in my 2 weeks?,"Hi all. I recently got an offer letter for a company on Wednesday and the big bosses all messaged me via email/linkedin congratulating me and providing me next steps (benefits, onboarding, etc.) but also sent over a background check from Checkr which came back showing a previous offence. 5 years ago (2020) I got a 2nd OWI/hit and run but was brought down to a misdemeanor because of the circumstances. I'm so ashamed of it and have been sober since and no other things on my record before or after that. I'm worried this will disqualify me. This is for a remote marketing role that doesn't include any driving so I'm not sure it applies, but it still is a horrible thing to have on a record so I'm just worried and embarrassed :(

The background check came yesterday morning at 8 AM and I was notified that it went to my new employer for review. I have not heard anything yet so I'm not sure if I should reach out and explain or leave it? Idk what to think and I wanted to put in my two weeks at my current job today.

I did reach out to the recruiter this AM saying I was excited and I was putting in my two weeks today at my current job and they responded saying ""great news! we can't wait for you to join the team!"".

1kobaxs,How limiting is it to not have an ABET-accredited degree for failure analysis roles,"Hello everyone, I’m currently an undergrad trying to plan out my career path, and I’m looking for advice from people who work in materials testing or failure analysis.

I am interested in a career in failure analysis, perhaps working in industry lab, R&D teams or product reliability as a failure analysis engineer. I am interested analyzing how and why materials or components fail (mechanical wear, corrosion, degradation, etc.) and interested in working with tools to find and discover failure modes

Im considering between two majors, Engineering Science(ESG) and Engineering Chemistry(ECM) both of which are part of the Materials Science and engineering department in my school but are slightly different. The ESG program is traditional engineering program which covers multiple disciplines of engineering with a focus on the materials aspect and allows for specializations in a particular field. Meanwhile the ECM program is a more chemistry-heavy program that focuses on physical chem, solid-state science, and some materials science. In addition to the ECM major, i might add on a mechanical engineering minor and a materials science and engineering minors to supplement the lack of engineering course like stress analysis, failure modes, and mechanical properties.

My main question is:

1)How much does a lack of ABET accreditation affect my chances of getting a job in failure analysis — especially in roles that involve lab work, materials testing (e.g. SEM/EDS), QA/QC, or product evaluation?

2)Would a degree like the ECM program — with the right coursework, lab skills, accompanying minors, and maybe internships — be enough? Or do most employers screen out applicants from non-ABET programs, even for lab-based or materials-focused roles?

If anyone has made it into failure analysis or materials labs with a non-ABET background (especially something chemistry-based), I’d really appreciate hearing how you navigated that.

Thank you in advance for any and all insights

1koa1ga,Trying to leave academia and get into ESG (social equity and impact). What should I do?,"I posted a similar version of this on r/LeavingAcademia but maybe this sub can also help me out. 

I'm Feeling stuck and disillusioned with my prospects in academia, but I also lost faith on my work. I'm also tired of so much work be demanded from us without compensation, the lack of structure and clear goals. 

Years ago I set myself to become a professor in social sciences/philosophy. I got a BA in Social Sciences (with a paper focused on economic anthropology), and after graduating, I spent a few years freelancing in CSR/ESG — mostly doing data collection, surveys, and reporting on labor/supply chain issues. A job that, BTW, I got from a professor that liked me and wanted to help me out during hard times for my country (Latam). However, I didn’t get formal certifications like GRI back then because I was juggling too many short-term projects and just trying to keep up between a terrible relationship and family issues.

Eventually, during one reporting on supply-chains labor relations, I met some Americans that invited me to apply for their professional masters program. I got the grant and I moved to the U.S., finally getting a Master’s in Labor and Workers’ Rights. I kept working with data — both quantitative (on reporting and analysis) and qualitative (research, ILO frameworks, transnational orgs). Still chasing the academic path, I went to Europe for another Master’s in Philosophy (focused on cognition + anthropology). Then COVID hit, and I ended up back in my home country teaching Philosophy and entrepreneurship to teens, while also working with NGOs on animal rights and education.

Fast forward — two years ago I got a PhD grant in Europe and moved back. But now I’m burned out. Academia feels increasingly hopeless — unstable jobs, lack of community, and terrible prospects for the humanities. Even my research (social science methodologies + mind/language) doesn’t excite me anymore. I've been teaching an undergrad level course (philosophy of knowledge) but, man... The classroom is now one of the worst professional moments of my week. 

So I’m wondering:
Is it realistic to pivot back into ESG/CSR work after spending several years in academia? I miss the excitement and reward I got from that line of work. 

What kinds of skills should I focus on, and would getting certifications like GRI, SASB, or similar make a real difference now? As a PhD candidate I don't have 1.2k euros laying around for a GRI Certification. 

If anyone here has made a similar career shift or works in ESG/CSR and can speak to the current job market, I’d really appreciate your insights.",Peter_Isloterdique,1,1.0,0,1747424923,2025-05-16 19:48:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1koa1ga/trying_to_leave_academia_and_get_into_esg_social/,5,2025

1ko95xt,Assigned to basic helpdesk work despite being hired for a more technical consultant role,"Hi all,

I’m looking for some honest advice.

I recently started at ilionx as an IT consultant. During the hiring process, I was told I’d be working as a bridge between end users and software developers — translating user issues into technical requirements or adjustments for the dev team. On top of that, I’d occasionally assist the helpdesk when needed.

Now I'm on day 2 of the project and… I'm working full-time on a helpdesk that handles basic Citrix and Active Directory tickets. The team has 8 people handling maybe 20 calls per day total, so there’s hardly anything to do. This is work I used to do years ago when I was just starting out.

On top of that, my onboarding was messy:
– My user profile is incomplete
– I don’t have the proper permissions
– My laptop was dirty when I received it
– No one seems to know or care what I’m supposed to do
– I have to chase everything down myself

I brought it up with my manager (gently, and respectfully), but he seemed caught off guard and somewhat defensive. I now worry this might affect how I’m perceived internally.

Am I overreacting by raising this so early (day 2)?
How do I push for a role that fits better, without damaging relationships?
Should I consider quitting early if things don’t change soon?

Would appreciate any insights — especially from fellow consultants or techs who’ve been in a similar spot.

1ko7nf4,Negotiating Raise at Nonprofit,"I work at a small nonprofit (4 full time staff), and boards made up of volunteers serve as HR and set out salaries. Recently, I realized they are completely out of touch with what the salary they see on paper means in terms of a paycheck in 2025 in a VHCOL area. The small COLAs I have received in the four years I've worked here that have not kept pace with inflation, and my health insurance costs have risen out of control because the percentage of my premiums my employer cover is so low. Between these and a few other things, my pay adjusted for inflation is almost $800/mo less than when I started here.

The last time they had someone in my role with this exact job title was 15 years ago, and the person in between had a different, more senior job title. I believe they compare my salary with what they offered two decades years ago and feel I am overpaid. I have a performance review coming up, and I plan to break down my job responsibilities, explain my accomplishments, and compare my salary and benefits with the national average and the minimum non-exempt salary for my area. I plan to ask for them to pay a more standard percentage of my health insurance, raise my salary to what I started with adjusted for inflation, and then add $5k as a raise after four years.

I am very popular at this organization and have been extremely successful in my role. It is not revenue generating, but I have made a lot of connections with donors that have translated into successful fundraising, and I believe this will lead to even more impact on the budget in five years. However, at a nonprofit there is always concern about the money, and with so much economic uncertainty everyone is understandably worried about next year's budget. We are not in dire straits and have been stable financially for the past several years. Also, the organization just tried to hire for a brand new position, partially funded by a grant and partially from the operating budget. The candidate they were considering did not work out and the position will likely not be filled for next year. This indicates to me that they are not trying to aggressively limit staffing costs at this time.

Even though I feel the compensation I am asking for is reasonable, I worry about pushing too far in a market where everyone is worried about money and looking to cut costs. At the same time, I can't really afford to continue like this in one of the most expensive areas of the country. Am I sticking my neck out too much?

I recently got hired at a traffic control company, and I’m already dealing with some serious issues. My boss is extremely unsafe and honestly just a difficult person to be around. He seems to have a problem with everyone—whether it’s a coworker or even a kid riding a bike half a mile away.

On the road, he’s reckless and shows almost no concern for the safety of others. He’s told me and other employees to “jump out in front of cars” that try to go through road closures—obviously putting us in danger.

He regularly yells at and gets aggressive with drivers who are confused, slow, or simply asking questions. On top of that, he’s extremely inappropriate toward me and another female coworker. He constantly makes sexual remarks about any woman he sees, and it creates a really toxic and uncomfortable environment.

My DevOps journey started in January 2025. I was desperate to get a job after 6 months of searching, and when I finally landed one, I was fired up to prove myself. I worked day and night without even giving myself a break

At first, I thought the problem was the workload or pressure. But over time, I realized that wasn’t it. The real issue is that I’m not interested in doing technical work. That’s the actual problem. On top of that, I’m not technically strong either, which makes it even harder. And to make things worse, my lead keeps giving me new and different tasks every single day, so there’s no consistency. It’s a lot to deal with.

In these months, I did manage to learn Linux, Docker, Git, Shell Scripting, AWS, Python, FastAPI, Pandas  not in-depth, but I’ve worked on all of them. Still, none of it excites me. I feel like I’m forcing myself to do something I don’t enjoy, and that’s draining me mentally.

Some of my friends suggested QA because it’s comparatively easier and less technical. I’ve started thinking about it too. But now I’m stuck between

Asking for a QA role in the same company (not sure if they’ll allow it)

Searching for a QA job elsewhere

Or taking a risk and trying something completely different

1ko5ltp,"29M, IT, Considering a Career Change from Property Management to Personal Training and more. Advice needed","Hi!  
I'm a 29-year-old man living in Italy, currently working as an employee in a real estate agency managing properties. I earn €15k a year and work 35 hours a week (8 AM to 3 PM).

In my free time, I enjoy physical activity—working out, sports, being outdoors, and soaking up the sun.

To be honest, this career feels limiting. The salary isn’t enough to cover a decent cost of living. I’ve considered following my friend’s path: he got certified, started managing properties independently, and now earns around €80k gross (€50k net), working 50 hours a week with 24/7 availability within a 30km radius. But I've seen the toll it's taken on him—stress, burnout, constant complaints, conflict resolution, and dealing with unhappy clients.

On the other hand, since I enjoy fitness, I'm considering becoming a certified personal trainer. I could train people at a gym from 4 PM to 8 PM after my current job. It wouldn't feel like work—more like a passion. I estimate I could earn an extra €10k net per year this way.

I believe that with effort, my current real estate career could lead to €100k net annually. But it would come at the cost of constant stress—thinking about properties, suppliers, bills, etc.

The fitness path feels more fulfilling and aligned with my interests. It could open doors to other fields like nutrition, physiotherapy, or even creating and selling fitness products. It’s a more expansive and growth-oriented direction.

But I’m almost 30, and I need to decide soon—bills and a future family won’t pay for themselves.",crepuscopoli,1,1.0,1,1747413956,2025-05-16 16:45:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ko5ltp/29m_it_considering_a_career_change_from_property/,5,2025

1ko4bps,Accept job offer or stay in current role?,"I'm unsure of what I should do here and would really appreciate some advice from kind strangers:

I've recently been offered a permanent position at a new company that pays around €12K more than my current role. I also have an offer from my current place of work to extend my temporary contract by another year.

Now, the new role sounds great on paper: more money and a permanent contract, what's not to like? The thing that I'm nervous about is that this is a more senior role (senior data analyst) in a smaller team with more responsibility. I would be responsible for the sales data and answering directly to upper management. I've only got around 3 years of experience . There's also a 6 month probation period I would need to pass first.

At my current job, although the pay is less and the contract is only for another year, I know the team and what's expected of me but It's unclear if they'll offer me a permanent position in a year's time - there are no open positions available currently. 

I'm also working abroad and I don't know if I want to stay here or move back home, my friend group here has fallen apart and it's getting quite lonely (but all my friends from home have also moved on and have their own lives so id essentially be starting again if I were to move back)

1ko43i2,"Graduated with a BS in Criminal Justice. Now I’m 26, no career path, and need advice!!","It has come to the point where I needed to create a reddit account and make a post because I am absolutely lost.

Back story, I had graduated with a Bs in CJ in 2021. I was excited for a career path in any first response field, specifically law enforcement. Unfortunately, that same year I had experienced some severe family issues (I'd prefer not to go into detail about) that changed my life completely. Due to this night in particular, I was disqualified from all law enforcements agencies I was going through at the time (NYPD and NYSP). It's been 5 years, I've taken other department exams in NY the past few years but I never get an email back about going further in the process. I do understand that there's usually a 4 year window, however, judging the past I don't think a career in law enforcement is now possible for me as I have very little faith and windows are closing.

Before I go into what I intended this post to be about, I do understand that I could take EMT courses and become certified there and get into first response. Or, go the fire route. I have taken the FDNY exam but I'm waiting for my results still after a year. However, with my family moving to FL this year (were now all okay together), I may end up in FL if I move with them. I understand now how different the process for EMT/Fire is in FL compared to NY. So heres my thoughts and questions:

Obviously, a CJ degree really doesn't transfer to other fields which sucks. I'm wondering if its even worth taking the time to wait for results in NY or start my education process in FL for EMT if I still go the first response route. On the other hand, do I completely scratch off first response at this point and look into a different field? I'm wondering, if I change careers, what are some options I could look into? Again, knowing a CJ degree sucks if you're not going into law or first response, I understand ill need to take time going back to school for a certificate or different degree. Or is there another option like entry level apprenticeships? If I am in FL, I'd be in Manatee County which I honestly love. If anyone has any ideas or advice in this area or FL in general, I'm all open ears. As well, if there are options I haven't thought of in NY I'm also open to those ideas. Id prefer to restart everything in FL but again I'm open to every tidbit of advice.

To sum: Is it worth taking more time to wait in NY for results? Or start a certificate/different degree program in NY that gets me into a specific CJ sector (ie. Cyber security)? Or change fields completely? Or lastly, go to FL and restart there by doing a cert or diff degree program (could be anything or EMT)?

I have been working as a court liaison in NY for 3 years. Not my favorite thing to do but I do have experience there if there are other options open in Fl in this field.

I'm very much open to other career paths.

1ko42xs,An agent that applies jobs nd internships,"Hey everyone,
I know this might sound like an old idea at first, but hear me out.

I’m building an automation agent that can help job seekers or interns by:
	•	Auto-applying to relevant job/internship listings,
	•	Finding the CEO/HR/team members at that company via LinkedIn,
	•	Sending them a personalized connection request,
	•	Once connected, it follows up with a customized message that includes why the applicant is interested and why they’d be a great fit.

This isn’t just mass spam—it’ll tailor content based on role, company culture, and the applicant’s profile. Think of it as your virtual career hustler.

So I have a few questions for you all:
	1.	Does this sound useful to you or someone you know?
	2.	Would you trust a tool like this to represent you professionally?
	3.	If yes, how much would you realistically pay for a service like this (subscription or per-job basis)?
	4.	Any feature or concern you think I should consider before building?

Appreciate any honest feedback. Roasting welcome if it helps sharpen the idea 😅

A few months ago, I landed what I thought was my dream job at my dream company. It’s been a slow 7 year climb to get here. After getting the job I relocated, left a stable situation behind, and fully committed to this next chapter, only to be laid off after 4 months due to restructuring.

I know this wasn’t personal, but it still stings. I barely had time to settle in or show what I could do. I poured so much into this move emotionally, financially, professionally and now I’m left trying to figure out what’s next.

I’m struggling figuring out what I’m supposed to do next:
	•	Do I try to re-enter the same industry/company tier, or aim for something more stable even if it’s less aligned with my passion?
	•	This was literally what felt like the goal of my career for years, like this was it, and I just don’t even know what I’m aiming for now. People say take time to figure out what you’re passionate about, this was literally it, or create something of your own, which sounds like a nightmare 

If you’ve been through something similar, I’d love to hear how you navigated it

1ko3n4g,Should I report her to the area manager? Please advise I will do what most of you say.,"

**We are in training and education company**

Our manager was promoted 2 years ago mainly because she knows the higher mangers like they are “friends”. She was promoted because we had issues in our department and our manger got fired and back then she was new and had no history so she picked the manager side. (Smart move) 

Anyway, for the last 2 years she took advantage of everything and literally does no work, she doesn’t teach classes although she’s recommended to do 1-2 each month. We do all the teaching and she is actually required to do some but really does not care and does nothing as she usually ask others to do it for her. She only works at most 3 hours per day and leave. 

Her work is to do what she told by higher managers who we have had a very big issues with. So when higher managers want a revenge they will ask her and she will do it for them. Like she does all the dirty work for them and never care about us or anything related to our department. 

When there is credit or bonus she will assign herself and do it to get the credit or bonus, other than that she does nothing but watching us and sometimes fighting us. 

This is a short story of what’s happening.

I am thinking to report her to the area manager and tell them everything from an anonymous email. I am not going to report higher managers just her and her behavior and how she lies and takes advantage of our department. 

Should I report her or not and please share why you think so. 

Thank you so much, I will take every comment seriously and decide based on the comments.

I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Economics and in the process of writing my thesis. While I enjoy the academic side, I’m increasingly realizing that I don’t see myself staying in research or academia long term. I have always been a go getter and have a scholarship for the masters, which is sucking the life out of me.

Lately, I’ve been drawn to the idea of working in financial planning or wealth management, helping people make better decisions with their money. It feels like a meaningful and dynamic career path ,but I honestly don’t know where to start. I feel like I have reached at the point where I really just want a job that will allow me to make money. Finding a policy role has been very challenging and honestly it’s putting me off from going into Government.

I need to work, want to work and I'm a great employee, but at this point I need to face reality that no company is ever going to hire me.

I’m open to learning new skills or even going back to school if needed, but I want to make a smart, future-oriented decision. I’m especially interested in areas like technology, wellness, business, or personal development—but I’m still figuring it out.

1knxjq9,34M and Completely Lost,"I really hate that life doesn't come with a restart button because man could I use it. This is going to be long, going to probably have plenty of excuses and I'll probably reply with even more but I really need help here. Here goes:

At 17 in 2009 I got my GED and started at a local technical, nationally-accredited ""college"" if you can call it that for an associate degree in information technology. Met my much older now-ex-wife and due to relationship stress and stupidity dropped out a year in. Worked at Walmart as a cashier for like a month, worked at a call center for an internet provider for several, worked at another call center for Ticketmaster for a month. Never fired just quit. I then made the equally idiotic decision to go to University of Phoenix and it took me until 2013 to finish my associate degree. In 2014 I then moved across the country and started work through a temp agency at a freeze drying plant for a month or two, was let go due to attendance, and then got an offer from the agency a few months later at a production plant where I stayed as a temp for probably about 6 months. I'm sure you can see the pattern if you've made it this far. In short I also worked at a phone-survey company, then got hired full-time at the production plant but quit before their merger was complete with another company, a warehouse as a temp and then later as a full-timer both less than 6 months, fish plant on the coast for a week (minimum wage and it was a 3 hour drive to and from and a 12 hour shift), and lastly at a call center for a bank which was my longest at a year the first time before I quit and then another year when I went back and quit again. I tried going to my state university but withdrew several terms due to the poor decision to try taking a difficult math course I was failing at every term until I got it (and never did) and now owe a hefty balance with no bachelor degree to show for it. 

I used to enjoy working with computers and learning new stuff but now I'm so stressed out about work that I can't concentrate on anything long enough to get a solid grip on it and I bounce back and forth between wanting to work in tech and wanting a job in production. Ultimately I want a job where I can show up and do my job without really being bothered, earn my paycheck and go home, it doesn't matter if it pays really well, doesn't matter if it's monotonous or boring, all that matters is that I can consistently and reliably do the job, make enough to support myself and my partner on just my income, and pay off the ridiculous amount of debt my poor decisions have put me under. 

I'm sure it's going to sound crazy but I just don't want to play the games. I'm required to have a job to survive but I don't want my job search taking up my entire life. I keep seeing people say to put numbers on your resume for impacts you made at companies but I never got any numbers so I don't know what to put and I'm 100% opposed to making them up. They say to tailor your resume and write a cover letter to every company you apply to but I'm not doing that either if I'm going to have to apply to hundreds if not thousands of jobs. 

I know I did it to myself but am I just screwed? Like where do I go from here? I'm 34 with no more than a year at a job and no career in sight. I've been suicidal, I've been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds that made me more suicidal due to their effects. I've even tried applying for disability due to my mental state but they say there's some work I can do so they deny me but don't give me a single clue what I'm supposed to do. I'd even join the military but I'm ineligible due to my criminal record (there's no way around it unfortunately so no point suggesting it because I've tried to find a way). I always feel like I'd be better off ending it all because I feel like such a burden anymore.

Enjoy peaceful life for me and my parents , and move abroad (UAE, Europe, or America) to build a better life. 🌍💼
Here’s my current struggle:

In tech, it might take me 2–3 years to land a proper job — especially in the UAE.
NEBOSH could help me start earning within a year.

Do NEBOSH → move to Dubai → start earning 💵
Code in my free time 💻
After a year or two, visit software houses in person and try to get an internship or junior dev role

1knv8yr,Need Advice: TCS Digital Offer vs. Real Estate Startup Internship Conversion,"Hi everyone,
I’m in a bit of a dilemma and would really appreciate your advice.

Background:

I’ve recently completed my B.Tech in Computer Science.

Currently working as a Program Management Intern at a real estate startup (non-tech role).

The internship is for 6 months, and there's a possibility of conversion based on performance. If converted, the CTC offered is 8 LPA.

I’ve now received a TCS Digital offer for a tech role with a CTC of 7 LPA.


The dilemma:

The startup role is non-tech, and I’m unsure if I’ll be able to transition into a tech-focused career later if I stay.

However, the startup offers more responsibility, learning opportunities, and a higher potential salary (if converted).

TCS offers a stable tech role, brand name, and alignment with my CS background, though the pay is slightly lower and the work might be more generic or slower-paced.


My goals:

Build a career in high paying jobs.

Prefer roles with growth opportunities, skill-building, and exposure to decision-making.

Open to switching companies later if needed.


Question:

Should I take the TCS Digital offer and build a tech-oriented profile from the start?

Or should I stay at the startup, hope for the conversion, and later pivot to tech/product using the startup experience?


Would love to hear from people who’ve faced similar situations or have insights into long-term career impact of both choices.

Thanks in advance!

TL;DR:
B.Tech CS grad working in a non-tech startup internship (possible conversion at 8 LPA). Got a TCS Digital tech offer (7 LPA). Want to build a career in tech/product.

1kntleg,Feeling Guilty About Resigning After Committing Long-Term,"Hey everyone,

I'm feeling really conflicted right now and could use some perspective.

I recently got an admission offer from one of the top B-schools of the country (super grateful and excited), and I’ve decided to pursue the MBA starting this year.

The issue is — I’m currently working at a firm, where I joined full-time around November. Honestly, this job came to me at a point when I had nothing solid lined up — another offer I had was deferred, and this firm gave me a real shot. From day one, people have been supportive, welcoming, and just great to work with. I felt like I finally had something to build on.

Now here’s where it gets tough:  
In my final interview before joining, I spoke with a senior leadership member (also had problems with hiring people like me since they always exit early) and explicitly conveyed that I saw myself staying long-term and growing with the firm — and I really meant it back then. But this MBA admit came out of the blue and feels like something I can’t pass up.

So I put in my resignation (within probation), with a request for an early exit and an offer to buy out the notice period. The manager I mentioned earlier is clearly disappointed — and understandably so. Hasn't said much but I can clearly sense the letdown. It’s making me feel like I broke some kind of trust or burned a bridge I never wanted to damage.

I keep wondering:  
**Did I handle this poorly?**  
**Is this level of guilt normal when leaving your first real job, especially under these circumstances?**  
**Should I do something more to exit with grace and professionalism?**  
**Could this impact future jobs or references down the line?**

I know it’s not wrong to leave a job for a top B-school, especially early in your career — but emotionally, I feel like I’m carrying a burden I can’t shake.

1knt82r,My boss is having an affair,"I work for a micro manufacturing company in the south east, uk.Operations support. 6 months in, and I'm not sure where it's going. I have a 1 year contract so am learning as much as possible to stay out of hospitality management. Every job has down sides, I just don't have anything to compare it to. Maybe this behaviour is accepted. My boss is a poor communicator with big expectations. I'm biting my tounge to get skills on my CV, but he's taking the piss a bit. Recently it came to light that he's having an affair. He gave the person in accounts £350 for her discretion and i got zip. We're supposed to be going to a new manufacturing site, but my H&S concerns were laughed at. I was told not to worry about things like lockers and drinking water - 'we can get by' - I know it hasn't been budgeted for. I got laughed at when I asked what KPIs we'll be driving from a website pov, and i was told KPIs are a load of rubbish and sales are sales. Am I too soft from working in normal companies? Also a demotivator is his not intrested teen son hanging about for extra cash from dad. Add babysitting to the list. Is it worth hanging around? Do these people change? I'm struggling to find the opportunity in all the mess. Is it worth biting my tounge for 6ish more months to be offered a permanent position?

1knt7vf,So… my office has a crappy atmosphere,"As said above. I work in engineering. I used to work for a big European engineering firm that’s famous for not paying too much and overworking people over here (and apparently had misread my CV) about 5 years ago. 

About that time got an interview for a different company that also works in my town (huge engineering firm, but with a small office in my town). They actually read my CV, liked it a lot and offered me a notable pay rise (they are the best paying engineering firm in my town). 

Thing is that after the first 6 months or a year passed by (and during Covid), I began to notice stuff. Had a horrible immediate boss who happened to be friends with some ppl in management. Been trying to get out for ages… haven’t found anyone to even match salary. Closest I’ve seen is either going for an extremely more expensive town with a salary difference that would barely cover rent difference and same salary, but 3 times the responsibility. 

My current manager has made it crystal clear (before he became my manager) that I won’t go any further if it depended on him

I understand I should run the hell away, but every job interview is worse than the previous one (responsibility wise, money wise, and so on)

Any ideas how to tackle this?",Notseriousdingo,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1747373313,2025-05-16 05:28:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1knt7vf/so_my_office_has_a_crappy_atmosphere/,5,2025

1knsf97,Breaking into your first sales interview process?,"Free guide: “10 Interview Questions Every Aspiring Sales Rep Must crush”

By Brandon | Fortune 500 Corporate Sales Recruiter | Interview sales coach

———

Landing a sales job in this current market is competitive — but the interview is where you can truly stand out.
As a recruiter who’s filled 600+ sales roles at a Fortune 500 company, I have spent four years working alongside hiring managers, including VP’s of sales, I know exactly what hiring managers look for. This guide includes real questions I’ve seen asked — plus frameworks and tips to help you deliver answers that convert.

1. “Tell Me About Yourself”

What They Want: Confidence, clarity, and alignment with the role.
Structure to Follow:
	•	Who you are (professionally)
	•	Key accomplishments (with numbers)
	•	Why you’re excited about this role/company

Pro Tip: Keep it under 90 seconds. Tie your background directly to sales traits: persistence, curiosity, coachability.

⸻

2. “Why Sales?”

What They Want: Motivation beyond money.
Frame Your Answer:
	•	“I’ve always been drawn to performance-driven roles.”
	•	“I love building relationships and solving problems.”
	•	“Sales rewards people who take 
ownership — that’s me.”

———

3. “Tell Me About a Time You Bounced Back from a Setback”

This is all about resilience — a must-have in any sales role.
Structure your answer using the STAR format:
	•	What happened?
	•	What was your role?
	•	How did you handle it?
	•	What was the outcome or takeaway?

Pro Tip: executing the STAR method to answer your behavioral type questions is extremely valuable in the interview process. 

———-

4. “How Do You Handle Pressure or Performance Goals?”

Use examples that show:
	•	You’re goal-oriented
	•	You break big targets into small daily actions
	•	You have habits or systems that help you stay focused

———

5. “What Do You Know About Our Product or Company?”

This one is so important. This is usually one of the first questions asked by me as a recruiter and it is certainly one of the first questions asked by the hiring managers/sales leaders. Getting off to a fast start is important in a job interview. 

Failing to properly answer what you know about the company you are interviewing for is a very rocky start that is hard to bounce back from. 

Your job isn’t to memorize their website, it’s to show you’re curious and you’ve done your homework.
Mention:
	•	A specific use case
	•	A customer story or industry the product helps
	•	Why the product interests you

———-

6–10: More Questions to Practice
	6.	“What’s your approach to learning a new product or system?”
	7.	“How do you handle rejection?”
	8.	“Describe a time you worked toward a tough goal.”
	9.	“How do you stay organized or manage priorities?”
	10.	“What makes you stand out from other candidates?”

These are the 10 most common questions that I have spent thousands of interviews and countless amounts of hours hearing in entry level and mid level sales interviews. As a recruiter for a competitive Fortune 500 company, my job is to be able to identify the strongest candidates in a competitive environment. 

Executing the answers to these questions will give you a very good chance at landing that dream job.

1knqt44,Working a 30k/month React Native dev job in my final BCA semester — worth quitting to prepare for NIMCET or CUET PG MCA?,"Hey folks,

I’m in my last semester of BCA and working full-time as a Mobile Application Developer for ₹30k/month, supporting my family and funding my brother’s education.

I’m torn between two options:

1. Keep the job and upskill (DSA, system design, Leetcode) for better future roles, possibly in product-based companies.
  
2. Leave the job to focus on NIMCET or CUET PG for an MCA from a prestigious college, knowing a full-time MCA would be challenging to balance with work.

The job offers experience and stability, but I often wonder if an MCA from a top institute would provide better long-term opportunities.

1knqfz3,"Can I please get some insight, feeling super lost in my career/life","I've been working in Tech sales for two years now. I got laid off in Feb after being told I was going to get promoted to an AE within the first quarter of this year. Company had a leadership change and decided to gut the entire b2b side sales. I was wanting to get out of the world of being an SDR but seems unlikely and I've been trying to be picky with the next company I go to but I'm really not sure if I want to continue working in sales. I don't hate it but don't love it.

I've learned that I don't have a passion for any sort of specific work, I've thought about multiple different paths and none really click with me. I originally thought Finance was the right fit since I've always been a personal finance freak and truly care about financial freedom but realized corporate finance isn't really satisfying to me. I've considered data analytics, seems like a good career path that earns good money but seems almost impossible to break into right now. It seems like doing anything long enough you'll eventually grow to not like it after reading some posts in other career subs. I did want to mention I do have an MIS degree and am willing to take certifications and whatever needs to be done to move careers, I really just want to make good money (eventually 100k+) and live a modest lifestyle.

To give more details, I only really care about making good money and not having to work insane hours to get there, I never had to in sales and was able to be a top performer at my company but sales is and can be super stressful with quota attainment, I don't mind cold calling and cold emailing so I'm considering just sucking it up and continuing interviewing with companies until I find the right fit. Maybe I've tricked myself mentally for reading too much ""doom comments"" on reddit in the tech sales and sales subreddits lol but does any have any career path recommendations I should look into??",Alternative_Glass_58,2,1.0,3,1747363744,2025-05-16 02:49:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1knqfz3/can_i_please_get_some_insight_feeling_super_lost/,5,2025

1knp8t8,Let go of first job after college and going back to prior employer too early? Advice please,"I don't know if this is the right place to post, but I was let go from my first job after college a couple of weeks ago.

I was told at the end of the day that my position wasn't needed anymore because they were changing their business goals and didn't need the software I used to do my job (I worked at a law firm). They gave me a severance check and I haven't filed for unemployment yet. Probably won't because I am going to go back to working at my old job I had during college. 

The thing is, I feel like shit. I have applied for 19 jobs total in fields that are unrelated to my degree (BA in English, minor in PR) because I live in an average sized town in the Midwest. For pay, I just want to at least make somewhere in between my 2 prior jobs. I don't care what the work is. I've applied for housekeeping at hospitals, BHT for acute care, office admin for a tech company, production managers, production operator, etc. I also tried applying for jobs that I could flex my degree and resume for in the hopes that they'd at least consider an interview maybe: human resources and marketing positions.

The funny thing, the random jobs I applied for have all turned me down, even though I have a college degree. I've been told by a few that they don't want to proceed with my application/have a second interview, even though I have an impressive resume. (I was highly active during college, 2 internships, published undergraduate research project, high GPA). I have crafted each of my resumes to fit with what the employer is looking for. It hasn't helped. 

So, because I am getting rejected, I'm going back to my prior job (supervisor and barista). The coffee shop is happy to have me come back (I was respected because I treated everyone like a human) and it makes me happy that my manager is willing to hire me back in a heartbeat. 

But I feel like I've taken a step back and I feel like shit. I feel like my degree is useless because my hometown doesn't need the skills I can offer. Yet, I can't get a job I'm willing to work because I'm apparently over qualified for some jobs that only need a high school diploma. I have a degree dammit, why isn't that enough? 

I'm married so I can't relocate because my spouse makes (now) x4 more than me. We'd be dumb to move. They are also SO supportive of me going back to my old job until I find something better, but still. I feel like a waste of space and a failure. 


I think I just need some encouragement. Anyone have any advice maybe on how to navigate through all of this? ",Empathetic-mouze,2,1.0,8,1747359892,2025-05-16 01:44:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1knp8t8/let_go_of_first_job_after_college_and_going_back/,5,2025
1knp6rj,Did I make a big mistake?,"I worked in a fin Company for 6 yrs as a senior relationship manager and decided to look for jobs more towards the investment side recently. I was really unhappy on the team I was on and overall my mental health was suffering so I took a 20k pay cut to get my foot in the door at another firm in a jr wealth management.

My first day I think I made a mistake. I’m completely introverted, young, female, little life experience (I’m the only one at the firm that still lives with my parents. I don’t have specific hobbies. I don’t have many friends irl just 2 I see every now and then that work in non professional jobs. No kids. My parents have non glamorous jobs. I just feel so out of place) my boss could sense it and literally said to me I can go back to my old job if I don’t like it here (this really upset me even though he didn’t seem to mean it maliciously)

Anyways it’s been 2 months. I’m decent with clients, I feel like I’m getting the systems and policies. But I’m really struggling with the social aspect of the job. I work in a small office with one senior person and our main office is 45 minutes away. I feel very isolated, very out of place, and depressed being here. The senior  person here is not someone I connect with well. I feel so awkward and anxious all the time being in a small office away from the action. It feels like I’ve fallen way behind my other peers and I’m seriously regretting this decision. I guess it wouldn’t be so bad if I was in a main office hub but I still don’t connect well with most of them. I was told I should go to offsite networking events for the company so I did go to one. I felt extremely awkward and I was very overwhelmed (and it was 1 1/2 hrs from me)  I had a mini panic attack and left with the first hour but I did meet a few people (my previous company did not gave this type of culture of extrovertedness and events)

I’m not really sure what to do at this point. I’m being told I need to go to these events and become good friends with my colleagues if I want to succeed and get promoted but I don’t know how and I have serious anxiety around socializing. I’ve reached out to some younger colleagues here and there but not on a regular basis. I’m decent with sales and prospecting because there’s an objective and end game but with making relationships with people I don’t relate to I’m totally lost.

1kno15k,"Should I quit my job before my stated ""last day""","Hello Everyone. I have been working at my job for almost 4 years and largely enjoyed my time there. I made friends and had a schedule that worked with my random college classes. I am now out of college and got an amazing full time position at a new place and told my boss I would leave a week before it's start date. I gave two months notice.
My problem is unfortunately a new one. Half the night crew for my job has quit a few weeks ago and I've had problems at work ever since. I've spent entire lunch breaks and drives home just sobbing from the stress. The closers me and two men and a woman are left. It wasn't all bad until I realized that this girl is the laziest person I have ever experienced professionally. She can't hold up on her own for me to complete any closing tasks or I end up superwomaning to do absolutely every task. By myself. I didn't mind at first but I have become increasingly more irratable and tired. I believed I would just get through it but with my shift lead. One of the men, I just can't. This person refuses to help on the floor even at our busiest. And so I have asked newer people training to close to complete tasks and essentially run the floor. But I think I've upset this shift. He's become passive aggressive and petty. I actually believed he was my friend and has an invite for my upcoming wedding.. but he has been treating me like I am doing a horrible job at work. Constant criticism and side comments to the point I just got confused. I ask the other shift we work with if I wasn't good at my job as other managers in town have praised me and said I'd be welcome back at their locations any time I need a job. He said I was his best worker and that he doesn't need to micromanage our incredibly lazy coworker and he said he appreciates that I know what needs to be done and does so without any instruction. He told me I know the floor as a shift.
I realized I may have overstepped the other male shift by ""leading"" the floor myself. But he just doesn't do it. As the second lowest level worker (I'm a trainer) I should not have to ask what's next? Or what should lazy girl do? He should be updating the floor every half hour and it just doesn't happen.
I think this person hates me or is greatly annoyed by my behavior and since we have barely anyone willing to close I am with him almost 5 out of my 6 days a week and it's incredibly toxic.
I am writing this post specifically because after weeks of doing absolutely everything at work with two people who refuse to do their jobs I am sick. Physically sick. I thought I had a fever today but I have realized I may have entered severe fatigue.. I have occasional episodes of fainting when I get sick and I walked my pup 3 blocks and sat on my porch curled up in a ball of dizzy.. I don't know how to professionally leave my position at this point. 
So, should I call my manager and explain my situation? Take some time off but not leave? I am 24 and the two coworkers I mentioned are 20 if that's relevant.",Imaginary_Budget2868,4,0.8399999737739563,2,1747356116,2025-05-16 00:41:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kno15k/should_i_quit_my_job_before_my_stated_last_day/,5,2025
1knnyf1,Pivoting Drastically to a Better Fit Career,"Hello everyone. I’ve included a short summary of my situation below - I’m interested in getting some advice on my current situation. 

Education: school in the USNW 30s. Dual BS/MS in engineering with a low 3.7 GPA. Selective grad fellowship that I probably could have capitalized on more. 99th % SAT and GRE. Graduated in 2021. 

Work Experience: had several great internships in real estate development and energy during school. Had a consulting job lined up that was canceled during the pandemic, ended up working in construction management at a major company as a stepping stone job but haven’t been able to break out. Generally dislike the industry and am looking to leave for greener pastures. Likely layoff/coach out coming in July because of a downturn in projects, and middle management is typically first to go from past experience. 

Interest Exploration: I’ve used my free time over the past few years to explore a variety of professional interests through shadowing/MOOCs/online classes from good universities, and I’ve found that my new areas of interest are in the technical sides of the defense industry, consulting, and NGO work. 

I’ve been accepted to UPenn’s MCIT program (accelerated bridge MS for non computer science majors with decent outcomes even in this market), which I can start full time in the fall, or I could use the next year to prep for an MBA to try for a traditional consulting/LDP entry point. I understand that both markets aren’t in the best shape, but I’ve been through tough transitions before and I have come to the point where I’m more concerned about wasting more time in a career I don’t want than an earnings setback from aiming for something that will better engage and challenge me. 

For those of you who successfully made similar drastic leaps, what was the most important lesson from your pivot? Would you recommend one path over another given my interests? What worked for you? What didn’t? Given the state of the market, what is your advice to me?

So far, I've liked the responses from the 2nd company, but wondering how I should best approach this.  Do I immediately let them both know about this conflict?  Do I gather more info and turn one down?  I'm not sure how to proceed.

1knm8os,Quit or stay?,"Quit or stay?

I’m 19F and took a gap year to save money. I have been working at Hobby Lobby for 14 months (5 part time, 9 full time). It’s a nice store and I make a pretty decent wage at 18.50 an hour, but it’s a bit poorly managed and I don’t like how they have treated me in my time there. Last summer, when I was still part time, they got me fully trained for a promotion to a management position, and then took it away last minute, and made me a full time cashier instead. It has left a sour taste in my mouth ever since. It’s also starting to feel monotonous and stagnant. I want my life to have some forward momentum and room for advancement.

 I currently have $17k in my bank account, and I don’t have many big financial commitments. I don’t pay rent because I live with my grandparents, they cover majority of groceries. I am currently in the market to get my first car though, $8k absolute max. I understand cars are an ongoing expense

I plan to start community college in September, and enter a transfer program into medical lab research. Starting out with general ed and applying for financial aid.

Here’s my dilemma:

I’ve been considering quitting my job to take the summer to work part time and:

- Build a marketable skill. I don’t have any realistic career skills, so I want to learn data entry, excel, etc
- Prepare for college. Due to complications with my mom’s homeschooling neglect, I didn’t graduate last year and need to take my GED test.
- Build healthier routines
- Work on my mental health after dealing with an upbringing of neglect and isolation

My big aspiration is to move to Roch and work for Mayo Clinic as a lab scientist. There’s a position for a part time patient access rep at my local clinic that I want to try for to get my foot in the door with hospital work. 

The environment at HL can be unpredictable and I have inconsistent hours that make it really difficult for me to maintain a routine in my life. I have to decide very soon if I’m going to put in my two weeks. I don’t do well with change so I want to make sure I’m making the right decision here, please reply with any advice or better ideas.

TL;DR:
19, $17k in savings, rent-free living. Full-time retail job that’s fine but feels stagnant. Starting school in fall and thinking of quitting now to reset, prep, build skills, and apply for part-time clinic work. Sound plan or premature?

1knlzu9,Switching Companies,"I will start with I have been with my company for 10 years. Got hired right after graduating college. I am happy where I’m at, recently got a promotion, work with people I like, and was not looking for a new job. However, I now have a new opportunity I was not even looking for. A customer of ours reached out and they have a role they think I would be perfect in. And so do I.

I really respect this customer of ours, they have a great business, been around for over 50 years. And the pay is quite a bit better and more consistent (a lot of my pay currently is commission based but this new job would be pretty much all salary). And the benefits are so much better (I don’t pay for medical, company puts in 15% to 401k which will essentially max me out). And they are a very family-oriented company that I think I would fit in well to. I wouldn’t even have to move.

But I am scared. Scared of leaving the comfort I have. Anxious to leave my boss in a bad position without me just before our peak season. I feel guilty, but I am leaning towards taking this new job even though I think it will be difficult to break away from my current job.

I know it’s silly to ask for strangers opinions on this situation, but I am looking for advice if anybody has been in similar spot. I want what’s best for my family. I know that only I and my family can make this life decision, but i am curious what you all think about it. Thanks I’m advance.

1knlekj,Feeling undervalued despite qualifications—was I overlooked for the wrong reasons?,"I wanted to get some outside opinions on a frustrating situation at work. I've put a lot of time into my career, and I genuinely enjoy what I do—but I’ve noticed a pattern where I seem to **bring change and progress**, only for management to resist and push me down.

Here’s some background: I work at a tech, robotics, and fabrication lab. My qualifications include:

* **Experience:** Airport Agent Supervisor, Freelance Marketing/Web Dev, and Lead for a CRE (Code, Robotics, Engineering) Fabrication Lab
* **Education:** Working on a Master’s in Computer Engineering with a Mechanical Engineering minor, plus multiple degrees/certifications in Cyber Security, Software Engineering, Ethical Hacking, and IT Support
* **Skills:** Electrical Engineering, Software Engineering, Soldering, Cyber Security, CAD, 3D Printing, and more

I was hired as a **basic-level employee** and within a month was asked to join a **development team** for a department-wide project—where I naturally took the lead. After three months, my manager, who **knew I was overqualified**, promoted me to Lead. A year later, the **Departmental Lead personally encouraged me** to apply for a **Fab Lab Coordinator** position.

I went through interviews, thinking it was a great fit for my skill set. But I was denied the position—not because someone more qualified applied, but because I apparently **answered some questions “as a student.”** That alone felt vague, but I brushed it off. The **real slap in the face** came when I learned who they hired:

* The new Coordinator had worked as a basic employee in the lab for **three years**
* His previous highlight job? **Parcel delivery driver**
* His degree? **Graphic design**

I was **shocked**, but I kept my humility and had a conversation with the new hire. He seems like a nice guy, and none of this is **his fault**—but let’s be real, **how does this make sense?**

Then, I found out something that **really hit hard**. A close friend, who knows one of the board members, **asked why they chose him over me**. The response?

*""We didn’t want to hire someone who would shake up the lab and make changes of ‘growth.’ We’re comfortable with how things are.""*

**That’s it. They picked familiarity and complacency over actual leadership and improvement.**

To clarify, our lab is **poorly managed**, and there are entire teams who don’t even know **who their manager is**. We’ve invested over **$300,000** into a department this year, yet it operates like a **revolving door** because of bad oversight. The kicker? Despite the inefficiencies, the **higher-ups are making a ridiculous profit off it**—a **75% profit from a nonprofit lab**.

And now, I realize the hard truth: **They don’t want change. They don’t want leadership. They want the status quo.**

I feel **sick to my stomach** knowing that **real progress and accountability were ignored for comfort.** Have any of you dealt with something similar? How do you move forward when you know you're in an environment that actively resists change?",wasetylinlewis,2,1.0,4,1747348375,2025-05-15 22:32:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1knlekj/feeling_undervalued_despite_qualificationswas_i/,5,2025

1knkrw8,More relaxed alternative to typical service industry jobs.,"I worked in the food industry for 8 years, and it was such a stressful environment regardless of where I worked. Not to mention that large sections of the industry are vastly under paid. I decided to persue other options in the service industry. This is my advice to people working in the service industry who want a (usually) more relaxed work environment: look into security work. I got hired about a year ago, and I have no regrets. Here's what I've noticed so far.

My place of work is beautiful, I get paid a living wage in a big city, I have around 6 hours of down-time per 8 hour shift, no supervisor breathing down neck during my day-to-day duties, and no hangry people to deal with (usually).

Pros: ● Higher or comparable wages to most entry-level jobs. ● Lots of job openings. ● Less stress. ● Less interaction with angry customers (at most sites). ● You will usually be alone (at most sites), and will have less micromanaging and more independence to do your job. ● Significantly more down-time between duties. ● Diverse coworkers. ● Being able to work at cool buildings, campuses or complexes (I work at an absolutely beautiful site in the mountains) ● Decent benefits as a result of unions or union-competitive companies. ● Lots of opportunities to switch sites. ● There is potential to move up, but not as much as some other sectors of the service industry. ● Freedom to work on studies during downtime (depending on company policy enforcement).

Cons: ● High turnover. ● Potential to work the night shift, abnormal hours, and/or weekends + holidays. ● Potential for confrontation with tresspassers/etc. ● You will be alone for most of your shift (pro or con depending on how you look at it). ● Potential to work long shifts (12+ hours). ● If your replacement doesn't show up, you have to stay until someone relieves you, potentially a double shift. ● Again, night shift and sleeping during the day is a rough transition. ● Some reactionary coworkers and offensive jokes.

Common misconceptions include that most security guards are armed or required to stop a potentially dangerous conflict. That is not usually the case for most sites. You are not required to be armed at all. Your primary duty is to observe and report incidents and remain safe. You won't have to detain anyone at most sites. There are sites where you are expected to do that, but they are not entry-level.

Requirements for job: ● HS Diploma or equivalent. ● Clean criminal record within 2+ years (depends on location and company policy). ● Ability to pass a drug test among entry (or periodically if your company/site requires). ● Reliable transportation to work. ● Depending on location, a security license, or even top-secret FBI clearance.

This isn't meant to be a call to join any security company in particular. This is just my experience so far in the industry. If it sounds like something you'd like, look into it! Feel free to ask questions if you want my takes.",Griffdog17,1,1.0,0,1747346632,2025-05-15 22:03:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1knkrw8/more_relaxed_alternative_to_typical_service/,5,2025

잘 선택된 이직은 커리어 전체의 방향을 바꿀 수 있지만, 그렇지 않으면 같은 문제를 반복하게 되죠.

다음 직장을 알아보기 전에, 아래 다섯 가지 질문을 자신에게 먼저 던져보세요.

1. 이직의 이유는 ‘도망’인가, ‘끌림’인가?
지금의 일을 피하고 싶은 건지, 새로운 기회에 진심으로 끌리는 건지 구분하세요.
이유를 명확히 하면, 같은 불만족을 다음 직장에서 반복하지 않게 됩니다.

2. 새 직무가 내 장기 목표에 부합하는가?
화려한 직함이나 조건에 눈이 가기 쉽습니다.
하지만 이직 후 3년, 5년, 10년 후의 나에게 도움이 되는 길인지 고민해보세요.

3. 돈 외에 무엇을 얻을 수 있는가?
유연한 근무? 성장 기회? 건강한 문화? 배울 수 있는 환경?
연봉은 중요하지만, 그 외의 가치도 반드시 따져봐야 합니다.

4. 실제 ‘하루 일과’가 어떤지 알고 있는가?
공고에 나온 설명은 절반일 뿐입니다.
가능하다면 현직자나 퇴사자에게 직접 이야기를 들어보세요. 숨겨진 리스크가 있을 수 있습니다.

5. 내가 변화할 준비가 되어 있는가?
좋은 이직도 스트레스를 동반합니다.
새로운 환경에서 배우고, 적응하고, 관계를 처음부터 쌓을 준비가 되어 있나요?

여러분은 이직을 하면서 어떤 교훈을 얻으셨나요?

Changing jobs isn’t just about a higher salary or escaping a toxic boss. A well-timed career move can change your entire professional trajectory—for better or worse.
Before you update your resume or schedule interviews, take a step back and ask yourself these 5 essential questions:

1. What’s driving this move—push or pull?
Are you running away from your current job or genuinely excited about the opportunities ahead?
Knowing the why behind your move helps you avoid repeating the same dissatisfaction elsewhere.

2. Is the new role aligned with your long-term goals?
Sometimes, shiny job titles and offers distract us.
Ask: Will this role take me closer to where I want to be 3, 5, 10 years from now?

3. What are you gaining beyond money?
More flexibility? Better leadership? New skills? Culture fit?
Don’t let a bigger paycheck blind you from the real value of the role.

4. Do you know what the day-to-day looks like?
Job descriptions often tell half the story.
Talk to current or former employees if you can. Look for red flags and daily realities.

5. Are you mentally and emotionally ready to change?
Even a great new job can be stressful.
Are you prepared to learn, adapt, and build new relationships from scratch?

What’s been your biggest lesson from switching jobs? Or if you're considering a change—what's holding you back?

1knib24,Confused between continuing as a SAP Consultant or going for MS in CS,"I am currently working as a Convergent Mediation (CM) Consultant, which is a part of the telco billing stack and integrates closely with SAP BRIM systems like CC, CI, CM, etc. Although I am not directly working in SAP yet, I have been observing the SAP side quite closely and feel that it is structured, process-driven, and seems like a field I could pivot into with effort.

Recently, I came to know a family friend who did his masters in USA then worked as an independent SAP consultant for 14 years, became a VIP in a company, and is now a senior manager at a Big 4 firm. This got me thinking about whether I should continue on the SAP consulting path or switch gears and go for an MS in CS in the USA.

My confusion:

SAP path (India/Global consulting roles) Pivot into SAP BRIM techno-functional consultant (CC, CI, ABAP, etc.) Focus on building niche skills, certifications, leadership roles Lower risk, no debt, but potentially slower growth unless I hustle hard. Uncertain if SAP alone will give me international exposure or tech leadership roles I aim for.

MS in CS path (USA focus) Go for GRE, MS in CS in 2026. High initial investment (50-70 lakhs), high debt risk, plus uncertainties around job market and visa. Might open doors to pure tech roles, but I’m not sure if I want to be coding forever. The attraction is more toward the global exposure, better salaries, and flexibility to pivot into consulting, product, or strategy roles post-MS.

1knhy2f,What would be a well paying career that I could pivot to?,"So I'm a high school senior entering college with nearly a full ride as a journalism major, but I've been having second thoughts. For starters, I feel like journalism is a dying field and I don't see myself making a good amount of money in the field. But I really enjoy it along with writing. 

I've recently been looking at different fields, and some that stand out to me are law, and government jobs. I'm very into investigative journalism, but I also have a huge interest in detective work, and forensics. I guess I want to pursue a career that involves a bit of writing, a lot of detective work, and (might??) involve law. I honestly want to save myself a lot of time worrying in college and would like to know what you guys think would be a good idea for me to pursue. I also have a small interest in criminal justice. 

As you can probably tell by this post, idk what I want to do **😭**

I'm looking for a career that pays really well as my family is very low-income.

1knhxhy,"Intern Hoping for Full-Time Role, Now Being Moved Without Clarity","I joined a company as a marketing intern in the finance-tech space, with the understanding that I’d be working for 2 years. However, after some time, they extended my internship tenure without much discussion. When I raised an objection, they reassured me that it was just for 2 more months. And I'll be full-time after that.

Now, with those 2 months about to end, they’ve informed me that I should move to the marketing team of some company, They said they would either refer me externally or try to create another internship role within the company’s marketing team itself.

I was confused because I’ve been giving 100% – working closely on pre-launch strategies for an algo trading tool, handling social media coordination, content, internal comms, etc. We’re still in the **pre-launch phase**, and there’s no fixed launch date yet. I was under the impression that pre-launch marketing begins **when the go-live date is set**, not 3–4 months before without clarity. But now I’m being told I didn’t do the pre-launch right, even though the expectations were never clearly set.

I asked my mentor if my performance was unsatisfactory, and I got hit with, “You didn’t do the social media campaign I told you about.” The thing is – he only mentioned it once, and never followed up. I assumed (maybe stupidly) that there’d be a proper plan or brief coming my way. I feel crushed because I always try to stay loyal and proactive – I even rejected the marketing team offer earlier just to stay in the product team with my mentor.

To add to the burn – they’re hiring IIT interns at 1.5L a month. I’m nowhere comparing myself to them, but it hurts when **your hard work feels invisible**. I don’t have an MBA, I’m not from IIT, but I’m genuinely trying to learn and contribute. Instead, I’m being told my future depends on whether there's an opening in the marketing team – which may or may not happen. He said he’d try to refer me elsewhere too.

All of this feels like sweet sugarcoating. I honestly don’t know where I went wrong. Is it because I don’t have the right degree? Or because I misunderstood vague instructions? Or am I just not cut out for this world?

Please tell me honestly – what should I do? Should I explore new companies, stick around and wait, or just accept that this might not be the place where I grow? 
Whatever my mentor is doing is correct? Why do I have no control over the job or my choice here? Why am I not being asked what I want. And I'm given a verdict this way, is this a way of firing people?

My mentor thinks ""I'll get better exposure in the marketing team rather than being in the product team and also I'm not a pro person like an IIM graduate. And nobody here was really focused on me or taught me I can only learn by being into hardcore marketing team or in B school""
But isn’t this unfair to someone without a top-tier pedigree? It feels like the opportunities I worked hard for—and the ones I truly deserved—are being taken away from me",tiredalreadyy,0,0.5,0,1747339554,2025-05-15 20:05:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1knhxhy/intern_hoping_for_fulltime_role_now_being_moved/,5,2025

I live in the Bay Area and they're offering me 70k with great benefits, which I do feel is fair. It's on the lower end of the salary range, but I don't have a ton of direcr experience in this kind of role and will need training up.

1kngq8g,"Where to go from here, completely lost","Hey, I'm not one who usually asks for help, but I feel so lost with my current career aspirations. I'm (23M) from a mid sized city in the US. I graduated just a little over a year ago with a BSc in Statistics, with distinction. I also got student work experience (approx 2 years's worth) with well known private and public organizations. One had even offered me to stay longer but I decided to switch to get more diverse experience with a different team. I know, big mistake. That new student job wasn't looking to keep students after they graduated.

I then had been working part-time at a fast food chain for the first few months after graduating, whilst looking for a job. I took a break a couple months ago and my parents have been helping me with staying afloat while I search jobs all day, but I feel like such a failure at times. No matter to how many jobs I apply, whether office jobs, stats, data analysis, administration, sales, customer service, I either get rejected in the interviews, or get no reply at all. One job almost sent the letter of offer until they had to do budget cuts right before. I even read some people saying a BSc in Stats may not get any job at all in this current market.

I tried tailoring my resume and cover letter, applying directly on websites, applying on the job sites, applying using chatgpt, applying on government or state websites, many other things.

I am feeling very negative about everything and wondering if I need to just work with fast food for a few years, try to get my foot into sales, go back to study longer, or maybe change career path entirely. I'm usually a little more shy than the average person, which might not help my cause either. I am also very exhausted mentally from the job search and the general stress of the past few months.

1kngngw,What do I do now.,"I’m sure this type of post has been made before but I really need some advice on what to do.

for some context: I’m 21, and I work at a well paying bank job, 23/hr and work morning shifts to mid day mon-saturday with one day off guaranteed during the work week. Never work a sunday. I have excelled at my job and have never had any issues when it comes to work related things. In fact I have been praised for my skills countless times. 

The issue that I could never overcome was getting to work on time. I tried everything, going to sleep early, getting a new louder alarm clock etc etc. In the beginning of my career I had a few issues here and there with tardiness and then it turned into a verbal warning, then a pip then a final pip. In between my first and final pip my alarm clock just didn’t go off and I paid the price for it, unfortunately being on my final pip my manager basically told me that putting in my two weeks would be better for my career than being fired. So I did, i gave a month advance and my last day was to be the end of next month. 

I am a full time student at college and work 30-40hrs a week. (I’m 30hrs but work more usually) I just recently found out school is going to take much longer to complete than I initially thought. 

The only expense I have is my monthly car payment of $500 and insurance so let’s say 600 a month.

This job has been amazing and I would hate to leave the great pay but banking isn’t where I want to end up for the rest of my life and it’s the type of job you invest in.

My main objective is to finish school and get my degree. I want to educate overseas and see the world at a young age. 

Today I was late again on my final pip. Since I had my 2 week notice in my manager had to contact HR to see what to do. I’m not sure if they’ll terminate me or let me finish my month notice. I have been looking at jobs in my area but I really can’t find anything that matches what I want that being like part time 20 hours and a job I know I can succeed in. 

LTDR: should I toughen up, ask to continue to work at my position and talk with my manager and HR. Or just cut my ties, wait for the termination and find another job? 

I’m at a point where i’m overthinking everything, I haven’t even discussed this with my parents and i’m freaking out. 

Everyone i’ve talked to has told me “you’re 21, you got your whole life ahead of you” but I really feel like this is a big decision.",MentalShibe,2,1.0,2,1747336378,2025-05-15 19:12:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kngngw/what_do_i_do_now/,5,2025

1) Team Leader for a fast food restaurant. Pay is 17$ per hr. About 40-43hrs per week. The workplace is 3min away from my appartment so it would be very convenient. 

2)Retail Sales Representative. Pay is anywhere from 600-1800$ per week. About 38-43hrs per week. Since i just moved to a new city, i will relocate to the workplace through ubers (about 10-15min from apt) until i save to get a motorcycle or a car. 

3)Mover for a moving company. Pay is about 5000-7500 per month. About 40 per week. It is quite a hard job from what my roommate told me since there is a lot of physical things to do. Will get to the workplace through ubers mostly until i get reliable transportation.

Since then I’ve been working at a large name insurance company as a Total Loss Auto Claim Specialist. I’ve been in this role for nearly 3 years now and I’m feeling entirely burnt out from this job. It’s not a fun or rewarding job. I get yelled at by the public every day, I’m telling people their car is totaled, how much money they’re getting for it, and that their rental is going to be over. As you can imagine people are usually not happy about this and I serve as a punching bag for them. Management is always up our asses about SOMETHING. They track every single one of our metrics, idle time, many different things that makes me feel like I’m being micromanaged even if I am keeping up on all my work. Since I’ve been in this role I’ve exceeded expectations, got a promotion within the role, and received above average rating on performance review. However the last few months I feel like I’ve been falling a little behind because of this burnout I’m feeling. 
There are a few things I do like about this job, one being that I get to work from home 75% of the time, 3 weeks out of the month I’m working from home. I also do make pretty good money for my age and experience, I make almost $80K a year right now (including bonus). 
I would like to keep a job where it is either remote or hybrid like I am currently doing, but it’s not a necessity. I would be willing to take maybe a $10K pay cut to get into a different job. I would love something with a bit more freedom, with opportunities for creative thinking or collaboration with peers, instead of just feeling like I’m doing the same thing over and over again every day. I’ve applied for a few roles in a different department at the company that I’m at, but I’ve been rejected.

2. Courses to pursue
B.Sc in Geology (3 years) is the typical starting point.

Later I can go for M.Sc in Geology / Applied Geology to specialize.

For research or higher roles, Ph.D. in Geology is an option too.
3. Entrance exams
Some universities take direct admission based on 12th marks.

Others might require entrance exams like:

CUET UG – For central universities

IIT JAM – For M.Sc later (after B.Sc)

State-level CETs or university-specific exams

4. Top institutes for Geology in India
IIT Kharagpur – Earth Sciences

IIT Roorkee – Geological Technology

Jadavpur University, Kolkata

Presidency University, Kolkata

Banaras Hindu University (BHU)

Delhi University

Osmania University

University of Pune (SPPU)

Anna University, Chennai
5. Career paths
Government sectors like:

GSI (Geological Survey of India)

ONGC, Coal India, ISRO, DRDO

Private companies: Mining, Oil & Gas, Environmental consulting

Teaching & research after M.Sc/Ph.D
6. What I’m doing currently
Watching Geology content on YouTube (channels like ""Geology with Shubham Sir"", ""GeologyHub"", etc.)

Reading NCERT Geography books to get a basic understanding of Earth sciences

Planning to apply to a B.Sc Geology program after boards
Any suggestions or corrections would be super appreciated! Thanks in advance. ",Known_2009,1,1.0,0,1747334680,2025-05-15 18:44:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1knfy56/hey_im_currently_a_12th_grade_student_in_india/,5,2025

1knf0tb,how to quit my job of 7 years,"I (24F) started my job at 17 years old as an apprentice working in the city. It’s a small company (3 employees and 2 directors).

I really like the job it’s in a field I love and I get on with the employees and directors really well, they’ve watched me grow up essentially.  The perks are good, many work from home days pretty much unlimited annual leave. 

My only problem is I’ve just moved out, everything is expensive and they don’t pay as well as I would like. Also feel like I’ve out grown it a bit. I would most likely get a £10k per year increase in salary elsewhere (in the same job role). 

I do feel like I need to switch jobs I’m just wondering if anyone had any advice on how to bring it up? Do I give them an ultimatum and say I’ll stay if they increase the pay or do I just tell them I’m quitting?

Also worth noting this is the only job I’ve ever had and I have never quit a job before. Thank you!! 

TL;DR: how do I tell my boss I need to quit when I really like the job and the company, they just don’t pay well enough.

1kneuvl,"Looking to change careers, please help with next steps.","Summary: 28M Physiotherapist interested in changing careers but unsure which path to pursue. Please help in deciding next steps.

28M from the UK. I have spent the past 5 years as a Physiotherapist in the UK's National Health Service where I specialised in Neurosurgical Critical Care. I really enjoyed the profession, but unfortunately I reached a point in my career where there was little available upward progression and I didn't feel challenged any more. Sentiments of leaving have been building for a while, and I am now certain that I want to change careers.

Working at a cutting-edge hospital, I witnessed how advancements in technology revolutionised healthcare. Inspired, I taught myself the basics of Computer Science and programming through online courses. I was able to write some very simple Python programmes which optimised data collection and analysis during my clinical practice. I was also appointed the Digital Lead of the therapy department in my hospital (my role here was rather limited but was ostensibly to optimise our clinical software system for clinicians).

It was during this time that I had applied to some Master's courses in Computer Science. I was accepted into a couple of different universities, but I didn't feel ready to take the Master's course at the time, so I deferred. This was 3 years ago now. One of these universities (Queen Mary University of London) still retains its offer for me a place to study starting this September. I have two course offers at this university, Computer Science (conversion) MSc and Data Science and AI (conversion) MSc.

I remain unsure whether I should enrol onto these programmes. Contributing largely to my uncertainty is that I am unsure which career path I would like to take. Some options I have considered include (in rough order of preference, but they seem to change frequently):

* Project manager in medical technologies
* Software engineering
* Public Policy
   * Public Health
* PhD in Medical Technologies
* Civil Service
* Healthcare law is another consideration

As mentioned, I remain unsure which path to take. The ideal next step would be to speak to relevant people in each industry or even some work experience to gain more insights into which of these paths would be the most appropriate. However, I have the offer to study Computer Science now… waiting a year may just be a redundant delay with me resulting in taking the master’s degree anyway and I could be further along in my path with industry experience (I have delayed the degree for 3 years already). The flipside is that if I decide that Public Policy is the better fit for me, a master’s in Public Policy (MPP) would be more appropriate, for example. That being said, Computer Science is a very practical, applicable and transferable skill and could be useful in a range of the job options I have listed above.

Please help me whether I should:

1. Take the master's programme now, knowing it will open some doors for me and would mean I am taking some actionable steps towards a career path.
2. Or should I spend a year or two in employment, spending this time picking up skills (e.g. online stats course, computer science courses) and gaining experience in industry to shed light on which career path I want to take before applying to another (or the same) Master's.

* My concern about the second option is that I could, in a years time, just end up doing the Master's programme that I currently have an offer for. In which case I would have just delayed a year where I could have been making further progress in my new career.

Some further info:

* I have enough savings to afford to undertake the master's without a loan. The Master's is in my hometown and I could stay with my parents to save money. I live in a major city and there are many excellent universities I could study in and live at home.

Please let me know if I can provide any more information. Thank you all in advance for your help.",Derek9inch,1,1.0,0,1747332012,2025-05-15 18:00:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kneuvl/looking_to_change_careers_please_help_with_next/,5,2025

Everyone said JEE is easier and has more scope, so I joined JEE coachig but it was a disaster. I’ve never been good at math, and I couldn’t survive there. I left coaching mid-way, wasting money and facing constant yelling from my family. I had no foundation, no confidence, and felt like a failure the whole year.

I attempted JEE in January and April, both were terrible. Gave NEET in May and messed that up too. I feel like I wasted my entire drop year. My mental health has hit rock bottom, and now my dad just keeps saying, ""Take another drop."" But I don’t have the strength. They don’t realize how mentally exhausting a drop year is, feeling left behind, older than everyone else, constantly judged and compared.

I tried to apply for other courses like NFSU and AIIMS paramedical, but due to delays from my dad, I missed both chances. I’m so angry and helpless. My mom even offered to sell her jewelry for a private college, which made me feel like a burden. I feel ashamed, guilty, and broken. Even neighbors mock us, asking when I’ll get married. I barely leave the house anymore.

I still want to become a doctor, but I don’t know if it’s worth it. What if I mess up again? What if I can’t handle the pressure? 
Idk if i should even take a second drop, or I'm not even sure if I can crack it 100%, should i just do btech from a private college? Can i survive? Or should i wait one more year?

1kndz3h,Is mentorship in IT important? How to cope without it?,"I (23) am a Junior DevOps Engineer at an IT consulting start up (about 50+ employees). I had gone through the same company in my first internship last year where they then offered me this permanent position.

The company has just started taking on software product projects and there are currently no coding standards, processes or senior/experienced developers for guidance. I say no experienced developers, as a large portion of employees are coming through the company's internship program(60-70%). They have been doing it evey year for the last 3 years.

During my internship year and up until now, I have not received any mentorship of any kind. All of my learning has been self-taught. Although I understand that this is how it generally is in IT and I have no problem with this,  I cannot help but feel I am missing out on a large amount of industry knowledge and learning. I am at times, treated like the 'senior developer' by my managers (who are not very knowledgeable in software engineering). I am found having to advise and make decisions on things I, myself, have just been learning about and trying to grasp. 

I am trying my best right now to branch out and look for other roles while working here but I am also worried that by the time I get my next job they going to expect me to have gained industry experience in my time here.

1kndmgs,Has anyone tried “Speedy-Apply.com”? I just discovered a wild job-hunting hack.,"Hey all,  
I’m currently on a pretty intense job hunt (shooting out 15–20 applications a day), and I recently stumbled on a tool called Speedy-apply.com. I’m not affiliated, just found it while trying to streamline the endless job portal clicking.

Here’s what it does:  
It basically automates applying to jobs on LinkedIn and Indeed by filling out your info based on a one-time resume upload + preferences (location, salary, remote/hybrid, etc.). You still get control over each application, but it shaves down the process dramatically. I went from applying to 3 jobs/hour to 12+/hour.

What I liked:

* You can blacklist companies or roles you’re not interested in
* It keeps a dashboard of where you've applied
* The free version gives you a decent idea before upgrading

What I didn’t love:

* It’s not perfect for complex applications with essays or assessments
* You still need to keep an eye on accuracy — can’t just “set and forget”

Not sure if this is old news for some of you, but for others drowning in job boards, it might help.  
Anyone else tried this or something similar? Curious if there are better alternatives or if this is a game-changer I'm just now discovering.

1knctag,How do I navigate my two part time jobs?,"
So I currently work at a job that I’ve worked at for over 3 years and it doesn’t pay me great, but it’s not the worst either. The hours are the biggest pain and often have me working Friday and Saturday nights till 10 or 11 at night. There are no options to work earlier in the day because it’s an afternoon only business. 
Despite the moderate pay and the bad hours, I still enjoy working there because the job is fun and easy. 

The biggest reason I’m keeping the job is because  two of the owners really like me and hold very high positions at the Fortune 500 company I plan to apply at after I graduate college. With their references I would have a great chance of getting the job I want. For this reason, I have stayed at this job to look as good as I can possibly be in their eyes. I’ve managed to make myself the best and most reliable employee. 

I recently got another part time job as a manager at a retail store. The hours are better and the pay is almost double what I’m making at the other job. Plus, it would look very good on my resume when I eventually apply at the Fortune 500 company after college. 

I’m now in a personal conflict because I want to work less at my first job and more at the new job, but I don’t want to fall out of my bosses favor and potentially lose a good reference from them. The new job would look really good on my resume, pay me much better, and give me much more forgiving hours. 

I was thinking that I just tell my first job that I got a new job, but I ensured they wouldn’t take away from my hours. I would then tell them to schedule me whenever I was needed, but to give hours to other people who might want/need them more than I do. 

Is that a good plan? I’m trying to make everyone happy here, but I’m worried I’ll mess this up. ",Illustratingtheworld,1,1.0,1,1747327126,2025-05-15 16:38:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1knctag/how_do_i_navigate_my_two_part_time_jobs/,5,2025

1kncfjb,Finish out law school or commit to roofing?,"24 and due to medical reasons (and the subsequent financial costs) I ended up taking a leave from law school. I have three semesters left, and even with my scholarships the cost likely is around 40k. The firm I had worked for previously and planned to return to after graduation was great, but a senior partner (schedule booked 2.5-3 months out) told me she doesn't break 100k. We connected over hating the toxicity of law school, but her salary really surprised me given her busy workload and the stress of the job. After I took my leave, I let the firm know my reasons and returned to a roofing company that I worked for in college to cover my tuition as a seasonal employee. Yesterday my branch manager offered me a $7 raise (21.50 to 28.50) hourly if I signed full-time, and could jump between 30.50 and 32.50 an hour if I got my CDL. The company reimburses the cost of getting a CDL. The highest paid roofer I know at our branch makes 36.50 and grossed over 80k last year. But we work over 50 hours per week during the busy season. (April - November) Money isn't why I wanted to practice law, but I thought the pay would at least justify the responsibility and liability that attorneys are subject to. Knowing I could make over 70k my first year full time without having to worry about countless deadlines and malpractice claims has me really questioning if a law degree would leave me better off financially. I'm in the top 50% of my class and accepted a scholarship that requires me to practice in rural areas of my state. However, I am still in a rural area for roofing and enjoy the people I work with a lot.

1knc65k,I need advice,"
I need advice on my current situation. I'm currently a member of a union. I was recently accepted into an apprenticeship program, but I haven't started it yet. The pay is between $20–$22 an hour.

I also received another opportunity for a non-union job starting at $20 an hour, working in concrete. The job is pretty easy, and I’ve worked with the company before—although I was under a different company at the time. I’m familiar with their scheduling, routines, and I know some of the crew.

I also plan on going to community college to pursue a business degree, but I’ve come to realize that I need money now. I'm willing to finish my apprenticeship first and then return to school later.

It’s also become clear to me that most union jobs aren’t as flexible as non-union ones. For example, in most non-union jobs I’ve worked, we’d start at 6 or 6:30 AM and finish around 1:40 or 2:30 PM. With union jobs, there have been times where I had to stay until 3 or 4 PM. It's frowned upon to turn down overtime because it makes you look unreliable. But at the same time, I have a life outside of work.

So now I’m wondering if I should take the non-union route for the more flexible schedule, or stick with the union job and deal with the unpredictable hours. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",Frequent-Quit3736,1,1.0,0,1747325563,2025-05-15 16:12:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1knc65k/i_need_advice/,5,2025

1knb135,Should I do computer science or law?,"I’m a fresh uni student living in Australia and I’ve started my first year of a computer science bachelor degree. I’ve been thinking of transferring to law next year since as of right now I’m not finding CS enjoyable (maybe because I’m bad at it), but I’m not sure if I should actually go through with it.

CS 
Upsides:
- Has potential for a very high salary 
- Opportunity to work from home 

Downsides: 
- I’ve only started coding for the first time ever in February this year, but I’ve been finding it difficult for some reason (I don’t know what it is, I just have trouble wrapping my head around it, even though we’re just learning the basic stuff)
I don’t find it fun (probably because I’m not good at it), I’m alright at maths though. 
- I feel like I lack knowledge in the technical side of things
- I think if I code more I could be good at it though (?)

Law
Upsides:
- I think I’m at least decent at memorising concepts/facts
- I find the idea of analysing sections of laws, applying them to different scenarios/cases, and “arguing” my point enjoyable

Downsides:
- I’ve heard that people work insanely long hours
- Also heard that the salary isn’t as high as people might think
- I’ve never been “good” at speaking and being confident in general (you can say that I’m socially awkward)
- I think law will be more stressful than CS (might be wrong on this one??)

I’m going to do another semester of CS (just to give it another go) but guys what field do you think I should go for?  ",CharacterExisting788,1,1.0,1,1747322791,2025-05-15 15:26:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1knb135/should_i_do_computer_science_or_law/,5,2025
1knaumw,How to respond to sales contact professionally?,"
I tried posting this to r/sales but I don't have enough karma within the subreddit to make posts. Hopefully there are some sales professionals here that can respond.

My question is from the perspective of the prospect. I work in an administrative role at an insurance broker. Recently, I was contacted by sales person from a firm that provides insurance reimbursement plans for executives.

I know he wants to create a professional relationship so that our firm can request proposals from his company if our clients show interest in that type of executive compensation.

The thing is, I'm not the one that makes decisions as what we quote and with who. If I respond saying this though I know that his next question will be along the lines of ""Can you help introduce me to the person that does make these decisions?""

Unlike a lot of other sales people he actually put a lot of effort into his email contact by researching my career history. He also sent me a Linkedin contact request. I don't want to ignore him like I do with most sales contacts, but at the same time I don't want to be put in the situation of becoming a gatekeeper to him because I don't feel comfortable passing him on to the actual decision makers.

Any advice on the best way to respond?",frozenflameinthewind,1,1.0,1,1747322355,2025-05-15 15:19:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1knaumw/how_to_respond_to_sales_contact_professionally/,5,2025
1knaky2,Need some career change advise to lower position in education field,"I have been a middle level manager in a non profit health care position in the same company for over 30 years.  The hospital I am with has been struggling for many years and isn't doing well, but we are still here. They are currently going through a merger and bankruptcy to try and dig out of a finacial hole they are in.

The pay isn't great, but it's ok, low 80k. No raises in 4 years though.  401k cut. Horrible health benefits.

Some pros: lots of vacation (24 days for me) senority, flexibilty, good hours, etc. Some of the staff I supervise is difficult and nasty and I have a supervisor who is not really a good person to work for. He favors some team members and plays people against each other. He is sometimes verbally abusive and condescending to me. The job can be very stressful at times. I don't feel challenged, I'm often bored,and the commute is over an hr each way. I don't feel I have respect of some staff and my supervisor doesn't back me up often. A few weeks ago, one of my staff almost became violent with me for doing my job. That was the straw that broke the camel's back in my mind. It's not a very happy place to work here.
Overall morale is low. Long story short, it's got it's pros and cons.

I'm in my mid-50s, not ready or able to retire anytime soon. I feel I'm too old to get interviews and too young to retire. 

I've been applying for other jobs in my field and other fields on and off. Interviews are hard to come by. I don't really get calls back often.

I recently was called for an interview in a school for a secretary position but after the interview, I realized it's really more of an administrative assistant job. It's literally 5 minutes from my home. I was offered the job pending an interview with the director of HR (which is next week) to negotiate salary and benefits. It's a position that only requires a HS diploma, Associates degree preferred. I have a Master's degree, and 30+ years experience, but none in a school. I can do everything they are asking and what I don't know I'm sure I can learn.

The top salary guide pay is about 8k lower than what I get now, there seems to be a ton more work, I will not have a title other than secretary, and no private office.  I won't be supervising anyone. I will only be getting 2 weeks vacation but more holidays and days off than I do now. It's a 12 month position. I googled the district and got nothing bad as far as reviews. The staff seems nice from what I gathered from my initial interview and I know it's a secure job. My spouse is in Education and asked around and got overall positive feedback about the district, but I have some questions:

1. Is it a mistake to take a job like this,  which is a much lower position than what I have now? I am not much on titles or prestige, but I also worked hard to get where I am now.

2. How do I convince them that I'm really worth at least the top level of the salary guide?

3. Can I ask for more than what is listed in the salary guide? I don't need their insurance, Im on my spouse's plan. Is that something I can mention?

4. What can I say to convince them of why I would like this lower position instead of what I do now without bringing the drama of my current job into it? I know I'm hoing to have to convince the HR director, which is probably going to be harder than the first interview. 

They really seemed to like me, and they want me for the position if I can agree to the salary. I got a good feeling in the interview (she kept me almost an hour) but I also want to make sure I'm not making a mistake.

I'm also afraid of the work a little. I feel like impostor syndrome is taking over. I do much more important work now and designate a lot of it to different people. If I take this I will be on the opposite end taking direction. I'm fine with that,  just a little afraid of messing up.

There is little chance I will get laid off here, but always a chance. I'm afraid if I don't take this opportunity I won't get another one and I may have to go down with the Titanic here if they close, or worse,deal with horrible colleagues and a boss who plays favorites until I retire.

1knag0i,"I was ""let go"" yesterday","I had a feeling this would happen, but honestly, it hasn’t hit me like it has in the past. I haven’t cried. If anything, I feel relieved.

I was doing outside sales for a trash company, which never really aligned with my long-term goals or passion. The industry involved multi-year contracts, and the tactics often felt manipulative. It didn’t sit well with my work ethic or integrity.

For a long time, the company chose to protect a toxic male employee who openly disrespected me. It wasn’t subtle. He regularly crossed the line, not just with me but with others too, and it made the work environment miserable. By prioritizing profit over people, leadership sent a clear message that our well-being didn’t matter. When they finally let him go the day before I was fired, I felt a shift. For the first time, I thought there might be a chance for me to grow and succeed there.

Then, at the end of that day, my boss texted me asking to meet the next morning, yesterday. I assumed it was about a prospect we were working on. I even ran up the stairs, thinking we’d be going over next steps. But when I saw her sister, who also works in HR, and she asked me to close the door, I knew.

I laughed a little and said, “Oh no,” then smiled.

That was the moment I realized this chapter was closing.

She began with, “These conversations are never easy,” and I smiled even bigger. Not because I didn’t care, but because I felt calm. The thought of being unemployed as a single parent with no passive income or savings definitely crossed my mind, but strangely, I wasn’t panicked.

Part of me wants to cry, but the tears won’t come. Emotions are weird like that.

What stings is how much I gave. I visited hundreds of businesses, closed many deals, and put in the work every single day. But the ones that sting are the ones I lost because of poor leadership or lack of support.

For example, I brought in a $4,000-per-month deal through my own prospecting and relationship building with a property manager. I lost it because the company refused to agree to a one-year contract without including a three-year auto renewal. The client had never agreed to anything beyond a one-year term. In my eyes, if the service is solid, the customer stays and renews anyway. That one deal alone would have paid me $8,000 in commission, not to mention the other properties he already had me working on.

Then there was a smaller deal they kept stringing along, just like many others they refused to close with me, despite my efforts. It started to feel like they never really wanted to help me succeed.

The commission structure kept changing. I was told the award letter didn’t matter because it wasn’t signed. I had to fight just to receive the car allowance and fuel reimbursement I was promised during hiring.

I’ve already started applying to jobs, taking on freelance design, and I’ll even deliver food if I have to. But I feel free. I used to cry on the way to work. So when they let me go, I smiled. It felt like a weight had been lifted.

Part of me thinks, really ... again? What more do I have to prove? I’ve been let go more times than I can count, and each time it stings. But deep down, I truly believe the universe is making space for something more aligned. I’m in my 50s, and I long not just for freedom, but for meaningful success.

As a professional graphic designer with over 20 years of experience, I’ve carried other people’s brands for decades. Now, I’m building something of my own, something rooted in creativity, community, and purpose. I don’t have it all figured out, but I do have a vision, and I’m taking steps every day to bring it to life.

Have you ever found yourself in this position, a real-life oxymoron? If so, how did you find your way through?",MommaMomentum,19,0.9100000262260437,1,1747321365,2025-05-15 15:02:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1knag0i/i_was_let_go_yesterday/,5,2025
1knafpw,Keeping the peace,"Hi Reddit! I’m in the process of transitioning from a Fed position to the private sector in gov contracting, and I’m going in pretty blind to a new workplace with new coworkers. I lost my position in government for The Obvious Reason, which is kind of relevant to my question. 

I did some looking into my new coworkers on LinkedIn and it looks like I’m joining a fairly right-leaning crew, the kind who get into arguments with strangers about everything that’s going on. 

I don’t have the energy to engage in this in the workplace. I also don’t want to immediately be clocked as a “lib”. I’m looking for advice on how to dodge conversations of that nature that aren’t the standard “I don’t talk politics in the workplace” that seem to get people clocked as a “lib” anyway. Phrases that can be repeated and easily remembered are great, like ways to pivot away from conversations that are politically inflammatory and back to neutral ground. 

I don’t have the reasonable option not to take this job. I understand there are times and places to make waves and this is not it. My career is not my life and I like to keep work and life completely separate, and avoiding conflict that will inevitably spill over because of stress is not my goal.

1kn9sdw,Does my Student Internship make sense for my Career?,"Hi everyone! 

Im in my 2nd semester of my Bachelor’s degree in „Business Information Technology“.
I really wanted to work besides my studies so I decided to look for a Student Internship. Unfortunately, these Internships are very hard to come by where I live and they are gone quickly. 

I was lucky enough to find one and started to work in the field of „Documentation and Masterdata“. The company is in the field of supplying water, electricity and heating to a big city. I have a contract for around 2 years. 

Now my tasks are obviously documenting heavy. I also get to do tasks that are oriented around modernising and digitalising the department and helping out with IT. Therefore, I get to do some stuff that is associated with my field of studies. 

Now my question is if this internship makes sense for my future career, even if I don’t want to spend my whole life working in this field? 
Is it better to quit this job and wait till I find a job that suits me better and not work at all or to keep working and try to find another internship in a year or two? What is better for the CV? 
What are your experiences with internships and do they determine what field I will work in for the rest of my life? 

I don’t know exactly where I want to work in the future, but I feel like it would be more centered around people and project management in general. 

Thank you guys for helping me out!

I feel like I’ve racked my brain about what to do career wise, or any options I might have, and have just come up blank and am hoping that some different minds might be helpful. For context: I’m 40. I have an undergraduate degree in English with a specialty in creative writing. I’ve not done the whole song and dance very well and it took me longer than usually to get my degree.

1kn96ri,"Why is it so hard to find an office job right now in Leeds, UK?","I’m a 23 year old male, living in Leeds now (about 2 years ago I moved here permanently) and for the last two years I’ve had issues finding a decent corporate office job in Leeds, ideally central (as I live quite locally and not far from it by walk), but oh my days…

Before I moved out of London, I never had personal issues finding employment, even temporarily, and I understand the counter argument that of course London is much bigger, busier etc, but is it just me or are the employers/recruiters up here far more pickier and particular about the candidates they choose? Or for example, if you ever reapply for the same role like a few months to a year later, somehow the recruiter just ignores your application (if you don’t get picked the first time of course), and you go on their blacklist? It’s a bit bollocks really, but from my own personal experiences, down south finding employment was never so difficult or challenging.

Now, this isn’t me dissing Leeds or hating on it. I much prefer living here and it’s much quieter and people here are actually far nicer, so I’m never moving back down again. But man, I’ve been unemployed now for over two months and I’m kind of losing my sanity.

Any help or advice or even opinions? Cheers! ",plonkaplak,0,0.5,0,1747318253,2025-05-15 14:10:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kn96ri/why_is_it_so_hard_to_find_an_office_job_right_now/,5,2025

1kn8inp,Support for asking for a raise after realizing I am doing more than my initial job description.,"I had an annual review in February and overall it was very high. They gave me constructive feedback to prepare to be promoted. I was expecting the promotion at the time, but after their feedback, I understood ways I could improve to be better prepared. Additionally, I highlighted several responsibilities I have that were not included in my initial job description. This includes travel, of which I do average about 20 days a year- on top of all of my other work. For example, I have to speak at conferences, but this is not the only thing I have to do, I still have to get all of my other responsibilities done since everything I do is time sensitive (reports, applications, etc). I also now oversee a new program that was being developed when I was onboarded a year ago. I still have support on this, but I have, lets say, two new groups of people I support, about 3-5 additional hours of work a month. its not a lot of time, but its very complicated, and I will be expected to manage more as these projects grow. Overall, I think there is about 10 additional hours of work monthly (the travel plus additional projects) that I do. I calculated this to be about $5,700 more based on my current salary rate. Although I mentioned the additional responsibilities in my review and even proposed a new job description, no one really acknowledged it needed to be compensated for it, and I should have been clearer that to do this, I would like additional compensation. 

Do I try to negotiate now and ask for a random salary increase in the middle of the year, or wait until I am under review again, which will likely be around the beginning of next year?

1kn8hum,need guidance,"🚀 Career Crossroads: Luxury Brand Management vs. Business Analyst—What’s the Smarter Choice? 🚀

Hey everyone!

You ever feel like you're standing at a crossroads, torn between two exciting paths? That’s exactly where I am right now! 😅

I passed 12th (Commerce) in 2024, but due to some circumstances, I couldn’t get into DU at the time. Now, I’m finishing up my 1st year of BBA (Amity Online) and seriously questioning which field will lead to a high-paying job abroad.

💡 After researching, two career paths caught my eye:
✅ Luxury Brand Management – Exclusive world of high-end brands, customer psychology, and marketing. Sounds glamorous, but is it a stable industry with good international pay?
✅ Business Analyst – Strong analytical role, widely in demand, great salary potential. But do I need coding skills like Python, SQL, or can I enter with just business acumen?

📢 HELP ME DECIDE!
🔹 Which career has the best global prospects?
🔹 Real-world pros & cons—what do professionals in these fields wish they knew earlier?
🔹 Any high-value certifications or courses to jumpstart my journey?

I’d love to hear from people working in these industries or anyone who has gone through this decision! Bonus points if you suggest any alternative fields I might be overlooking. 😃

Let’s talk—your insights could literally shape my future! 🙌?",malaichaap69,3,1.0,1,1747316458,2025-05-15 13:40:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kn8hum/need_guidance/,5,2025

Enjoyed the work and loved the lifestyle but had some concerns. Got convinced to switch to another interest so I’m now completing my BSW and graduate next year. Well now the social work field isn’t looking very stable and a lot of students have already left the field. Some of them have switched degrees to IT and Business. I have a background in marketing, graphic design, and business as well. I have a best friend who graduated with a Computer Information Tech degree and got a 6 figure job immediately after graduation-she’s trying to convince me to go back to IT. I’ve been hearing that IT isn’t stable right now either. My friend said with my background maybe I can get into App Development or DevOps. I’m confused and concerned.

1kn83di,Should I let middle management handle it or go to HR?,"My supervisor has been on monitoring from her boss since I started 6 months ago. This means that her boss attends all our 1:1's, team meetings., Etc. This is because my supervisor relentlessly harassed a former employee, losing her temper and causing him to quit. He reported this to our office upper management but apparently not to HR before finding another job.

Things have been busy at work and my Supervisor's boss has not been able to attend our meetings. My supervisor has been conducting herself unprofessionally in her boss' absence; raising her voice, threatening my job, lying about policy, talking bad about other employees etc.

My team has had turnover and issues with work equity. When I asked for clarification on work equity my Supervisor lashed out at me and so I sent an email to her boss about the incident and the overall unprofessional behavior I have been experiencing from my Supervisor. My Supervisor then sent a follow-up email saying that I was being unprofessional.

Things have been tense at work and I met with Senior management who asked if I wanted to try to resolve this issue internally or go to HR. They said if I go to HR I could be put on a PIP.

I know that PIPs are cause for firing and I cannot lose my job. I dont know what to do. Senior management seemed insensitive to my concerns in the meeting, no surprise there.

My sister works for the same company and told me she has heard rumors of restructuring and that my boss may get demoted in the near future.

My Supervisor's boss is also a new hire and did put in the initiative to monitor my boss after her harassment of the former employee, against the interest of senior management who wants to bury these issues. She also told me privately she has witnessed many of my claims and believes this can be handled internally through recording our meetings.

I know HR is there to protect the company so I am very scared to take it to them and lose my job.

What should I do? Should I try to let management handle it or should I just go to HR?",222555111,1,1.0,9,1747315371,2025-05-15 13:22:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kn83di/should_i_let_middle_management_handle_it_or_go_to/,5,2025
1kn81hq,How can I switch career paths without taking a massive pay cut?,"I make about 100k working in 3PL industry and I want to switch to finance but it’s looking like a 30-40% paycut. How can I move over without taking a paycut?

I am a 26 year old guy and got this technical support job 3ish years ago out of college. The industry is very niche so i make a good salary early, but I’m afraid if I stay too long that will balance out and I won’t be marketable in other fields in the long run. It’s looking like I have to get in entry level jobs if I want to change paths.

I don’t have a great resume behind me because I’ve never really had a plan and still don’t. Just a vague idea. Majored/minored in Psychology/Management. Currently work in a Technical customer support role working with clients by email or phone all day. Don’t really have any certifications.

I think my transferable skills from current job are:
- customer service/support
- consulting
- small project management
- some data analytics (SQL/Powerbi)

I have been given extra responsibilities to create and run our departments KPIs in PowerBI as a side gig and I really enjoy that. Would be very interested in doing something similar full time.

In my free time I’m very interested in my personal finances. Love investing, been doing it since I was 18.

I'm starting to feel blackballed management put me on a separate network and its barely any work every time I try to reach out to my boss they wont let me sit with and learn with a team they always say we need to find somewhere to put you when the teams within the company 75% are horrible and actually need the extra work done I have a Jr level position trying to move up to mid tier and honestly I don't know what I should do. This is about the 3rd-5th time management says they are ""trying"" to find somewhere for me to go I feel like they don't like me for other reasons they just wont say I honestly consider myself a likable person and don't feel I have rubbed anybody the wrong way.

I have the certs I need to currently do the work and years of experience needed just a lack of movement from management seems like they want to just keep me where I am cause nobody else will do the work.

I have not 1 but 2 coworkers I came before and 1 moved positions to mid tier and the other is getting the experience he needs working with the team I wouldn't be surprised if he got the position before me he is actually learning getting hands on experience everyday the same thing I specifically asked the manager who put him in on that team for and she said she would try and did not so that goes to show they are doing for who THEY want to do stuff for here within the company they don't like me for other reasons I have no control over which sucks.

Monday I sent my manager a email explaining these concerns he still has not reached back out to me yesterday I sent him a teams message saying did he get the original email one he said ""I'll send your a response later this afternoon or evening as I'm in \*\*\*\*\*\* today on a site visit."" we have a meeting at 930 mind you its currently Thursday this is the second time I have sent him an email voicing concerns and he likes to not respond but speak in person or speak through teams is this not weird?

I know I could go to HR but I know they are not on my side and might make my manager really start to dislike me I don't want any problems or am trying to start anything I just want a fair chance for opportunity like everybody else.

1kn77fp,Am I about to be fired?,"So I am a salaried employee who was recently put on a PIP for “time sheet violations.” I have a punch in time, but I also have to keep track of my time manually and submit a written report.

My boss told me I had to write in manually in 15 minute increments; ie couldn’t write in 9:06, it had to be 9:00.

Some days I punched in at 8:56 and left at 4:56, some I punched in at 9:04 and left at 5:04, but I always wrote 9-5 on my sheet as that is what I was told to do.

Now my boss is accusing me of wage theft and although she said there isn’t currently any worry about losing my job, PIP seems like a step in the wrong direction.

Am I crazy that this seems extremely harsh for a salaried employee?

And I'd probably sit at like 70k for years before I was able to move up but it'd probably take me 10 years just to get there. 

I have an opportunity thru a friend to become a loan officer and make more money but i worry about the grind. But ive not syatted saving for retirement so i feel this need to catch up and 40k isnt gonna do it but if im a successful LO i can make 100k plus a year by this time next year... they are willing to pay my 52k/yr while I train as well.

1kn5q3b,Customer service transferrable skills,"I work as a receptionist / customer service associate at this flooring company. The customer service aspect of it is pretty new, I've mostly been just a receptionist until a few months ago. My manager's last day is tomorrow, she got married to some guy living in a different country, so she's moving there to live with him. I've always thought I was the obvious next candidate for her position, mostly considering I've literally done her job for her when she's been out on 1.5-2 week long vacations to visit him overseas. I would barely need any training to fill her role, since I've done it already, but instead they hired out and I'm ready to leave the company.

I'm not all that interested in dealing with people, I don't mind answering questions and providing help on the customer service aspect of things, I mostly hate the greeting aspect of being a receptionist, and being the middle man between customers and their salesperson. So outside of greetings and taking phone calls, I do a LOT of data entry. This is the part of the job I like much more, data entry and paperwork. I think my greatest skill is attention to detail, but there's obv a few others that go into customer service in general. My manager is the customer service manager, but also the accounts receivable rep. Additionally, our accounts payable rep was recently injured and in the hospital for like 2 months, and in that time they had me filling in on some of her duties as well. Not sure if those accounting aspects could be included on my resume or not since they were all temporary.

Other relevant aspects of my job are I pair customers with salespeople. We have a daily rotation for it so it's not very hard but there's special circumstances where I need to do things a little differently. I handle the ordering of customer refreshments, like boxed water and breath mints. I update spreadsheets that keep track of when salespeople have quoted and sold leads that they've received. I keep track of all transactions made each day, compiled in a daily sales folder. Making sure customer info is accurate and the same in all applications that customer info is stored in. I'm also given tasks that nobody else wants to do / has time for, like going online to find pictures and room scenes of ALL of the flooring materials that we stock. Transferring relevant files from this shared computer drive to what's basically a new, online version of the exact same thing, etc. miscellaneous tasks.

So I'm looking to re-form my resume, see what other potential fields I could enter with a customer service background, and what transferable skills I could mention in interviews, should I receive one for a different field. All help is appreciated, thank you.",nyancoaa,2,1.0,0,1747308198,2025-05-15 11:23:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kn5q3b/customer_service_transferrable_skills/,5,2025

1kn55dc,Automate Your Job Search with AI; What We Built and Learned,"
It started as a tool to help me find jobs and cut down on the countless hours each week I spent filling out applications. Pretty quickly friends and coworkers were asking if they could use it as well, so I made it available to more people. 

How It Works:
1) Manual Mode: View your personal job matches with their score and apply yourself
2) Semi-Auto Mode: You pick the jobs, we fill and submit the forms
3) Full Auto Mode: We submit to every role with a ≥60% match

Key Learnings 💡
- 1/3 of users prefer selecting specific jobs over full automation
- People want more listings, even if we can’t auto-apply so our all relevant jobs are shown to users
- We added an “interview likelihood” score to help you focus on the roles you’re most likely to land

Our Mission is to Level the playing field by targeting roles that match your skills and experience, no spray-and-pray

1kn0ant,Career advice,"Hello All!

I (35F), married with one child need your advice.

I work in the insurance industry and was given an opportunity to join MetLife. Similar role, but different portfolio. I initially accepted the new job and was secretly waiting for my bonus payout before I submit my resignation. 

Current employer learned about the offer and has provided a counter offer, but it is less than 12k compared to the new company. 

Pretty much same working hours as per contract and benefits.

I know it may be a no brainer to some and would suggest I go with the higher pay. But now after thinking about it, I did realize I would lose my current tenure and start from scratch again. I love my current employer and the people I work with. The only caveat is that their pay is less and the type of customers I deal with is sometimes horrible - which is the reason why I started looking for another job. 

The new role involves different portfolio so may be a different set of people, but who knows. I work in claims if that helps.

Need suggestions on things I may have missed to consider in choosing my next steps. Also if anybody has worked or is working at MetLife (Australia) - how is the culture in the company?

I wasn’t given access to the folders, tools, or documents I needed until just 3 days before the KT ended. So while I sat through all the sessions, I couldn’t actually practice or apply anything — which left me with a gap between theory and execution.

The moment the predecessor left, I was expected to take over completely and perform without errors. To make matters more frustrating, my manager kept reminding me that the previous person was a “star performer” who never had any escalations — even though she received direct KT from the client and was guided by them for over four months before being left on her own.

Despite putting in 12–13 hours every day, I made a few mistakes recently, (after a of Turbulent month end and a decent month end) — like missing 5 journal entries. I take ownership of that. But then my manager went a step too far:
He asked me if I had any “psychological” or “personal problems” that were affecting my work.

That hit me hard. I’ve been genuinely trying my best under tough circumstances, and instead of support, I got questioned like something’s wrong with me.

Now, most of my teammates have been moved to other processes temporarily, as the client wants to stabilize things before handing everything over. My manager asked me if I want to move too, saying there are other roles I might be more suited for.

And I’m stuck.
	•	Part of me feels relieved — maybe a new process in the same project means a proper transition and a chance to prove myself without this mental weight.
	•	But another part of me feels like I’d be giving up, like I’m walking away because I couldn’t handle it — even though I know the setup was unfair.
	•	I’m also unsure if I’ll face the same issues in the next role, or if it’ll leave me feeling even more under-confident.

Has anyone been through something like this?
How do you decide whether to fight through a tough situation or move on for your own sanity?

Would really appreciate your thoughts.

1kmzl61,General contractor in  socal,"Hey everyone,

I’m a general contractor m28 based in running a small construction business that I’ve built from the ground up. I’ve been in the field for a while and have a solid foundation of experience managing small projects, and delivering quality work. That said, I’m at a crossroads and could use some advice from people who’ve either been here or have insight into the construction industry.

I’m trying to figure out the best path to scale my company. Right now, I’m weighing whether I should go back to school and pursue a degree—maybe in construction management, business, or something similar—or if my time and resources would be better spent focusing purely on growing my business through networking, marketing, and expanding my team.

As of now, I don’t hold a college degree—just my GC license and experience. I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished, but I’m wondering if getting some formal education under my belt would give me a competitive edge or open new doors, especially when it comes to larger contracts or commercial work.

If you’ve been in a similar position—or if you work in hiring, contracting, or construction management—I’d love to hear your thoughts. Is going to school worth it at this stage, or should I double down on business development? What helped you level up in your career or grow your business

1kmzj90,Am I doing anything right in life?,"I was making less than 30k/year, working multiple shit jobs simultaneously while being in and out of college, then took out 50k of loans over 4 years once I got caught back up in community college to transfer to a state university. So altogether I spent a total of 8 years spent renting making less than 30k/year. All of this lead up to 2020, which was the year that I graduated with my bachelors in comp sci as well as got furloughed from both of my college jobs that I had spent 4 years at. 

What followed was 7 months of unemployment until I landed my first ‘career job’ in 2020 making 39$ per hour. Job hopped in 2021 to the new salary and again in 2022 to a newer salary. 

Currently got years worth of savings but graduate school has been a dream of mine so I started taking a class this year since it feels like jobs in my field are becoming harder to get and harder to find. Plus I want to hit the ground running in case I get shitcanned.

https://imgur.com/a/CfAxvox

Not gonna lie the one grad class for my masters of computer science that I am taking is really hard. I graduated with a 2.9 gpa in my bachelors of science program for computer science. I always felt like an underdog and it’s hard to be surrounded by smart hungry people. Idk if it is my being out of school for 5 years but the grad class is really hard. It’s definitely not as hard as physics and calculus was but it’s hard. 

Is it the right move? It’s a personal goal and honestly I feel like it could help me financially if not for making more money in life but for some sort of extra knowledge like a hedge. 

But I still can’t shake the feeling that I’m a loser and an idiot. Where am I going wrong

1kmz6yu,How would you go about starting an adviser business?,"As in people seek and pay me for my advice on the problems they are faced with. 

Last year, I decided to move across the country to be closer to family.

I left a promising career in government behind thinking it would be easy to find a job like it back home. I was terribly wrong. I have now been unemployed for over a year despite  applying to literally hundreds of jobs every week.
The constant search and subsequent silence from employers is driving me insane.

Consequently,I decided to pursue that one idea that I have for a business. 

Both friends and strangers have told me that I provide sound advice and that I am of great help when it comes to making big life decisions and its gone to such extent that I get calls late at night.

I figure I could probably monetize this ""talent"" of mine somehow but after researching the topic for a bit it seems like I need some form of legitimacy that would allow me to justify changing things from ""call this person, they are helpful"" to invoicing clients for phone calls and visits. 

Here is what I believe to be a useful definition:

""An adviser or advisor is normally a person with more and deeper knowledge in a specific area and usually also includes persons with cross-functional and multidisciplinary expertise. An adviser's role is that of a mentor or guide and differs categorically from that of a task-specific consultant""

1kmyckc,Will taking the same job withhold me from advancing my career?,"Hi guys, I’m a 19 y/o Canadian university student going into my 3rd year. For the upcoming semester, I’ve taken the co-op route and have been applying for jobs. I’ve received an interview for an administrative assistant job ($19.50/hr for 35 hours a week). I already have almost 1 year of experience as an administrative assistant, paid less (minimum wage, $17.20/hr). I like the work and I’m efficient, I strive to learn every bit about my job and the people there. But I want to progress into something human resources related, and higher paying.

This job interview is at the same company but in a different department. For co-op, I am only allowed to decline 1 job offer, and then I would be obligated to accept the next one no matter what. While I like working as an administrative assistant, I’m worried that it will limit my experience and withhold me from applying to other administrative jobs with varying responsibilities and qualifications. It also pays slightly less than other co-op jobs (which average at about $21-22 for other companies and the government). 

However, the commute is the same, I know my way around the buildings, the associated resources and whatnot. The job market is also highly competitive, especially for co-op - there were about 50 job postings with over 400+ people applying. The job market in general is crazy competitive in Canada right now. 

This job would be a safe and secure position for my co-op terms. But if I reject it, I automatically have to accept the next offer, even if I’m not thrilled about it. I also don’t want to limit my resume experience to administrative assistant jobs as I fear it may hinder on future opportunities.

Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you so much. I’m so lost. ",princess_vessel,2,1.0,2,1747279359,2025-05-15 03:22:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kmyckc/will_taking_the_same_job_withhold_me_from/,5,2025

I’m 19 years old from UK, unemployed and not in education. Considering doing an apprenticeship in either Electrics or Carpentry. Not sure if it’s what I really want to do, but I have no idea what to do with my life and those 2 careers seem like something I might enjoy and could be rewarding for me to do. They would also mean I could work in/at places I dream of going to (Svalbard and Antarctica) as those jobs are some of the main jobs people do there.

I know it’s very far-fetched but I need something to give me a little hope and I dream of working and living (even if temporary) somewhere far away from home and close to the arctic or very cold. 

However I also want to travel to New Zealand and Australia as well as South America, potentially staying longer at the former of those places and doing backpacker jobs. 

My concern is doing an apprenticeship in Carpentry or Electics might take 5 years and since I turn 20 soon I worry that I will spend a big chunk of my life doing something I might not like and potentially throw my dreams away as I get older and won’t be able to do all these things. So it leaves me at a conundrum, where I have many ambitions and dreams but think that if I make the wrong choice I could throw those plans all away.

Strangely enough, I’ve also been offered a second interview for another position that pays up to 45% more. I’ve been in this hospital role for just about two weeks, and from the very beginning, I sensed something was off.

During my pre-employment physical, the receptionist was unhelpful and even gossiped about me in front of me while on the phone with someone from another department. The colleague assigned to train me was unkind, and the overall environment has felt cliquey and unwelcoming, which has significantly heightened my anxiety. This has also led me to second-guess whether I want to stay in this environment long-term.

For further context, a colleague spoke to me harshly in front of a patient. I later confronted her and expressed that I didn’t feel comfortable working in such a setting and planned to speak with my supervisor. She urged me not to and convinced me to stay. While she did later express regret—offering a small gift and more support—I still have reservations. The emotional toll in such a short amount of time has been significant, and I suspect part of her insistence is due to high turnover at the hospital, all in all.

The new opportunity comes with significantly higher pay ($86K+ vs. my current $27/hr), but it's not without trade-offs. The job would be in a correctional facility, and relates to my graduate studies in Public Health, and to be completely honest I’m unsure how emotionally or mentally taxing that environment will be. On top of that, the commute would be lengthy—about 1.5 hours by public transit or an hour by car—and the schedule is fixed: Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.

This is where the biggest challenge lies. I’m starting a nursing program that will require daytime availability. My current hospital job offers flexibility with scheduling (though it may still be hard to reduce hours), whereas the potential new role does not allow for flexible hours. On the other hand, my current position includes tuition reimbursement that would fully cover the nursing program I’ve been planning to attend. I’m not sure whether the new role offers the same benefit—and the programs I’d be eligible for outside of that (which align with the new roles schedule) would likely cost $25K or more, and require additional prerequisites.

To be clear, I don’t *need* to stay in this hospital job. I have another part-time position that allows me to choose my schedule. What’s difficult is that my motivation to stay in this hospital role is already fading. I’m worried that continuing in a negative work environment could dampen my enthusiasm for entering the nursing field.

In sum, while I appreciate that some efforts have been made to repair early missteps at the hospital, I’m still feeling emotionally unsettled. I want to make a decision that supports both my mental well-being and long-term goals—but I’m truly torn.",Stunning-Low48,0,0.5,3,1747274512,2025-05-15 02:01:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kmwt6j/offered_a_higherpaying_second_interview_just_2/,5,2025
1kmwof7,"Have experience in software engineering and equipment validation, what roles can I apply to?","Hello,

I have a little over 2 years of experience as a fullstack software engineer as well as \~5 years of experience working as a validation specialist/engineer for medical device / biotech companies, specializing in equipment validation.

For context, I did a bootcamp to career change into software engineering with a degree in chemical engineering. Currently unemployed since January

After some time thinking, it might be best for me to move on from continuing to be a software engineer and look into different roles. I would love to continue to work with technology in some capacity if possible. I have also thought about going back to my previous role.

I wanted to ask for some advice on what roles I can look into that could use both of my experiences here? From roles I've researched, a lot of them require years of experience where I don't think i have much relevant experience.

1kmwi3g,Should I take a lateral move job offer?,"I have been at my current job for almost 4 years. When I started, it was a dream job in my career path with good benefits and above industry standard working conditions. In January, my division of the non-profit was acquired and all our benefits taken away. The hours and pay stayed about the same but the added financial strain of buying our own health insurance and loss of benefits made it a net loss. I already worked a couple side hustles and still love my job and the people I work with so I took the differences in stride. But with new business practices being implemented and some staffing changes, there is a feeling of uncertainty coming from both employees and customers. 

Recently, a former colleague offered me a position doing essentially the same thing for the same benefits. The only added benefit would be free shared housing, which would save me about 15k a year. The hours at the new job would be somewhat stricter, and the time-off policy more firmly enforced. Also, I would not have the flexibility to do as many side hustles and would be required to share housing, something my mental health has struggled with in the past. 

This being said the new offer is awaiting my reply and has already adjusted some of their offer to try and get me to accept (matching my current salary, adjusting work hours a bit).

TLDR; Should I accept the new job that seems to want me and is established or stick with the current job that I love and ride out the changes?",PortalPopper,2,1.0,2,1747273580,2025-05-15 01:46:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kmwi3g/should_i_take_a_lateral_move_job_offer/,5,2025
1kmvxqu,Please help me decide between 2 college Programs for the fall,"Power Lineman or Power Engineering. This is really stressing me out I live in Nova Scotia about 2 years ago I threw my name on the waitlist for the Power Lineman Course and just confirmed and paid for my this September but I'm having second thoughts, most of my friends took Power Engineering and it seems like a way easier job and is inside vs up at heights in the cold.

The Power Lineman course is only 1 year and starts at $50/hour but I'd be outside at heights and it's freezing here in Canada 9/12 months and the Power Engineering is 2 years and seems to start at $33/hour but is indoors doing 12 hour shifts, I'm really not sure if lineman is 12 hour shifts but I assume so? 

Also the Lineman course has about 130 people waitlisted vs like less than 10 for Power Engineering so if I were to switch I'd lose my spot but Power Engineering seems like a much easier job.

1kmv8qo,"Please help--I am one foot out the door pending a conditional offer, and current job needs to know if I want to be considered for promotion.","Hi there, hoping you all can help with this situation as I am new to this type of decision and don't know how to proceed.

I (28) am an administrative assistant for a small firm in the AEC industry. This is my first corporate job and I've had it for 4.5 years. I initially liked the role, but we are minimally staffed on the admin/accounting/HR side and some of our processes are old-fashioned or inefficient. Business has grown over the past two years; we've opened a new branch, doubled our amount of current active projects, and hired more staff in every department... aside from mine. As such, my responsibilities have grown as I directly support our CFO. There was one other administrative assistant for our firm who recently resigned, so in addition to an impossible-to-finish workload, I have been covering her tasks until our replacement starts next week. Upon her leave they offered me a raise to $60k, and thankfully I am making overtime. But the nonstop grind here is killing me.

Due to stress, burnout and the company's inability to provide staffing support, I began job searching last winter and particularly looked into public sector roles. In January I applied for an administrative analyst role with the County, for which the salary range was $67,000-$82,000. It is represented by a local union, located five minutes from my house, offers WFH one day/week, and would place me in a more specialized role. It checks all my boxes.

After a long application and testing process, I recently interviewed and was offered the position for $70k. Since it is with a law enforcement department, the offer is conditional upon a background check and very extensive pre-employment process. I was told that it can take 4-6 weeks for everything to clear, and thereafter I will receive the final offer which includes start date, where to report, etc. I received the conditional offer yesterday and have three days to respond.

Today in passing, my boss mentioned that they hired a part-time administrative support worker to assist with our backlogged clerical tasks. Also, they are creating a ""Senior Administrator"" role for me where I can focus solely on the higher level admin/accounting tasks, and hire someone else for reception/mail/daily office maintenance. This is exactly what I've been hoping they'd do for the past year or so! What timing. My boss said they need to know ""soon"" if I want to be considered for the senior position, and that we'll have a formal meeting thereafter to discuss the details of the role, etc.

Basically, I don’t know how to proceed. Due to the long background check process, I will need to stay at my current job for the next 4-6 weeks, possibly longer. I don't want to give notice until I pass the check and receive the final offer, so I have to act like ""business as usual"" and show excitement for this new role they're creating for me. But I also feel odd accepting the promotion, transitioning roles, moving desks, assisting with onboarding a new administrative assistant, etc. just to exit shortly afterward (or mid-transition). Current job wants an answer by next week. 

What I am trying to avoid: 

* Reveal conditional offer to current job.
* Give notice to current job prior to final offer from the County. Can't count the chickens before they hatch.
* Accept promotion and tedious process of transitioning roles immediately before resignation. 
* Leave my current job ""hanging"" with only a brand new receptionist when they could begin the process of replacing me, instead.  



I know I am giving too much consideration to my current job, and I'm holding the cards here, but I feel stumped. Is there a savvy way to turn down the promotion without revealing my conditional offer? Would the easiest thing be to lead them on, accept the promotion then resign several weeks later, however awkward it may be? I appreciate any and all advice.

1kmuyfl,Work part-time after Economics Master‘s degree?,"Hi folks, I’m currently at a crossroads where I could use some advice on know how to navigate my life. Here’s a brief summary of my current situation and my ideas, perhaps you can help me evaluate them, maybe you have better ideas you would like to share with me. Thank you in advance! 

My situation:
- From Germany
- Turned 22 in January
- Getting my bachelor‘s degree in Economics & Business Administration this summer
- Gotta move away from home this fall for master‘s degree (Finance or Management) because grades not good enough to stay at current university
- Dislike my major, chose it only because I wanted to restrict prospective career paths as little as possible
- I love singing, playing music
- Can‘t sing due to voice problems for one year

After the master’s degree, Plan A: 
Get a decent 9/5 job for two years tops, save a little money, and then switch to part-time (20h/week), earn enough to get by and enjoy my free time playing music (hopefully, if my voice gets better) and get good enough to get into the music industry someday, maybe even make it to LA.

Plan B: 
Like Plan A, but instead of just playing music I’ll try to launch a social media career, livestream on Twitch, or launch a podcast with my friends

Plan C: 
Also work part-time, but try to find a romantic  partner who is wealthy and provide me with financial security

Plan D:

5. I’m also interested in trending fields like AI and might pursue an AI course.



I don’t have a science background (no physics or maths in 12th), and I also don’t want to go for exams with extremely high competition like UPSC unless necessary. My goal is to get a top-level, well-paying, and respectable Group A government job.

How do I figure out the right direction? Is there any path that balances my interest with practicality and less competition?

1kmrukk,"Fired for ""not being the right personal fit for what they need at the moment and performance"" from my first post-grad corp job","I (23M, NYC) feel like I'm getting over it more, but that feeling of anxiety and despair still lingers. I've lived in the city for 11 months and moved here for the job. I respect the decision, and it ended on good terms, but I'm just questioning everything about myself over the past months. I was told that I wasn't a good fit for the role at the moment, and after my manager left, they felt like it wasn't working, and my work quality was decreasing. In some sense, I can agree, but I also felt like my performance improved compared to earlier this year. Even when asking for feedback on other projects, I would get minimal feedback or be told that I did a good job, and they made minimal edits. I didn't receive any prior review, warnings, or discussion about my performance before the meeting, except for my last 3-month check-in back in January before being fired. Also, if people had complaints about my performance, why was I not told about it when I requested feedback or had a meeting? The HR VP assured me that it was nothing personal or a reflection of me or my skills, they said I am a bright person, and have no doubt I have a bright future. She even offered to be a positive reference for new applications and personally offered to help me find new jobs that would be more fitting.

I just feel so disappointed in myself. It was a tough transition when my manager left, I had a lot of new self-instructed training and more work placed on me with no coaching. I still never got a six-month review or one-on-one meetings after my manager left, so maybe they were expecting me to rise above it? I did put in the work, turned in my assignments on time, asked for feedback, and enjoyed my co-workers a lot. Of course, I could've been better. I should've seen the signs more, like last week I help the new hire in my role discuss responsibilities, not realizing I was training my replacement.  I was a bit shocked by the meeting, but I had a gut feeling it would go this way after my manager left for some reason. Maybe I got pushed out? The VP did say it's nothing personal or about me as a person. It's just interesting because initially I was told they were going to find a replacement for my manager, but instead they hired another person in my position that has the skills to do what my old manager did and what I can do... 

The last thing I want to do is disappoint family, or what about the time and resources that were spent training me? I'll take lessons away from this, and I can always improve, but right now I just feel so embarrassed and upset at myself. I think in the end, it might be a blessing in disguise. The pay wasn't that good, and honestly, the VP might've been right about fit. After a while, I felt like I was less engaged with the work after my manager left, and more focused on completing my assignments and getting the work done. It was no longer exciting or enthusiastic, especially since a lot of the work revolved around living in excel. I think I want a role that's more stimulating, dynamic, and public-facing, where I can use my voice and communication skills rather than in an admin/support type role.",RaspberryPast6211,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1747260032,2025-05-14 22:00:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kmrukk/fired_for_not_being_the_right_personal_fit_for/,5,2025
1kmri8z,Should I (upcoming undergrad) take a Minor in Something that's not Life Science?,"I am a grade 12 student from Canada, Ontario. I have already applied to university and there is a high likelihood of me going into McMaster Life Science in the fall. However, it has kind of just hit me how hard it is to become a medical doctor and the unemployability of having a pure Life science degree. I hear that if you fail at the doctor route there's always a high demand for nursing. But it's tiring and people give shit to it and my mom says they will make me do night shifts. But also then I could've applied and started nursing 4 years sooner so why after undergrad lmao? Then there is also PA or pharmacology but those are a bit niche, plus I volunteered at a hopsital pharmacy where I was just sticking stickers on bottles for 3 hrs... very boring.

I really love biology and learning about the environment and plants...but plants don't have chequebooks now, do they? (ended bio with IB conversions 100%)

Thus this spiral brings me to me and math. I don't hate math, I more of just tolerate it and hope it's over soon, I ended up with a 96% in Calc and Stats (Lvl 6 IB converted - math SL) after many stressful nights of my dad teaching me math.

Then this brings me to today. I just did my IB HL economics exam (predicted 6) and honestly, while I hated economics because it was boring, the exam itself felt really easy. I think I hated economics because of the lack of empathy, it's all about profit max, lowest costs for highest output. But apparently, economics is a hirable degree?

I'm not an engineering/CS/math person in general, so I feel like those things are out of the question. Maybe the snobby business kids at my school were right all this time? Is it time to do something related to business? Accounting? Project management? Data? Stats? MIS? I also did get accepted into Western for medical science, a known business school in Canada but im not sure how flexible it is to switch.

TL;DR: Kid just realizes how impossible it is to become a doctor, average student at everything. Maybe now is willing to commit to the machine of capitalism in exchange for wages. Maybe realizes that all work is boring and I should just suck it up and feel alive again on the weekends.

1kmr62k,Two offers but trouble deciding which to take,"I(31M) was laid off back in Feb and with lots of luck and countless grinding I ended up receiving 2 job offers, but I’m having trouble deciding. Both are in the health field. Both have pros and cons and I’m really just stuck.

Job 1: 125k + 7.5k relocation(PM role). Higher base pay and better benefits(401k match, HSA match, Unlimited PTO), less opportunity for growth, lower COL area but has state income tax. Role requires me and my wife to relocate to Missouri(her families there so thats a plus) but I'm not sure what the work environment is and the sites in a rural area.

Job 2: 110k(Change Manager role). Lower base pay with lackluster benefits(no 401k match, limited PTO), supervisor role, startup, lots of opportunity for growth, higher COL area but no state income tax, good management, team expressed high desire for me, and really enjoyed the team. Roles downtown and in a great area.

Both roles are hybrid and commute time is the same. Overall it seems job 1 offers better pay and a better chance to progress my career as a PM, at the cost of relocating to a less desirable area. Job 2 offers better quality of life at the potential cost of changing career trajectory. I’m not sure which aspect of my life to prioritize and how to choose between the two.

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and would love some outside perspectives. I’m mid twenties, early career, masters degree. Here’s the situation:

Current Job (J1):
Pros
	•	Fully remote
	•	Work less than 40h a week
	•	$10K annual bonus opportunity (I met 100% of the goal last year but it was prorated and taxed)


Cons
	•	Not so good benefits (3% 401k match that vests only after 6 years)
	•	I’ve been here 1 year and already don’t like it
	•	Job security feels shaky. The program I manage is underperforming and has funding concerns
	•	Small company (~60 people) with high turnover (1–2 people fired/quitting per month)
	•	unrealistic goals 

New Job Offer (J2):
	•	$10K higher base salary (no bonus, but higher guaranteed income)
	•	State government position in a different state
	•	Commuting 2x a week via train (about 1.5–2 hours door-to-door each way, ~$200/month cost)
	•	Benefits are assumed to be better (state job)
	•	Aligned more closely with my degrees
	•	Also a project management role
	•	I used to think this type of position would be my “dream job”, just not in this state
	•	Moving homes isn’t an option 

I could tough it out at my current job or until they get rid of me. Or leadership pivots company strategy and I can stand being there indefinitely. Or I could be dead wrong about my anxiety on my job security or the program success.

What should I do?",Altruistic-Force8371,3,0.6700000166893005,20,1747255200,2025-05-14 20:40:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kmpwhz/stay_at_current_job_with_a_10k_bonus_opportunity/,5,2025
1kmpijh,Soon MHA graduate feeling unqualified....,"I’ve been at Children’s Hospital Colorado for 12 years and I’m working on transitioning into healthcare administration. I’ll be finishing my MHA this December. Lately, I’ve started looking at job postings that interest me, but it’s been tough to find something I’m qualified for without taking a big pay cut.

Over the years at Children’s, I’ve worked as an ophthalmic technician and was promoted three years ago to an ophthalmic educator. In that role, I handle onboarding, training, interviewing, policy alignment, and performance management—though I don’t technically have direct reports. I’ve also done clinical scheduling and a lot of hands-on patient care, but I’m ready to move away from anything patient-facing.

I’m really interested in roles related to project management, operations, or data analytics, but I don’t have certifications or experience in those areas. I’d love to get into that kind of work, but I'm feeling unqualified without any experience or knowledge of specific data/project software. I think I could get a clinical management position but this isn't what I'm looking for. Ayn recommendations on roles I should look for? Are there any easier project/data certifications that would help me break into the hospital administration field?

1kmpck8,"Career stagnation, not sure how to pivot myself into something more stable","**Hey hello. New around here. Just figured id throw my question in to hear some advice from people who may be more knowledgeable than me or have more career experience than me to help guide me.** 

So i am a Zimbabwean living in Canada, graduated from University with a degree in economics and did a lot of random computer science subjects along the way as i am a bit of a tech nerd but not fully skilled in any one particular area. But basically since graduating, i have been stuck in a bit of a loop of working part time jobs and gig jobs, with my only long term spot having laid me off during the pandemic and that caused a bit of career turbulence but i am back working part time jobs again and so was just wondering if there was any advice with regards to how to pivot into a more stable industry or how to put yourself out there for more stable jobs as i have been applying all over Indeed and LinkedIn but constantly getting rejections or overlooked for even entry level jobs that i am overqualified for so the market has been rough but i am seeking how to improve my skills and maybe even improve how i interview or approach applications or which jobs i should be applying for given my background and skillset. I have a fully ready work from home setup as i am a gamer so i have a bit of a strong PC and multiple monitor setup that i used for some of the customer service work i was doing during the pandemic and for some of my freelance graphic design work.



So just to list some of the jobs I've worked in no particular order:

1. Bartender, line cook and server at a restaurant during some summers before i graduated (2years on/off)
2. Deli clerk at a chain supermarket here in Canada (1 year)
3. Freelance graphic design work and a little bit of video editing work also freelance (ongoing)
4. Customer service specialist for a telecoms company (the one where i eventually got laid off after 3 years)
5. Compliance associate (1 year)
6. Door to door sales for solar and telecoms (contract basis on/off)
7. Inside sales representative for an HVAC/plumbing company (2 years)
8. Then various sales jobs I've done part time from counter sales for a plumbing company, counter sales for a piercing/tattoo spot, and then some security work part time with a security company as i got my security license and figured it would be an easy job to pick up shifts on when I'm available especially for odd hours

My qualifications:

\- Bachelors in economics

\- Security license

\- Food safe license (for serving in restaurants)

\- Serving it right license (for serving/selling alcohol)

\- Fall protection and forklift license (from the plumbing spot because we sometimes had to go pull stuff from the warehouse) 

\- Bloodborne pathogens (for the piercing and tattoo spot)

\- A few random Coursera certificates in various IT and business courses

So yeah basically looking for advice on which career path i should look at and what would maybe best suit me as i am looking for something stable and long term and need to basically phase myself out of this whole cycle of part time work and gig economy work as it is unstable at the moment and i have found myself grinding paycheck to paycheck coz with part time work sometimes you get loads of hours sometimes you get no hours and so forth so i am trying to pivot away especially from the many sales and customer service roles i tend to get offered.

Btw this is not self promotion, so i hope it doesn't get interpreted as that because i am just looking for advice on what i can do better and what paths i could maybe look into in order to find that long term career so i can break this cycle off just part time and sales gigs that haven't really given me any real career growth or given me a path into a steady career.

1kmp5nn,What’s the best way forward?,"Hey, I’m a computer engineering major finishing up my second semester. I failed algebra first semester, dropped chemistry, everything else high scores. Same thing happened in high school, as the math advanced the worse I did. I graduated with a 90’s GPA in HS which could’ve been higher if not for math. So finding out the hardware the obvious answer, I’m not good at math nor do I like it. Chemistry and physics involve complex maths so that I honestly have no care for. Basic algebra maybe calculus 1 is where I would like to stop completely. 

That said, my college offers Cybercrime & homeland security, as well as a regular computer science degree. The cybercrime degree only regulates I do calculus 1 OR discrete structures for math. The rest is basic CS1 and CS2 courses & courses around law. Whereas the cs degree requires I do up to calculus two, assembly language, and algorithms.

1kmoodb,Help!? I look like I lied on my resume?,"
Hey everyone, 

I’m currently job hunting after finishing a contract with another position. Before I worked at my most recent job, I worked for a big box retailer that was an incredibly shitty company. During my time with the retailer I was promoted to a customer experience manager. I was manager on duty, I had keys to lock up the store at the end of the night, I did coaching with team members and deescalation with customers and all sorts of manager duties. So obviously, I listed my experience on my resume as Customer Experience Manager and applied for other managerial positions in retail. 

I’m in the final rounds of interviews for a few positions when I was talking with a friend who also worked at the retailer, and who was also promoted to a manager around the same time I was and had the same frustrating experiences I did. 

My official title with the company never changed. In all official documentation my title is still regular service team member with no record that I was a manager. I think the only thing would be the slips I signed confirming the tills were counted and deposited? They actually didn’t start paying me the manager wage until about six months into me having the position (I did receive back pay eventually) and when my pay finally increased it was at the same time as everyone received their performance bonus.

The friend ended up losing out on a job because during the employment verification process, the correct title of customer experience manager she listed on her resume didn’t match the employment verification process. So I’m thinking the same thing is going to happen to me as the entire city uses the same company for employment verification.

So uh. What do I do? How do I get on top of this and make it clear that I didn’t misrepresent my qualifications and employment history? The company I worked for just sucked? What should I do going forward?

Thank you for any advice! ",miss24601,2,0.6700000166893005,2,1747252222,2025-05-14 19:50:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kmoodb/help_i_look_like_i_lied_on_my_resume/,5,2025

1kmlqr3,Put on PIP and gave notice -help,"I’m going to try to keep this short and sweet. I work for a group of financial advisors, when I started I was just a scheduler/phoner. I call people, set appointments, manage the calendars..all that good stuff. 3 months into my new role, a girl quit and they decided not to replace her. Instead they got me licensed and I was now doing both insurance operations and my original job. This did not come with a pay raise, a bonus structure or a new job description. Since then I have been absolutely slammed all day every day. Which has lead to a few VERY EASILY FIXABLE mistakes. On Good Friday, I was called into my bosses office and they put me on a PIP because of the mistakes. None of these errors resulted in any losses for the firm or anything like that. The pip also listed things outside of my control, like IT issues, the advisors not following their calendars and being late and worst of all, they indicated I have a bad attitude. I’ve never in my life been told my attitude is negative. 

Anyway. At first I hunkered down and spent more time double checking everything. I burned myself out and realized they just want me to leave. In the mean time, my next one on one after my pip, lasted 8 minutes and my boss said all is well and I’m doing a good job. Mind you, they’re HUNTING for any mistake. Would wait until a meeting popped up on the calendar and was pending tracking through Microsoft 365 and would say I didn’t set regard it. Things like that. 

I found a new job and start Monday. I told my boss two days ago that I’d like to finish the week and he announced to the entire team yesterday that I’m leaving and included comments like “yeah with 4 days notice which is kinda shitty” and I’ve been getting iced out, they’re interrogating me and my coworkers that I’m close with to find out where I’m going and no one is cracking

1kmlh5e,Is it worth it to leave a boring job that pays the bills to pursue something more engaging?,"I currently work as an insurance salesman. The work is easy, I have extreme flexibility and I work from home. It also pays the bills pretty well. The only problem is that I am BORED all the time and I'm home alone all day long. There really isn't enough consistent work to keep me engaged (sales opportunities are limited) and while I can chat with my coworkers, it really doesn't do much to prevent a feeling of isolation and stagnation. The idea of working this job forever sounds like a drab, grey life that I would be disappointed to have lived when I look back from my deathbed.

I'm considering going back to school to pursue the career in biological research I've always wanted to do. My hope is that the work will be more engaging and challenging and I'll be able to work in a team environment to socialize a little more on the daily. I don't mind the schooling I would need to do and the likely drop in pay is not really a big deal. 

My problem is that it feels INSANE to leave a stable, decent paying job to pursue something much more difficult with lower pay and way less flexibility. But I'm not happy where I'm at right now. I'm chronically under stimulated and isolated but it feels stupid to search for something else when my current job is taking care of my needs. I know that tons of people would be envious of my current job. 

So people who have left something stable and boring to pursue something more difficult and uncertain, how did it go? Was it worth it?

1kmlgii,Career in trading,"  
Hi, I’m currently a first-year student at Bocconi studying Finance. During the course of this year, I’ve been thinking that a trading career could be my route—particularly in Fixed Income or Equities. 

There are a few questions I have about it:

1. What has trading become nowadays? (I obviously know that the quant world has taken a large part of trading, but at the same time, I don’t believe that would be my path. Despite my passion for mathematics, my current Bachelor’s in Finance may not put me in the most competitive position.) Is trading still an exciting role, or have most traders become more execution-focused and less active?
2. Could you help me understand a bit more about the practical, day-to-day differences between buy-side and sell-side trading roles?
3. Another strong interest of mine is a role like desk strategist—particularly what comes to mind is a FI & Macro desk strategist role at Citadel, which is my current dream job. Could you help me understand a bit more about the difference between the work of a desk strategist and a trader at a hedge fund?

Sorry for the long message, but I have so many questions and unfortunately so few opportunities to ask them.

I graduated top of my class in Industrial Engineering and have some programming experience. Admittedly, I haven’t put much thought or effort into planning my career so far (I know dumb, but I struggled with some mental health issues and just wanted to focus on getting my degree first).

Now that I’ve graduated, I still find myself unsure about which career path to pursue. I tried out project management, but i didn't really like it since i'm more interested in technical and less in administrative/organizational tasks. I’m looking for a well-paying stable career. I'm not necessarily aiming for the highest salaries.

I want to approach things the right way this time by planning my career ahead, gain some work experience in this area, and then possibly deepen my knowledge through a master’s degree.

So I’d love to hear from you:

- What is your current career, how stable is it, and what can someone in your field expect to earn on average( I'm especially curious about unconventional or lesser known career paths) ?

- What do you like most about your job and what do you dislike?

1kmkpeo,"After being laid off, basically ended up a step down now it’s hurting me and I feel stupid","I’m now in basically an entry level position, when I have 4 years prior experience in this area as well as some other outside of it. now I feel so stuck and lost.

First I’m on a sales team and I don’t even want to be a sales manager so it’s already harder to grow anywhere. There aren’t many positions available in general and I think half the company is sales. 

Also I really don’t “own” much of anything, so it’s not like I can really shine and it also doesn’t give me much confidence. Since I’m not super outgoing or talkative, I don’t say much in meetings because it’s rarely about things I work directly with. So then of course nobody will see me and be like yes she needs to be promoted. 

Even others in my position do more than me on other teams and I don’t get it. Partly just my team is different. My manager is aware too and they’ve also mentioned in reviews things that I could look at growing into. But it kind of just hasn’t happened and yeah maybe I should be more forward about it but now I kind of don’t care, like kind of rather try to get a position more my level somewhere else. Because also now a job is open and it’s clear they’re not even considering me, probably partly because its not really a next step from my position but it’s like my other experience doesn’t even matter. When I was interviewing for jobs before, i had a lot and many paid $20k more, I ended up getting this one though right after being laid off so even though it was paid less than I thought and I didn’t totally realize how entry level it is, I had to take it. But at first I was ok with it, it’s a good company etc but I’m seeing now I kind of screwed myself.

So I feel forced to look outside however it’s harder to find a job now of course. And I’m just kind of sitting here feeling kind of dumb. 

So I’m trying to maybe get a career coach because I also could use help on seeing the best path for me. Also i wondered if this happened to anyone else.

1kmk7fy,Early 20s First Full-Time Job Nightmare Manager,"Looking for some advice on what I should do. I’m an early 20s professional that recently landed my first full time coordinator position. Have only had part time and internship positions before this so this is a huge step in my career. 

The position is with a huge organization that is going to require me to move across the country with zero relocation reimbursement but I figured the experience will pay for itself and it’s in a city I’ve always wanted to live anyways but still scary moving away from my family for the first time.

Anyways, I’m still in my first month of the job, but working remotely right now as I’m still working on relocating. I’ve run into an issue where my direct manager is micromanages me to an extreme level. I understand that I am still new and get they wants viability into my work but it feels extreme.

I feel like I was obviously hired for a reason and trusted with my background that I know what I’m doing. But it constantly feels like my manger doesn’t trust me and I end up second guessing everything I do because they want me to run it by them first. This includes sending simple emails to staff just asking simple questions…they want me to ask them first because they may have the answer and don’t want me reaching out asking questions to someone else if they’ll be able to answer it anyways.

Apart from that, they want to be copied onto EVERY email I send, even the one-off ones just confirming a date or something. 

The most recent one that set me over the edge was me writing an email that I of course had to get their approval to send anyways, and I said “apologies for the delay in my response” (because I had to wait to get approval from them to send the email). And they later replied to me saying next time not to say apologies but “thank you for your patience”

I’ve never experienced this type of micromanaging and I feel like I want to stand up for myself but it’s too early in the job to say anything. I’ve considered what it would look like if I quit and just stayed at home and not taken the position but the job market is so bad right now and if I stayed I’d probably just end up with another internship that would’ve advance my career in anyway. It’s also been making doubt I even enjoy the job in the first place.

How do you deal with someone who micromanages to this level and will it eventually get better? Is it worth just sticking it out for a year just to have it on my resume?

Eighteen months ago she introduced me to an interdisciplinary collaborator and we embarked on at eight month granted funded project. The project has concluded but the organization is interested in continuing it and leaders have proposed half of my position be dedicated to and budgeted for this work. This has not gone over well with my boss, our meetings are borderline antagonistic and chaotic. She knows that if I lose this opportunity I will likely leave the organization as it is my only chance for advancement. 

In our last 1:1 she established an arbitrary deadline for the new dedicated position to be verified in the budget. The timeline does not correspond with our budget process but to our 1:1 schedule. If the deadline passes without “verification” I will lose this opportunity. She explained this as a kindness, keeping me out of “limbo” but followed those statements acknowledging (three times) “I know this will be bad for you”.

1kmjvle,Should I take a contract to hire role at double the pay?,"Hi there,

I've been offered a role at a much smaller company, that only hire contractors with the option to covert me to FTE further down the line (contract to hire), but most seem to stay contractors. The new role is pretty good for me, as I'm a little bored/stuck in my current role having worked there for quite a long time in a pretty narrow role. Both roles are in NYC so VHCOL - I am 29 and have consistently performed very highly and been promoted 2 years ago)

**Current Role**

* Base: $156k (last few years have been 2-3% raises)
* Bonus last year: $30k (could go up or down)
* 8 years of service and 'senior' title
* Huge company (SP500)
* 3 days a week office/2 at home

**New Role**

* $150 per hour which for the hours (45) and weeks working (46) equals approx. $310k
* No benefits/match etc. (I can go on my partner's insurance and I negotiated an extra $10k to cover that).
* No particular title (senior etc).
* Relatively tiny company but well respected - what I want from my next role if possible.
* 2 days per week office minimum
* W-2 through agency (gave choice of 1099 or W-2 but as I want to buy a house in the next 2 years I don't want to start anew as self-employed for mortgage reasons).

I pretty much need to make a change at some point, as my current role is pretty deadend so I'd have to change team at least. Changing team in my current company cannot come with a pay increase (at least automatically). The new role should be much broader and have an ability to make impact (current role is very slow but easy/chill).  

Curious on people's thoughts on the new role and if there's any red flags.

1kmjj70,"Working contract roles my entire 20s, how do I land a permanent position as someone who is stuck in entry-level hell?","For the past 9 years, I have only ever worked in contract roles and could never land a full time permanent role. All my roles have been through connections/friends but they have always been interim entry level roles with the possibility of becoming permanent roles and I was never able to land a permanent position. I continued to just accept any position I could without thinking about the consequences because I needed the money. I really believed that it would be good for my growth to learn new things in different roles and industries.

I have worked in marketing and social media, in admin positions as an executive assistant, office manager, or operations in the not for profit and film/entertainment industries. I also worked in tech as a front end developer and team/project lead. I tried freelancing in graphic design and web development, as well as the minimum wage jobs in the retail and food industry. I even tried to become an influencer and stream video games on Twitch hahaha.. I am the literal the definition of a jack of all trades but a master of none and it definitely has been impacting my career journey and my future as it looks really bad on my resume that I have worked in only entry level contract jobs no longer than a year and a half to 2 years.... for almost a decade! This is no fault but my own and I really screwed my life up. 

I am 30 soon and I do want to experience more in life like travelling, owning a home, invest in fun hobbies, and to stop worrying if I have enough money to pay all my bills. I feel like I can't do the things I want to as someone working contract roles living in a very expensive Canadian city and I need a permanent position for more financial stability. I have only been paid CAD$40,000 - $60,000 yearly salary in these contract roles with no benefits, while my friends are all making well over CAD$100,000. It has been affecting my social life as I can't travel the world with them or go out to eat as often and am always suggesting cheap hangouts. I can't help but compare myself to them and I wish I was where they are at in life.

My contract for my current job is ending at the end of June and I applied for the permanent position but it feels like someone who has 15+ years of experience will be taking over. I have been applying to permanent roles where I have the experience in but I am in entry-level hell!!!! No idea if I can even negotiate a higher salary or if I am eligible to apply to jobs over CAD$60,000 or even apply to more experienced roles. I have no connections/friends to lean on for a new role this time. Any words of wisdom would be helpful.

1kmj6st,Mental Fog: The Silent Epidemic of a Brilliant but Disoriented Generation,"**We are the most educated, connected, and opinionated generation in history—**  
And yet, we’re also the most underpaid, directionless, and undervalued.

We walk out of universities thinking we’ll earn ₹1 lakh/month, only to land jobs paying ₹15,000.  
We studied code, design, economics, systems—  
Now we copy-paste data, answer calls, run errands.  
And the scariest part?  
**We’re okay with it.**

This isn’t a job market problem.  
This isn’t a government problem.  
This is a **clarity problem**.  
This is **mental fog**.

**Let me be clear:**  
I’ve worked with people who spent 4 years becoming developers—  
And they don’t even know why they did it.  
They’re not building anything.  
They’re not learning anything.  
They’re just “there”—existing through a job they don’t care about, earning just enough to not ask questions.

Ask them what they want.  
They don’t know.  
Ask them where they want to be in five years.  
They laugh.

This isn’t laziness.  
It’s surrender.  
It’s the brain giving up without saying it out loud.

**Gen Z has two big problems:**

1. **Companies don’t trust us.** They say we’re impulsive, we quit too soon, we expect too much too fast. And yes—**they’re not wrong**.
2. **We don’t trust ourselves.** We scroll endlessly. We consume advice without executing. We live in “almost”:

* Almost focused.
* Almost building.
* Almost applying.
* Almost starting.

We’re not lazy.  
We’re just fogged.

**And here’s the truth no one wants to admit:**

>

You don’t have to make decisions in fog.  
You don’t have to chase risk, face discomfort, or admit failure.  
You can just keep moving in circles, convincing yourself that it’s progress.  
You can say you’re “figuring it out” for five years straight.

**I’m not selling you hustle.**  
**I’m not telling you to start a business.**  
**I’m not here to motivate you.**

I’m here to make something clear:

>

* Stop saying “I don’t know what to do” and start doing *something*.
* Stop talking about what you *could* be and start becoming *something real*.
* Stop using your degree as a wall, and use it as a window.

**And if you genuinely don’t know what to do—if you’re stuck—then reach out.**  
I’m not here to sell you anything.  
I don’t mind figuring it out *with* you.  
But don’t sit still.  
Don’t stay fogged.  
Don’t pretend the silence is normal.

You don’t need to be exceptional today.  
You don’t need to be rich, famous, or fulfilled.  
But you need to move.  
You need to take yourself seriously.  
Because clarity only comes *after* motion—not before it.

>

We are not the lost generation.  
We are just the fogged one.  
And once that fog lifts—everything changes.

1kmj2l0,what to do about lousy lazy coworker,"I am on a team with one other person + our boss. our boss is nice enough but a total people pleaser and completely conflict averse. 

my coworker has been there for at least 10 years, totally untouchable. my biggest issue is since I was hired four years ago, all I've done is clean up their messes- all our files & such that they have created are just chaos. I guess this leads to job security. but my coworker is the laziest person I've ever met in my life.  they \*literally\* work two hours a day or less in the office. How do I know this? well they have a NINTY MINUTE commute each way (this is totally voluntary, absolutely no reason to have this commute, we do not live in a high cost of living city or a city with crazy traffic) so they roll into work at 9:30 and some days leave as early as 12:30 to go ""pick up their kids"" since they have a 90 minute commute (the ""picking up the kids"" thing seems to be the only excuse that flies in our office as all the bosses have kids but most of us lower employees do not). after they leave, they are impossible to get ahold of via phone or email. MY BOSS NEVER SAYS OR DOES ANYTHING. this coworker is supposed to be working 7-3 or 8-4. they left everything slip through the cracks, I am continually checking in on things, looping back around, inquiring if things got taken care of. we repeatedly have people emailing us saying ""I've been trying to get a hold of your coworker for weeks now with no response"",  my boss doesn't seem to care. This person is higher than me by one position (and makes a shit ton more money than I do. they make like really really good money) and yet, I am forced to continually clean up after them. 

It is really starting to impact my personal feelings toward this person, I don't even want to talk to them about casual stuff because I have zero respect for their work ethic and feel like I am acting as their babysitter. I am turning bitter. 

I really do not want to rat out my coworker to my boss (who knows exactly what is going on, can see it in broad daylight), I just want everyone to be a professional adult and do their job.  what would you do?

It was like a dream; they took me training in a different country to get used to the environment before they launched in my region. Everything was going more than well, I was performing well my bi-yearly review by the country leader was good and everyone advocates for my work.

3 months ago a new manager got hired who is the most (and forgive me for my language) dumbass man I've ever had the awful displeasure of working with. No communication, doesn't know what he was supposed to do, lead by throwing any question or help I needed on anyone else. 

We had a huge argument less than a month ago and I tried to solve it without escalation but he insisted on forcing me to go to HR, I went to HR they suggested to set up a meeting with him and discuss the issues. 

My biggest regret is not writing my own transcription of what happened during those meetings, so my reasoning for shortcomings (such as not agreeing to work on my day off 😭😭) are a mystery (there are Teams chats proof though).

I talked to some friends and family to discuss my next steps, luckily my country is VERY strict on retaliation so I immediately called for an internal investigation to be conducted, I documented everything and I objected to the PIP immediately.

I'm here to see if I should go on with the PIP since he will definitely not find anything to hold against me and just raw-dog it for another year, or should I start building a case with the labour office, or should I start looking for jobs now?

I wasn't studying clinical psychology/therapy, rather experimental, which I actually think gives me a leg up because I've designed tons and tons of experiments and relied heavily on data/quantitative analyses. I think when I went into college, I had the wrong idea about success in America. I initially wanted to be a physical therapist, then realized I hated anatomy and didn't want to go into debt. I think that would have been a poor career choice anyways, with a salary ceiling pretty early on. I went into the PhD program for a combination of reasons, but honestly academia is too slow for me and I just don't feel like I'm around people who really want to hustle and work hard. But hey, at least no debt!

I'm 28 which is older than I'd like to be to transition careers, but it is what it is. I've realized that I am most interested in jobs that MBAs apply for, aka consulting. I am at a target school and I have started prepping heavily for the case interviews and asking alumni from my school to chat over Zoom etc. But, I am very worried about getting an interview at any of the top firms, or even if I do, passing a case interview. I just don't know if 2-3 months is really enough time to prep. Additionally, part of me feels like I don't *need* a super fancy job.

1kmg91h,Would you take a “lower” position that was closer to home and avoided a long commute into the city?,"I’ve been working for about 20 years. I took a new role a few months back after several years with a separate employer.  With the return to office push, I’m not having much luck finding full time remote roles. 

A recruiter recently reached out to me on a different role. My commute would be about 15 minutes to the office three days a week but still hybrid two days a week. 

On paper the “title” is one below a job I have now. It is also in a slightly different role which I have actually been wanting a career change - though I haven’t been sure on what. This would be different but still familiar with my skill set.  

I asked for and am waiting for the salary ranges. That of course will be a non starter if it’s absurdly off. 

Going back to my original question though - is it still considered bad to take “a step back” career wise?  For the record, I think modern careers in general are a joke. I only do this for the money and take zero pride in it.

I talked to the Sales rep, Regional manager, and HR rep and let’s just say that they’re all really liking me so far. The sales rep even called me right after the interview to thank me and telling me that their interview was amazing and that he sees potential. So getting to the job, it’s gonna be an hour away from where I live but I was told that I’m gonna be receiving mileage reimbursement. My plan is to bare with it for the next 7 months and then when our lease is over, we’ll plan on moving to the city that I’m gonna be working in so I’m not having to drive an hour to and back from work.

When I presented it to my supervisor, she immediately criticized it, saying I didn’t have the level to be a jurist (yet), that my legal reasoning was weak, and gave me nothing but negative comments — no encouragement, no constructive feedback, just straight reproach.

I’m just an intern. I haven’t reviewed some of the core legal theory she was asking about in almost three years — and the questions she threw at me during the presentation were specifically about things I studied that long ago. I did my best to answer, but it felt like she was setting me up to fail rather than guiding me.

Now, however, I'm thinking that I stay at Job A at least through the beginning of next school year (while securing a rec letter or two for my applications) and shadow/intern at Job C over the summer, and then see if I can transition to working there fulltime while I'm applying to graduate school.

1kmf8mh,Who else had career consultation with Joanne Mok?,"Warning: This Career Coach Wasted My Time and Money – Learn from My Mistake!

Avoid This So-Called Career Consultant – A Complete Waste of Time and Money

I recently paid for a career consultation session with this so-called career coach, and it turned out to be one of the most disappointing professional services I’ve ever experienced. Here’s exactly why:

1.Came to the Call Completely Unprepared: I shared my background and relevant information ahead of time, but it was clear during the call that she hadn’t bothered to review any of it. She asked basic, introductory questions that I had already provided answers to in advance. Instead of using the time to dive into meaningful advice, she wasted the first half of the session talking about herself—something I didn’t pay for or need.

2.Short and Rushed Session with Zero Immediate Value: Although this was supposed to be a proper consultation, the call barely lasted 20 to 30 minutes. When I asked direct questions hoping for actionable advice, her response was repeatedly, “I’ll provide that in the email after this,”—which, unsurprisingly, she failed to deliver.

3.Lack of Relevant, Personalized Advice: Despite me clearly communicating my career focus and goals, the limited advice she did offer was completely irrelevant and disconnected from what I shared. It felt like she was just recycling generic suggestions that could apply to anyone, rather than offering tailored insights based on my situation.

4.Generic Resume and LinkedIn Feedback: She promised detailed feedback on both my resume and LinkedIn profile but delivered nothing beyond surface-level, boilerplate advice that anyone could easily find online for free. And to make matters worse, she didn’t even provide the LinkedIn feedback she explicitly promised.

5.Questionable “Networking Support”: She claimed to have an extensive network but only shared a random email address with no background or context—no indication of who the contact was or why they’d be relevant. This felt like another checkbox exercise, not genuine support.

6.Unprofessional and Contradictory Communication: When I raised my dissatisfaction, she admitted that she was not equipped with the skills and knowledge to help me and was unable to provide the services she had promised. She then offered a refund, effectively admitting that she couldn’t deliver what was promised. However, rather than taking accountability, she later made a public post that twisted the truth to save face and attract more business—misrepresenting the situation entirely.

7.Refund Only Offered After Being Confronted: It was only after I directly raised my dissatisfaction that she offered a refund—essentially admitting she couldn’t deliver what was promised.

Final Thoughts: If you’re considering using her services, think twice. You’ll likely receive generic advice, wasted time, and no real actionable insights. Save your time and money—there are far better resources and professionals out there who actually listen, prepare, and provide meaningful, value-adding guidance.",No-Cheetah-6332,2,1.0,2,1747229486,2025-05-14 13:31:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kmf8mh/who_else_had_career_consultation_with_joanne_mok/,5,2025
1kmf0qq,Feeling burnout and empty,"I work in public health, so things have been rough lately. I've been working early in the morning or late at night, sometimes for a few hours on the weekend. Tasks keeping piling up, making it challenging to set time boundaries. I want to say no a lot of the time, but with how precarious the situation is right now, it just feels hard and feel like everyone else is trying to keep work afloat.

I've never felt so detached from work until now. Like, I'm lacking passion, drive, and motivation to create quality work, which frustrates me because I value having a strong work ethic and creating in general. 

If you've been burnt out, how do you regain motivation again? Or is it okay to just work for your livelihood? This is also something that I've been conflicted with because so many of my coworkers are passionate about their jobs but my passion feels like a dim candle right now.

Also, do you ever share if you're burnt out at work? I know this is a difficult line to toe around, but I feel so lonely with how I feel at work.

1kmegit,Career crossroad: working or studying full-time?,"Hello, so basically i'm at crossroads with my career. 

I have a background in International Relations and went to apply to a few internships while finishing my Master's. I applied for one that put me in Business Development / Admin in a consultancy. Mind you, the position i had applied to was different, but they told I had seen an old ad, but still the job description would be similar. 
I'm like okay, i don't mind getting any work experience right out of uni, I'll say yes to pretty much everything.  


So I move to this other EU-country for this internship. 

Fast forward 6 months, I get hired. Fast forward another 6 months, I also get fired.  Never had a formal review of my performance, never got told I was performing that badly to be let go. 

I got over this traumatic experience (even though it really affected my self-confidence) because I was not enjoying the job at all. Moreover, there had been very little training during my internship so I had actually assumed I'd not be hired because they didn't need the extra head. 

Anyway, during my notice period, i find another job. I didn't want to stay in consultancy, but I was also eager to give myself another chance in the sector (and because I'd not qualify for unemployment benefits). This position is a step forward to content work, but not really there yet, still more on the PM/Coordination side. At least, this company works in a very interesting field where I feel like I can get a lot of experience.  

First few months are stressful but i'm okay. After roughly 5 months, my team gets a new mid-senior co-worker and a Senior Manager. The SM is a nightmare.  The classic micro-manager style. She made the new guy quit in a few months. As only me and other two remained in the team, i won the opportunity to work more with her and it's making me hate my job.
It also doesn't help that, with the reconstructing of the team, I got stuck on the most boring tasks again. But okay, nature of the job, i'm willing to play the long game and grow, if not for the stress she puts us under. 

Fast forward another 6 months, I'm now one year in this company and role and I'm super ready to leave. Stuck on things that rarely seem useful/impactful, with a nightmarish management. 

Thing is, part of the reason i was willing to stay, was that I wanted to get some job experience before preparing for a big national exam to work in the civil service in my home country, which is the main reason I've chosen my studies and it's a dream career. 

I've started self-studying since last year but with a full-time job + hobbies/friends, i've not progressed as much as i'd have liked, but I do enjoy it and I do it with passion. 

Therefore I'm seriously contemplating these options:
1) quit cold turkey, move back in with my parents in my home country and study again full-time
2) quit cold turkey to look for another full-time job  and still try to make time for studying 
3) quit cold turkey and find a part-time job (either in corporate o, rather, the service industry), having definitely more time to study
4) suck up and continue like this 
5) go back to being an intern in a sector i'd like more

I really would like to have the courage and follow my dream job and give myself full chances at succeding, but i'm also aware I need to have a solid plan B career-wise, which would ideally be a career I enjoy or at least one that I don't totally hate. 

I feel stuck and I'd like a break. The past two years have been super hard. I feel like i'm on a chess board and it's check mate in every direction. But I also can't stay still, I need to make a move, the clock is ticking.

So I'm here to ask for any advice on what you'd do in my situation, aside from getting a therapist because it has become increasingly clear I need one.

My pay is probably in the top 1% in the field, but I can't seem to care anymore, I hate cars, from working on them to driving.
Just thinking about spending another 20 years doing this makes me shudder, between the absolutely horrible benefits (very expensive insurance, no sick pay, minimal vacation time, nothing besides 401k with almost no contribution from employer) on top of less then idea environmental conditions (no air conditioning).

1kmd32m,I accidentally hooked up with my student and I don’t know where to go from here,"Let me first start by saying that I am a college professor. I am 29f and my student is about 24m. 

Please refrain from judgement because I already feel bad enough. 

So as stated before I accidentally hooked up with my student and I am terrified as to how this could possibly affect my job. 

So I teach art history and English gen ed courses at a local college. I started around two years ago and I have never had any issues. 

Last Fall when I was teaching English I got a student that I have not had before. For the most part he was a decent student and didn’t really stand out or give me any issues. However, I noticed that he was possibly being a bit flirty. I brushed it off thinking that I was looking too much into it. 

However, one day before our winter break he came in to give me a Christmas present. This is NOT out of the ordinary because the country that I live in, it’s common for students to give their teachers presents. He bought me a box of chocolates and some flowers. When I stood up to hug him, as I was letting go he quickly kissed me on the lips…. I froze and was taken back and didn’t know what to do. I just said thank you again and he left. 
A couple of days later when he came to class, I asked to speak with him alone. I explained that what happened was not appropriate and that it can’t happen again. I also said that I do not see him in a romantic way. That was that and we didn’t have any issues. (This was around 6 months ago from today) 

Fast forward this current semester, he is in my art history class. I noticed that he would constantly stare at me. When he came to the front desk to ask a question he would twirl my hair, and he also would call me by my first name. I would correct him every time. I didn’t look too much into it…again. 

One day when class was over he asked if he could give me a ride home. (I don’t drive, I take the train to work. In my country most people take trains and busses). I originally said no, but it was storming outside and I just thought “oh well”. (He kept pressuring me to just let him take me home) That was a huge mistake. 

When he dropped me off at my house as I was getting out, he leaned over to kiss me and I didn’t stop him that time. Needless to say we ended up hooking up in his car. When it was over I just rushed out and now I am here. 

I LOVE my job and this was a mistake and I obviously cannot report it. Would it make more sense for me to talk to him about it directly again? Or should I just act like it never happened. 

I am currently freaking out and truly do NOT know how to go about this. ",ineyks,0,0.38999998569488525,82,1747223221,2025-05-14 11:47:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kmd32m/i_accidentally_hooked_up_with_my_student_and_i/,5,2025

1kmccam,Tired of the BS. Should I leave my job?,"
Hi everyone! I'm wanting some advice on whether or not I should stay in my job. For about 3 years now, ive been adding to my roles and responsibilities and taking on all the work of my colleagues that have left throughout the years. Ive been trying to get a promotion for 2 years now and haven't had any luck due to a bunch of corporate red tape. Recently, another one of my colleagues left and all of her work came to me. I got another job offer for a role that pays less and benefits arent the best, however I'd also not have as much responsibilities as I do now. I shared this information to my manager, and they basically told me to kick rocks. They can't offer more money at all, a change in title, a pizza party, a pat on the head, NOTHING, NADA, ZILCH. As you can imagine, this was very frustrating to hear, granted that I'm one of the few people left on the team.

My question is, if Ive been thrown multiple people's workloads with no incentives, should I leave regardless of the other position offering less in salary and benefits? Should I leave simply to tell them F YOU? 

What are your thoughts? What would you do? I like my role, I love the benefits, I just hate feeling like they are taking advantage of me over and over again. I deal with some health issues so health insurance is super important to me and I do have great insurance now. However, I'm afraid now I placed a target on my back given the fact they know I'm looking for another role.

1kmbsck,Advice?,"Hi, I will try and keep this as short as possible. I just turned 27 today, I'm a guy and I'm having a little bit of a existential crisis. Basically the past few years have been extremely tough. I am a recovered alcoholic, I suffer with severe depression and most likely some form of ADHD or bipolar but I haven't got an official diagnosis. 

Right now, I seem to have my life in check. I have tried to end my life twice when my alcoholism was at it's worst but for the time being my mental health is relatively stable. I have things in place that are keeping me sane and of course staying away from substances is an absolute must. 

Anyway, I used to run a successful personal training business which I lost due to my past actions. It's not a career I wish to return to. I have recently taken on a part time evening cleaning role as I am studying for a degree in natural sciences however I am only in my first year and I've started to realize that a scientific job is probably far less realistic than I had originally anticipated. 

Which brings me to my conundrum, I want to be a cleaner for the least amount of time possible because cleaning crap out of kids toilets is pretty degrading, however I'm studying a degree which now seems pointless and I have no idea which direction I should take myself. 

I feel as though myife has been a long line of bad decisions and I want to start making some good decisions, never had parents to advice me on these things and I want my partner (bless her she's stuck by me through everything) to see that I'm worth being with. 

So if there is anyone on here that can offer some advice? What would you do in my situation?

1kmb2e5,"My boss asked me to time myself to gauge how long I spend working on a new project. Do I start/stop the timer as soon as I start/stop working, or do I time from the beginning of the project to its completion?","A bit of context: I work for a remote company. A higher-up reached out saying he wants to assign a brand new role for me within our company (in addition to what I'm currently doing). It will consist of making weekly social media posts and writing a newsletter.

My boss suggested that I take this week and create the posts while timing myself so we can know exactly how long it takes me, and therefore see if I really have the time and bandwidth to take this on.

So, between yesterday and today, I timed myself making these posts. I started the timer as soon as I would start working on them, and would pause the timer any time as soon as I clicked away, or went to the bathroom, or stood up to make some coffee, etc. 

In the end, the total time amounted to 3 hours 14 minutes spent actively sitting at my desk working on these projects - BUT, if I count the time from when I began the posts to when I finished the last one, it took closer to five hours (including things like bathroom/coffee/stretching/thinking breaks). It did, therefore, get in the way of me finishing other projects yesterday, even though 3h14m doesn't sound like a lot.

Do I tell my boss it took me 3h14m, or do I tell him it actually took me longer because I wasn't sitting nonstop at my desk for that entire period of time? I don't want to come across as lazy, but I also want to be honest and not bite off more than I can chew.

1kmb0bp,Help,"Sorry if i'm breaking the rules with this but I feel like somebody with some wisdom can help me out. Basically my manager kept asking for me to go out with her for drinks I'm 26 m she's 25. We're both single and I already had told her I didn't view her in a sexual manner. Went out with her one night and she literally bought me 50 bucks worth of booze, wanted me to hold her hand, she was a lil stumbly so I didn't think much of it. Explained I had been abstinant for a while and wasn't looking for anything, fast forward to the next weekend we go out again and pretty much same thing except she drives home drunk as hell and tells me to follow her. I know better and I shouldn't have went to her house but I wanted to make sure she was good. We get to her place talk for a bit and she changes into just panties and an oversized shirt 🫥. Should've left then but I was kinda buzzed and just wanted to chill. She offers me a weed pen and I just said screw it took a couple rips and felt like drinking some more so i asked her what she had and she got me some vodka, no problems so far. She was probably sober at this point and i was drunker then when I arrived, all of a sudden she starts asking me if I wanna play with her and I was like wut ? She keeps begging me and then brings up firetruck 🤡🤡 I literally said no cus i knew how it would go and she asked me probably like 10 times and I gave her the same response. Eventually I was like I guess and she immediately undid my pants 😵‍💫 one thing led to another and i made some very regrettable decisions. Went home didn't really care. Next weekend we all go out but this time we stayed at a club til last call linked with coworkers and went to an after party. I'm normally a good drunk but I had a grabbed a whole bottle of gin for the after party and got sauced. Pretty sure she had a three way with two of my other coworkers and I was pissed, we spent probably 4 hours in total talking about how I hate ppl that get around like that in the past so I was pissed because the coworkers whose house we're at is a self admitted man hoe so I can guess what happened. Basically told her I would get her fired (this is not a jealousy thing I'm just pissed i raw dogged a hoe) next day was bad it was just her and I and she pressed me to see my phone to see if I had anything to get her fired. She's told me stuff where she has warned me not to say anything because it'll get her a first and final warning. She literally wrote a bs report on me over something I didn't say and spilled the beans to me on that plus she's brought up who's made reports that actually got people fired. My workplace is very compartmentalized and you need to have witnesses to back you up with most reports. What the hell do I do, and what the hell might happen ? I made it very clear that was the last time we do anything like that but she was being super hostile the next day. She has the least power out of any of the managers and I really would rather not go to hr about it. She's admitted she's diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I just worry she's gonna concoct some plan to get me in trouble or fired. I've had this job for over 3 months working at least 40 hours a week, never missed a day, never had a problem, and I do good work 99% of the time. Should I be worried or am I overthinking it. Nobody else at work knows to my knowledge unless she's told. Never been in a situation like this so I'm like ahhhh.

1kmajwp,"Trying everything, finding nothing","Lately, I’ve been feeling really lost. Since early April, I’ve sent out over 50 student job applications—barely any replies. Today, I had an interview and was told I don’t have the right skills yet. They said I should learn them myself and maybe reapply later. I get that others are more qualified, but it still made me feel like I don’t belong.

I know I’m capable, but it’s hard not to take this personally.

I’ve also been trying to grow a fashion/creative Instagram page. The idea was to slowly build something meaningful, maybe even offer services one day. But lately, it’s felt forced. I’m not sure if I’m doing it for the right reasons or just trying to prove something to myself. It feels more like pressure than passion.

I don’t really know what I want yet, and that’s been hard. Today I mostly slept and avoided my coursework. I felt embarrassed. I’m 23, and I know there’s time—but seeing others my age build careers or businesses makes me feel behind. I know I’m not alone, but I still feel far from where I want to be.

I do have interests: photography, fashion, design, and music. I love dressing up, taking photos, finding cool spots. I love how clothes show personality. I’m really into visual stuff, especially digital design—so I bought Affinity to create art. I even got a DJ controller after using the software for 3 years, and mixing music gives me a sense of peace.

These are all creative paths, and I know they’re hard to turn into stable careers. But I’m studying Economics, which feels so far from who I am. People are surprised when I tell them, saying I seem more creative. I chose it because I didn’t hate it in high school—not because I loved it. When people ask what I like about it, I don’t have a real answer. Same when they ask about my dream.

I know many people work jobs they don’t love. I just can’t imagine living like that long-term—but I also know I need to earn money, so I’m trying to find a student job in my field.

Most days my mind feels messy, like today. Even small decisions feel hard. But I do know I want to build some creative skills while I’m at university—something meaningful I can grow with. I don’t have a dream yet, but I’m hoping it’ll come. I just worry it won’t.",thoaway17,1,1.0,1,1747213432,2025-05-14 09:03:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kmajwp/trying_everything_finding_nothing/,5,2025
1kmacck,Should I pursue finance than being a SWE/ML engineer ?,"I am a master's student in AI, and received a job offer as a software engineer at a video codec company.

The college curriculum was very math heavy, which drove me a bit toward finance maths. In the past few months I have studied some financial maths from ""*Capinski* & *Zastawniak"",* and ""S.Ross"". Also tried to study some SDEs, as SDEs were part of our diffusion models classes. I just got to know about CFA certification, and thinking of pursuing it on the side. I have also started to read some quant-finance papers from arxiv, implement them in code and put up on GitHub.

I had joined the AI program with hopes of a high paying job, but all applications are getting rejected (maybe recession is to be blamed). And with a surplus of ML engineers and SDEs, I feel the demand for new hires is lower than in finance (please correct if I am wrong).

I have no industry experience till now, this is my first job.

According to industry experienced people who have been in both, should I turn toward financial jobs ? Or should I aim for ML/Data Scientist roles ?

Because of this i think i may need to catch up on some learning for college. So i was wondering if there were any books, resources or other specifics like equations that i should learn before i start.

I enjoy working with kids (not all of course, there are some exceptions, but overall I like spending my time with them). Right now, I'm in community college trying to get my associate's and maybe transfer. The problem is, since I was little, I really wanted to become a dentist, idk just liked the environment and the job setting, I guess. But now I'm starting to think that I'm not smart enough for this career path. I was just... never really good with numbers and subjects like chemistry. Since I like kids, I was thinking about teaching, but looking at their average salary, it doesn't make me optimistic at all. I have interests outside of work and school, I like reading books and building Lego, for example, but i don't think these types of hobbies are very helpful since I don't wanna become a writer nor an engineer. I liked learning languages in High School, and I'm bilingual myself, but it feels like that translator as a job might disappear soon due to how fast ai is advancing. I really wanna have kids in the future, but without good-paying job, I can't really afford anything and I can't give a decent future to them, just the medical bill for giving birth is like $3,000 with insurance...

1km9g74,Continue Flutter Development as Career or...?,"At the end of my Civil engg degree I was campus placed into a decent construction company and worked there for 2yrs. Then switched to a private consulting firm and worked for 1yr there too. Then, COVID hits and everything becomes a mess. Within a few months, I make the call to switch to IT. I took a Java & Full stack course and got the grasp of basics. I had zero knowledge of coding as I had done my Civil diploma & degree, so didn't have a chance to learn coding anywhere along the way. Mid way through the course placement opportunities were provided, but I was never shortlisted as I was a year older pass out & was from a civil bg. It was looking meek. Was stuck between a rock & a hard place. 
A sudden job opportunity arrives through a mutual friend for a small start up. App development in Flutter framework. Front end. For a gulf client. I have always been good at communication and my English has been a strong point. I quickly picked up on dart, the basics, built screens, navigation etc and proved to be of good value. Got a good idea about app development & the works. Developed a good relationship with the backend engineer & learnt some ropes of strapi, api & sql from there as well. Would provide valuable inputs in meetings, interacting with the client, providing inputs, ideas, giving timely demos/presentations etc. Dart seems to be one of the easier languages. Successfully completed 85-90% of the app. Everything was going good for a yr. Project suddenly gets shelved, startup suddenly ups and dissolves.
I get hired again by a different start-up for another app. But here, I need to do everything by myself, Was only given a app template. Further, Features, Back end & everything else in between had to be done by me. Proves challenging, but used my prev experience  & was slowly pulling through.

- manager level
- working for an MNC
- values work/life balance (very important to me)

I’m at a crossroads. What would you do if you are in my situation?


__Option A: stay with current employer__
- I get promoted and get 25% increase of base pay (this is my company’s counter offer to get me to stay)
- I keep my tenure and soon qualify for retirement benefits
- Easiest way for upward mobility in the career ladder
- Pros: remote work, easy to file leaves, flexible hours, no time tracking, global team, I rarely do OT
- Cons: unhappy with current salary, unpaid OT for manager-level employees

__Option B: take job offer__
- I get a 70% increase + 10% due to night diff
- The offer was initially 40% but after the set of interviews they maxed out their budget and want me to start soon
- Smaller company (BPO/RPO). I will be expected to put on many hats and take on tasks done by analysts/associates. I will not manage any people
- I don’t know if I’ll be asked to time in/out or have some way to track productivity ala-BPO. I’m assuming there will be.
- Pros: remote work, client is nice based on the vibes of the interview, can sharpen my skills because i’ll be working as an analyst again, qualified for OT pay
- Cons: they will provide a desktop so my work-from-anywhere days will be over, I will probably be stuck in my job level for a while, little chance for promotion",userisnottaken,1,1.0,0,1747207704,2025-05-14 07:28:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1km99c4/promotion_or_different_role_with_a_pay_bump/,5,2025
1km8ywf,Am I handling lack of leadership poorly?,"During Covid, I decided to make a major career switch and went into a fairly new company owned by an incredibly sweet but terrible leader.  The place was a chaotic mess but had such great potential and the owner became more than a boss he became one of my best friends.  He is genuinely a very good person but terrible leader. 

I basically performed what I like to describe as a dictatorship and declared myself in charge.  He was so lost in the weeds of trying to figure everything out he welcomed the help.  We made huge strides and almost completely got everything in operational working order. We’ve grown from $3M to $9M in sales. We’ve gotten 100% of our sales team certified and licensed in our industry.  

Its been 6 years and while we’ve made a lot of very positive changes, there are still certain aspects of it that have repeated the same cycle over and over. Our administrative support team are point blank lazy and entitled.  They half ass their jobs and their is zero accountability.  No matter how hard I try, there is way too much on my plate and I am stuck in a cycle of doing their work in addition to mine because many of my responsibilities require their tasks to be completed before I can finish mine. 

The most recent hire is by far the worst. She’s a manipulative liar who has basically pushed me to the breaking point.  

I put together a plan for the owner on what the next steps need to be to improve the operations side of the business then told him I am burnt out and need a break.  I told him that I will continue on with my responsibilities except for two - I will not be doing anyone else’s work and I will not be responsible for anyone else going forward.  He has yet to announce it to the entire team so they continue to come to me with things that aren’t my responsibility and when I direct them to the most recent hire they basically tell me she won’t do it.  I’ve asked him to tell them and he keeps saying he will get to it.  He did tell recent hire of my new duties and she asked him if she can “take on my responsibilities.”  He keeps saying he doesn’t know what to do since she keeps asking for more responsibilities and I’ve given mine up.  Except I haven’t. The only thing I am not doing anymore is someone else’s job and holding others accountable for doing their job.  So essentially she’s asking to be put in charge of what she’s already in charge of but not doing. I think she wants more money but has no intention of actually doing anything more. 

My biggest issue is that the owners expectations and what he will take from employees is so low I cannot handle it.  Example, I went on a planned vacation and while I was gone, the new hire called out sick to the owner the entire week with stomach issues saying she couldn’t be away from the bathroom for more than a few minutes. At the end of the week she told me that she was having mental health issues because of separation anxiety from her son (she spent the entire week posting pics on snap chat of her and her boyfriend drinking in a hot tub at an Airbnb).   She’s responsible for the phone system and the 3 people who answer the phones. If they don’t answer the phone it goes to an answering service. We spent over $4k on calls not getting answered during business hours. The owner doesn’t say anything about it just says she is great on phones.  My expectations are just answer the phones. 

It’s so difficult to sit and watch what we’ve built get abused and he does nothing.  This is a cycle that gets repeated over and over.  This is the type of behavior that the owner tolerates.  I can’t take it anymore.  So I told him I need ax break But still have to watch their shitty behavior while he does nothing. I told him I have one foot out the door and she’s what will push me further out yet the poor behavior isn’t addressed. 

Is there anything I am missing here or do I just need to leave? It’s going to break my heart if I have to walk away from all that we’ve created.",betugotasmallone,1,1.0,0,1747206482,2025-05-14 07:08:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1km8ywf/am_i_handling_lack_of_leadership_poorly/,5,2025
1km8e2q,Stuck in survival phase or burnout?,"I’m a 21F, I completed my bachelors last year and took a gap year due to some financial issues and uncertainty regarding my career path. I was a top 3 student till 8th, then I changed schools and 9th was my worst academic year, but I scored above 90% in 10th. 

I chose commerce but couldn’t get interested in accounts, covid came when I was in 12th- I would scroll Instagram or Twitter and didn’t study at all- when they cancelled exams- I got around 80-85%, 10% decrease from 10th result due to my laziness and ignorance for practicals and assignments. 

I procrastinated a lot- didn’t have any idea what to choose for college major. In the last moment- I ended up choosing sociology- a subject I had interest in but didn’t look too much in the job aspect. I thought that I would pursue mba after graduation. I didn’t apply to colleges on time and  due to some lack of clarity had to take a gap year- all my fault. 

I didn’t apply an hr job for 5 months and interned at ngo during my college. During gap year- I took a child curriculum job that had no relevance to my career because I wasn’t getting any other job without experience. The employer didn’t inform me about signing a contract until I decided to quit after 3 months and they said that they couldn’t provide me with any experience cert coz I didn’t sign the nda and agreement. I have no more formal experience.

I haven’t applied to any colleges in India since I wanted to study abroad. I’ve applied in many universities in uk since most of my friends are there and it’s lot easier to have ppl refer you to jobs. My friends who were going to go with me to uk cancelled. And now I have offer letters but I don’t know if I’ll get scholarship though I had the highest grade in my faculty. I didn’t research well and am regretting wasting my whole year like that. The possibility of going to uk without scholarship is very low since my father won’t let me take a loan- he will provide the money but the amount is too much. We are financially good but his factory has some financial troubles still he insists.

Please help me understand how to deal with this situation- is my procrastination due to burn out or being a brilliant student in academics without effort made me like this? I want to know if I can do some skill courses or any other courses to guarantee job here in India or if I should go to uk since I never intended to settle there and want to eventually come back to India.

1st product: Tinder for mentoring.

I failed because I couldn’t scale high quality mentors’ time. On top of that, bad hiring decision led me to a lawsuit and burned half of my company’s funding. I still feel some shame and a lot of pain every time I reflect on it 🥵

3rd product: An AI app that turns [voice note into personal branding content](https://tally.so/r/wvppZX?camp=4.0launch&channel=reddit_staycurieous&content=deadline_dream) on LinkedIn.

This is an ongoing pivot, and its success remains to be seen.

While many of my peers are generating millions in revenue or raising even more in funding, I’m back to square one.

Trusted friends have told me, “You should give this startup a deadline. If you can’t prove PMF by then, kill it. With your background, you have many options. Your opportunity cost is too high, and you might be stuck in a sunk-cost fallacy.”

Maybe I’m irrationally stubborn, but I won’t do that. My deadline isn’t tied to a specific time. It’s when I run out of love for what I do.

1km6z26,Seeking Early Career Advice,"Hello everyone,

I’d like to share a summary of my current situation and get your perspective. I started my first engineering job in the U.S. this past February, working on CFD projects involving multiphase flow in chemical processes and doing supporting field work. My background is in compressible-flow CFD for resistive heaters, so the work has been a tough adjustment. A few months in, I already feel overwhelmed and uncertain of my results. Most of my calculations seem off, and although I’ve reached out to the one team member who could help, he’s too busy with his own work to offer much support. Despite this, I’m expected to be the team’s CFD expert, which I don’t feel equipped for. I’ve been assigned three projects and am struggling to deliver them on time with confidence in their quality.

Before this job, I started a thesis-based Master’s program after spending 2.5 years as an undergraduate researcher in a CFD lab. As an undergrad, I worked on mesh generation and internal tool development (some of which were used by other students), but nothing gained widespread use. In grad school, I began developing a CFD module for multiphase flow. Although there was supposed to be a team (a professor, a PhD student, and an assistant professor), I ended up working alone, with the assistant professor contributing briefly. I spent the summer abroad at our sister lab but struggled due to language barriers and lack of guidance. When I returned, my advisor was rarely present and only interacted with me to criticize small mistakes that were not work related, often bringing up minor grievances from my undergrad years.

The breaking point came when I received a job offer and didn’t inform my advisor right away. He called me into his office, expressed how disrespected he felt, and dug up various past issues. The conversation escalated, and he eventually accused me of alcoholism as the only explanation for my mistakes. I left his upset and took a leave of absence the following Monday. I had really enjoyed aspects of the lab (especially the high-performance computing and programming), but the lack of mentorship and collaborative opportunities left me stuck without meaningful progress.

Now I feel like I’m at a crossroads. I graduated summa cum laude with an undergradiate engineering degree, was involved in a rocketry club, and worked on an award-winning capstone project. Despite those early successes, my career feels like it’s off to a poor start. I don’t think I’m a good fit for my current job, both in terms of interest and the level of support I need. At the same time, I’m worried that leaving this job so soon—after already stepping away from grad school—will make me look unreliable. I constantly feel like I’m on the verge of being fired or exposed as incompetent, and that my career could stall entirely.

If you were in my position, what would you do? Would you stay and try to learn on the job, look for a role with stronger mentorship, or consider returning to grad school in a different environment? I’m happy to answer any questions, and I appreciate any advice you can offer. Thank you for reading.",qubits4ever,1,0.9900000095367432,3,1747198599,2025-05-14 04:56:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1km6z26/seeking_early_career_advice/,5,2025
1km68k5,Potential Raise Opportunity,"For context:
I’ve been working as an engineer at a small company in Newcastle, Australia for the last 18 months, paid $85kAUD. In that time I’ve been fully responsible for the design and development of a new product.

The company has not produced a new product in almost 15 years. Partly due to having serious issues in hiring and retaining competent engineers, losing most people in <6 months.
However, they have just had a record year of sales of their existing product line, so budget shouldn’t be an issue.

The project I have been working on is projected to increase the companies revenue by 200-400% annually. We are now in the final stages and expect a launch by the end of the year which the higher ups seem quite reliant on for continued growth. No other engineer at the company has managed to get a project this far despite them having more experience, my boss included, who I suspect is under a lot of pressure because of that. 

I am also in the process of automating and streamlining a lot of their existing processes which are severely outdated and I have become the go-to technical consultant for all the engineers, including my superiors. 

I have a scheduled performance review sometime around EOFY (June 30), I believe before the new budget is confirmed for the year. 

My questions:
Would it be acceptable for me to ask for a fairly significant raise given my performance and the current situation?

My original plan was to wait until the product is launched and generating money, so I would have concrete figures to justify a raise or to move to a new company. This was mostly due to being told in my performance review last year that raises are justified by the money you’ve explicitly brought into the company or by wearing different hats (business, eng, marketing, etc.) but that raises typically come in less frequent buy bigger jumps here.

However, this seems like a unique position I could potentially take advantage of. Since, if I resigned now, the project would be delayed for a significant amount of time until they can replace me (emphasised by their continued struggle to hire and retain engineers) and until the replacement can get themselves up-to speed on what I’ve done and how to proceed.

I’ve heard of people getting 65-100% raises when contributing to a large portion of a small companies growth but not sure if that’s warranted here? I honestly have no idea what would be an acceptable figure to ask for.

Would it be more beneficial for me to get an offer from somewhere else as leverage? However I don’t think I’ll get a very significant offer since I don’t have the launched product to show yet.

Should I ask for a meeting before my performance review and negotiate salary then, in-case my raise is already calculated and decided upon before my review?

1km4r8d,Thinking About Going Back to Previous Job,"Not sure how much traction this post will get but looking for some advice...

A little over a year ago I left a controller position at a small manufacturing company after being there for 4 and a half years. The job was pretty easy overall. Took a job as a senior accountant at a much larger manufacturing company to increase my experience for resume purposes, since at the time I didnt want to limit myself in the future and thought I was at a dead end.

I reported to the contoller at the larger company, and realized I would never want his job. He was working 10 hour days almost every single day, and everything got dumped on him that the CFO didnt want to do, and I was getting funneled into basically becoming an AP manger, which is not at all what I was looking for.

About a month ago I interviewed for a job that I ended up getting, as an accounting manager. But 2 weeks in and I've realized I will have the same amount of work as the controller at my last job. They made it sound in the interviews that there would only be overtime for month/year end and during the audit, but I've found out it's actually 6-7 months out of the year with 50 hour weeks.

The owner of the small manufacturing company made me an offer almost impossible to pass up salary wise when he heard I was job hunting again a month ago. The work like balance was just fine, and my experience at the larger company will actually make me a better controller there overall, but I feel like I would be taking a step back. The salary is nearly a 25% raise, but in 5 years if I want to leave or the business is sold and I lose my job, I would be looking at the same amount in a salary reduction going somewhere else.

I really dont know if I should stick out my new job or go back to my old job. I didnt realize at the time how good I actually had it with my old job, but worried about what could happen 10 years from now. For reference, I'm in my mid 30's.

1km4qfu,Escaping past roles after an internal promotion,"I’ve recently had a promotion at my company, but I’m finding it extremely taxing to have to continue carrying out duties of the previous role and being the go-to person for people with questions about the previous job function. I don’t know how to retrain colleagues to rely on their new resources when I am still the first person they think of to do something quickly or successfully. 

Some backstory: I was a manager, recently promoted to an IC role in an adjacent team. By recently, I’m talking 5 months ago. The company decided not to immediately post my backfill role and have been dragging their feet. There is a supervisor newly promoted and mostly trained within my former team that should be the first point of contact, and she could use the exposure to issues and questions that arise at a higher level to help her learn the job, but no one reaches out to her and still come to me first.  

I’ve tried having conversations with my coworkers letting them know that I no longer handle xyz, please contact the supervisor. Or at the very least, please include the supervisor when reaching out to me with questions/issues. I’ve tried talking to my manager about this, asking her to share an updated org chart with other departments, or at the very least set expectations for me about which responsibilities from the old I am expected to handle until my backfill is hired, but I’m getting no support.

What’s the move here? Do I just start ignoring people and potentially damage my reputation at the company? I know I’m not able to give 100% to my new role while having to constantly handle tasks from my previous role, so I haven’t really been set up to succeed here. I’ve been set up to drown.

1km4f7i,Thinking About Leaving My Consulting Job for a Short-Term Real Estate Role — Risky Move or Smart Pivot?,"Hi everyone — I’d love some outside perspective.

I’m currently in a high-pressure consulting role in NYC (think corporate comms/strategy), making good money, working with great people, and learning a lot. But I’ve realized long-term, I don’t see myself in this field. I want to build real wealth, have more ownership over my work, and eventually live a high-quality life with my (future) family in Boston.

Recently, a unique opportunity came up: a founder of a real estate investment firm in Boston offered to bring me on in a short-term, hybrid analyst/operations role this summer. It’s a true learning role with some mentorship — not a guaranteed job — but it would let me get real exposure to acquisitions, asset management, and deal flow.

The catch? I’d be leaving a strong, respected job after just under a year. It would be my fourth job in four years. My parents are hesitant. Some friends think it’s risky. But my gut says it’s aligned with the life I actually want to build — wealth, flexibility, ownership, and a future in Boston with my fiancée.

I’d love honest takes from people who’ve made similar pivots — or who’ve stayed in “safe” roles and later wished they hadn’t.

1km42mm,I need guidance,"I don’t know what to do with my background. Can I get some advice please?

Hey everyone,

Looking for a bit of guidance here. I’ve got a Bachelor’s in Criminal Justice and recently wrapped up an MBA in Strategic Management and Leadership. I’ve worked in a bunch of different fields and I’m trying to figure out what kind of career path actually makes sense long-term.

Here’s a quick snapshot of what I’ve done:

Currently working as a Relationship Banker, helping clients with financial products and managing day-to-day operations.
Also managing a team as a General Manager at a restaurant, handling everything from training and scheduling to budgeting and operations.
I’ve also:
Interned in HR at an automotive company
Worked security coordination at large sporting events (Kraft Group)
Been a store manager in retail and a chef/shift leader in food service
I speak four languages (Arabic, English, French, and Spanish)
I’ve always been someone who can adapt and lead in different settings. I like solving problems, working with people, and building structure. But now I’m at a point where I’m not sure where all this experience is actually taking me.

So here’s what I’m trying to figure out:

What kind of career paths could someone with this background realistically pursue?
Is it worth leaning into finance, HR, operations, or even revisiting something related to criminal justice?
What kind of roles or work environments make sense for someone with a wide-ranging background like this?
If anyone has been in a similar spot especially after an MBA or switching fields I’d love to hear how you navigated it.

Thanks in advance!

1km3q2j,Masters or workforce?,"So, I (21M) am graduating from a pretty good institution with my Bachelors (science), debt free. Fortunately, I also recently got accepted into a Masters in Management program (1 year) at a very good Business school, but I received mixed advice on whether to pursue this route or not.

So, first, my two options at the moment are #1: to find a job in the next few months and work there for a year or two before applying back to grad school (either for an MBA or a Science PhD/MS). I’m not graduating with the best GPA, but it’s enough to apply for most stuff (around a 3.0) Or #2 pursue this masters even though I only got around $15 K in scholarships, so that would mean I would get into around $60K in debt (maybe less if I manage to get good scholarships and work simultaneously).

Now, for option #1, clearly a bachelors is making it extremely competitive and hard to get a job so far. I have good experience and qualifications, but it is my first job out of college and I don’t have significant savings or financial support from my family. This option seems almost logical to get financially established and remain debt-free. However, I also am worried my academic performance could hinder my ability to get into future academic programs, reason why I feel like I should do a Masters now that I have the chance.

Then for option #2, this is a program I really enjoy and (if I apply myself and network correctly) I could very likely find a great job in consulting or management while in the program and earn enough money to pay that debt back in around 10 years without much economic strain (the payments would be around $500 a month for like 10 years, which doesn’t seem crazy and could go down if I lock-in and generate new income streams). However, I also am considering the worst… a case where I am unable to land a good enough position and I’m stuck without savings and with debt.

I am now two weeks past the final interview stage and I haven’t heard back yet besides me reaching out to the hiring manager.

I finished a panel style interview for a state job for a rehab company that is contracted by the state I live in. I got the vibe that the interview went well.

I had the second and final round interview on May 1 and and the head of the company told me they would have contacted me by the end of last week. End of last week came and went without anything. Through this, the manager has been telling me that the state is very slow and that he’ll keep me in the loop when he hears anything back.

It seems like the approval process is that applicants that the rehab company likes must also be interviewed by the entities that work for the state that owned the facility. It was a five person interview, where it was the owner of the rehab company, the director of rehab, the administrator for the building, and two other people that are affiliated with the state.

1km2qp6,WWYD?,"What would you do in my shoes?? Due to company wide changes, I got moved to a whole new department at the beginning of Q2 (I’m in account management). With the impact of tariffs and market conditions, the team I’m with has NOT been getting work from clients at all, and therefore I’m not hitting my sales numbers or producing revenue. I also don’t have access tonight the accounts we manage (my boss says he’ll share them but keeps forgetting?) so I haven’t been able to proactively scout or upsell anything, just a sitting duck. 

Other teams in different departments, including my old department, have been thriving on the other hand. Swimming in work, and just the complete opposite of my situation. I talked to my manager about my concerns and asked him to brainstorm with me about how to find me and the broader team more opportunities so we can be in a better spot. I was told not to worry and that “numbers aren’t everything”. 

Looking solely at the data, there’s a steep decline in my performance that started the first week of Q2- clearly correlating that the reorganization directly impacted my numbers. 

We had multiple rounds of layoffs the past 12 months, including a big one at the end of Q1. My team is made up of fresh college grads, who started at my job a few months ago. I’m hitting my 5 year mark this summer. I point these last things out bc my concern is that i feel like these things put me in a vulnerable spot to get laid off if my circumstances don’t change.

I want to try and talk to my manager again but last time we chatted I feel like he invalidated my concerns. Any advice??",Starryhyles2,1,1.0,0,1747184830,2025-05-14 01:07:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1km2qp6/wwyd/,5,2025
1km2gy0,Need advice: WU Quant Finance vs. Tsinghua IR – Which path should I choose?,"Hi everyone,
I’ve just completed my bachelor’s degree in Business and Finance with a specialization in corporate and economic analysis, and I’m now facing a big decision regarding my next academic step.

I’ve been accepted into two very different master’s programs:
	1.	Quantitative Finance at WU (Vienna University of Economics and Business)
	2.	Master’s in Chinese Politics, Foreign Policy and International Relations at Tsinghua University (Beijing)

I’m genuinely torn between these two, and I’d appreciate some insight from anyone with experience in either field.

⸻

Why WU?

Quantitative Finance would be a natural continuation of my academic background. I find finance interesting and I’m curious about topics like financial modeling, risk management, and data analysis. A career in quant finance is intellectually rewarding, relatively stable, and offers strong earning potential.

My concern: While I enjoy finance, I don’t believe I’m especially gifted in mathematics or programming. I’m afraid that I might struggle to truly excel or stand out in a highly competitive and technical field like quant finance.

⸻

Why Tsinghua? (One of if not the most prestigous uni in all Asia)

I’m ethnically Chinese but was born and raised in Hungary, so I speak both Mandarin and Hungarian fluently. Because of this, I’ve had many opportunities to work as an interpreter for Chinese business delegations visiting Hungary — especially those involved in trade, technology, and investments. These experiences sparked my deep interest in international relations and diplomacy.

What’s more, I’ve already gained significant hands-on experience in the international arena, and I’ve realized that I have a strong aptitude for communication, negotiation, and intercultural understanding. I genuinely feel that this is something I’m good at — and passionate about.

With China becoming Hungary’s biggest trading partner and playing an increasing role in Central Europe, I believe this skill set will only become more valuable. My long-term ambition is to serve as a bridge between Europe and China, and the Tsinghua IR program would give me the academic foundation, cultural insight, and professional network to do that effectively.

My concern: Choosing Tsinghua would mean stepping away from finance — and essentially pivoting into a new field. While I’m excited about international relations, I wonder if I’m giving up on years of education and possibly more stable job prospects in finance.

⸻

So my big question is: Which path should I choose?

Should I stay in finance, even though I’m not sure I have the natural talent to excel in it?
Or should I follow this new path, where I already have experience, feel confident and passionate, but where the future might be more uncertain?

Any thoughts or advice — especially from people working in finance, international relations, or anyone who’s faced a similar choice — would be incredibly helpful.

Thanks so much for reading!

I’m in my mid-20s, and I feel like I’m at a crossroads, but without a map. I want to make a good living and have a stable future, but I genuinely have no idea what to pursue. I’ve never felt like the “career-driven” type, and traditional academics have never been my thing, which makes choosing a path even harder.

I see people around me building careers, moving up, and figuring things out, and I can’t help but feel like I’m falling behind. I’m scared that if I don’t make a move soon, I’ll end up stuck in low-paying jobs forever, struggling just to get by.

I want to find something I can be proud of, something that pays well and gives me a sense of purpose, but I feel overwhelmed by all the options and the fear of making the wrong choice. I don’t even know where to start or what skills I should be focusing on.

1km0xoj,Employed on borrowed time and feeling burnout.,"I work for a retail chain well known for both its products and how it treats its employees. It is also well known for making statements regarding employee protections but that's not the point of this post. I went from near perfect/perfect employee reviews and being on track to advancing more in the company to getting marked off and ""not meeting expectations"" and ultimately not getting raises. This is from a big change in management. I admit some mistakes are on me but again others that are brought up in the review, I feel, are not reflective of my actual performance throughout **the entire** review period. Hell some managers are always praising me for my work ethic so it's just plain weird. And I'm not the only one being scrutinized for small mistakes or take issue with the new management. I plan on checking in with my managers in the next couple weeks to see where my standing is and what I can do to improve since they never really tell us.

Anyways the next employee review is in 3 months and I don't have high hopes for this one. In fact I feel like I'm on borrowed time before I fail it and get fired. I've been applying to jobs but I'm sure you all know how miserable the market is right now so I'm doing what I can with applying, tweaking my resume, etc. I've also been feeling VERY burnt out lately and have experience some major burnout before. It wasn't a great time and those same feelings are returning and I just don't know what to do.

Thankfully I am in a spot where I can put my two weeks in if I want but I also don't want to in the case I do make it out of this next review employed. I also know how unwise it is to quit without anything lined up. Do I quit now for my own mental/emotional health while still applying or just ride it out and see what happens in the next review (still also applying to jobs)?

1klz2u6,Seeking advise whilst job hunting: I left a job because I got attacked...what do you write in 'Reason for leaving'?,"Hi Redditors (posted this in a few places and didn't know where it best is suited)

I (28, F) am applying for jobs within MoJ and some other recruitment websites and I have a very traumatic incident a few years back that led to me have a breakdown and subsequently having to leave my job.

Now the tricky bit is, recruiters ask for the 'Reason for Leaving' past jobs as part of many of the application processes. In the instance of me leaving my Finance job, I have been stating 'Would prefer not to disclose', but I am starting to think this might not be the best and might be hindering me in my job search.

Now for me to explain my story...

**(TW: Abuse - Sexual and Physical)**

I worked for a Finance company in a major city in England and in the Spring of 2019, I was attacked outside of my work in a physical attack of a sexual nature. I am a runner (like I have run competitively since college) and thankfully this worked in my favour in this instant, I am so happy to this day I did not freeze as I don't like to think about what *could* have occured if I did. But anyway, I **was** able to get out of the attackers grasp and RUN!!!

I could not go to work the following Monday (the incident occurred on a Friday night) and my mental health completely shattered from there. I attempted a brave face and tried to go to work the next week, getting on the bus, but as soon as I was anywhere near the location of the attack, I just had panic attacks. On my last attempt to go to work my Dad dropped me right at the door and I went in but I just had no control of my emotions and went home (no one at work knew about the attack).

One thing led to another, my mental health shattered and I ended up having a mental breakdown. I was ordered to a mental health hospital 3 times a week to take part in therapy and a a few different group sessions which were non-talk therapy (I did Sports and Art therapy classes) on an out-patient basis (if I didn't attend I would be put in-patient), as I turned to self-harm, constant suicidal ideation, anxiety (including panic attacks) and I just couldn't take care of myself.

I am happy to say all of this is behind me. I had a very very good therapist (I went private - was expensive but SO worth it at this time of need) and the team at the hospital were absolutely fantastic, along with my family and the few friends that know the situation.

With all of the above context (sorry reader, I know its a bit heavy) - what would you suggest to put in the 'Reason for Leaving' for my Finance job?

I thought I’d turn to the wisdom of Reddit for some well-needed career advice. I’m a 22 year old male from the UK and over the past year I’ve found myself very lost (career wise) and unsure what direction to take. 

For context, I’m currently working as an electrician, making a wage not to be sniffed at however I’m so incredibly dissatisfied with my job. I’m plagued with the feeling that I could do more with my life seeing that I achieved good grades in school and would be academically strong so I’m more than willing and actually quite excited about the prospect of going back into full time education. 

From a young age I have wanted to be a barrister however due to being immature and wanting to earn quick money in a trade, I never pursued it. I’d love to go and study law however the future job prospects with the introduction of AI and the competitive nature of the job slightly concerns me. Is this something that all industries will face and should I pursue it as a career anyway OR should I purse my electrical career and study engineering?

I’d love to hear different opinions from people on what I should do. Also, if anyone has any good career ideas for me please send them in. 

Thanks🤘

1klxevm,I need some advice,"I work at an apartment complex doing maintenance. We have a crew of 3 guys plus our supervisor. We have a great crew that's almost like family. All 3 of us have some sort of relationship with our supervisor outside of work. One of us was his baseball coach, one has been his best friend since high school, and the other is dating his sister. So needless to say we care about this guy in some capacity. However he is the laziest and most useless human when it comes to work. He gets in his feelings if one of us tries to better ourselves by going after additional certifications. He says we are trying to take his job, but all he does is bitch and complain about the job and says he's going to quit( he has been saying this for about 3 years). Work goes so much better when he isn't there which recently is at least 1 day a week. One of the guys is contemplating leaving and going back to a job that is physically more demanding especially for a man of his age. It's less money per hr. but with tons of overtime potential. Another guy may end up going with him simply due to frustration with our supervisor. We have tried to explain our issues with our supervisor, with him, his supervisor, and with hr. We were basically told by corporate that since the day to day runs smoothly that we aren't the biggest fire to put out. I would love to find a way to keep this crew together, but I don't see a way that happens with him as our supervisor. I really want to go to his supervisor and tell them that if something major isn't done quickly that they are going to lose their entire maintenance staff, but idk that it will do any good. I'm at a loss at this point. ",inkdngauged,1,1.0,0,1747170317,2025-05-13 21:05:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1klxevm/i_need_some_advice/,5,2025

1klwvxn,Tired of not getting interviews,"I'm genuinely not sure what to do anymore.

I work in public health (medical affairs, infectious disease and health communications) and got laid off back in October 2024 and since then, I have submitted thousands of applications. Around the end of July, we had an all hands on meeting where we were told that cuts were going to happen around October, and unfortunately I was apart of that cut - my entire team alongside my manager got laid off.  Since the moment I found out about the possibility of a lay off, I started Job searching from August and for some reason, I still can't land a job. 

My experience and qualifications: I have 2 bachelor degrees and a Master of Public Health, with 8 years of experience in medical affairs, infectious disease and health communications. My previous role was one in leadership, so I also have pretty great leadership experience under my belt. I also have numerous scientific publications (peer-reviewed papers).

In the beginning, I was just rapid firing resume applications everywhere due to the anxiety of being unemployed. I was doing about 40 applications a day (yes, I kept track). Some days I'd ease up and do 20. These applications would range from huge companies where I dream of working, to companies on the smaller end. After months of not receiving any interviews, I decided to start tailoring my resume specifically where I can, and match it to the job description as close as possible. Still nothing. I ensured that my resume was ATS compliant, and even redid the entire thing just incase some formatting was off. Still no interviews. I started leveraging my network on LinkedIn, paid for the premium subscription and reached out to so, so, so many hiring managers. Still nothing. I've used so many different job boards. Still nothing

Since August, I've done roughly 10 interviews in total with over 4000 applications submitted... that sounds insane to think of. I made it to the final round once, I was very confident I was going to get but they ended up going with a different candidate. As for the others, I got ghosted. I always follow up after the interview, and I'm usually told I'm the perfect candidate for the role and they will reach out with next steps - always ghosted. 

At this point, I've burned through the entirety of my savings and I don't have much left. I genuinely don't know what to do next, I'm doing everything that I'm told and its been 8 months of unemployment with my situation getting progressively worst. Recruiters are ghosting me nonstop, ATS is tossing the fuck out my resume even when its tailored, and hiring managers simply... do not respond when I reach out independently. 

Is there anybody else in a similar situation? Or are there any suggestions (hopefully something I haven't tried)

1klw8oa,"What should I do I feel totally stuck in call center jobs, any advice?","So I’m in the U.S., I’m 29. I’ve only worked in bilingual call centers—collections, sales, etc.—and I absolutely hate call centers. Using my company’s education reimbursement program, I got a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration in 2022 and a master’s degree in Data Analytics, graduating in January 2024. Because I was using the education reimbursement, I wasn’t able to do any type of internship before or after graduating.

After finishing my degree in 2024, I decided to quit my call center job, hoping to find something better to start gaining experience. I’m literally open to moving anywhere in the U.S., and I’m not picky about salary at all. All I want is a job hopefully data-related where I can gain experience and grow.

I paid to have my resume professionally reviewed, and I completed a few certifications: Google Analytics, Advanced Analytics, and AWS Cloud Practitioner. I also built a portfolio. I started applying in January 2024, and after more than 1,000 applications over six months, the only responses I got were from call centers.

Eventually, I decided to take another call center job and meet the 9-month requirement to grow within the company. Now, I’ve been in this horrible CSR job for 9 months. I haven’t stopped applying externally, but I still haven’t heard back. I’ve also applied for jobs within the company, but they all require 2+ years of experience, and again—I hear nothing.

Externally, I’ve had a few interviews, but even after making it to the final round, I either get ghosted or receive the “we went with another candidate” email.

At this point, I feel totally lost. I hate my life as a result, and I’ve been really depressed lately. I feel like a total failure.

1klvhj3,Working with Indians,"Hey there! I don’t want this post to come across as disrespectful or discriminatory.

I work with Indian colleagues, and I’ve noticed a few things that might be challenging for us to work together effectively. One thing is that they seem to have a different understanding of time management. They often send messages late at night, which disrupts my sleep schedule. Additionally, the accent can be a bit difficult to understand, which can lead to misunderstandings.

Another thing I’ve observed is that they might not always prioritize teamwork. They often work in silos and don’t seem to consider the contributions of others in the team. I’ve had to repeat myself multiple times, even though there’s detailed documentation for everything. They also tend to prefer calls over messages, even when there are other ways to communicate.

I’m not sure if this is due to cultural differences or if it’s just a challenge with certain nationalities. I really want to work with them, but I’m not sure how to navigate these issues.

1kluwwm,My manager promised me a raise and then announced he was quitting. What now?,"Late last year, my boss required me to switch from hourly to salary. When I called attention to the fact that I typically have to work a few hours of overtime every week, his response was basically “oh well”. I pressed him, and pointed out that I just had another kid and that the OT pay was the only thing keeping our bank account out of the red. He came up with a list of job tasks for me to take on, and if I did that, he would give me the raise to make up the difference and “maybe a little extra.”

Well about 3 months passed and I had been keeping my end of the deal, so I went to ask about the raise (this time I secretly recorded the conversation). His response was “I can’t do anything until the first quarter ends.” His reasoning was that layoffs were happening due to slow business (remember this for later). 

Last week he gathered everyone into the conference room and announced that he was leaving the company at the end of this month. I went to ask him about the raise, and he cut me off mid sentence and said “you’re going to have to ask the next guy for a raise. There’s nothing I can do now.” After some back and forth, I asked if he thought there was even a chance the next manager would even entertain the idea. He said “oh yeah. Our numbers are way up. Most of the company is exceeding expectations, so that shouldn’t be a problem. But it will be up to the next manager to decide.”

So I have a couple questions. 
- 1) did he do anything illegal? He promised me a raise in exchange for added responsibilities, and then assured me I had priority for the raise in the 2nd quarter, even though he knew he wasn’t going to be here (he gave his resignation the week before our second conversation).
- 2) is there any course of action for me to ensure I get this raise? We are running out of savings and I have had zero success finding a different job.

I feel like the level of stress for the amount of pay is 'very good'. Like, whenever I work I feel like my stress level is pretty much always very low.

I kind of feel like everything else isn't good though. I don't really feel like there's much career growth. I mostly work by myself and don't have many coworkers. My boss is decent. He just never says anything though really though. I would say the coworkers are below average in general. I liked the coworkers at all of my other jobs more probably.

So, it's like the only good thing is the amount of pay for the level of stress I deal with. The amount of pay can get someone a pretty nice home in my area.

I’ve recently interviewed several candidates who are obviously using some form of interviewhammer AI tools to record the question and then read off the answer. We use Behavioral questions that are pretty standard (tell me about a time you innovated at work, how did you recommend something and get buy in, etc). It’s not only obvious that they’re waiting for the answer to generate, then reading an answer from the screen, but then the answers don’t really make sense or completely answer the questions. And then when I ask follow up questions for clarity, they can’t really tie back to the answer.

I’ve gotten to the point where I just don’t move forward a candidate when I see them reading from a screen. It’s maddening and a waste of my time.

Just spend the time to actually prepare and practice for the interview in advance. Use interviewhammer to help you, just don’t rely on it during the interview!!!

1klrin9,Thinking of getting a Master’s and maybe subsequently a PhD in political science. Is this a bad idea?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently 25 years old, working as an ESL teacher in Spain, which I have been doing since I was 22. I’m going to do this for at least another year. My Bachelors degree was in Political Science with a concentration in International Relations, and I was a double major in Spanish. I like what I do now but I can’t do it forever because of visa constraints, and it’s obviously not what I studied in school. I am not interested in being a K-12 teacher in my home country of the U.S. for a variety of reasons.

I have recently been thinking of getting a MA in Political Science somewhere here in Spain as it’s much less expensive and then hopefully getting a PhD. My reasons for this are as follows:

- In undergrad I spent about a year as a research assistant for a professor in my department. I was doing menial tasks but I found it really interesting and enjoyable, and I’ve always had aspirations of doing my own research in the field and/or doing research as a career. Ultimately, academia is really attractive to me (but I’m aware it has its downsides and would love to hear from those with experience). I would also be willing to do research for a think tank.

- I honestly love what I studied and loved doing it in undergrad. I’ve tried to talk myself into doing more “lucrative” masters degrees but at the end of the day I really can’t see myself enjoying them as much. I still consider them for ROI but yeah, not what I really want.

- I have aspirations of one day being a professor in the field. I know this is difficult to achieve and not a reason in and of itself to get a PhD because of how competitive it is, but it would honestly be at the top of my list of jobs I want to do and could see myself doing.

Anyway, the reason I’m writing here is basically to hear other opinions, because I know Political Science is not as practical of a field for me to go into compared to, say, getting an MBA or choosing to get an MA in Econ (I had to take classes in Econ for my degree as well and thought it was alright). I really just feel like I don’t know a lot about what the career prospects or employability is if I do this, even though I know it’s something I would want to do. Obviously I don’t want to spend a bunch of money on something that won’t help me in the long run.

1klr6ou,Feeling lost,"I’m 43 with a wife and a 1 year old. Have in recent years been well employed ran successful teams and hit targets in sales management and director roles in a niche ish industry. The problem came a couple of years ago at a decent company I got shuffled sideways and passed over for a promotion and then jumped into an adjacent sector in the marine industry ( I’ve worked selling things to commercial shipping for decades). The new role looked great on paper but 1 week in they appointed a new CEO and changed my title and had a strategy revamp process. Huge red flags but I was grateful to still be there being the last in. I ended up with a job way too small for my experience and a salary way to high for the job. I lasted 16 months before we parted ways mutually. They offered me a package and I said yes.

Been working for my friends startup in marine and just been laid off due to investor targets not being met globally (my friend is also ousted from control of his own company)

I’m an expat with high living costs that can be easily be unwound quickly but I’d have no problem doing so as fast as possible. I can live simply and cheaply once rental obligations etc end.

Having worked so many years in marine and having a couple of bad experiences in a row I’m a bit burned out. We did have a plan to save up more cash and move back to a home country in a couple of years either my wife’s or my own where I’d probably have to career change anyway as marine isn’t big in either place. I was hoping to have large enough transferable sales management and general management skills to change industry easily and it’s possible I do ( ran teams of 30 and budgets of 80 mil USD) but I have no idea where to focus or look. 

If anyone can share experience on industry change and how you went about it I’d be super interested to hear",Geordiekev1981,1,1.0,0,1747155615,2025-05-13 17:00:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1klr6ou/feeling_lost/,5,2025
1klr5xm,I feel horrible at the start of my career,I’m doing an internship till this August in supply chain and there was so many things that upset me but I just blamed me and my capabilities. This time I really feel like a complete loser. My boss gave a project to the other two interns in my department to work on together without me even tho a month ago I’ve expressed to him that I’d like more projects to be involved with. I still barely have work to do. The projects that I was working on I finished them with taking longer but its only because I was working on them on my own with no help or guidance until a boss turned up to me and guided me and when I’ve done them my boss’s boss never asked for them or anything so I just ignored it and started working on something else cause he’s always busy. Yes I am the quiet girl but when it comes to work I do my best and that particular project I told my boss that I like that type of projects and would like to be involved in cause I’ve done it before but no body checked it or cared. Is this normal? Do I deserve it? Why’s my boss being unfair? We are all on the same level. I do want to try to be close to him but I just don’t know what to tell him the other two interns they always have something to tell him or ask him cause they work closely with him but he’s just not giving me enough chances or any recognition. I also think one of the interns don’t like me so she made up her mind to work without me.

No one talks, no one communicates, no one knows my job, they don't seem to know what information I handle.

I was doing a technical course prior to this but due to bullying got moved to management. I'm in a managerial role (sort of managerial) but it's gone from two contracts to one single contract, which still consumes all my time. 

They've given a slight raise and hinted at another raise as well as putting me back on the technical course.

I just can't make sense of what is going on. I feel ostracised (WFH) and it's impacting my mental health really badly. I'm trying to do a good job but I just don't know where I stand. I feel like crying half the time. 

I do work all my contracted hours, it just feels like a slow reduction of my duties. I really don't know who to ask about this.

Other than my main tasks (R&D and QC), I’m in charge of maintaining/calibrating a lot of equipment used in our lab and cleanrooms. Also, training people for our manufacturing/doing the manufacturing. Stuff that would usually fall under supervisory/manager responsibilities at a larger company. If I stay longer, I can definitely leverage this experience for better positions/pay down the road. Downside is that I’m not paid well and I’m living in my car right now…which is hard to do in Arizona. I also don’t like living in Arizona. 

Pros:
-Good experience
-Chill work environment
-High impact position

Cons: 
-Pay
-Live in Arizona
-Only 2 weeks of vacation

On the other hand, I have an interview for a lab tech job in Alaska. I’d basically be starting at the bottom again since I have no background in oil. It’s probably a hectic/fast pace environment as well. 

Pros: 
-Alaska
-2 weeks of vacation every month
-probably good pay

Cons:
-Chronic exposure to carcinogens
-Starting at the bottom
-Being just a number on a spreadsheet

My main goal is to leave the US since I have no family here. The monthly 2 week vacations is alluring and the pay probably will help me get to my FIRE goals sooner.

1klqo6o,Successful Career (10 years) and I hate it,"Hi everyone, 

I feel stuck and beaten down. I am gainfully employed and thankful, just lost. 

I've had a successful career in marketing. Jumped from grad school to a large company, small company, pre-IPO startup that went public, then I became the most senior Individual Contributor at a Fortune 250 company. 

I was flourishing and successful in that role, but I saw layoffs coming and took a year-long contract at a FAANG organization . 

While I'm performing ""okay"" in FAANG, it's making me realize: I do not care about any of my work. I don't even care about marketing. It's high volume, deep work - difficult to stay on top of. I'm also sick of working remotely and pressing buttons on a laptop for hours a day. 

It's all immaterial. Fake. I feel like I reached a place many would kill for, and I suddenly don't want it. At all. 

I'm committed to riding out my contract (so long as they allow), but I have no clue what's next. Real estate maybe? I have \~6 months saving as a cushion if needed. 

Has anybody else reached a significant career milestone then pivoted? Any advice is helpful. ",floralandy,6,0.8799999952316284,5,1747154409,2025-05-13 16:40:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1klqo6o/successful_career_10_years_and_i_hate_it/,5,2025

I have worked as a technician at my family hvac business for 12 years. My service manager retired about a year ago and i took over for him.

I make around 140k/year currently and received a 15% pay bump when i took this new position.

1klpxga,I’m 24 and thinking of leaving finance to become a midwife. My parents think I’m ruining my financial future. Am I?,"I work in finance, specifically insurance, and on paper, my job is great. I sit quietly in a cubicle, I don’t deal with customers, barely have any meetings, and I get to work from home two days a week. I clock in at 9, clock out at 5, and make $60k with good long-term earning potential of over $100k. I’ve only been working  a job for a few months, since I took a gap year in college and graduated last summer. I have no real complaints, and I know a lot of people would love this kind of setup. But I still feel completely empty. I can’t explain it. One day I just woke up and realized I didn’t care about anything I was doing. I don’t care if an insurance company makes more profit. Even when a task feels satisfying like solving a puzzle, it still feels meaningless.

I’m 24. I live at home and my parents are totally fine with it. I already paid off my student loans. I have about $3k in credit card debt I’m working on currently. After weeks of thinking about jobs I might find meaningful and fulfilling, I felt called to midwifery. I’ve decided to go back to school for nursing. My long-term goal is to become a certified nurse-midwife. I ran the numbers. A full associate’s degree in nursing from my local community college would cost about $11k with in-district tuition. I called two online RN to BSN bridge programs admissions offices. Both are very reputable. One program would cost around $12k, and the other closer to $19k. However, the more expensive one is highly ranked by U.S. News in both its online bachelor’s and nursing programs, so it might be worth the extra cost when applying to MSN programs.

My plan is to work as an RN while finishing the online BSN. Once I finish the BSN I’ll get one year of experience in a labor and delivery setting. After that, I’ll apply to an MSN midwifery program. I also considered that I might be able to work full-time during the first year of my associate’s, since the classes can be online asynchronous and clinicals/labs can be from 5:30 pm to 8 pm. But by the second year, it will probably be too intense, so I may need to switch to any part-time work I can get .

Grad school is another cost I’ll have to face. I haven’t even let myself look too closely at what a two-year MSN program costs yet, but I know it’s expensive. I’ll be depleting most of my savings just to cover the associate’s and bachelor’s degrees. I’ll also be giving up years of full-time income and may end up working part-time or not at all for up to three years. I’ll likely have to take on some debt. Although, I’m pretty confident I’ll be able to fully cover the associate’s and BSN costs out of pocket.

My mom is really upset. She’s an immigrant that had me at 25 so she’s devastated by the idea that I might be 31 or 32 by the time I’m done with grad school, possibly unmarried and childless. She also thinks I’m throwing away a financially smart and relatively easy career to take on huge expenses and enter a notoriously stressful job that pays less starting out. And I get her concerns. She’s not wrong at all. 

But I can’t stop thinking about it. Something about nursing, especially midwifery, feels like it could finally give me a sense of purpose. I want to go to sleep at night feeling like I actually did something that mattered. Maybe I’m being idealistic or reckless. I want to hear from others who made a switch like this. Did it give you the fulfillment you hoped for? Was it worth it taking on that huge financial risk?

1klpdni,"Stuck on how to advance my career, which degree path should I take?","So for context, I am 28 years old. I joined the Navy when I was 18 and did 8.5 years and a Nuclear Electronics Technician. I was an E6 by the time I got out. As soon as I got out I took a field service technician job for a manufacturing company in the power generation industry. I was the first technician hired by this company and kind of helped build the field service department from the ground up. I was promoted after 6 months to Lead technician and oversee about 12 technicians now.

To clarify my goals, my only real objective is to make as much money as possible. I have the most experience in electrical/electronic/tech field, so staying in that industry is probably the smartest move for me. Ultimately not a deal breaker for me to change industries though. The only paths I see right now are to delve deeper into management and climb the corporate ladder. I currently make 6 figures. So I am doing beyond great.

The question I have is for furthering my education. I am at a point where I think I'm ready to begin a degree and have a few options I am considering. I have read through the countless post about how valuable and what opportunities are available from each. For my specific case I am unsure what to pursue, here are my thoughts.

I have no prior college from my military experience, I might get a couple credits from the nuclear training pipeline but I'm not banking on anything significant. 

For my bachelors degree I'm considering 3 options

**Engineering Degree**\- I would choose electrical purely because I have the most experience in this field. I have extensive knowledge and training from the Navy and my current role. The advantages I see from this are stronger on a resume, and some jobs specifically list an actual engineering degree vice eng tech. Disadvantage being most degree programs for engineering are in person, and with my travelling work schedule would be tough to maintain.

**Engineering Technology**\- Again would probably choose electrical but not opposed to any field. I believe with the work experience I have and the technology degree would adequately check any technical knowledge block even if slightly less respected than the full EEng degree. Advantage being probably a little easier and more options for remote/fully online. Disadvantage being Some jobs do require the full engineering degree box to be checked.

**Business/Management/Finance Degree**\- Lastly I figure any upwards mobility in a company while requiring sharp technical ability, is a lot more heavily involved in the business/financials. While probably not gonna be making the big bucks straight out of college, in my case with an already established career, not really a pit fall. It checks most of the degree required boxes, improves my actual weakness of the financial inner workings of a company and brings diversity to my resume. My worry is that is corners me into an upward mobility of purely money managing/budget building/business career path. Which doesn't necessarily bother me, but all of my job experience is NOT that. Makes me think if I transitioned to that I'd only be qualified for entry level roles. Don't really want to start over.

Last part of the puzzle being a masters degree.

Really only one option here for me and that's to pursue an MBA. I guess the only real dilemma on that one is whether I try to just take the easiest and cheapest to check the box, or try for a prestigious MBA program. Cost not really being a super heavy factor in my decision, My company reimburses college degrees and I still have all of my GI bill. I feel like at a certain point in the career ladder this is a must.



So my questions are:

What do you think I should do?

Have I misunderstood or missed something I should be thinking about?

Have you been through this yourself or seen anything similar? What did you decide/see? How did it turn out? What would you do differently?

Now, hunting for SDE2 roles, but I feel, I might fail again, also the job market is super thin, so I am finding it super hard to find any new roles that well. Any advice would be great.

1kln5pe,Environmental conservationists,"Hi all!

Just a quick one to see if there’s any environmental conservationists on here and how they got into it! Very interested in pursuing this now, I’m based in the UK and would like to chat to someone who has worked or is working in the role or similar! 

I’m not sure I’ve got the qualifications but then again not too sure what I’d need. Thinking of starting an apprenticeship somewhere or I’d be happy with starting a degree/course to do to get me where I need to go - only thing with that may be my GCSE grades and my almost non-existent A-Levels…

If anyone has any advice or is happy for me to ask them a few questions, please let me know!

1klmr7f,I was told I don’t have to ID everyone at the grocery store I work at,"So basically im scared i might be getting fired for a situation that happened i feel like I handled the best way i could for how i was told to handle situations like this during the beginning of my Whole Foods cashier training.

I was told I don’t have to ID people that look around 40 or 60 or older. I forgot exactly if the training said looking 40 or 60 or older that I don’t have to ID them.

Basically, I was watching the self checkout, and someone comes to scan what I thought was a non alcoholic drink or an alcoholic drink, I’m not sure which one it was but it asked for me to scan his id or type in a birthdate. I’m told that I’m supposed to usually try and scan someone’s  ID always first. So even though he did look older I still asked for his ID. He asked if I could just bypass in a very rude tone. I had a bad interaction with this same customer around a month ago as well so I didn’t want to deal with an argument preferably. I originally thought he typed in his birthday himself  and bypassed it himself, but apparently they checked the cameras and they said it looked like I actually bypassed it. I asked for his ID beforehand just because it was kind of a grey area because he could’ve possibly been in his late 30’s so that’s why I asked just in case. But because he definitely really didn’t look like in his 20’s at all I guessed that’s why I thought it was ok  to bypass then. 

I’m just confused why I could be getting in trouble when im told at the beginning of working here that I don’t have to ID people that look most likely older then 40 or 60 or so, but i did that and i might be getting fired now for it. I feel like if i was told that i have to ID everyone regardless of what age they look like I would’ve handled this very differently and i would have been more stern with him if I was required to ID everyone regardless if they were rude to me if could cost me my job.

1klm66j,Quit without something else lined up,"I started at a small tech startup as an Enterprise AR a little over 3 months ago and have realized that this environment is not a good fit for me (toxic management culture/no support, extreme micromanagement, extreme grind/fear culture where everyone works at 4 am everyday until late at night, consistently works on the weekends, etc). For my qualifications this is not a fit and my mental and physical health is starting to take a serious hit where I’m not sleeping, constantly anxious, have zero mental clarity anymore to the point I can’t even think straight). Normally, I would quite quit and find something else before jumping ship, however with the extreme burnout I’m experiencing I do not believe I will be effective in interviews right now. I have about a year of living expenses saved up if not a little more, despite living in an expensive city in an expensive high rise. If this role is clearly not a fit and is taking an extreme toll on all other aspects of my life, is it reasonable to quit without something already lined up? I have several options through my network I can pursue, and have a solid tech sales background with >7 years of experience. 

I just can’t continue on this way….. ",Comprehensive_Dog711,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1747143512,2025-05-13 13:38:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1klm66j/quit_without_something_else_lined_up/,5,2025
1klkl7h,Haven’t had any luck getting a job.  Bills are coming up and I’m incredibly stressed.,"

I’ve been having a rough few weeks applying at what feels like every restaurant and retail store nearby only to get ghosted or sent a rejection letter.
I can’t really blame these employers for not wanting to take a chance on me because of several gaps in my employment history as well as my limited experience, but it’s growing to be extremely frustrating.

To give some background, I’ve struggled a lot with my mental health since COVID, and only recently have I felt like I’ve gotten to a place where I can manage it. 
At 23, the only sort of accomplishment I have is a high school diploma. I don’t have any skills, a driver’s license to get me to and from places, or even a cell phone with working service.

So I’ve been extremely codependent on my mom these last few years and I just feel terrible about the situation I’ve put her in.
We are doing terribly financially, and I have no one to blame, but myself.

I just would really appreciate any advice about what I can even do at this point. I wanted to go to college someday, but I doubt this is an appropriate time.
I just feel like I’ve irreparably damaged my life admittedly. 

I have until the 6th of June to pay my rent before eviction, and my internet is set to turn off in the next two days. I don’t expect to find a solution in two days of course, but I would greatly appreciate any advice for things I can do in the meantime.

1kljvld,Director Clueless - Keep Pushing?,"I do marketing planning. Preface with i am a good employee, i do my stuff and then some. It’s my thing, work should get better. Have worked for some fairly large brands and startups.

Flashback before i started about a year ago - Goon VP of media gets hired and hires his friend as director shortly after. VP decides to change entire media department and workflow. He did stuff like outsource analytics and reporting, sign up for vendors with repeat offerings, changed flowcharts, forced young/entry workers to do higher level tasks like billing and back end website management. Again all in like one year, he couldn’t just pick one to start with. I legitimately think he didn’t read some contracts and just signed them to push them off his plate. But People quit, department is shredded.

Back to recent - i get hired 4 months ago for a supervisor position under the director. Everything was “okay” for a few months until suddenly a large client pulled back heavily. 30% of staff let go including that VP (yay). Thankfully i remain but so does The director.

So here is the problem, In the past few weeks I’ve begun to realize the director also doesn’t really know what he is doing or how to manage. Very akin to his VP.

Managing - It’s the little things like not letting someone finish a presentation before asking questions, not listening or reading the presentations leading to said questions, misunderstanding contract details, not picking up things when able. Me and my subordinate also “learn” nothing from him, minus where to add a bullet in a ppt.

Director - Kinda clueless for a media director. I have never met someone who needed to be reminded of what CM360/DCM its literally the only thing we use to track and traffic media. Similarly, he just signs sometimes, no reading required. Upper level thought leadership again missing - i had to clue him in on how we could save money by consolidating vendors. Guess who’s doing that work now? He will even take my work and present it to the c suite without me. 

When does the buck stop? I have started to clue in other VPs and the CEO on some of this stuff but do i just come outright and say, “this guy should have been let go with the rest?” Do i keep pushing him and management to prove himself and the role?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

1kljgwa,Getting exploited/ripped off at work,"Trigger warning for mentions of suicide.

For context, I (23F) am working in a top market area for one of the most competitive fields out there. This is my first year out of college and I was very lucky to land a job after graduation. 

I am contracted at my job. That does not mean that I have a contract that expires and I am bound to it, it means I work hourly, don't get benefits, vacation, etc. My hours though, are consistent and I make enough to live on my own.

My coworker (40s Male) has worked at this company for a few years and is staff (he makes salary, gets benefits, vacation/sick days, company perks, etc). When I started, other coworkers who don't work my shift warned me about his tendency to call out frequently and come in late. This ended up being true. He called out about once or twice a week regularly and someone else would be called in last minute to fill his place. I was often called to come in two hours early to do this. 

On top of calling out, when he is at work he constantly complains, picks every fight, and does the absolute bare minimum - if that. 

Two months ago, he was out for about a week. He later told me that it was because his wife attempted suicide and he had to stay home to take care of his kids. After about three weeks of no solution to him being out and him calling out last minute because of this issue, my boss shifted me to his schedule, and he took mine. 

He now works Sat-Wed and I work Mon-Fri. I am appreciative that my boss trusted me to take on this responsibility. I'd like to think that I'm good at my job and have learned quickly and have even surpassed other coworkers in skill. Plus, I like having my weekends on the weekend. This coworker and I now work together Mon-Wed.

The issue is that my coworker keeps calling out. He has called out after his shift starts multiple times - where at that point, if I am not working, our department is unstaffed. He has left work early with ""stomach pains."" He claims his alarm clock doesn't go off then doesn't come in. He'll call out with mental health related issues. 

It happens so often that it's hard to tell what is true and what isn't. 

I am always here to pick up the pieces. Even though he comes in late more than he comes in early, even though he works short weeks more than he works full, I am working his shift, full time - but I am not staff. I don't make salary, don't get benefits, vacation, company perks, etc. 

When I was hired my boss told me that once the year was up, I'd be brought on staff if they like me/my work. Two weeks ago I asked my boss what the likelihood was that I'd be brought on staff and he said that because our department's staff positions are full, as of right now, it's not likely. Once my year is up in June, I would continue contracted, with an hourly rate. 

I am not incredibly concerned about health benefits. I have three years until that becomes a problem. My problem is the principle of it. This man barely comes to work and is staff, while I work his shift, do his job, and am contracted. I was put on his shift because of the risk of him calling out.

The manager on my shift suggested I email my boss and explain how the situation is unfair. I worry that this won't help/do anything. They can't fire him because he can sue for some form of unjust firing. Every time he calls out, its physical/mental health related.

Admittedly, I also like working Monday-Friday. I have gotten closer with said manager and interact more with coworkers. Plus, I get weekends on the weekend.

In the meantime I have been searching for other jobs. I'm in the interview process for two but it's a very competitive field and I don't want to count on anything panning out.

What would you do? I want to have a job above all else and I don't want an complaints to backfire. ",No_Income_3724,9,1.0,5,1747135575,2025-05-13 11:26:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kljgwa/getting_exploitedripped_off_at_work/,5,2025
1klj4vc,Stay in Uni or Take the Job?,"Context: 25F, located in the EU.

I have a non traditional background. I have an existing degree in law, and work experience in AML/Compliance and some internships in legal. I found myself being super interested in AML and Regtech, and I was limited in my skill set at going down that path so I went back to uni for a BSc in Comp Sci.

I just finished Y1 in CS, and because of my networking skills, research projects, GitHub repo, and just luck in general I have just landed an offer for a dream role which is mixed Consulting + AML + Tech Dev for a major firm, with very good prospects for upward mobility. It’s basically a dream role for someone with my background.

The only caveat is that I will for sure have logistical issues studying at my current uni for CS (part time status is not guaranteed) and it’s possible I have to switch to an online uni. It’s not bad as I can transfer credits for the entire year but I’d lose the networking and research opportunities at my current uni.

What do you guys think is more important? A Job or a good degree with research opportunities? Personally I think a job > academic research because that is not the area I want to go into and I want to just get an online degree and keep going for masters and just get things over with, but I could also get laid off during the probationary period or from bad performance.

I would greatly appreciate outside perspectives that can help me weigh my options.",sadpinotnoir,1,1.0,0,1747134411,2025-05-13 11:06:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1klj4vc/stay_in_uni_or_take_the_job/,5,2025

1klhpo5,Feeling stuck because you overthink everything...how to break out of analysis paralysis?,"If feel like you're constantly second-guessing every decision, and can't quite figure out your next move, this will help you (this helped me).

Isn't it funny that sometimes people come to you for answers, but when it comes to your own path (whether it's career, business, or life), you’re stuck, spinning, overanalyzing, hesitating...

Now, here's something I experienced in the past, and which I've seen many people go through when it comes to doing a career reset:

You have dozens of ideas… and zero momentum.

This is especially common in your 30s, where you typically reach a point in life where you've worked hard, climbed the ladder, earned stability...

But now that you want something *different;* more meaningful, more aligned with who you are deep down, you feel paralyzed.

I’ve seen this pattern lately with professionals who are ""successful on paper"" but deep down they are questioning and second guessing their next move (I can relate, used to be here myself).

Now, what I've learned is the problem isn’t laziness. It’s not fear of failure either.

The problem is you’re too intelligent for vague goals and too responsible to risk everything blindly.

You're too smart for your own good.

So you overthink everything… and do nothing.

If you leave this unaddressed, you'll stay behind, wasting your potential, being miserable, stressed, unproductive, and unfulfilled.

And you know it.

So if you feel stuck, like you're overthinking your next step in life or work, remember:

1. Shift from Outcome-based decisions to Directional ones. Stop thinking ""best"" and trying to be too efficient.

Most people ask: “What’s the *best* next move?”

But the truth is, that question has no answer.

It keeps you frozen, waiting for certainty that doesn’t exist.

Instead, ask: “What’s a move that moves me closer to the life I want, even if it’s not perfect?”

In the beginning, don’t optimize for “right” or ""best.""

Optimize for momentum in the right direction.

2. Think Shorter Term: Choose a 1-year mission, as opposed to a Life sentence

Thinking in terms of “forever” creates pressure and fear. This is what holds most people back (it used to hold me back).

Thinking in terms of “12 months” creates clarity and urgency, so you can design a short-term mission you can commit to, like:

* Exploring a new skill or role
* Building a side project or business
* Resetting your mental and financial clarity

Your next move doesn’t have to be *the* move. It just needs to be aligned and actionable.

3. Commit to the process, and not the perfect plan

Analysis paralysis usually masks a lack of structure. Once you’ve chosen a direction:

* Block time weekly to move on it
* Track progress in small wins, not outcomes
* Share the goal with someone (accountability matters)
* Stop following people that are telling you to follow different paths, or overwhelming your brain with how their ideas are the next best thing you can do

This sounds simple, but most people don’t do it. They stay in their head, running simulations.

""What if this, what if that? Hmmm, how about that one?""

Your clarity lives on the other side of **action.** 

So, if you feel stuck, like you’re overthinking your next step in life or work, remember:

* You don’t need a perfect answer, you need a clear direction
* You don’t need to change everything, just build a 1-year mission
* You don’t need more ideas, you need structure, commitment, and movement

You’re not broken. You're not lazy. You don't need more motivation.

You’re just overdue for a reset.

1klfhdp,Am I being ridiculous?,"As the title says I could use some advice as I'm angry and may not be thinking reasonably. 
My previous job before covid was at an office that only required 2 in office days a week (they were hybrid before everyone was doing it). Was laid off from there and got a job during covid so of course it was remote at the time. Eventually they made us come in one day a week. Now they are about to change it to 3 days. My commute is 30 miles each way, moving closer is not an option. 

One of my friends is pretty high up at a company that has an opening and this place only has one office day a week. They said they could put in a word for me if I applied. The pros are the 4 remote days and it'd be less work than my current role. But I'm hesitant because it'd be a 20k pay cut, and if this place ever decides to change their remote policy I've essentially taken the cut for no reason. 

I know it's crazy to consider a lower paying job. But I haven't worked in an office 3+ days in over 10 years.

i’m a 2nd year english undergrad. i’m worried about getting a job after uni, yes (just bc of general job market shenanigans atm) but i know i have options. civil service, marketing, copywriting and editing, etc. i’m looking at converting into speech and language therapy. i’m thinking of doing perhaps more challenging things, such as transitioning into law, or maybe following the ‘dream’ of going into academia.

and i guess here’s why i’m struggling - i recognise that in following one of these aspirations, another door kind of shuts on me. i only get one masters funded by the UK government, so picking carefully is important. furthermore, i’m scared of, let’s say really pushing for being a uni lecturer, only to spend the 8 years of education to blow up in my face, and never get the job, when i could’ve been doing lawyer training, for example. but then, what if i regret never giving the dream a chance?

i understand i can’t let you all make any decisions for me, but any advice on this dilemma would be greatly appreciated.",belovedbumblebee,1,1.0,1,1747117957,2025-05-13 06:32:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1klf579/weathering_uncertainty_and_picking_a_career/,5,2025

Now I see the responsibility that was permanently handed over to me is delegated to a different person on the team. I used to be the point of contact for some tasks that need coordination with other pods. Now I don’t receive any. I just get tasks assigned. Work load is slightly reduced.

At the same time, I am finishing up my last semester of college with exams approaching in four weeks. Although starting right away at the new branch is optional, it is clearly their preference, and I feel some pressure to begin as soon as possible. While it would be great to be paid, my concern is that starting a new role right now (with internship and school responsibilities) might be too overwhelming. Would it be considered inflexible or unmotivated if I ask to wait until after I finish school and my internship before I begin working at the new branch?

1kl8toa,"Really need advice- underemployed, which next level position might be good for me?","I’m under employed (5 yrs relevant experience in an entry level position….) and feeling stuck. I am also overlooked because I am not outgoing or a huge loud go getter that I go wayyy above and beyond and tell everyone. Which ofc I understand that’s what you’re supposed to do. However everything that I do work on I feel I do better than many others would. But my current job I don’t really “own” anything so I can’t really show much plus it doesn’t help to make me more confident to have a lot of input in meetings on things I don’t directly work with. 

So here’s my experience :

5 years working in hospitality (last year as a sales assistant job that was more like manager without the sales part- aka I did everything after the sale)

1.5 year merchandising assistant on sales team for distributor/grocery company

Left for new job which laid me off from Covid 

Back to that company where I was then a coordinator for a private label. 2 years? Lots of focus on promotions but also category work. Would’ve been a product development manager if I stayed :(

Left after I moved to a new city, category analyst directly for a store. Tons of different work in lots of areas did a lot of category management work. 

Laid off again… now sales analyst and thinking wtf did I do? I don’t want to work sales. So now I’m stuck. They don’t really have other jobs often and the one that I know I could do, they’re not considering me because I’m just an analyst so I think maybe it’s not seen as “next step” 

So now I feel like I need to start looking for jobs at other companies more aggressively. But I also know it’s pretty hard right now, I applied to 2 I was super qualified for and never heard back. (Which I know is not enough to matter but man I was so qualified!)

I’m looking mostly for category specialist, merchandising specialist or like development manager or category insights or maybe senior analyst (though I realize there might be some good programs I should learn to help me there)

Wondering if maybe I should look for something new I could do better maybe supply? Or go for a different kind of company. I dunno. I’m lost.

1kl8ah5,Sticky job situation - Pls help :(,"Hi,
So I’ll set out my situation. I was at the same company each summer (Australia summer so November to February) for three years, and then part time all of last year - this is all during university. That company didn’t have any work for me this year so I asked my manager if he had any contacts, he ended up getting me a part time job at his best mates company (they’ve known each other since they were 20) and I’m very grateful for this. 

However, since starting in February this year, for the past month or so the work has been really irregular. I’m supposed to work two days a week, and sometimes they will call me up three days before and say that they won’t need me at all (that’s the notice period they can give me). But being a university student, I need the money. 

A couple weeks ago when I was working, the owner told me that he thinks there won’t be anymore work for me for the rest of the year - so on that day I started applying for more jobs because it sounded like redundancy. But then yesterday he said that next week I could come in for the two days because it always gets busier towards the end of the month with the administration work that I do (invoicing). 

I rang the owner a week after he told me that I might be made redundant and told him that it scared me and I started applying for more jobs, and asked if it would actually lead to redundancy and that if I did get accepted for another job that I didn’t want any harsh feelings. He said that it would probably be work at the end of the month and that he understood that it’s his shit to sort out, and it would lead to any harsh feelings.

But then that leaves my old manager, I’ll be working at that company this summer again and then for the foreseeable future as I finish my degree at the end of this year. It’s quite a big company so I won’t be under him again for a little while, but I want to have him as a reference for one of those three jobs that I have an interview for tomorrow. 

I’m just not sure how to tell him considering they’ve been best mates and I feel guilty for him getting me a job, and then leaving. I also don’t want any harsh feelings to come from it between them two. 


Please if anyone has some advice I’d really appreciate it, I’ve asked my old manager if I could give him a ring today but haven’t heard back yet.

I moved into this role almost two years ago after working as a unionized labourer for the same company. I’ve been feeling unfulfilled in the position for more than a year now and since the company laid off over 30 people in the past year, I’ve had to take on more responsibilities than I was originally hired for, I'm often exceeding 40/hrs. a week with no overtime compensation.

I’ve been thinking about going back to the field, but this time as a Heavy Equipment Operator and if they let me, I would make $49.67/hour, 10% Vacation Pay, $8.50/hour to my pension and better benefits than I have now. And I'd have guaranteed work for the next 4-5 years one this one jobsite.

The operator role would pay more in the long run, and I’ve always liked working in the field more than at a desk. It would also give me more time and freedom to focus on personal goals like starting a business or buying a house.

I’m torn between staying on a white-collar career path that could lead to project management or switching to a role that might not have as much growth but offers better pay and more enjoyment right now.

I emailed her back promptly and said that I was at work today until 4:00 but that I would reach out as soon as I got off. (Obviously worded more professionally than that but you get the point.) 

Then I got off work Friday and completely forgot to reach out to her and didn’t remember until that night and didn’t want to bother her on the weekend or late at night Friday so I called her today (Monday) and got her voicemail so I emailed her after and apologized sincerely for my forgetfulness and essentially asked if we could arrange a time through email to connect through phone call (so that I could write it in my planner and would know in advance and be less likely to forget again). 

The problem is I accidentally sent that same message three times on outlook and I tried to do the recall feature so she wouldn’t receive three emails back to back from me and my MacBook doesn’t seem to have that feature. I am stressing out cause I feel like I just ruined a perfectly good chance because I look so irresponsible and dumb for forgetting and not knowing how to send a professional email.

Just got blindsided with a PiP (one month) without any warning or suggestions and any interactions with my direct supervisor has been ""you're doing great"".  Its a hybrid position at a medium sized company that Ive been at for over 3 years and I honestly don't know how to make heads of tails of this.

I thought I was doing well with my yearly reviews being very positive but I guess that is no longer true.

  
The PiP did have a couple points that aren't really quantifiable and are more of an opinion than able to be documented.  Things like, I should be enforcing my team to be using their webcams and such.

  
This is a bit of a gut punch to say the least and I am really weighing my options.

  
I guess my questions are:

 \- Is this just a slow firing?

 \- What is the best way to approach this?

 \- Is it even possible to negotiate severance?

 \- If I quit, will I have trouble getting unemployment? (CA)

I (23F) am about to graduate with an MPH degree this upcoming weekend. I am very proud of this milestone as I am first generation with siblings to complete a bachelors degree (in biostatistics) and masters degree. Graduated undergrad in 2023.

While in undergrad, I also was pre med. Took the essential classes on top of the major requirements and even took the MCAT (not the score I wanted) and was about to apply to the 2025 cycle last year but couldn’t since the undergraduate pre health advisor at my college told me last min they “wasn’t able to give me one”. 

Ever since navigating through my MPH since Fall 2023, it kind of put me in a different perspective in healthcare. IDK, i personally want to work with patients on a deeper level while implementing my degree. 

I’m not sure. i’ve been navigating if optometry is the right path for me. it does apply physics and math which i enjoy. work/life balance is better than a PCP and such. and working with patients more too. I took the OAT today and I didn’t get the score i want. lol i think im just a bad test taker lmk if you have advice too. 

not sure if im ok with where i am. i am taking a gap year anyway since i need a break and take time away from education and work on my best application. what bothers me the most is the social pressure i get from family since growing up since being a kid that grades are most important. (and yes, i do have experience, ive been working in healthcare jobs/internships since i was 14 and school extracurricular from all the schools i’ve attended to). i feel like time is flying and i feel like spiraling a bit wit my career.

1kl6hn4,"What should I do I feel totally stuck in call center jobs, any advice?","So I’m in the U.S., I’m 29. I’ve only worked in bilingual call centers—collections, sales, etc.—and I absolutely hate call centers. Using my company’s education reimbursement program, I got a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration in 2022 and a master’s degree in Data Analytics, graduating in January 2024. Because I was using the education reimbursement, I wasn’t able to do any type of internship before or after graduating.

After finishing my degree in 2024, I decided to quit my call center job, hoping to find something better to start gaining experience. I’m literally open to moving anywhere in the U.S., and I’m not picky about salary at all. All I want is a job hopefully data-related where I can gain experience and grow.

I paid to have my resume professionally reviewed, and I completed a few certifications: Google Analytics, Advanced Analytics, and AWS Cloud Practitioner. I also built a portfolio. I started applying in January 2024, and after more than 1,000 applications over six months, the only responses I got were from call centers.

Eventually, I decided to take another call center job and meet the 9-month requirement to grow within the company. Now, I’ve been in this horrible CSR job for 9 months. I haven’t stopped applying externally, but I still haven’t heard back. I’ve also applied for jobs within the company, but they all require 2+ years of experience, and again—I hear nothing.

Externally, I’ve had a few interviews, but even after making it to the final round, I either get ghosted or receive the “we went with another candidate” email.

At this point, I feel totally lost. I hate my life as a result, and I’ve been really depressed lately. I feel like a total failure.

any advice?",Imaginary-Ad3548,2,1.0,1,1747090249,2025-05-12 22:50:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kl6hn4/what_should_i_do_i_feel_totally_stuck_in_call/,5,2025
1kl5dd8,What goes into a performance review?,"Should performance reviews be a result of the overall discussions had throughout the year, or a detailed list of everything the employee did wrong (even if they did okay 99% of the time)?

Example: let's say an employee once drops the receiver during a client call and accidentally hangs up on the client. Employee then calls back, apologizes, and continues the call. Afterwards, the manager comes to the employee and says, ""that was unacceptable, be more careful"" to which employee responds ""I know I'm wrong and I'm truly sorry, it won't happen again."" And it doesn't happen again.

Should the performance review say-

""The employee hung up on a client, which was unacceptable"" 

-or-

""Despite a few hiccups, the employee has made an effort to learn from their mistakes, and no other incidents have occurred during the performance period. The employee understands the importance of being more careful and has met the manager's expectations following an incident.""

Just trying to understand whether they are meant to be more constructive or more critical.

1kl4v71,Is this interview process too easy?,"I’m currently interviewing for a position that will be relatively lateral, potentially more pay within my industry. I have a relatively senior position in my industry as of about 2 years ago. My role is tough to acquire and desirable, essentially everyone in the role just below me wants my position.  There’s usually no shortage of well experienced internal and external candidates for these roles. I’m currently in an incredibly secure role with my current company, well liked and established and have some professional leverage due to some unique non-transferable skill sets i posses (meaning those skills mean ALOT to my current employer and not much to anyone else in my industry, but it keeps my job safe). I never shy away from hearing about job openings though and usually when I do they don’t go anywhere but this one appears to be going somewhere.  

So far through the interview process things have been pretty easy; I wasn’t really asked many challenging questions and everything was more informative about the role, some light review of experience/work history, asking if I have any questions, etc. I’ve had 4 interviews with successive senior people and all went super fast (all well under 30 minutes) and I was passed along for next interview within a day or even same day. I am colleagues with one of their employees at my same position, so i do have a strong referral. That said, the job opening was never officially posted and this specific hire is an expansion of their current roster and is getting final approvals now. 

The company I’m interviewing for is massive, well financed, so i don’t worry about the legitimacy of the role. There more upward mobility and the pay is likely better. What does make me sweat is if this is a fast hire and they are expanding faster than can handle and bringing people in to throw things at a wall and see what sticks and move on from those who don’t?  I was expecting an external interview for this role to be much harder and intense. It was actually the easiest interview process I’ve had in my professional career at any level

I’m pretty confident in my performance but am a realist.  I don’t have a ton of work history in my new role and if I take a new job and it doesn’t work out it’s VERY likely I will have to take a role one level lower with another company. My current employer will backfill my position quickly, as we do a good job of grooming people for it.  

What’s your reaction and experiences with these situations?",ahoy_shitliner,2,1.0,0,1747086003,2025-05-12 21:40:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kl4v71/is_this_interview_process_too_easy/,5,2025
1kl4omy,Public speaking fumble,"I just got a new job through a referral (old mgr and friend) and everyone including my new boss was super excited/welcoming. 

But due to chronic imposter syndrome and just general social anxiety, I fumbled and was SUPER awkward at my welcome meeting. It was a mess and it showed.. so much so that my new boss has shifted his behavior with me. I didn’t want to get reassurance from my friend but he wouldn’t say directly that I did a poor job but just that I’ll learn to get over my social anxiety. 

My new coworkers also feel awkward and weird talking to me since they’ve seen how socially awkward I was. It’s only been two weeks and I am trying realllly hard not to let this affect the rest of my time here but it feels like an upward battle already. It’s just so embarrassing because I have 5-6 yrs of work experience and still haven’t improved in being able to articulate myself clearly in meetings. I think my boss was kind of shocked…

1kl3l0v,"Constantly Getting Rejected—No Response, No Interview. Could a Past Research Incident Be Haunting Me?","I’m a 3rd-year undergrad majoring in Computer Science, and honestly, I’m feeling really lost. I’ve been applying to internships and job opportunities startups, big companies, research roles, anything I can find—and I keep getting rejected at the *very first* stage.

What’s worse? **Most of the time I don’t even get a reply.** No test, no interview, nothing. Just an automated ""we're moving forward with other candidates"" email or complete silence.

I don’t think my profile is *that* weak to deserve this level of ghosting, and it's starting to feel like something deeper is wrong.

There’s one incident I keep overthinking:  
I once applied for a research internship with a professor at IIT Indore. She initially asked me for a simple Linear Regression code sample, which I gave. But then she kept piling on extra stuff a fully documented Google Colab notebook, a notepad file, etc. It felt like a lot for just a screening task. I tried to delay and asked her for a break during Diwali, but she didn’t respond. The next day, she texted me saying I wasn't a suitable candidate, and that was it. She never replied again.

Now I can’t help but wonder…  
**Could she have blacklisted me somehow?** Maybe spread negative feedback in academic or research circles?

Or am I just overthinking it, and the real issue is with my resume?  
I'm attaching screenshots of my resume. If anyone here is willing to give it a look and offer constructive feedback, I’d be *really* grateful. I’m tired of feeling like I’m shouting into the void with every application I send.

While since I’m job hunting, obviously I keep getting all sorts job advice on social media platform, such as TikTok. And one of the advices is to reach out on LinkedIn. I’m curious to know if this has actually helped anyone? And how did you go about it? 

I have reached out to employers in the past or recruiters in the past and it has done more bad for me than good. More recently I had interviewed with one company that rejected me from a specific position, which for me was understandable because I also didn’t feel that position was right for me, however, now I have applied to other positions in the same company that align closer to my résumé and still have been rejected. What is odd about this, is that before I was rejected I reached out to the same recruiter to let them know I applied to these positions that closely aligned with my resume and experience and within an hour or so of reaching out, I was rejected from every other position I applied to in the company….

Maybe I went about it the wrong way.. I’m not really sure. But I would like to know others experiences on whether reaching out on LinkedIn has helped you or is it just something people are selling on social media?

Only problem is that I accepted an offer from another company a few months ago after interning for them.

\- Does word spread among companies? I am mostly concerned about if recruiters from my original employer will speak to other recruiters in the same industry and prevent me from getting a job there in the future.

\- One of my close family members is currently working with my original company. Would reneging an offer with them reflect poorly on them? They were the ones who referred me last summer for the internship. They've worked for this company for longer than I've been alive and I would hate to see them get backlash because of me.

1kkx58i,Should I do a summer research project or take more classes? Looking for advice (Data Science major),"Hi everyone,

I'm a data science major heading into my senior year this fall, and I’m currently studying abroad for the summer. I was recently accepted into a summer research project that I can do for course credit, but I’m also considering just taking more classes instead. I haven’t landed any internships yet, so I’m really trying to figure out what would be most valuable for my resume and overall career prospects. Especially considering I don’t have industry internship experience yet, I’m wondering if research could help fill that gap, or if recruiters will mostly be looking for internships? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Do employers value undergraduate research experience? I’d love to hear what others think, especially those who’ve been on the hiring side of things.

Here are the details of the research project, in case that helps give more context:

**Research Topic:** Convex Optimization and Linear Integer Programming  
**Summary:**  
The main goal of the project is to understand both the theoretical foundations and implementation aspects of convex optimization and linear integer programming. We’ll start by studying the mathematical analysis of these optimization problems and their associated algorithms. After that, we’ll implement various optimization algorithms using tools like MATLAB or Python. The project is hands-on and requires using programming tools to bring these mathematical concepts into practice.

Would this kind of research be a strong addition to my resume if I’m aiming for roles in data science or analytics? Or would I be better off focusing on building more practical skills through classes or personal projects?

Thanks in advance for any advice!",Friendly_Star5014,3,1.0,2,1747067828,2025-05-12 16:37:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kkx58i/should_i_do_a_summer_research_project_or_take/,5,2025

1kkwxkj,Is it okay to take a break?,"I'm working a job that pays just okay. I moved to an expensive city like Mumbai for it, but most of my salary gets eaten up by rent, food, and travel. On top of that, a big chunk of my time goes into commuting, which leaves me with barely any time or energy to focus on learning or developing myself.

It’s been two years now, and I haven’t really grown in terms of salary or career progression. I’m still very young—just 23—and I’ve been seriously thinking of quitting and giving things a fresh start after a proper break. I’ve been considering moving to Europe for a master’s, or even just taking some time off to find a better and more aligned opportunity.

That said, I’m not looking to just switch jobs—it honestly feels pointless right now and I don’t feel ready. But almost everyone I talk to keeps telling me not to leave, to just find another role.

Is it really so wrong to take a break and move forward at my own pace? Or should I only consider switching jobs because that’s the “safer” thing to do?

1kkw9p6,Got placed on a PIP.,"I just got placed on a PIP last week. Have been struggling with the workload not because I’m not capable of doing it but because I have not gotten any actual support. I have voiced my concerns and frustrations during my 1:1. There’s a certain individual (outside of the company) that has been making my work harder than it’s supposed to be. I also asked for a raise last year because since I started working with them, my workload has increased. Mgmt said I wasn’t at that level yet. It came to my attention that I’m not the only one that’s been struggling with this individual. 

I got “coached” a few months ago. But basically was told my work was shit and needed to get it together. They said some of my additional duties were going to get released ( I’ve been working on tasks outside my role).. til this day I’m still doing them. 
A few weeks passed by and management started working directly with the individual to help me out (more like submit things on my end so I won’t have direct contact) .. they soon realized the headache he is but never acknowledged my concerns. I’ve been asking for a performance review and never have gotten one. During the PIP conversation, I brought that up and they said they don’t do them anymore. 

I was under a lot of pressure to complete my deadlines that when I told my supervisor that I was struggling to stay up float  his solution was to do OT. 

I was crying after every meeting because I felt like I wasn’t being heard or supported. 

I ended up going on FMLA due to the overwhelming stress and for my own mental health. 

I came back and a week later was hit with the PIP. 

Obviously the clear answer is to find a new job. 
I have started applying since my “coaching” but obviously with the current job market it’s been difficult. My morale is low, I’m second guessing myself and my ability to move past this. I feel lost and more so defeated because my name is tainted and this is obviously not my work ethic at all. 

Any tips/pointers/ advice to get through this? 
I’d really appreciate it. ",Alternative_War6172,12,0.7699999809265137,10,1747065795,2025-05-12 16:03:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kkw9p6/got_placed_on_a_pip/,5,2025

1kkuoyc,Promotion but no salary increase,"Whilst off on annual leave the senior project manager of a large project in my organisation has been successful in their application for a new job (a promotion with immediate effect). The project is due to be delivered within 6 months and has been ongoing for 3 years. I’ve logged in this morning and been told I am now essentially the project manager with immediate effect (I was previously an admin assistant for said project on 30k who took minutes and organised meetings) and I won’t be getting the salary to match the project manager post. I also must continue in my role of admin assistant so I am a team of 1.

I’ve been told to see it as a good thing because they think I’m more than capable of doing it and I can grow a whole new set of skills that could benefit me getting a new job in the future should I wish. I’ve been told I can always ask the old project manager for help.

My new role hasn’t been announced but the previous project managers new role was announced to the company so everyone knows they’ve moved on. Mine is more of a quiet transition.

I’m new to this career having made a career switch last year (due to burn out in education) so I don’t want to seem like I’m not a team player and don’t want to cooperate, but also think this is a massive undertaking for someone without formal project management qualifications who was quite happy in their admin role.

1kkufft,Should I Trade My Finance Career for Life as Cabin Crew?,"Hey everyone,

I’m in need of some outside advice and a different perspective, so I figured I’d turn to this community.

I’m 33 years old and have spent the last 15 years building a career in finance. I’m qualified as a chartered accountant and a management accountant, which has taken a lot of hard work and sacrifices along the way. My current is to reach the CFO level. 

I’ve made choices with the mindset of short-term sacrifice for long-term gain. But here I am I still don’t feel fulfilled and like I am wasting my life.

I thought that after all the late nights and studying, combined with years spent in high-level roles and working with the Big 4, I’d feel a sense of accomplishment. Instead, I find myself feeling drained and questioning my happiness.

A big part of my motivation has always been to provide for my elderly mom, who sadly passed away recently. That loss has made me reflect on my life choices and what I truly want moving forward.

Now, I’m considering a big change: becoming cabin crew for Emirates Airlines. I know it would come with a pay cut, but I see it as a chance to learn new skills, change my perspective, and see the world.

I was not aware of the all the benefits that came with being cabin crew when I was younger and am confident I would’ve chose cabin crew instead if I had been better informed. You don’t know what you don’t know.

So, if you were in my position—at 33 y.o and with my background—would you take the leap and leave a stable but draining, finance career for something as different as cabin crew? I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts or any experiences you might want to share.

1kkua6e,Dealing with a Toxic Ex-Manager... Four Years Later?!,"So this has been eating at me for a while and I needed to vent—and maybe see if anyone else has had a similar experience.

Recently, I found out my former manager from *four years ago* is still trying to sabotage me. I had a casual chat with a recruiter on LinkedIn (not even job hunting, just talking about the market), and that recruiter mentioned—on a call—that my old manager reached out to badmouth me. Not even subtly... just went out of his way to trash me.

I had previously blocked this guy on LinkedIn, but after hearing he retired and was working as a contractor, I figured I’d be the bigger person and unblock him. That was apparently a mistake.

To give some context: this guy was *toxic*. He spread rumors at our old job—one claiming I was gay because I got COVID from hanging out with a friend, and another that I was sleeping with a female coworker (we were just friends, and still are meme buddies to this day). I reported this to HR and had a formal complaint entered by staff member X. Later, those records were mysteriously altered. When I challenged it with HR rep Y before quitting, *I* got written up for being “disruptive.” That was the final straw for me.

Oh, and while I was working remotely due to a *documented* stomach condition, I was still showing up to meetings, getting my work done—but he marked me as taking PTO. I almost went to a lawyer over it but decided to just get out and move on with my life.

Despite all this, the guy has kept creeping on my LinkedIn—even after multiple blocks. He’s in his 70s now, probably bored with too much time on his hands. And now he’s trying to sabotage my career, apparently for fun.

The recruiter won’t give me anything in writing, so I don’t have the evidence to pursue a defamation claim. Just his word, over the phone.

The wildest part? I *modernized* that company. Led automation and AI initiatives, saved them \~$30 million over three years. Only write-up I ever had was because I got upset that my HR report had been changed. I still get pinged by folks from that company—they even encouraged me to apply for the Director role when this guy retired. But I refused—didn’t want to deal with that same HR team ever again.

**TL;DR:**  
My ex-manager from 4+ years ago is still actively trying to ruin my professional reputation by spreading lies to recruiters I talk to. I have no written proof, so I can’t pursue defamation. Just incredibly frustrating and creepy. Anyone else have a manager who just wouldn’t let go?",Tipsterspainting,2,1.0,4,1747061027,2025-05-12 14:43:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kkua6e/dealing_with_a_toxic_exmanager_four_years_later/,5,2025

1kktsxd,Anyone else constantly being called the wrong job title?,"I’m working in a data science team and my official job title is Data Scientist. But honestly, I feel like I made a mistake when I accepted this role.

At the time, I was urgently looking for a job, so I applied to any opening that had “data science” in the title. I didn’t realise until later that this position was more like an entry-level analyst role, most of the responsibilities were quite basic, and most of the team was doing work that looked a lot like traditional data analysis.

That said, during the interview, I did ask whether they were looking for someone who could do machine learning, and they said yes, so I joined, expecting to actually use my modelling skills.

Now that I’m in the team, I’ve realised I’m the only one doing actual ML or predictive modelling work. Everyone else is more focused on analytics, reporting, etc. And even though everyone’s title is “Data Scientist,” the entire team is now treated like a bunch of analysts by the rest of the organisation.

What’s worse, one of my stakeholders outright refers to us as “the analyst team,” and another stakeholder even calls me a “Data Analyst” directly, despite my official job title being Data Scientist. I’ve corrected them before and explained that I focus on modelling, but they keep calling me that anyway. It’s honestly getting on my nerves. Worse still, that stakeholder even tries to assign me analyst-type work.

But I don’t want to do traditional analyst work. I want my role to focus on modelling, that’s where I want to expand my skillset. I have zero interest in basic data wrangling or creating Excel dashboards, and frankly, I don’t care about those tasks at all. That’s not where my passion lies. I want to grow deeper in AI and machine learning, not get trapped in traditional analyst work.

I really want to be very clear with stakeholders: I’m not a data analyst. I’m a data scientist, and that distinction matters.

Currently I’m earning around 85k per month, with no debt and very little expenses (~10-15%) as my father pays the rent and I help with expenses here and there as required. I’m up for a promotion and I was very happy today. July onwards I might get paid more, how much is yet to be known. The company is a reputed MNC, and now I’ve gotten the knack of the job, so I’ve been getting more responsibility and features. I’m starting to understand the product, and I can see if I stay here long enough, I can get ahead. But when I told my mom, she was like: you will grow in this company, but age when you earn that money also matters. She gave examples of my friends who earn way more than me. I really like the company (the wlb as well as the team and learning curve) or maybe it’s just my comfort zone. Should I go for a switch or continue my career here? I’ve a good resume and I’ve done 2 internships in the same company and 2 internships at a reputed and leading Indian Fintech company and won a couple of hackathons. What’s the right time for switch? I’m happy here but will staying in the same company slow down my growth? Also given the fact that my father will retire in a couple of years so I have to bear the family myself as they have no savings.

1kktohq,How you can advance your career in just 10 seconds per day,"Hi all

**TL;DR:** Capture all of your achievements at work (small and big) including your ideas. You should have a record of your impact at work so you can use it to your advantage and make performance reviews and resume writing effortless. Just create a word document, apple notes file, whatever and start capturing it.

Using note taking apps is great, but it can get tedious overtime and it doesn't provide you with personal insights. To fix that, I’ve built a cross-platform desktop app that helps you advance in your career by spending only 10 seconds a day.

**Why I’ve built it**

Like a lot of very driven people, I want to grow and advance in my career. To do that however, I need leverage. In order to get leverage I need to have proof of impact and impact is made by contributions through ideas and achievements. But, if I don’t document any of it, there is no proof and it’s like it never happened. Ideas are never executed and achievements are forgotten.

This leads to two problems; When performance reviews come around, I’ve got nothing to show for it and when it comes to updating my resume, I have nothing to put on it.

Of course, you can advance and progress in your career using simple note-taking apps and this is what I had been using all these years (and I highly recommend anyone to do that). But eventually it became tedious to do consistently.

I had two main problems with my current approach;

\- Capturing ideas and achievements is tedious and it’s just another admin job to stay on top of

\- I can’t see any statistics / insights on my entries (how many ideas/achievements, how often etc.)

So, I’ve built something for myself that fixes both of these pain points.

**What it is**

It’s a desktop app that makes capturing achievements and ideas effortless. Quick capture allows you to save achievements and ideas in less than 10 seconds. Over time it helps you reflect on your progress and most importantly gives you personal data to prepare for performance reviews and building resumes with ease.

Why a desktop app and not a web or mobile one?

One word: friction.

Since it’s desktop based, I can hook into global keyboard shortcuts. That means I can capture an idea or achievement without breaking focus. No browser tabs or bookmarks. No grabbing my phone and ending up on YouTube. All I need to do is hit a shortcut, write down my achievement or idea and press Enter and I’m right back to what I was doing.

**How does it work?**

By using a global keyboard shortcut you can summon a small “quick add” window that floats over whatever app you’re in.

Everything you capture goes into an Inbox. You drop in entries as you go through your day. Later, when you’re ready, you review what’s in there. Add more details, save the useful stuff, delete what’s not.

The flow: Capture > Keep working > Review when it suits you (not when deep in work)

**Current Features**

\- Inbox view (where you capture all of your ideas and achievements)

\- Table view (entire list of all of your entires)

\- Timeline view

\- Exporting to markdown (export all entries to plain text)

\- Insights (total entires by category, total entries by annual/monthly/weekly, graph view for comparison between ideas and achievements)

I didn’t want to lock people into this app, so I made exporting to markdown files. This way you can use this app to easily capture your achieveemnts and ideas but your data is yours to do with what you like. You can export at any point and use it however you like (It’s a great way to import this into Obsidian app for example).

Would love to hear what you think. If this is of interest to you, you can sign up on the website via email to be notified as soon as I officially release it. (I'll post a link to the website in the comments for anybody that's interested).

Think property management/construction/flipping a high rise in the heart of Manhattan business district. I work a disgusting amount of hours for a person who consistently wants to cut costs. It feels like their business model is to work everyone to the bone and get what you can out of them. The role I currently hold is quite prestigious for someone my age 25M. I worked at the bottom job right out of college and ended up here. I see everyone around me on call 24/7 and complaining about WLB. Everyone says I’m young and should tough it out. My ceo does not seem to recognize my efforts as being one of the first in and last out. He even went further to suggest I should be working “24 hours a day 7 days a week”. I was also yelled at for trying to request a summer vacation my whole family already paid for me for. 
I get home at 9pm to eat sleep and repeat the next morning. I am now being asked to come in on weekends and “catch up”. 
I plan to start applying to other jobs today. I took a pto day for myself(still expected to be checking emails and taking calls, as there’s no coverage for my role). My question is am I making a grave decision walking away from this job? The learning experience has been amazing the last 5 months I’ve been here, but I just don’t want this for myself. I don’t even like the city.
I feel like a quitter and a loser. I just want to be able to eat breakfast, maybe work out for an hour a day, or read a book before bed. Things I took for granted I do not have the luxury of doing anymore.

1kkrbt8,Work at a non profit I love but management is worried about enrollment/attendance numbers,"So I'm wondering how concerned I should be. For context I think I have a pretty cool job: I work hybrid at a non profit teaching English to hotel workers. I love the work life balance at my job and it feels like I've had a year to decompress and get my mental health back after working in k-12. The only thing I hate about my job is I would like to be paid slightly more and I dislike my manager because she's insecure and nitpicks. I'm also worried because as a non profit we always struggle with enrollment numbers and this is something management is always concerned about. We have a class goal of getting about 15 students enrolled but one of my classes has 8, one has 3, 3, 3 (the last one actually has fluctuating numbers). Numbers wise--- not great. But the last class like I says comes and goes and is sometimes 8 on a good day. The issue is that if you don't know hotel workers schedules change a lot so they have to pick up extra shifts and sometimes if you don't have seniority you can't be picky. Not only that but only some people seem to have access to these classes through their benefits because some of them don't have days off on the days we have class. I guess I'm just worried I'm going to lost my job because of numbers but I don't know how the problem is in my control. I have really good rapport with students and always reach out when one of them doesn't show up and they always tell me it's either because they are sick or working so it's no ones fault. Furthermore, I actually enjoy the small class sizes as a teacher and wish we could stop obsessing about numbers even though I know we probably rely on certain grants. I'm wondering if this would worry anyone else.

1kkqdsy,Help me with a career change,"
Apologies if you’ve also seen this on r/findapath 

I’m 22 and want to start putting time and effort into building my career, I currently work as an ambulance care assistant doing NEPTS and have been doing this for a year. It’s a job that i’ve enjoyed but due to management and incredibly high staff turnover i’ve grown to hate it and want to get out ASAP. 

The pros to the job are: 
- not having an “office” and being out and about all the time, spending a lot of time in the countryside
- Socialising with lots of different people
- I work 4pm-12am which is literally the perfect shift for me bc i’m more of a night owl 

Cons:
- when it’s bad it is BAD 
- i also start work at 5:30am which is too early for me especially after doing lates for a few weeks 
- it’s a thankless job, 90% of the people are rude and we get the blame for everything that goes wrong on the road. 
- sometimes shifts can run HOURS over. 

Anyway my criteria for my perfect career is this:

- must have an insane amount of variety
- enough socialising throughout the day
- something with consequential work (I get out what I put in) if i go above and beyond I want that to count towards something
- LOTS of progression
- ideally not in the same office all the time 
- option to travel around if i’m really lucky 
- something practical, I don’t want to just input data for 8 hours a day 

I’m open to anything really, I’ve looked into programming jobs, learning a trade, doing an apprenticeship, going back to school if a jobs worth it too.

Please help get me off the ambulances it’s killing me! ",snoopyw00p,2,1.0,0,1747050163,2025-05-12 11:42:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kkqdsy/help_me_with_a_career_change/,5,2025
1kkpgbj,Frontend Dev with 7.5 YOE – Want to Upskill in AI (without going deep into Data Science) + Learning Azure. Could anyone guide me?,"Hi folks,

I’m a frontend developer with 7.5 years of experience, primarily working with React and Vue.js. I’ve been increasingly aware of how AI is shaping the future of development, and I want to upskill in a practical way that benefits my current domain rather than pivoting entirely into data science or ML engineering.

Recently, I’ve started learning Azure (mostly from the DevOps/infrastructure angle), but I also want to start understanding and integrate AI capabilities.

From what I understand, I don’t necessarily need to go deep into data modeling, LLM training, or math-heavy ML theory. Instead, I’m interested in learning about the tools and things that would help me in my work.

Could anyone point me to a good learning path, resources, or courses that are well-suited for frontend devs like me who want to start using AI meaningfully in real-world projects?

What helped you if you’ve taken a similar path?

1kkop6h,About to graduate and feel like I have lost my direction,"I’m graduating from a top university  next week with a degree in English and moving back home to the UK, but I feel completely lost. I’ve always been a good student — worked hard, kept my options open, and followed the advice of people who had my best interests at heart — but now that I’m here, I genuinely don’t know what to do next.

I’ve always been a creative person. I used to dream of working in animation, I still draw in my free time, and singing has been a lifelong passion. People have encouraged me to pursue music more seriously — it’s what makes me happiest — but at the same time, I feel I should be doing something more stable and “realistic.” My parents, who have always wanted the best for me, have had very clear ideas about what counts as a good degree or career. That’s why, when I originally wanted to study art history, I was strongly discouraged. English felt like a compromise, but it hasn’t provided a clear path forward, especially in this job market. I’m still interested in media, but I’m self-taught and don’t have the technical background that most creative internships require. Even unpaid roles feel out of reach, and I constantly feel like I’ve already fallen behind.

I have a master’s in law lined up for next year. I’d like to be good at it — I’d like to feel capable and secure in that path — but I haven’t been able to get any relevant work experience or internships, which has only deepened my doubts. I’m terrified of being a postgrad, especially when I already feel so unsure of myself.

On top of everything, the past few years have been really hard. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety throughout university, and we’ve had death and cancer diagnoses in my family. It’s been difficult to process, and I’ve felt like I’ve been operating in survival mode for months on end. I know I’ve been fortunate in many ways, but right now I feel exhausted, and unsure how to move forward.

Moreover i think literature has more potential as a career , because you can specialize in a lot of fields like cultural diplomacy, teaching, translation, writing publishers etc...

1kkk69n,"I was misled, given mixed messages, and ghosted, so I blocked him on Facebook all for a $21 an hour retail sales job at a furniture store","Two months ago, I was in financial straits and posted a GoFundMe about my situation on a Facebook group I belong to. 

People donated to help me out, which was great.

I received a Facebook message from a group member who said he worked as a furniture salesman at a local furniture store and that they were hiring. 

He asked if I had any direct retail sales experience and I told him that I did but it was older than 10 years. 

I also told him that I had just completed a seven week job training class for Office administration and pass the national sales Federation retail exam as part of that seven week class.

When he first told me about the role, he told me to just apply on the furniture store website and if I got a rejection email from HR to ignore it because he would directly talk to his supervisor about hiring me. 

So I believed him because why not, since he reached out to me, knowing that I was in financial straits, looking for a job.

Well, I applied on the furniture website twice because the first time my application was rejected by HR and I forwarded that rejection to him via email. He wrote back not to pay any attention to it and that he would talk to his supervisor. But he never followed up.

He had an email copy of my résumé, of the national sales Federation certificate from Me, a list of my previous direct retail sales experience from 20 years ago, so there was no stone left unturned.

Anytime I would send him a Facebook message asking him for an update, he would blow me off saying oh it’s my day off or oh I was sick or my supervisor was sick. So I started feeling like I was not a priority for him and wondered why he reached out to me in the first place to tell Me about this job opening and his furniture store if he’s not going to actually follow through with helping me get an interview When he claimed he could.

So I told him tonight via Facebook message that I felt completely misled, disrespected by him for not following through or giving me updates and blowing me off anytime. I asked him for an update. Thanked him for wasting my time and blocked him on Facebook.

If you’re going to reach out to offer, someone help getting a job at your company and then not do anything about it. What’s wrong with you?

1kkj6js,I might quit new job very soon due to mental health. Anyone do the same? Advice?,"Hi team,

I’m close to quitting a new job I started in January. I took the job right after leaving a toxic job in December as a sort of career pivot. 

Well, the pivot is not working out. I am overworking but not getting anywhere, now dealing with severe anxiety (started seeing a therapist just recently), and breaking down after work. 

My manager is okay but is giving super direct feedback and I am messing things up a lot. I’m not catching on as fast as I should be. I was given some training and onboarding but this is all very new to me so am struggling to get into systems very fast and really understand what I’m working on. I’ve asked for help on things but sometimes am told I need to think through things “smarter” or I ask things we’ve already gone over and am called out. I’m kind of losing confidence in myself and have performance anxiety in meetings having a hard time recalling things. 

My manager is making me feel really dumb and I’m having a tough time now going to them for help and questions. 

The job is not something I enjoy and I feel like I am very behind on learning and tackling my tasks. I’m often getting to things late and my manager is getting frustrated with me. I’m trying to work nights and weekends to get through things but it’s taking me a very long time. I’m not used to that. 

I want to work on things together but their style is for me to do the work first then come to them with questions. I feel like an idiot because this is all brand new stuff to me so I kind of don’t know what I don’t know and not sure what questions to ask to get me going. 

I’m to the point of wanting to put in my notice and take a few weeks/ months to reset and job search. I have a decade of experience in a different field that I could fall back on and a bunch of savings. My wife works and is supportive of me doing this if I need to. 

Anyone have any experience with taking a break when you’re going through a career bump?

I’m like breaking down all of the time, getting little sleep, I’m not eating well, kind of losing it over here :/",knewgob,3,1.0,5,1747021686,2025-05-12 03:48:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kkj6js/i_might_quit_new_job_very_soon_due_to_mental/,5,2025

1kkitdj,"I'm walking the stage at graduation, but didn't officially graduate --- starting a full-time construction management job in June","Just wanted to share my situation and hear from others who might’ve been through something similar.

I am walked the stage next week after five years in undergrad in engineering. I’ve completed all of my coursework, passed my classes (including some retakes), and came a long way overall. But I didn’t meet the GPA requirement to officially graduate. I’ll need to retake one or two classes this fall to meet the minimum GPA and have my degree conferred.

Here’s where it gets complicated:  
I accepted a full-time offer last semester with a major construction company after getting offered last summer. The role starts this June, and it’s exactly the kind of job I’ve been working toward. It's literally my dream job and i worked so hard for it. At the time I accepted, I genuinely believed I would be graduating in May. My resume and conversations reflected that.

The company hasn’t asked for my transcript yet, but I know it’s coming in the background check. I’m planning to email them this week and be fully honest — that I walked, completed my coursework, and I’m finishing one GPA-related requirement this fall (online) without it interfering with my full-time work.

My university career advisor has been supporting me through all of this and said he’s willing to vouch for me directly if needed. He has connections with the company and knows my work ethic and growth over the years. The only issue is he’ll be out on vacation soon, so I’m trying to act before he’s unavailable. As of now, I'm focusing on final exams coming and I need a damn near a 98% on every final to get the grade I need. My academic advisor and career advisor told me to let your professors of the situation. I was going approach them after final exam, but before grades are due. For most of my classes, I'm going be 5% percent below the grade i need. Some of the professors, I don't talk to forreal. I was thinking emailing each of them at the end of finals to let them know of the situation as well as attaching my signed offer letter.

On paper, I’ve got good experience: three relevant internships in construction, involvement in construction orgs, and strong alignment with the role. But I can’t shake the fear that this GPA technicality could cost me everything I’ve worked for.

Appreciate any honest advice or stories from people who’ve been in similar situations. Just trying to do the right thing.",Content_Stay_3363,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1747020440,2025-05-12 03:27:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kkitdj/im_walking_the_stage_at_graduation_but_didnt/,5,2025
1kki69a,I got put on a PIP after our GM said there isn’t a need for me,"I am on a PIP for my job (I work at a fortune 50 corporation) and I’m struggling desperately to beat it but I’m starting to feel like it’s hopeless to try.

I am only about 9 months in my role and the first 4 months went by great and then we re-orged and I got a new manager and as soon as I started he told me that I need to “step it up” and that I’m going to be “watched like a hawk.”   Before this point, I considered him to be really cool, he would set up meetings with me and he even bought me a gift from a trip he went on and sent me a Christmas card so I thought this would be a good thing. He admitted that he never managed or worked with a PM before and so I thought it would be a team effort to work together but most of the time he doesn’t really quite know what he is asking for and it frustrates me to no end having to work for a new boss who doesn’t care to learn about my role nor care to give me meaningful work to do.  I think I have a target on my back now as a result of not delivering what he’s asking for - but even he doesn’t have any idea of what he’s asking for bc he doesn’t know what I do. It’s an absolute disaster.  He thinks I’m a glorified note taker who tracks things. He also doesn’t let me make any mistakes, will publicly shame me in front of his boss and basically will do anything to make me look bad and incompetent.

It’s a huge disaster and I need to know how to proceed. I don’t want to burn any bridges but I feel like I already have. 

I’m looking for new roles rn but I obviously can’t be picky, being on a PIP sucks, I feel like I got totally played and my confidence and spirit is at an all time low. Does anybody have any recommendations on what to do?

1kkh6hz,28yo HR Generalist laid off 3 times in 3 years - Need advice,"I graduated with a bachelor’s in Human Resources in December 2019 and started my career in recruiting, working for one of the largest staffing agencies in the U.S. over 2.5 years, earning two promotions. Unfortunately, in early 2023, I was laid off with 60 others when our client contract ended. I loved that job and was devastated.

Shortly after, I joined a startup through a family connection. I handled recruiting and some HR work, but it quickly became clear the company was problematic. I later learned several C-level executives had served prison time for financial crimes. Once it was discovered that employees knew, several of us were let go. Some colleagues threatened to out the company to clients but I did not. I did report them to authorities though due to suspicions this was continuing to happen. I personally faced some EEOC violations with the company and contemplated suing.

After two layoffs in two years, I pursued a more stable HR generalist role. Landed at a well-known, reputable company in the auto industry. I was b-r-u-t-a-l-l-y transparent about needing mentorship and how green I was. I was promised training and support. Unfortunately, that never materialized. My manager was overwhelmed, and I was left to learn from a colleague who was barely more experienced than I was. I received poor guidance and was often on my own.

Now, I am left managing 120 employees across four facilities due to the colleague quitting. I overseeing payroll, benefits, employee relations, apprenticeships, investigations, and much, much more — with only about 1.5 years of true HR experience. I voiced concerns but was met with regret from leadership about hiring someone “too green.” Recently, after an error on my part due to lack of support, the company moved quickly to bring in new hires who I suspect are meant to replace me in the next few weeks.

If I’m let go, this will be my third layoff in three years. I feel completely burned out and am wondering: Is this what HR is supposed to be? Am I just not cut out for it? One of the people they made an offer to is 3 years younger than I am, getting a higher title than me and has been in a generalist role for only 9 months longer than me. Even with 12-hour days, I can’t keep up. I don’t want to work 12 hour days every day. I value work life balance. How do other professionals younger than me seem to be able to do a better job than I am? I’m considering leaving the profession but unsure where to go — especially with the financial stability HR has offered.

Is this normal?? How many hours a day is normal? How many people should I reasonably be over seeing? Do people in HR just love their job so much everyone is able to and wants to not have work life balance except me?

If you’ve left HR, what did you transition into? What has been your experience in HR? Do I just need to keep trying?

I thought I would love HR- processes, policies, procedures - black and white. But I’m learning, it is a lot more grey. My work & dedication never seems to be enough.",ExtremeFluffy4062,3,0.8100000023841858,3,1747015022,2025-05-12 01:57:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kkh6hz/28yo_hr_generalist_laid_off_3_times_in_3_years/,5,2025

30F and I work in higher education, same kind of department but 2 different employers. Was at one school for almost 2 yrs and my current school for ~ 8 months. At my current job, I was trained by myself with the manager and she told the team when I was first introduced that I’m a quick learner etc. On my old team (before everyone moved to different supervisors), the supervisor acknowledged when I reached milestones to the whole team like clearing students/making it past 3 month probation etc (what they do for everyone). But in the staff meetings when they want to shout out staff for random things, I’m never brought up. Random things like when someone brings up an idea, covers someone, motivates them to do the walking challenge etc. Yet my supervisor individually gives me a pat on the back for my metrics exceeding or mgrs calling me suggesting I should consider applying for the supervisor role. The attention I get always seems to be more private vs the public attention everyone else seems to get, I’m sure those same ppl get private praise too. Is it bc I’m quiet? They haven’t made it seem like it’s a problem. I just always feel like I’m invisible, this job is more “for the people” vs my last job. Better company culture here/more “attention” but mgmt used to suggest I was good/should work in leadership at my last job too.

1kkg9gj,LSE MISDI vs Imperial IEM – which one actually helps you land a job in the UK (consulting/tech)?,"Hey folks
I’m an international student trying to choose between two master’s programs in London and I’m seriously stuck. Hoping someone here can help me out or share any firsthand experiences

MSc Innovation, Entrepreneurship & Management at Imperial College Business School
MSc Management of Information Systems and Digital Innovation at LSE

My background
Studied Business Management
Internships in AI, UX, data strategy
Want to stay in the UK after graduation (Tier 2 visa)
Dream roles are in consulting like Deloitte or Accenture, or digital strategy, fintech and tech product roles

What I care about
Getting a job in the UK
Career support that actually helps internationals
Practical hands-on learning
Strong recruiter and alumni network
A degree that opens doors in consulting and tech

What I’ve gathered so far
LSE MISDI sounds more academic but strong for consulting and has a big-name brand
Imperial IEM is more practical and seems better for innovation startups and tech but maybe not as known for traditional consulting
Not sure which one actually makes job hunting easier though

Has anyone done either program or know people who have
How helpful were they in getting into good jobs especially as a non-UK citizen
Would love some real talk — what would you choose and why

Thanks a ton

1kkf7qd,"I’m 28, starting over in the US. Struggling with career choice—any guidance?","Hi, good afternoon. I was hoping you could help me out because honestly, I’m feeling really lost in life, and it’s starting to get frustrating.

I’m 28 and moved to the U.S. almost three years ago, so I’m basically still starting over. I work in the hospitality industry as a front desk agent and have a degree in it, but lately, I feel like I’m just drowning. I’m living paycheck to paycheck, and it's taking a toll.

I’ve been thinking about switching careers quickly, even if I figure out the rest later, but I’m unsure which path to take.

Right now, I’m torn between Massage Therapy and something in Computer Science or IT. Here's what's stopping me from choosing:

1. Massage Therapy
The program takes around 8 to 12 months. Most options are Monday to Friday, and since I work full time, I’d have to significantly lower my cost of living/working hours just to get through it—which is already hard, especially living in LA.
But once I’m done, I could become a massage therapist and likely earn more than I do now.

2. Computer Science/IT
My plan is to get a Google certificate and try to land an entry-level IT job, then work while studying at WGU. This path seems more stable long-term, but it’ll take a while. Entry-level IT jobs often pay less than what I currently make ($25/hr), maybe around $19–20/hr. That’s a tough hit, especially in LA. Plus, the field feels super saturated, and I’m not even sure I could land an entry-level job right away. That part really worries me.

Any suggestions, advice, or insight would honestly mean a lot. Thank you so much!",Cute_Tumbleweed3752,7,1.0,7,1747008675,2025-05-12 00:11:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kkf7qd/im_28_starting_over_in_the_us_struggling_with/,5,2025
1kkemv7,PAP then a PIP? Should I leave?,"Hi all! Started a call center gig back in November of 2024. Training was 4 weeks class and 1 week nesting calls, then on our own. We had limited availability to ask questions to supervisors, but rather refer to articles for help plus a help line if needed, or put it in a group chat.

Anyway, first 3 months I had the best scores of our hiring class. Best AHT, limited ACW and 98% schedule adherence (91% is acceptable). NPS and CSAT fluctuated but passed for the most part. I fielded 600+ calls per month approximately. In February, I was told I was 3 months ahead of the typical ""new hire"" and was fast tracked for possible growth. I applied the feedback to get the CSAT and NPS up (more empathy, slow down calls, don't tell them no, put customer on told and ""pretend"" you're researching even if you know the answer right away, etc)  but scores still fluctuate, but still good stats. A new hire class just graduated nesting.

Last week, starting May 1st, metrics changed for the 5th time since November (NPS and AHT are now scored less and CSAT, Adherence and First call resolution are now priorities), and I was told I'd be on a 2 week ""position action plan"" - or a pre-PIP, and it's due to schedule adherence being at 82% now (even though I wasn't doing anything different and staying on que) and CSAT was a 2. Low scores are due to the insurance company's policies and nothing I can control.

Anyway, I asked for further explanation about the discrepancies and waiting to hear back. The constant metrics changes are so confusing and hard to get a groove down.

Should I just leave this job?

1kkdphn,"Burned Out Nonprofit Leader— What High-Paying, Low-Drama Careers Should I Look At?","35M in Seattle. I’ve spent my entire career in small nonprofits, most recently in fundraising roles. I have an MSW and 8 years of senior organizational leadership and supervision experience. As a fundraiser I brought in over $9M in capital funding during the span of 15 months to renovate a homeless shelter, and last year I increased my old organization’s operating budget by 20%.

After 8 years at my old gig I recently left for another org. I’m one month in and it’s the most toxic place I’ve ever worked, which is saying a lot. The person in my role before me rage quit by sending a 10-page letter to the entire org about my boss's misconduct and micromanagement, which I learned about AFTER accepting the job. I also negotiated a PTO increase that my boss is now trying to reneg on, despite having it in writing in my offer letter.

I’m one bad day away from rage quitting and looking to make a pivot ASAP. I’m hoping to leave behind nonprofits altogether. What I want is better pay (at least $125k), a less toxic work environment, and more work-life balance and time off. Bonus points if it’s partially or entirely remote and there are opportunities for advancement.

Any suggestions? I’d love input on what I might be a good fit for and what immediate next steps I can take to make it happen.

Since I’ve been in nonprofits my whole career, I’m unfamiliar with what roles outside the sector might be a good match for my skill set. I honestly DGAF what I’m doing as long as it pays well, doesn’t leave me drained, and gives me space to pursue other passions. Some things I’m good at are:

* **Fundraising & Grant Writing:** Secured over $9M in public/private funding, including multi-year government and foundation grants.
* **Leadership:** Substantial experience supervising teams, building systems, managing budgets, and leading strategic planning efforts.
* **Communications:** Several years experience developing compelling messaging and drafting newsletters, appeals, branding efforts, and social media. Demonstrated success at growing subscriber bases and engagement.
* **Relationship Management:** Built and maintained partnerships with donors, foundations, businesses, and elected officials.
* **Training & Public Speaking:** Facilitated large-scale volunteer training programs and frequently spoke at events.
* **Tech & Data Savvy:** Managed multiple CRMs, newsletter tools, websites, and donation platforms. Personally manage a Linux server, NAS, and smart home setup.

What is my best path forward for leveraging all of this and moving into a more chill career with better pay that I can tolerate?

I know CRE and finance are super competitive but I know that I have the skills and general understanding of CRE to excel in this job as part of a team. Anyone has broken into NY CRE finance/brokerage and care to share how they did it?

Unfortunately I saw him out that night and I thought it was my chance. I came onto him and told him to kiss me and everything. I did all of this in front of his friends. He was completely normal and obviously told me to go away and wanted to ring my parents etc to take me home. Anyway I now have a prospective job offer where I may have to engage with this man again. I won’t see him often if at all but the thoughts of having to work with him professionally after what I did puts me off this job even though I really need and want the job. Basically my question is what do I do? I’ve seen him since in the local area and he doesn’t seem to take any notice of me etc which makes me hopeful that he forgot my face and the incident.

1kka2e2,Feeling stuck between staying stable or walking away to build something real—what would you do?,"I’m 30, currently working a full-time corporate job as a tech contractor. It pays $65k/year and is technically a step up from my last role, but truthfully—it already feels like I’m just showing up for the check. The job’s not terrible, and the pay is steady, but it’s not fulfilling. I know deep down it’s not where I want to be long term.

I’ve got low monthly expenses, no major debt, and have been saving steadily. Outside of work, I’ve been slowly building something of my own that has solid earning potential if I give it more time and energy. Right now though, I feel like I’m stuck in survival mode—burning the best hours of my day on something that doesn’t light me up.

So here’s where I’m stuck:
	•	Do I ride this job out for the year, stack more cash, and keep building my thing on the side until it’s ready?
	•	Or do I pivot to a lower-stress job that frees up more time and headspace—even if it pays less—so I can go all-in sooner and move faster?

1kk9rag,"How to Lie on your Resume, and get away with it","If you pretend to have worked for a staffing company, employment verifiers will check the staffing company and NOT the employer stated on your resume. This is normal, no one thinks anything strange about it. You use that by redirecting the verification to a legitimate staffing company that you control (or one that you’ve paid to cover for you), and then you can get yourself verified. This happens all the time, especially in IT but also some other fields such as finance. 

The only issue is that you need to make the staffing company appear legitimate (phone tree, website, business license, etc) but that is all doable by yourself. I did it myself after all.

And before people lecture us about ethics (those poor, poor recruiters!), I'd say that different rules apply for business and personal life. Lying to an employer is not the same as lying to your spouse.

Here’s more about how this would work in practice:

1kk5vsi,"Left a job after being put on a PIP — did I burn a bridge, or is this just how it goes?","I'm in my late 20s and recently left a job after being put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). I’m reflecting on the experience and wondering if I handled it poorly or if the outcome was somewhat inevitable.

I was with the company for about 15 months. The first 6–7 months went well — I had a trainer who supported me, and things were progressing smoothly. Then I got reassigned to a new trainer, and that’s when things shifted. She spent a lot of time sharing personal stories unrelated to work (family, daughter’s school issues, etc.), which made training less focused and honestly drained my energy.

I was still technically in training and hadn’t been signed off on anything official. I was also working only off a laptop while requesting a proper monitor, which didn’t help productivity.

At around the 14-month mark, I was placed on a PIP and given four weeks to turn things around. I asked to switch trainers, but that wasn’t approved. Later I found out the trainer had told another colleague (and apparently my manager) that I sounded “defensive” in emails. When I asked her about it directly, she denied it and changed the subject.

One week into the PIP, I decided to resign. I brought my stuff into the office on a Monday, gave notice, and told my manager I understood the message in his PIP email “loud and clear.” He said he felt blindsided and asked me to sleep on it, but I had already made up my mind.

Since then, several coworkers have removed me from LinkedIn, and while my ex-manager is still connected, he didn’t acknowledge my recent post about landing a job at a major bank — even though I’ve seen him congratulate others in similar situations.

**My question: did I burn a bridge by resigning the way I did, or is this just a normal reaction from a manager/team when someone leaves under a PIP?

When it hit its first hurdle, he jumped ship and threw me under the bus. It went through many hurdles and each time the bus was ran over me, but in the end that is the system we use to this day.

I discussed it with my co worker and he was in agreement. So I talked with my supervisor and he stated that he thought it was a good idea as well.

(After two days of them working, the job still  isn’t done and will require them coming back later this month to work on it again.)

1kk4ob2,Toxic boss help advice needed,"So i work as a manager/shiftlead at a carls jr i have worked here for 4 years and been a shiftlead for one. for the first time in my life im looked up to and appreciated and cared about by the crew members. Crew all says im their favorite im the type of manager that will have a nice convo with crew, get to know each of them personally and even become friends with them i view them as my family. we are all extremley close to the point most of us hangout outside of work too. we buy eachothers coffees and stuff, just like a bunch of best friends working together. As long as the bassics get done and we can all clock out at a decent time and drive times are good, evrrythings cleaned and stocked up i could care less what they do and talk about. were all laid back and super chill. 

My boss on the other hand.. 
1. he isnt paying alot of the crew minimum wage. they are paid 16.28 minimum wage in my state and county is 16.66

2. he was dating one of the crew members and cut her hours when she broke it off

3. he holds hours over our heads. example: if we call out sick we get our hours cut. car breaks down? Hours cut. One minute late: Hours cut. forget one thing during closing? hours cut. saying your tired when you come into work? hours cut. talk about write ups, pay, raises, things you dont like, things that bothers you, conversations hes had with you, how morning crew never does anything for night? HOURS CUT CUT CUT CUT CUT

4. he protects toxic crew members. one crew member is constantly harassing my girls some being minors. he bosses them around and hovers over them, gives them his phone number and is all flirty  which 4 of the girls told me they were uncomfortable and didnt feel safe working with him. 

5. we cannot contact him in case of emergencies. fire alarms going off? no answer, new opening manager cant open the store for 4 hours? no answer owners called tryinf to reach him? no answer ect.

6. he flirts with and only hires females often times. he also only hires bassed off looks vs experience. he will admit to us managers he didnt hire someone because they werent ""hot"" or ""cute"" or whatever  it is

7. he abuses his power. he will yell at us managers and looks down on us. me and the other closer manager were told yesterday we arent trusted to close the store and that hws having morning people stay later to ""keep an eye on us"" ..but theyre crew members..

8. he tells morning crew to not listen to us closing managers we have morming crew who bosses around night and tries to run our shifts even though we are the managers. 

9. he promises us raises but will not give then to us i am making 17.05/hr other managers are making between 18.05 and 18.75 with the highest paid manager being a blonde female he flirts with making 19.75/hr

10. boss writes people up without proper reasoning nor does he tell us how to fix it. for example, i was written up 2 days ago for ""not following standards"" i asked him ""What are the exact things i am not following what are some examples on where i wasnt following them"" He kept beeing super blunt about it and said ""oh just bassic stuff we talked about before just make sure you're doing things by the book"" but would NOT tell me the EXACT  reasons. 

11. he tells us we cannot talk between eachother about write ups BUT he does tell us when and who someone else got a write up even though hes asked not to. he can talk about them between other crew and managers but we cannot talk about it between eachother when its about us. he threatens to demote and fire us

12. he drinks. ALOT. he goes on drunk rants to us flirts with us and says we cant talk to anyone about it or we will be fired

anyways yesterday as i got there 10 minutes early i go and i put my stuff on the back per usual.  brought my fellow manager a coffee aswell, super positive great mood. boss comes up to me and yells at me ""PUT YOUR STUFF IN THE BACK WHERE IT GOES"" i say okay and i do. then he says ""PUT UR PHONE ON UR BAG TOO. U KNOW BETTER."" ...i do even though i have 10min  before i have to clock in. then he says ""NOW GO TIL U CLOCK IN"".  i go outside for a minute to breathe not knowing the time. i come back inside and stand by the clock in tablet. boss says again yelling at me ""WHY ARE YOU STANDING THERE YOU HAVE 4 MINUTES GO UNTIL YOU CLOCK IN I ALREADY TOLD YOU THIS"". ..i didnt have my phone so i didnt know what time it was

i finally clock in and he hovers over me for a hour telling me im doing everything wrong. he leaves finally then he calls the store, again yelling at me. 

""NO MUSIC AGAIN EVER. IF YOU ASK OR PLAY IT YOU'RE FIRED (he was playing music as i walked in)

hes gona be getting access to cameras to watch us 247 again. 

no calling anyone in even if someone else calls out even if its a closer

nobody stays later nobody switches shifts

everyone has set hours now and mine are cut so bassicly ur fired if u call out once

""we aren't as sneaky as we think and we need to stop that stuff immedently"""" whatever that means 

please help idk what to do anymore i feel like such a failure whom can't do anything right i had a mental breakdown at work after that yesterday  and left early yesterday had my grandpa call and make up some fake family emergency idk if i can go in today or ever.. i think i should just quit",ZaraSoulzAJ,1,1.0,1,1746980087,2025-05-11 16:14:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kk4ob2/toxic_boss_help_advice_needed/,5,2025

I'm looking for advice on how to strengthen my profile to break into MBB or private equity, especially given some weaknesses in my academic background.

- 5 years of experience as a financial controller in the banking sector
- Active in extracurriculars: Enactus, a mental health association, and other project-based student initiatives
- GMAT: 700

Considering applying for a top master’s program or MBA to pivot into strategy consulting or PE

Given my relatively low GPA and non-target school background, what stepsf can I take to stand out?
Also, would MBB even consider someone from my background?

1kk0ngo,23Y/O(M) with a science background and Graduate apprenticeship in Defense sector — feeling stuck & Confused about what to do next ?,"Hello 👋 everyone, I'm a 23-year-old from India, looking for some clarity and direction in my career although I did posted in other subreddits too I didn't really get much help there so trying my luck here now 🤞
I’ve completed a Bachelor’s in Science (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics) and have a PG Diploma in Environmental Management. Right now, I’m close to Completing my 12-month Graduate Apprenticeship at one of the Indian Ordnance Factories, which manufacture arms and ammunition for defense and have been around from 1800s.

During this apprenticeship, I’ve gained hands-on experience in:

*Safety protocols in hazardous/explosive zones and Current Safety Standards

*Quality assurance and ISO standards

*Data management and Office administration

*Environmental compliance (EIA, EMS, etc.)

*In Export related Documentation and basic procedures too as i was fortunate enough that quite big export orders from different countries's firms came in, during my Tenure which helped in enhancing my experience further 

Exposure to this industry has sparked my interest in defense production, safety, and environmental quality assurance — but I’m still unsure how to build a sustainable career in this domain or field related to it.

I don’t currently hold any major certifications outside of my PG diploma, and I’m trying to figure out:

*What career paths align with my profile?

*Which skills or certifications should I pursue next?

*Is it better to go into government PSUs, private sector, National or Internationally (Though this one will be even harder I know) or consider further studies?

Any advice, insights, or suggestions from people in similar fields would really mean a lot right now & again this is not an advertisement or for hiring but a sincere ask for advice.

I've always been drawn to the medical field, even worked as a nursing assistant for a few years. I originally wanted to be a nurse but somehow stumbled into teaching. 

For the last 5 years, I've been thinking about going back to work in healthcare. I really want to work in medical imaging, starting off in x-ray, then eventually CT or MRI (or both).

The problem is, there are no radiology programs near me that aren't daytime only options. Classes and clinicals are M-F between 8am and 6pm. I can't quit my job and go to school. 

However, there is an LPN program that has a nights/weekends option that I could manage. And it's only 3 semesters. If I become a nurse first, then the pay and flexible scheduling could allow me to pursue radiology in a few years. 

Tl;dr.....I am a currently a teacher and want to switch careers to work in radiology but my current schedule doesn't allow it.

1kk05db,Feeling lost in job search,"Buckle in, I am verbose.

For context: I am 28m, live in massachusetts, and have been in retail my entire working life (12 years). I have a high school diploma, and have only completed 3 semesters of college (which I don't bother adding to my resume) I have done big box, independent small business, and most recently I have been in the cannabis industry for 5 years working my way from entry level to management. I have grown to loathe the cannabis industry for a number of reasons, mostly the company I work for, though the team I have is great and I wouldnt be where I am now without my direct supervisor. 

Seeing that there is no room for me to move up where I am and I do not feel respected and acknowledged for the work I do, I have started casually applying for jobs. The issue I am currently having is (a) that I desperately want to change industries, (b) I am not really interested in continuing with retail at all, unless it was a position where I am not dealing with customers face to face or running a register myself, i.e. district manager, inventory manager, or the pay was really worth it (I currently make \~$55k). And (c) all of my applications have been rejected or ignored completely and I am beginning to feel like working in cannabis has tainted my resume and is preventing me from finding work outside of that, though I may be overthinking it.

I do feel like part of it is a me problem, because I am being very picky about the jobs I apply to. I am not looking to start over and build myself up from entry level again, unless the entry level position matches my current salary. I am also concerned that my experience is not enough to outweigh degree requirements in the fields I am interested in. I guess what Im asking for is reassurance, advice on where to begin, or careers that I may have missed that are more niche and are willing to train someone who may not have a degree but is incredibly dedicated.

Here is what I have on my resume in the job duties for my two most recent positions:

**Assistant Manager**

* Assist in the development and implementation of KPI’s for a team of 12, contributing to an overall increase in productivity and employee satisfaction, indicated by a 10% boost in annual performance evaluation scores across the board, and a reduction in employee turnover
* Collaborating with the executive team to boost sales and increase customer retention through marketing initiatives and industry analysis, leading to a 22% increase in profits in 2023 and a decrease in wasteful spending in 2024
* Maintaining meticulous organization of all files and logs, security systems, and facility servicing in accordance with state regulations; including spearheading a complete overhaul of personnel and inventory record keeping to reduce time spent on auditing these systems
* Execute essential managerial functions in hiring, onboarding, training, scheduling, coaching, and disciplinary action; as well as orchestrating and administering quarterly all-staff meetings with a focus on employee engagement 
* Contributed to weekly meetings with store leadership, affiliated facilities and administration to communicate needs, challenges, and directives; leading to policy updates, key product procurement, and ensuring advocacy for my team
* Instilling and fostering a culture of exceptional customer service through hands-on modeling, coaching, training and recognition; including the employee of the quarter program, sales and review incentives, team building exercises, and monthly one on one’s. This resulted in a yearly review surge of 46%, with an average increase of 52.5% total 5 star reviews from 2022 through 2024.
* Facilitated opportunities for professional development and career growth for members of my staff, including the internal promotion of 6 team members in 2 years.

**Inventory Manager**

* Receiving, processing, and stocking weekly deliveries of between 20 and 300 individual packages from the vertically integrated cultivation/production facility and a number of rotating wholesale vendors; ensuring product reached the sales floor within 6 hours of a delivery
* Maintaining accurate, complete, and easy-to-navigate records of all manifests, product transfers, and monthly inventory audits to facilitate diligent compliance with regulations and stringent internal policies
* Executing the development of inventory SOP’s and training documents during the company’s transition from Software A to Software B in 2022 in coordination with the compliance department and retail director, resulting in minimal disruption to inventory management and daily operation during this period
* Direction of more than 48 comprehensive monthly inventory audits to exceed all state regulatory requirements, identified and addressed all discrepancies, and oversaw agent retraining as necessary to reduce loss and waste

Here is a list of things I am interested in but have yet to find: (Feel free to let me know if any/all are unattainable with my experience or background, or if you have any suggestions that fit the vibe I am going for)

\-Museum

\-Zoo

\-Forestry, parks, conservation

\-Secondary or higher education

\-Science/lab/research

\-Government

\-Jobs that require travel but are not sales

\-Retail district/area/regional/inventory manager or director position

I have a feeling they are going to say I need to get certain qualifications before I will get the pay raise. And that's a longer story about a bias against me from the training person.

I’m currently 21. Just finishing my MA. Been job hunting since my second year of undergrad. I have been able to get interviews, I’ve had maybe 10? I managed to get an offer from two marketing ones but they turned out to be pyramid schemes… self employed . Putting in more money than you’re getting out..
I do have experience, I worked for a year and 8 months  as ambassador in my undergraduate, then briefly did some ambassador work in my postgrad. 
I’ve volunteered when I was younger too. I’ve tried a recruitment agency but it’s like me just having a name down. 
Latest job opportunity was great, got to the final interview, did some tasks just to be told someone with 10 years more experience than me got the job… 

Tried LinkedIn, my resume would be downloaded, even been contacted, phone calls then ghosted. 
I’ve tried direct company sites too.
Please, does anyone know any jobs and creative jobs with decent pay, based either London, Birmingham or West Midlands, I don’t have a license (another issue I’ve dealt with but I can’t exactly drive if I don’t have said money to drive..) that are hiring, I’m literally available immediately.

1kjytwq,"2nd year BTech done, don’t want to go back — how to break into AI/ML fast","Hey everyone,

 

I’m a 19-year-old engineering student (just finished 2nd year), and I’ve reached a point where I really don’t want to go back to university.

 

The only way I’ll be allowed to take a 1 year break from uni is if I can show that I’m working on something real — ideally a role or internship in AI/ML. So I have 3 months to make this work. I’ve been going in circles, and I could really use some guidance.

 

I’m looking for a rough roadmap or some honest direction:

 

1. What should I study?

2. Where should I study it from?

3. What projects should I build to be taken seriously?

4. And most importantly, how would you break into AI/ML if you were in my exact position?

I just want clarity and structure.

 

Some background:

1. Been coding in Java for 5+ years, explored spring boot for a while but not very excited by it anymore

2. Shifting my focus to Python + AI/ML

 

At uni ive Done courses in DBMS, ML, Linear Algebra, Optimization, and Data Science

 

I wont say that im a beginner, but im not very confident about my path

 

Some of my projects so far:

1. Seizure detection model using RFs on raw EEG data (temporal analysis, pre/post-ictal window) = my main focus was to be more explainable compared to the SOTA neural networks.(hitting 91%acc atm- still working on it)

2. “Leetcode for consultants” — platform where users solve real-life case study problems and get AI-generated feedback

3. Currently working with my state’s transport research team on some data analysis tasks.

 

I just want to work on real-life projects, learn the right things, and build experience. I'm done with “just studying” — I want to create value and learn on the job.

 

If you’ve ever been in this position — or you’ve successfully made the leap into AI/ML — I’d love to hear:

 

1. What would your 3-month roadmap look like in my shoes?

2. What kind of projects matter?

3. Which resources helped you actually get good, not just watch videos?

  
Are my goal realistic?

I’m open to harsh feedback, criticism, or reality checks. I just want direction and truth, not comfort.

1kjxf9e,Nonlinear Path: Paramedic or Social Work Before Grad School or a Second Undergrad?,"Hi everyone,

I’m finishing up my undergrad in Psychology and Communication, and my long-term dream is to teach and do research—especially in areas like qualitative psychology, cognition, and mental health. I’ve already done some research during undergrad, and it confirmed that I genuinely enjoy digging into ideas, working with participants, and contributing to knowledge.

Lately, though, I’ve been thinking about starting with something more hands-on, like paramedicine or social work. I want real exposure to people in crisis—not just from books or data. I feel like working on the front lines would give me the insight and experience I need to become a better educator and researcher later. And honestly, I think I’d do well in those fields and be able to earn a reasonable living while doing something meaningful.

At one point, I considered law school too. I’ll be honest—I was partly drawn to the prestige and the idea of being able to afford things for myself and my family. I grew up in a difficult home environment, and financial and emotional instability have been ongoing. I’ve always had to stay on my toes just to survive, and it’s made it hard to focus fully on school. The idea of a stable, well-paying career is appealing. But I’m also scared of taking on that much debt, only to realize I might not have the drive to grind through the kind of hustle law often demands. I think I have the critical thinking and empathy to be a good lawyer—but I’m not sure I’d thrive in that world.

I’ve also seriously considered medical school—especially surgery—for as long as I can remember. It’s always been my dream. I initially tried to pursue the science prerequisites and attain a high gpa, but due to instability at home and the emotional toll of my environment, I wasn’t in a place to follow through. That said, I do believe I have the aptitude for learning and the discipline to succeed, especially when I’m in a stable, supportive environment. I’m someone who thrives when I can focus fully, and I’ve always had a strong drive to understand complex systems—whether psychological or biological.

I also have a natural aptitude for physical work and staying calm under pressure, which is why paramedicine appeals to me. It could allow me to support myself, develop maturity, and get real-world experience helping people in crisis. Social work too, would give me a grounded understanding of human need and systemic care.

If I were to go into one of these fields first, I think it would help me grow—not just professionally, but personally—so that when and if I decide to pursue that accelerated second undergrad for med school, I’d do so with clarity, confidence, and readiness. I want to give that dream a real shot, but only once I know I’m in the right place in life to commit fully with the confidence to work to have a realistic shot in medical school, along with the grounding and maturity that come with age and lived experience.

So right now, I’m asking:

Is it realistic to work in social work or paramedicine and eventually pursue graduate studies in psychology?

Has anyone started in frontline care and then transitioned into academic or research work?

Would it make sense to do a master’s part-time while working, or work first, then go back to school?

If you’ve navigated anything like this—or have advice—I’d be grateful to hear your thoughts. Thank you for reading. 

And for those who’ve done something similar—does it make sense to circle back to a second undergrad (for med school prerequisites) later on, when I’m in a more stable environment, with greater maturity and clarity, and shaped by real-world experience in service work?

1kjwgku,Promotion- I’m uneasy about,"Hello everyone, I need some advice. My boss approached me on Friday, she was wondering if I would become the 2nd clinical specialist for Neurosurgery.

  I’ll give you some background, I’ve worked at this specific hospital for 6 years, and been working with Neurosurgeon for 3 1/2 years. The reason, they need a second clinical specialist is because the 1st does “just enough not to get fired”. So for the past 3 1/2 year I’ve been picking up the slack and not getting the benefits. I know most people might think this is crazy, but doing this makes sure that patients get the care that they need. 

The issues I’ve run into are the following. The team that I work with now I’ve become very attached to, they are my family. Secondly, I have a feeling that the 1st specialist won’t relinquish the benefits they enjoy so easily and I’ll get screwed over to some extent. Thirdly my work schedule at the moment is the opposite of what it would be, so I’ll be a massive mess until my body adjusts. Lastly I’m just a nervous wreck, thus I’ll take any and all the advice you can offer. 

Thank you for all your help and Happy Mother’s Day to all the moms. ",Neurosurg-Tech,1,1.0,3,1746953095,2025-05-11 08:44:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kjwgku/promotion_im_uneasy_about/,5,2025

May 5 at 10:35 AM 
Hi Director of Professional Development Program, 

Good morning. Hope you had a great weekend. Yeah, I will also add to this that my post office and carrier are a particular problem as well, for MONTHS. I am lucky I got the first two checks on time. But there has been an ongoing issue with delivery, receiving the previous tenant's (before me) and his family's mail, and even mail that belongs to a completely different address but same apt number altogether. 

Also, the mail lady also putting let's say my neighbor's mail in my mailbox. I don't know what is going on with my postal code office but I made a service request this morning because I had enough that it had to affect this missing check now. I will try to be patient about this. 

I have no problems going to the office to pick up the remaining checks. Only possible issue is when (what day) to pick it up and how soon I can get to the office. I don't know when the office closes, and it will probably result in leaving a class early. I will keep you posted.

NO RESPONSE FROM THIS EMAIL ABOVE

May 8 at 8:15 AM
Hi Director of Professional Development Program, 

Good morning. Still have not received the check. Don’t think I will. Would have received it already. Checked “the pile” everyday/evening, nothing. My neighbors would have gave me my mail if they had it. Financially struggling. 

They (USPS) dismissed my original service request. I reopened it and opened 2-3 more service requests just now. They might just close those or call me, telling me the same BS. Will also write a BBB complaint. This is ridiculous, the whole mail problem with my whole building (not just this check although them losing this check set me off). The post lady always comes late to deliver the mail/packages (as late as 8 PM at times). I won’t be in my building after class ends today & tomorrow. So I don’t think there is no further point of waiting on this. 

I mentioned this to my Team Lead on Tuesday but I have a “Known” Bank account (your checks are from the same bank). I don’t know your Finance Department can do a direct deposit with me. 

THEY RESPOND AT THIS TIME: 
May 8 6:56 PM - WAY OVER EOD from Director

“Kashpny02:

Thank you for your detailed follow-up about this. Unfortunately, our professional development program does not offer direct deposit for client payments. I will let Finance know that the amount needs to be reissued for you. Check for you going forward will be held at the professional development program for you to collect in person, to ensure you receive the funds.”

END OF CONVERSATION FOR NOW and doesn’t say next steps on when to pick up checks. 

This is a non-profit for survivors anonymous but I don’t think they treat that with seriousness as they claim. They supposedly “teach” you how to be professional in the workplace yet I have had issues with their hypocrisy. We are put into groups 1,2,3. Group 3 is the advanced group. They wanted me to “fast track” the program, which is different from group 3 but I think that’s a lie (they don’t explain anything well; perhaps on purpose) as they put me in group 2. I said no to the fast track only because they said in the beginning they don’t want students to choose their groups, yet they ask me this & get me all confused. The point why I am in this program is to slowly work on myself professionally. Yet knowing all about me, they purposely put me in this mid-way group & can just easily put in group 3 from the beginning. One of the classes they have me in is like an ESL class when I am a native English speaker. I didn’t have a problem with this until the teacher stopped calling on me & such. They acknowledged I am “advanced” in that. I asked for an alternative only with that & they have yet to have a meeting with me on this. 

They (the director & assistant director) ridiculed me when I told them when I had a negative encounter about my “suit day” experience and when wanted to make an exchange because it was rushed & didn’t fit me properly (they bought me a blazer, shirt & pants). They “gave me” a week to decide “whether I was a fit for this program or not”, even though I said if I wanted to leave, I wouldn’t have this conversation with them. 

Then my team leader insulted where I live the first time I met her, and then wants me to make all decisions about my career path when she is supposed to guide me. Also, when they ask me something to do something that I don’t feel comfortable with that is not required of me like my upcoming graduation speech, they say “no pressure” and give me time to decide, yet a day later, they say I have to do XYZ and when I said again no in a way, they say they will have me as a backup plan but I already know they will tell me that person somehow can’t do the speech. Now this with my money. 

Seems like they only care about their investors/sponsors/donors than their actual clients and they act like a cult too. Threw some incentives in order to get me in this program like the money that I now regret. I’m only 3 weeks from completing this PART of the program. They didn’t disclose until recently I would be really in this for about a year. I’m really indecisive about this. I suffer from anxiety disorder. 

How do I approach the checks & should I stay or go? This is obviously burning me out too.

1kjw2oh,Opportunity to lead a high visibility project that can benefit the entire organization.,"I’ve been with my organization for just a year and was promoted within the first few months, despite having no prior management experience. My background is in a related field, and while I’ve led small team-based process improvements successfully, I’ve never managed a large-scale, high-visibility project.

Due to ongoing layoffs and leadership turnover, I’ve been asked to join more and more initiatives. I’ve said yes out of fear of being seen as replaceable and started therapy to work on my people-pleasing tendencies. Most recently, I agreed to lead a major project that could impact the entire organization—without considering my capacity or experience.

Now the reality is hitting me: I struggle with public speaking, lack formal project management skills, and have no mentor or support. Meanwhile, I’m stretched thin trying to develop my team, meet leadership expectations, and avoid burnout.

With the company in a state of constant change and downsizing, is it risky to step back from these projects? And if I move forward, how can I lead this initiative with confidence and clarity despite my inexperience and limited resources?",Competitive_Ease5651,2,1.0,0,1746951421,2025-05-11 08:17:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kjw2oh/opportunity_to_lead_a_high_visibility_project/,5,2025

1kjtc0a,I feel unprepared for the professional environment,"Hi everyone, first time here because I need more points of view, honestly, I have been reflecting a lot on my behavior and my posture in the work environment. I recognize that I have already committed some stupid things, nothing very serious, but today I realize that they were unprofessional actions. Once, for example, I made a joke with the intern, commenting that she was ""just an intern"". At the time, we were in a relaxed mood, but I understand that, even so, it may have sounded disrespectful.
There were also times when they said I was gossiping about hating my industry, EVEN I NEVER SAID THAT, which made me realize how the things we say can be misinterpreted or distorted. More recently, I got involved with some shit that ended up being seen by HR (I took a croissant that was left for the people who were on the integration) ps: it was 11 am and I hadn't eaten since 6, which led to another misunderstanding, even because the girl who saw me do it was in the general manager's office, but luckily at the time the intern from my sector, a colleague, talked to her, he told me and I ended up having a low self-esteem crisis.
Given all of this, I feel very unprepared for the professional environment. Even though I'm a young apprentice, the shame of coming back and facing all of this is great. I keep thinking: even after four years in this company, will I still be seen as someone small, who hasn't evolved?
The company itself is very good, but the weight of gossip and the insecurity that all of this generates in me make me doubt whether it's worth continuing. I want to grow, learn, be someone reliable at work — but today I feel very far from that. But what bothers me even more is going to work ashamed of what I did.

1kjpr2l,"Psychology PhD, wanting to leave academia, I need a drastic change!","Hi there!

So I feel like a lot of the advice PhD students get for transitioning to industry is terrible. We are usually told to focus on roles like UX research and human factors engineer or behavioral/people scientist, but I feel like these jobs are largely superfluous to companies and NOT recession proof. You won’t develop meaningful skills to climb the corporate ladder in those roles, and I think we are told to pursue them simply because they contain the word behavior and human in the job description. 

Basically, I just want to prove to companies that I am a smart, capable person and that I can help them make money. Not have a meaningful social impact or any of that nonsense, because I know that at the end of the day companies need to make money and I am fine with that. I think so many PhD students feel this unresolvable tension between chasing truth in academia and then chasing money outside of it, but idgaf at all lol. Anyways, I am going to try to get into consulting at a top firm, but I realize this might not work out since it is so insanely competitive.

If I can't get into consulting, what would you recommend I do? What roles can I realistically get that are actually important to companies and have upward growth? Both my degrees are in psychology. Bachelors is not from a prestigious school, but the PhD is. Basically what do I search for on LinkedIn for job terms if consulting doesn't work out?

It was a nice place, the people are nice , and the project is ok. Work B offered about 20% pay rise, and work from home full time (work A at that time requires 50% to work from office). 
So I informed A, that I got this offer. My manager & his manager agreed to match the pay - unfortunately the one level manager above them said no. So I left A.
7 months into B, now I have to come 2 days a week to the office. So theoretically, it is about 1 day less than A.  A few days ago, my old manager from A contacted me, that they haven’t been able to find my replacement , and the project dateline is coming near. They are running out of time. He said, that they finally want to match the pay and the promotion that I asked for at the start (during my 10 years there, I didn’t get any promotion. Payrise yes, but not promotion). 
Should I accept the offer ? In all honesty, B never felt like home to me. 90% of my colleagues are in different state, and I always feel like the colleagues here are treated “differently”. There hasn’t been any social events happening here. The team structure is very messy. There is no clear segregation of duty.

1kjnzvl,Is it better to major in what you’re interested in or in a STEM major that guarantees a stable career,"So right now I'm contemplating whether to just do what makes me happy or just becomes a physical assistant. My plan was to go to college, do biology, go to PA school and be a PA. I thought I had it all figured out but I don't im having second thoughts and idk what else to major in. If I were to pick a major I would do music and go from there but obviously the odds of blowing up are like zero if I were to pursue music and sing or wtv. Idk I don't want to spend my early years doing biology and having regrets everyday and having to study like crazy. I would like to yk make music, record and go from there but obviously it's not practical. I know many ppl are going to say to choose a normal actual career major and I will at the end of the day but I also want to focus on music too. What's another major I could pick?

1kjn1fm,Feeling guilty about interviewing at other companies,"I work for an agency and have been at the same place for 3 years. I honestly really enjoy everyone I work with but I’m frustrated with the structure of our agency and staffing issues within my account. Everyday is a new fire to put out and I feel like I barely have time to take care of my own projects with how much I need to help others (I have a niche expertise in this process our client uses). I know agency life is hectic but I’ve been having to cover for a lot of people and being promoted at the beginning of the year made me think I’d finally get some junior staff under me to help delegate tasks. That hasn’t happened and I’m actually taking on more than what I’d like (and less interesting projects than what I was told I’d be doing). The pros are I’m at least getting recognition for the amount of work I’m covering and becoming an important team member. But I’m getting exhausted of the everyday stress and needing to figure out problems for others. It’s also been a struggle getting PTO since all timelines are “priority” atm. 

I’m not actively seeking new opportunities but I do hear out recruiters when they reach out (I get at least a couple a month hitting me up). The offers are always more competitive than what I’m currently getting. I have a big hang up on feeling extremely guilty on the thought of leaving cause I know how much work would fall on other ppl and everyone is really nice to me…I wouldn’t want to burn that bridge. I also worry about risking working for ppl less nice..

If I do get an offer that’s more competitive elsewhere, would it make sense to take it or do most ppl value working with nicer ppl more?

1kjl9t1,Should I take a career break to reset and redirect?,"Hi all, I’m looking for some honest perspective and support as I work through a big decision.

I’ve been working in corporate roles for nearly 7 years now, and over that time I’ve developed a pretty intense anxiety response around work. I’ve always been someone who puts a lot of pressure on myself to do well, but I’m realizing that I’ve internalized a lot of unhealthy expectations from corporate culture—always “on,” chasing productivity, never feeling like enough. On top of that, I’ve continually struggled to connect to the values of the corporate world and I struggle with the “work to get to the top” mentality.

Recently I started a new job hoping it would bring a sense of renewal, but it’s been even more overwhelming than my last. The onboarding was almost nonexistent and the expectations are high with very little direction. The environment and leadership style is pretty toxic and have left me anxious and second-guessing myself constantly. I know I can do good work, but I don’t feel like I can thrive here. All that to say, I’m in a constant state of anxiety, am overly emotional and all around wound up and it’s impacting my health and my relationships. I know I can’t go on like this.

After many hard conversations, my husband and I are seriously considering that I take a short career break (maybe 3 months) to rest, go to counseling, volunteer, and explore what kind of work would actually feel meaningful to me. We’re incredibly fortunate to be in a financial position where this is feasible. But I still feel overwhelmed by guilt and fear—like I’m letting people down, or that I’m not “pulling my weight,” or that others will judge me for stepping away from a career path that looks fine on paper.

I also struggle with this deeper question: What kind of work would actually feel fulfilling and aligned with who I am? I have a communications background and have thought about freelancing or moving into the nonprofit space or finding a role with a smaller more mission-driven company but I’ve never given myself the space to explore those options thoughtfully.

If you’ve ever taken a career break, changed directions, or faced something similar… how did you work through it? What helped you find clarity or peace in the decision? What did you learn about yourself in the process?

Thanks in advance…I really appreciate any thoughts.",SeaEmergency2102,3,1.0,2,1746913703,2025-05-10 21:48:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kjl9t1/should_i_take_a_career_break_to_reset_and_redirect/,5,2025
1kjklfy,Looking to change careers at 40,"Hi - As the title says - I'm 40.  I have had a career up until now in professional services which has been moderately good, with it becoming worse in the last 5-8 years or so as I have risen to the C level of small to mid sized organizations.    
  
I have worked extremely hard the last 5-10 years, and found the work interesting, stimulating, exciting but not fulfilling personally.  I have felt like what I do has had little purpose other than to make my bosses more money LOL.  I have found the strategic work to be challenging but am very burnt out on the personalities and vagaries of my CEOs / Chairs / Owners.

At this point - I'd like to make a switch.  I would like to do something that is challenging and exciting, and that has a purpose.  I was thinking that law enforcement focused on investigating fraud, or white collar crime might be interesting.  I was also thinking that something focused on public health might be interesting.  

While I would like to make a decent living, salary is not the main concern.  In a perfect world, I'd like to make at least 100k but I do not expect to make remotely close to what I have been making and would prefer something fulfilling at 80k to something less fulfilling at a higher pay  
  
I do not have a CPA or a JD.  I would be open to going back to school to get a masters in accounting to get a CPA, going back to law school, getting an M PH or any other relevant credential.  

I would love any suggestions! ",NextStepsNQuestions,7,1.0,13,1746911830,2025-05-10 21:17:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kjklfy/looking_to_change_careers_at_40/,5,2025
1kjkeds,LOST OFFER IN VP ROUND?,"I recently interviewed at a major aerospace company and went through what felt like a full gauntlet. It began with a recruiter screen, followed by a second-round interview with the hiring manager. After that, I had a third round with two senior engineers, then an in-person visit where I gave a technical presentation to a panel of about 15 people. I also had one-on-one interviews with members of the team, the department director, and even a full site tour. Later, I spoke with a team lead from another office as well.

I passed every round with flying colors. The feedback was strong throughout, and eventually the recruiter told me the team wanted to move toward making an offer—pending one final conversation with the vice president of the department.

After everything I had already been through, I assumed the VP interview would be straightforward. Instead, I was caught off guard by a more technical line of questioning. I navigated the questions successfully, but at the end of the interview, when I asked if he had any concerns, he told me directly that I was “not impressive on paper” and that they “only hire the best of the best.”

That completely threw me. After all the rounds, the presentations, and support from the team, I thought I had proven myself. I still haven’t heard the final decision yet, but it was a wild and unexpected twist in a process I thought I had already cleared.

So now I’m wondering:
If the engineers and hiring team are backing me and saying, “this is our guy,” would they be able to sway the VP—and would they even try?

I’m 25 and have been at my job for about 14 months now. Things have been going well—my company is happy with my performance, and they’ve presented me with two different opportunities:

Lead Sales Role: I’d take the lead on 2 out of our 4 service lines, with ownership over sales strategy and campaigns. I’d also have 1 or 2 SDRs reporting to me.

Relocate to Australia: I’d move there for 2 years to support the local sales team. It wouldn’t be a quota-carrying role, more of a support position.

1kjhlxz,Torn Between Software and Consulting,"Hey everyone,  
I’m honestly confused and could use some real talk and guidance.

I’ve been in this weird limbo between pursuing software and going down the consulting route. On one hand, I enjoy building, solving technical problems, and seeing things come to life — that feeling of shipping something real is unmatched. On the other hand, I find myself getting drawn to business strategy, product thinking, and just wanting to be more “in the room” where decisions are made.

The truth is:

* I like coding, but I don’t *love* spending my entire day in code.
* I like business and strategy, but I don’t have an MBA or a McKinsey badge, and I worry I’ll be an outsider.
* I feel like I’m constantly switching between Leetcode and case studies, unsure of what I’m actually aiming for.
* I see people around me going all-in on one path, and I’m scared of wasting time being stuck in the middle.

I’m not here for a “pick one” binary answer. I want to hear from people who’ve been through this — who maybe started in tech and moved to consulting, or vice versa. Or even those who figured out a hybrid path (like product management, tech strategy, or internal consulting at a tech firm).

Would love recommendations on:

* Resources to explore both fields deeply (not just surface-level career blogs)
* Realistic hybrid roles that value both skillsets
* What kind of signals to look for in myself to make a more confident decision
* How to not feel like I’m constantly “behind” for not having it all figured out

1kjgob9,Being “temporarily reassigned” to other team for 2 months after just promoted last month while intern works on my job tasks,"I was informed by my boss that I will be getting reassigned to work under a different manager for 2 months while the new intern starting soon will be picking up my former job duties.

The team I was reassigned for 2 months to does business intelligence work (I am a developer) and the project they want me working (mainly security related sql queries) on they have had a long term intern working on for a few months.

So my boss is training the new development intern to work on my tickets while I do sql queries for 2 months under a different manager until the internship program ends. He said he thinks it will be a ""good change of pace for me"" instead of working on web apps.

What I am wondering is this: why are they putting me on sql queries instead of the new intern with the current intern? And why are they now putting all my work on hold for it for 2 months if they aren't going to be auditioning this person for my job?

On a scale of 1 to 10, how worried should I be that I will be permanently taken off the dev team and moved to business intelligence? They have a habit of hiring seasonal interns to work through the school year. I am very panicked I will end up getting replaced and permanently moved to the other team.

All my big upcoming projects have been put on hold for 2 months and I was told the sql work will be my only work for 2 months. It feels like they are trying to see if they can ramp the intern up to fill my spot and I am freaking out.

1kjfxev,Suspicious Internship/Co-Op,"At the very beginning of Fall 2024, students in my major were recommended to apply to internships. I applied to the first internship I saw on the page -- a Civil Engineering position in which I'd be performing tests to make sure materials are industry-grade before they get put down.   
  
I filled the application out but never went through with submitting, and the hiring manager went out of his way to call me. He told me that he saw the application on file, and encouraged me to continue filling it out. So I did, interviewed, and got onboarded to start on May 19th, 2025.   
  
Because I've been quite busy all semester, I never took the time to sit down and go through the employee handbook for any potential hangups. I've discovered one: The company's Co-Op program first spends \~1 month making you do written work to attain a bunch of industry certifications, which collectively cost like thousands of dollars. The website for the Co-Op assures that employees will be compensated in full for the certs.  
  
However, after deep-diving through the employee handbook, I discovered that any employees who get their certs and then voluntarily withdraw within a year of eomployment (even under the circumstance of a short internship, like the one I'm doing), are required to pay for their certifications in full. So in other words, the internship is structured in a way that *guarantees* I get all of my certifications before getting into the field, and has this clause in the handbook.  
  
 The tenure of my internship is from May 19th to August 22nd, well below the year threshold, and online Glassdoor/Indeed reviews cite that they got charged for their certifications for doing a Summer-only internship. Since I was assured that I wouldn't pay for the certifications, I emailed the hiring manager who onboarded me this:

""I was reading through the handbook, and took note of the following information:  
  
When you "" voluntarily remove yourself from employment … within one year of receiving a certification,”, you're responsible for the full cost of every acquired [cert.My](http://cert.My) only question is, that because my term with XXXXXXXX  is presently May 19th to August 22nd, and my concluding of the position isn't voluntary but rather a contractual agreement, would I still be required to pay for my certs upon leaving?  
  
  
Thank you so much""  


and I received this response:

\>no you would not be so ur ok  
  
\>looking forward to coming onboard

1kjfkes,Searching for Career & Job Ideas — Engineer Wanting to Move into Sports and Product Development (Hybrid/Remote),"Hello!

I’m a Mechanical Engineer (also Mathematics degree) looking for career direction. I haven't figured out how to attach my resume but once I do I will put it into the comments.

I have strong technical experience across several engineering roles, but I want to transition into something more aligned with my long-term goals and passions. Specifically, I’m interested in:

* Sports + performance (Open to all sports, played nearly everything)
* Data-driven (e.g. sports data analyst)
* Product development (engineering, product, and user experience come together)

Long-term, I’d like to grow into a management or leadership role, so I’m open to jobs that recruit engineers and offer a clear path toward management. I'd love to work in a role focusing on Sports but I don't know where to start as an engineer.

I’d appreciate any advice on:  
\- What kinds of roles I should target?  
\- Any companies you recommend (especially those with hybrid/remote options)?

Besides taking a hard hit on my confidence and feeling absolutely undervalued, I do want to get some constructive feedback from my manager on why I’m being passed over. One of her main feedback is I lack of a “strategic mind” for the position that the leadership team is looking for.

I can see where that comes from. I am a strong individual contributor, building and leading a team and really trying to be inspiring and instrumental most of the time, but a lot of times I’m bogged down by the day to day weeds which I have to get myself involved to support other key stakeholders. I’m curious if this might be seen as not strategic, not high level enough? How do you find that balance to be a strong contributor while able to managing at a 10000ft view? Does it mean I have to be hands off in order to be seen able to delegate and strategic?

And can you train to be of strategic mind? Or it just comes with it? This feedback from my manager can mean so many different things and hoping someone can help with clarity.",Calm_Airline229,37,0.8999999761581421,68,1746892254,2025-05-10 15:50:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kjdeed/what_does_it_mean_to_be_more_strategic_at_work/,5,2025

1kjcudk,What would you do in my position?,"Hi all, I’m really at a loss here. I’m 24, which I know is objectively young but I feel like I’m already failing at life and I’m scared for my future. I really don’t know what to do and would appreciate any and all responses on what you guys would do.

I went to school for marketing communications, got my first job right out of college at a publicity company. I recently quit due to numerous issues at the company (not going into it on here, but trust me. It was a NIGHTMARE experience in so many ways, it’s a place I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. MULTIPLE people, now including me, have quit without having another job lined up because they really couldn’t take it anymore.) It messed with my mind so badly, I have no clue if I want to stay in PR or the entertainment industry at all. I can’t figure out if it was just the company that ruined it all for me or if I genuinely don’t enjoy it.

I’m not sure where I should go from here. The job market is so terrible right now, I probably won’t even be able to get another job in the industry for a while, especially considering my lack of experience (although I was promoted to publicist there very quickly, but still only been working for 2 years). I’ve been applying to fast food places too just to get something in the meantime but no luck there either (I have 6 years of experience in fast food.)

I’m juggling several options: A) keep applying to PR/related jobs and stay in an industry that might make me miserable. B) go to trade school to learn something like web development (I know coding is difficult, but I’m used to hard work. Always got great grades and used to work 60+ hour weeks when I had 2 jobs, so I’m willing to put in the work.) C) work at a place like Starbucks (used to work there) and just work my way up to manager, etc.

I wouldn’t say I’m necessarily “passionate” about any particular thing. I thought it was the entertainment industry but that job royally messed me up. I just want a job that pays well (don’t need to be rich, just don’t want to agonize over every penny ya know), I’m not treated awful, and it has a work/life balance that allows me to actually enjoy life. I know I’m young, but it really feels like my entire future is riding on this decision. I really appreciate any help you all can give!!

TLDR - 24yo quit awful job without another one lined up, really struggling to figure out what route I should go. A) stay in same industry B) trade school C) work my way up in fast food.",justanotherbi_girl,2,0.7599999904632568,7,1746890764,2025-05-10 15:26:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kjcudk/what_would_you_do_in_my_position/,5,2025

1kjbcis,Should I stay or should I go?,"Hello everybody

I work as hairstylist and I’ve been working for a company for almost 2 years now, a little background: they fired me last year once and then asked me to stay for less money, I did cause the job was not too stressful and had good working hours, even tho the shop was totally not my vibe and the manager was really toxic; I held on till January when I asked to be relocated to a better location (wealthier too), but they played hard to get and said no.

Fast forward a month ago when they fired me for a second time, they hired someone new to replace me but suddenly they moved me to this other wealthier location (probably cause one hairstylist resigned and they want me to take over her clients) and now they’re playing nice af and wondering if I will stay, they literally ask me everyday what I think about the place, the team, etc etc…

So I ask you guys, what should I do?

Should I stay or should I go? And if yes, to what conditions?

In the meanwhile I moved around and found other places that are interested in hiring me, the thing is, this location I’m currently working is wealthy and they charge more money for services, so I’m wondering it may be a chance for me to ask for more money in a new contract? The workload is also much more compared to the previous location, I don’t mind pushing myself to work much, if it’s compensated with a good salary, good manners and a nice team.

Advices?

1kjb3h3,Career options: Paid Marketing Strategist,"Hello everyone
I recently found myself a little stuck in a performance/demand gen team without much sense of career growth and wanted to know what other people think and hopefully get some advice.
Company is a B2B SaaS with approx 170 people. 
My title is a marketing strategist, I mainly focus on paid social where I support campaign managers but also own my own campaigns. I work with the creative team, do LP optimizations, help other teams with strategy and generally I'm trying to work on many projects outside of just paid social launches to not get pigeonholed. 
My goal would be to reach a campaign manager (paid social) team lead position or similar but with the current structure it's unlikely. 
We have a new CMO on whom I was relying to make changes that will make this possible (eventually) because it would be more efficient IMHO.

However, after recent discussion I found out that he is not planning to make any changes to us and rather hire outside people for position like Program Manager who'd own campaigns more holistically later on. Keep us as a small in-house agency.
My manager is very experienced and supportive of my career aspirations but even his promotion seems extremely long overdue and so he can't help much with my struggle which is similar to his.

I don't want to end up as a paid media specialist that doesn't really do much else besides paid social launches and has nowhere to grow and waste next e.g. 2 years of my life. 

Can anyone advise me on how to approach this? I know I could consider applying for a new job but I've already put in 2 years at this company where I was hoping to become a team lead - currently noone will hire me as a manager/team leader without such experience.

Did I choose the wrong focus in my marketing career and shouldn't have done performance marketing? I thought it's easy to grow into customer acquisition lead and similar but that doesn't seem to exist in our company.

1kjafib,Skilled art handler lookong for career change,"I (33f) kind of fell backwards into this career when I was poor and homeless and found I was uniquely equipped to excel, but poor managment, personell issues, and gender bias have consistently been issues that I am feeling pretty certain I've done all I can in this industry.

I've been doing light carpentry since I was a child. Was making boxes in my uncle's shop, build theater sets in high school and college, spent a summer as a maintainance tech for a hotel repairing furniture, finishings, painting, and servicing hvac, I've also spent years building shipping crates. 

After school I worked as a gallery preparator, photographer, and copywriter for a small auction house for 5 years and made minimum wage the entire time. I wound up homeless and jobless after a bad break up which is when I went into the labor sector since it actually paid a livable wage.

Since becoming an art handler I have lead complicated installations, gotten familiar with equipment like gantries and various lifts, I studied art history and conservation because art school was seen as a waste of money by my family, but I've always been compulsively creative. I'm always drawing or making things for my home. I'm great at communicating visual ideas on paper but have vietually no digital skills. I am also good at seeing a project start to finish and planning out jobs even at a moments notice.

I've always been handy and figure things out pretty easily in a mechanical sense. I like tangible goals and solutions. I am happiest working with my hands, making things, doing repairs, organizing inventory, and managing projects and logistics. I also really like driving and can drive a 30ft straight truck.

For the longest time I wanted to work in the art department of movies but I can't afford to spend years working as a PA and art director jobs have dried up anyway which is where I'd want to go. I want to change careers but nothing seems worth it or I have no idea how to make the connections necessary. I'd need to start at at least $27/hour which is a little less than what I make now and health insurance is important for me too.

1kj8utf,Am I Cut Out for Engineering? Seeking Advice on Career Direction and Skill Gaps,"Hi All,

I would like some advice regarding a challenging situation I am currently facing in my career. I hold a Master’s and Bachelor’s degree in Naval Architecture and Offshore Engineering ( did this out of parental pressure but I myself had no passion for anything else so decided to go with their advice ) and have been working for the past 8 months at a consultancy firm. However, I am struggling to bridge the gap between academic learning and practical application in the workplace.

Despite investing five years in my education, I find myself unable to effectively apply or recall basic engineering concepts such as Engineering Mechanics, Strength of Materials, and Fluid Mechanics( I was an average student). Even after dedicating extra hours to revisiting these subjects, I still fall short of what is expected of me in my role.

My manager has expressed disappointment in my performance, and I feel that he is surprised I managed to pass my degree and secure the job ( his facial expressions and cold approach). This feedback has severely impacted my confidence and has left me questioning whether I genuinely possess the natural aptitude for engineering.

The ongoing struggle has taken a toll on my mental and physical well-being. I constantly fear being terminated, and my anxiety has affected my social interactions in the office. The uncertainty and self-doubt are becoming overwhelming.

I am now at a crossroads, contemplating whether to take a break to focus solely on revisiting and strengthening my core engineering concepts before attempting to re-enter the field. Alternatively, I also think this is an indication that engineering may not be the right fit for me and if I should explore other career paths.

I would greatly appreciate any insights, guidance, or advice from those who have faced similar challenges or who can provide a fresh perspective on how to navigate this situation.

1kj8hgp,Should I pursue a career path where AI can do tasks better than me?,"Should I pursue a career where AI can do tasks better than me?

I'm 19 years old and currently pursuing an engineering degree.

I've already tried rolling into a couple of career paths that don't require a degree and are suitable for remote work (3D and programming). But every time I've tried to develop a skill to a decent level to start working, a new AI tool comes out that does things faster and/or better than I do at my current skill level. I'm tired of being in a rat race of career trends.

**My question is:** Should I continue honing skills that I am already familiar with, even if the AI surpasses me in them? And if not, what skills are better to develop while I have a lot of free time now?

1kj7xaq,How do I decide what I want to do with my life when there so many options?,"A man walks into an ice-cream shop. The ice-cream shop has a plethora of options and flavours that span as far as the eye can see. There simply too many options to choose the best one and not enough time to try all of them. What makes it worse is that he don't even know what flavours he likes because he's never had any of them before, only what other people have told them they taste like before. How the hell is he supposed to pick an ice-cream?

Obviously i'm not actually talking about ice-cream, but i'm 15M living in the uk and it just seems impossible to decide what I want to do and devote years of my life to educating myself for it and then doing the actual job, when I might not even like the job, for all I know I could hate it and be miserable!

Yes, I know I can have career-changes and lots of people do it, but the range of jobs I want to try in my lifetime just doesn't seem plausible, like, I want to join the armed forces, perhaps the royale marines or paras because i love a challenge; but i also want to be an actor, love acting in plays and keep being told I have the talent for it, and my parents want me to make use my intellect and become something like a lawyer or an investment banker, but then I see all these big-time entrepreneurs on social media and even people I know, smoking nice cigars in their expensive ferrari and massive mansions talking about ""making it"" and ""escaping the matrix"". Hell, I even want to live a life as a construction worker or a small-business owner. I love writing and creating things - does that mean I should become a writer??

* Did anything *actually* boost your chances when applying internally?
* How do you stand out when changing departments at a big org?

1kj5be8,Need Advice: Contract Negotiations,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently negotiating my commission structure for a new role as an Investment Consultant (sales-driven, client onboarding focus) and would love feedback from others in sales/property/commission-based roles. Below are the key details and my proposed adjustments—am I being reasonable, or is there something I’m missing?

# Current Offer:

* **Base Salary:** $60K AUD (incl. super)
* **Bonus:** $2K flat fee per deal (paid only when onboarded client’s property deal goes unconditional).
* **Expectation:** Onboard 2 clients/week (\~8/month) $500 commitment to see me (0 commission made on that).
* **OTE for High Performers:** 250K/year(implies 104 deals/year at 250*K*/*year* (*implies* 104 *deals*/*year at* 2K each).
* **Probation:** 6 months.

\*Been advised 80% of deals go through after I bring them onboard\*

# My Concerns:

1. **No Visibility/Control:** Right now I don't know the exact deal values, from early conversations $950k was mentioned a bit so Ill assume its 1M in our market. I onboard clients but dont influence conversions. 2K feels low for high−value deals (avg. 2*K feels low for high*−*value deals* (*avg*. 1M property = 0.2% commission).
2. **Financial Uncertainty:** Commission is paid only at deal closure, but I’m expected to deliver 2 clients/week upfront.
3. **Industry Comparison:** Traditional sales roles often pay 1-2% for acquisition (even without conversion responsibility).

# Proposed Adjustments (Probation Period Only):

* **Tiered Bonus:** 2K (<750K).  3.5K(750K-1M). 5K+ (>$1M).
* **Split Milestones:** 1K at onboarding + 1K at unconditional.
* **Revenue Share:** Retain $2K/deal but add 5% quarterly pool from closed deals I sourced.
* **Base Salary Alternative:** $80K + Same structureQuestions:

Are my proposals realistic, or should I push for a different structure? Am I seeing red flags in the current offer?

I think I'm being very realistic and I don't imagine this hindering my offer or opportunity at all, I think it would effect me if i just accepted their terms. I don't want to leave myself high and dry with more money to be made, I’m excited about the role but want to ensure fairness given the high expectations and lack of control post-onboarding. Probation adds pressure, so I’m framing this as a temporary review.

Thanks in advance—appreciate any insights!",Icy_Swordfish_5785,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1746864963,2025-05-10 08:16:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kj5be8/need_advice_contract_negotiations/,5,2025

In contrast, at our recent staff meeting, all he said about me was, “She’s our new hire and she’s been helpful,” then moved on. Nothing close to what Leah got. She even pointed out how differently it was handled.

About a month in, I started taking on a lot of Leah’s tasks and they started training her for other tasks. Another manager complimented how fast I was catching on and how fast my work ethic was improving their department workflow. Instead of acknowledging it, my manager jumped in and said, “Well, Leah couldn’t be fast because I would give her extra work when she handled those tasks,” completely deflecting the compliment.

Leah’s been here for a year, and I can tell our manager absolutely loves her as an employee. But it feels like he’s hesitant to praise me—like he’s trying to avoid making her feel threatened. It’s subtle but draining, and with a performance review probably coming up soon, it’s hard to stay motivated.

1kj3dr9,I'm stuck between 3 bad options after a job offer – I really need advice,"Hi all,  
I’ve made a mistake and I’m now in a situation I don’t know how to handle. I really need some honest advice, and please don’t judge too harshly — I’ve already learned the lesson the hard way.

Some time ago, I applied for a new job and said I was working full-time in my current role, when in reality it’s a part-time position. I did this because I was worried my application wouldn’t be taken seriously otherwise. It felt like the only way to get a foot in the door.

Now things are progressing, and I’m terrified they’ll check and find out I lied about my employment status. I don’t want to ruin this opportunity, but I also don’t want to start a new job based on a lie. I genuinely want to move on, grow professionally, and I’ve promised myself I won’t make this mistake again.

At this point, I see three terrible options:

1. **Withdraw from the offer**, even though I worked so hard to get here.
2. **Hope they don’t check**, and keep quiet — but live with the anxiety. 
3. **Try to “fix” or “fake” the references**, which I know is absolutely wrong and could backfire badly.

I know none of these are good. I just want to find the most ethical way out of this mess, ideally one that lets me move forward without destroying my reputation or future prospects.

Has anyone been through something like this? How do employers usually handle minor discrepancies like this? Is there any way to come clean without losing the offer?

1kj35k2,Getting paid with senior position but required to bear the responsibility as a director,"My company is small, with fewer than 10 employees. All of us have been here for less than a year. My title is Senior xx which is essentially a regular staff and my pay is slightly lower than the market rate.

I am 5 months into the employment. Alongside me, there are 3 other ""head of department"", each of us in charge of our own department but all of them hold the title of ""director"" and mine is not even a manager.

Coming back to the business of my company, I manage the commercial part and the other three HODs manage design, project and business respectively. 

My workload is heavier than the other HODs. Other than the business director, the other two basically just take care of 1 project at one time and ongoing biddings assigned to them. They go back on time at 6pm while I have to work on all ongoing projects (3) and all biddings. There have been occasion where I have to work 36 hours without sleep due to the submission deadline. The other HODs or their subordinates would pass me the info at 6pm the day before the submission and I had to work overnight to wrap up everything.

Recently our Managing Director, during a weekly meeting, mentioned that we've lost bidding due to Project Manager's track records and our pricing was competitive so he cannot ""fault me"" on that. Yes. He used the word ""fault"".

Another occasion he told me that he wanted to raise my pay but need me to win one project so that he can justify the pay raise. That means, I am the sole responsibility for winning/losing the bidding. 

I feel so imbalanced right now because although I am the head of department but my title is not even a manager let alone my pay is 5k less than the design and project director. Yet I don't get a pay raise if we lose the project due to their poor track records or other reasons like design? I feel like being used.

I have already gotten an offer from another company, same position, 7% higher pay. 

What would you do if you are in my position.  
Current company-

Pros: casual, work flexibility, I get to decide my own department system, the MD recognize my knowledge and abilities, may get more than 1 month's bonus if profit good (again my sole responsibility)

cons: pay as a senior staff position yet need to bear bigger responsibility than other directors

  
New company

Pros: higher pay, responsibility matches position

Cons: stringent conditions like 2 months notice period, need to report to manager of the department, fixed bonus 1 month

1kj33f6,"Feeling bittersweet about leaving subbing for a new job, any advice?","I've been subbing for months while job hunting, and next week I start a full-time job unrelated to teaching. It’s an at-will, limited-term role with intense training and no vacation for months. While I’m excited for this career shift, leaving feels bittersweet. I’ve recently built meaningful connections mentoring students and someone even suggested I should be a math teacher after I helped them with math.

1kj2dy0,High performer but threatened with a PIP unless I change roles,"Hello, I currently have a tech sales role where I have been a top performer for 4 years. And by top performer, I mean my yearly raises have been amazing (5, 6, 8, 11%) and I received two mid year raises including last year (12 and 8%) for the work I've done. I was also selected to do a special project last year that only a handful of people in the company get selected for. In September we had a re org and I was put on a new team with a new manager and new accounts. Although it's been challenging, I feel I've done well so far with what I've been given in the short time I've had.

Last week, my manager mentioned there was a role in operations that he thinks I may enjoy, that I should check it out, and he slipped in the fact that we are 27 ppl over head count in sales. I vetted out the option which would lose my sales bonuses (30% of my pay) and I ultimately said no that I don't want the role for that reason. To this he replied he was happy I wasn't leaving his team

Today I get a call from my manager saying he wants to revisit me moving to operations because my performance isn't where he thinks it should be, im the lowest ranked sales person on his team, and this is a formal discussion about my performance. He then gave some iffy scenarios/examples that I don't agree with. I then asked if he was putting me on a PIP to which he replied that there were no plans for a PIP but because they are over head count some folks will be and I'm his lowest ranked sales rep. So to me it sounds like a threat to a PIP.

Again, I don't believe I'm an underperformer. I have never had any indication that this was the case until this conversation. This was so out of left field I was absolutely shocked. We have a follow up call on monday

1kj2b6j,idk if i should stay at this job,"mostly a rant/open to kind advice if possible 

I just graduated college and I’m taking a gap year basically before I (hopefully) go to grad school. I worked through most of college so now that I’m not working or in school I feel kind of miserable from the lack of something going on in my life. (It was a student  job so it ended when I graduated). 

I started looking for jobs I could do in the meantime just to have something to do and some money. I was thinking maybe something fun or not related to my career would be fine like retail (I buy a lot of clothes and would appreciate the discount), but that usually pays minimum wage so I was hoping for something that pays a little higher. My family is comfy so I’m not gonna die if I don’t have a job but I want some anime figures and PC parts. I’m not really expecting anything crazy with my experience but I was used to making $20 at my old job. 

So after applying to about a dozen jobs (i know it’s not really a lot lol) I got an offer for a full time 8 to 5 working the front desk receptionist at a private practice. Not exactly what I had in mind but I was like “hey I’m not really doing anything else right now so why not.” 

Some gripes I’ve had with it so far: 

1.	It pays 18/hr when I asked for 20 so that’s kind of my fault for not trying to negotiate (at least they said they give you a raise after a while??).

2.	There also wasn’t any formal written offer or onboarding or anything like what I experienced working for a big company but I was like okay… maybe it’s a small business thing. I guess I just like having a paper trail. The job listing was also a little vague so seeing my duties listed out would have been nice (idk how normal that is though). I’ll admit I didn’t vet this job well enough before accepting. 

3.	Related, I’ve realized the job is just doing everything the doctor doesn’t want to do. For a receptionist making $18/hr I kind of expected to be answering the phone and checking patients in but I’m basically the guy’s personal assistant lol. I answer his emails (he doesn’t separate his personal from his work wtf 😭) and bill the insurance and talk to case managers. 

4.	MY BIGGEST ISSUE probably is that I feel like I’m not giving the patients the best service they can have ☹️☹️ Most of them are elderly and I literally feel so bad when I can’t answer their questions or help them like aagsjfkf. A lot of times case managers for work related injuries will call and I literally don’t know how to help them 😭

5.	and finally a lot of these issues stem from the fact that no one is properly training me 🙂 !!! Idk if it’s a skill issue and these are basic things i should already know but I kind of expected a job dealing with a vulnerable population to be more serious about it lol. Shows what kind of business they are. The office is literally the doctor and one other administrative assistant who’s only part time. I feel like I’m literally left to fend for myself. I volunteered at a pediatrics research lab during college and they gave me sooo much preparation before they even let me talk to any kids because they wanted to emphasize how important patients are :( 

6.	some unserious things i don’t like are that i don’t see anyone under 60 all day and everyone dresses boring 

7. boss also made some political comments that i do not agree with so 🙂 yeah 

8.	the commute is also basically an hour each way. i thought it would be fine since it’s about the same as my commute to school but i’ve realized now a class schedule and 8 to 5 are not equal. When I also take the pay into account it just doesn’t seem worth it. I get so depressed when I think about how I wake up to get ready for work at 6 and don’t get home until 6:30 before i have to go to sleep at 10 to be ready for work tomorrow 😭

This ended up being way longer than I expected wow. Idk if I’m just having a hard time adjusting to post grad life or if it’s the job itself. I miss my free time and being around people my age and people passionate about what they do. I can see myself getting better at the job but nobody training me is not gonna change i fear 💀. So. That would make it hard to get better at the job. During the interview, I said there’s a day I need off and the boss said the schedule is really flexible but this place would be struggling without one of its THREE employees 😭 so idk how true that is. Maybe if I can make a list like this it’s a sign to leave. 

Yeah, idk what to do or how long i should hold out. I was thinking of applying to more jobs and then leaving this one when I get a new one but idk what a good timeline for that is like is it bad if I get a new job in a month lol. Would it be best to quit early so they don’t waste time “training” me? Also highly considering waiting for that first paycheck to hit and then asking for a raise… and then dipping if I don’t get it lol. bc after seeing what the job actually entails i’m not getting paid enough 😭 (my fault again for not vetting properly ughh). idek if i would wanna stay for higher pay bc realistically the pay will not be much higher. 

Thanks if you made it this far. It’s Friday night so I’m gonna get high and game. Going to honkai star rail anniversary event tomorrow (yay) if anyone cares.

1kj2axf,Stuck.  Not sure where to go,"I have a BSEET and an MBA with a concentration in Energy.  But I currently work in a machine shop 7 days a week.  I get told all the time how I am “over qualified” for the position I currently hold.  I have signed up for electrical apprenticeships and while I aced the written portion I failed the hands on.  I don’t have much experience with wiring motor control circuits and my motors class was 20 years ago.  Most of my experience is in cell phone systems engineering and the manufacturing, electrical sub-assembly/ testing of locomotives and its components.  I  can go to any machine they have and run it to meet/exceed production goals.  I often help my fellow union brothers troubleshoot problems on lines they barely know how to run.  I must disclose that I am currently facing suspension for a poor work performance incident.  My second in a one year period.  

I have been thinking about this more than I’d like to admit and wonder if I have screwed myself from any future opportunities within my current employer, union or management.  Furthermore, i am wondering what outside employers are gonna think when they see a guy with a BS and MBA working as a union machine operator.  For context, I ended up here after finishing my MBA and striking out on 10 interviews in 5 states.

1kj0ypq,Moral and Ethical Debate- Call out this company for misclassification?,"I've been in outside sales for over a decade, almost exclusively as a W2 employee. My last company was sold and fortunately found another good looking job immediately after. No where in the ad or during the interview was it mentioned I would be 1099.

  
I don't have an issue with 1099 as long as I'm treated as an independent contractor. To clarify, I am NOT treated as an independent contractor. I am told when my appointments are, where they are, forced to work every other Sunday/can't turn down appointments, I'm expected to follow their script and their selling method which I was trained on (also held to that standard and checked to make sure I am following it), I'm required to be in the office weekly, and they are asking me to sign a non compete (though legally they can in my state even as 1099). I answer to them on a daily basis.

To me, that exercises more than enough control to classify me as a W2 employee. My issue is I need to make money and the job market here is garbage, I have a family relying on me. I fully believe I'm misclassified as is everyone else and its the principle of it that bothers me. They are getting full benefit of me being an ""employee"" without me actually being an employee. They are skirting the system to save a shit ton on taxes. If I start questioning it, I can lose my job and then be fully screwed.

I'm being asked to sign the Independent Contractor agreement, it's basically an employment contract but uses the term Independent Contractor. If I sign this, I don't know if it would be binding since I signed it or if it would be nullified by the fact I'm being misclassified and therefore illegal.

Also important, without too much identifying info, the president of the company was arrested and charged with multiple felonies a few years back for looting his company and violating worker rights among other things. I didn't know this at the time I was interviewing and asking questions but was able to confirm this once I started. Knowing that, it would make sense that I'm being intentionally misclassified.

What's the best way to handle this situation? Keep my mouth shut and try to make money in the meantime? Or call them out and see what happens? Ultimately, my family is the most important factor here and my duty is to support them. I'm looking for other jobs but good ones are tough to find.

1kj0obo,22 y/o with experience turning around a small business — looking for honest feedback on resume & next steps into startups,"Hey Guys 👋

I’m 22, based in Toronto, and I’m looking to transition into a new role — ideally at an early-stage startup where I can keep learning by doing.

A bit of background:
I’m the co-owner of a local tutoring centre (part of a national franchise). When I got involved, the business was losing money and struggling to stay afloat. Over the last couple of years, I’ve been hands-on with everything from sales to marketing to operations. I implemented email/push/SMS campaigns, rebuilt our retention system, reduced refund requests, and helped grow MRR significantly. Now that the centre runs smoothly with minimal involvement, I’m ready to take on a new challenge full-time.

What I’m looking for:

Roles like Growth Marketing, Operations Associate, Customer Success, BizOps, or even Founder’s Associate / Generalist
I’m especially interested in early-stage companies or startups that need someone who can wear multiple hats
I want to be around smart, ambitious people and gain exposure to how tech companies grow and scale
Long-term goal is to either start something or work in VC, so I’m looking to build the right experience now
What’s working against me:

I haven’t finished my undergrad (yet)
I don’t have formal startup/corporate experience beyond my own business
I’m not sure how well my resume stacks up against people with fancier titles or degrees
That said — I have real-world wins, I work hard, and I care about delivering results.

👉 Would love any feedback on my resume (attached in comments or DM)
👉 If you’ve hired for similar roles — what do you look for in non-traditional candidates?
👉 Realistically, what kind of pay / roles should I be targeting in Toronto right now?

I’m also happy to connect with anyone in the space or who’s been through a similar journey. Appreciate you taking the time to read this 🙏",AdLess4884,1,1.0,1,1746846999,2025-05-10 03:16:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kj0obo/22_yo_with_experience_turning_around_a_small/,5,2025
1kj0lpe,Situation at work,"I joined a company last year, it was a total mess. No effective protection planning, shipping schedule, materials or factory capacity planning.
It was running late with 85% of orders 
I worked every evening , weekend for about 2 months unpaid, fixed all their systems using shared Excel files, pivot tables etc.

Now we are late with about 15% of their orders.

I think it would stop working if I wasn't around for a while, as no one is good on Excel and it requires some maintaince to keep it running.

Not one person in management has said good job or well down. I can't figure out why this would be.

 I think their customers would have left them and they would have been in serious trouble. 

Thought in fairly good shape they did make a number of people redundant as a general cost cutting exercise.

The customer accounts I looked after have all down well and increased in business. So what has happened is they have pulled on 2.5 times the orders onto me, compared to anyone else. Too much for one person

All of the other departments have some attempt at keeping a balance between the people. 

Added to this we are in the process moving into a new office and have moved into some warehouse for the last six months. Where we are in a room with no windows and I keep smacking me head into low metal rails, so have to walk about hunched over all the time . All in all I'm feeling pretty hard done by.

On Monday I'm thinking I am going to ask the managers for a meeting get them to acknowledge what I gave done and ask why they are pulling an unreasonable amount of work onto me.

It could be a good job, if the work load wasn't as high and I didn't feel disrespected over the whole thing. In two minds on whether to look for a new job.

Would appreciate anyone's thoughts on this situation and how I should proceed",INI-splinterrat,2,1.0,2,1746846749,2025-05-10 03:12:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kj0lpe/situation_at_work/,5,2025
1kj0d1s,Tough early career decision. Need some guidance.,"Hello everyone, 28M who works in IT. I have about 4 years experience and work as a Systems Administrator for a large local non profit. I make 35/hr with no benefits (contractor) (HCoL) and I've been there about 2 years now, my responsibilities have grown over the years to the level of engineer but ""budgets"" call for no new openings or raises for me. I got offered a Sales Engineer role for a IT company that is full time remote 100k with 6 weeks PTO and health/dental/retirement sign on bonus, tuition assistance etc. I know it seems like a no brainer but here's my concern: 

At my current role I'm getting to be highly technical hands on and work on the top cutting edge equipment everyday, I have some major exciting projects coming up that would look like gold on a resume and if I stick it out a little longer here I could gain the experience to move on to a high level engineering role. I love my teammates and I love the mission we support but the pay is bad and my manager is frustrating to deal with at times. This new role would be less hands on and more design and discussion heavy. Im very introverted and don't have that sales type of personality. On top of that im afraid I would lose my technical chops in the process and have a hard time breaking back in. Also I live alone and I'm not sure full remote would be good for my mental health? Not sure. But these are my concerns. 

TLDR: New role offered more pay and benefits but I'm concerned I'll lose my technical skills, forced to be overly social and become lonely due to being full remote. Love my current role and I'm on the brink of gaining gold experience soon but pay and management sucks. Scared to make the wrong career move.

1kj08ir,Just got fired after barely 5 months at my job and I have no protections,"If anyone can offer any advice, it would be appreciated. 

I’ve been working in local political nonprofits since 2019 (so about five years, coming up on 6). I recently left a full time nonprofit job to take a full time contracting role at a colleague’s creative agency serving nonprofits. And today I got fired. 

The firing itself was odd. We just got back from a one-week full team planning retreat, and he reached out to schedule the termination meeting three days after we got back. Boss said he had been thinking about this for a while, and that I wasn’t “stepping into the leadership position” the way he hoped. He also mentioned my sensitivity to criticism. Fairly valid points, though I was shocked and dismayed to suddenly be fired and not given a chance to work on things. This was the first mention of either/both issues. 

I’ve been wanting to get out of political nonprofits for years now, so this feels like my chance, despite being totally blindsided by the termination. (Thankfully I am being given notice, and was offered a month’s pay as severance, which is appreciated.) Thing is, I’m making $75,000 a year, which is not a salary that is easy to find in a career transition. 

Wondering if anyone might be able to offer some advice into what jobs to look for. My background is in communications, though my biggest strength is in social media management. I’m a fairly good writer, and have experience with graphic design for social media. I’ve also got a lot of logistics experience. These are some of my areas of strength but I’m really open to anything that will get me out of politics.

1kizp28,Crossroads with this current job,"Out of all of the jobs that I've had in my 13 year career so far, this one is by far the worst. This one is getting so bad to the point where I might actually quit a job for the first time in my adult life. Here's some context:

A recruiter reached out to me about a position that I had around 1-2 years of related experience in (or so I thought). The position also stated that some scripting language is needed (so basically coding). Also, THIS TELLS ME THAT ITS NOT THE BIGGEST PRIORITY OF THE JOB (Basically like five percent). During my teams interview with a person from a different state, I stated that I had no coding experience but I am able to learn. He said that it wouldn't be a problem and that there were training opportunities. After the interview, I basically got a job offer. 

Come to find out, the position is a lot more stressful than advertised (since it's more of a management type of position), but that's not the reason why I'm considering quitting. My supervisor that is actually on site where I work at and didn't interview me didn't really understand what skill set I had (you would think there would've been communication with him and the other person that interviewed me) got really upset my second week because I didn't understand what he was asking of me. It was related to coding and how to automate metadata for PDF files. I didn't even know what the hell metadata was (now I know after hours of research). It was something I've never had to deal with at my previous positions when it came to documents. Then he went on a rant about how the person that I was supposed to be helping with office/adobe products knows more than me and asked me if ""his instructions weren't clear"". I told him about the interview with how I didn't have coding experience and that the interviewer said that there would be training opportunities. Then he replied with ""of course he did"". So I basically threatened to quit right away and that I was salty about revoking my LWOP (as a federal employee) for this position and he kind of back pedaled. We did both apologize for not understanding each other so we kind of had a little redemption after talking it out.

A few days later, After more research and trying to figure out what he wanted from me as far as this project went, it turned out that he wanted an entire code built (he was easier on me after he knew I had no idea about coding). He gave me another project related to this code, but wanted me to modify it (turned out to be really easy). During this process, however, our communication is definitely off. He kind of gives me the cold shoulder whenever I would say thank you for giving me the information that I need in relation to this project (basically being polite and professional) or even just saying thank you in general after he helps me with a technical issue. I would also ask him questions on when he wanted to discuss certain topics like instructions on "" how to automate metadata for PDFs"" and he either gives me a short answer (idk) and then walks away or sometimes doesn't even answer my teams (chat messages) at all (even though there were emails where he said that he wanted to sit down and discuss things). It's super frustrating and confusing. 

Now here's the personality of this dude that hopefully connects all of the dots in this post. In the mornings, he's super rude, a little snappy, and very short when it comes to conversations. He explained something to me after troubleshooting my computer on what I should do and then immediately walked out without me having much time to respond. On top of that, ive seen him act this way to other coworkers as well. Overall, he's just not a very nice person to be around and it kills my vibe/ruins my day. Crazy thing is that he works in a different office from me, but he's considered my supervisor. I work more with the actual GS employees than I do with him.

1kiyur9,Leaving a job after 10 months...,"Been in field for 11.5 years. 3.5 at first job, 4.5 at second, 3 at third and now coming up on just 10 months at 4th. Aside from first have been recruited to subsequent positions. Now being contacted by 2 separate companies for Director level opportunities. Comp is substantial increase (400-500k salary) for the new roles. 1 would be remote at a medium level company, 1 would be in office at a very prestigious company and require relocating.  

I know that if I stay in current role I will have similar or better offers on 2/3 years, but hard to not consider them now.

I have been instrumental in recruiting new people in current role and feel like I would also be hurting them by leaving so soon. Could likely take 1 or 2 with me, but would certainly black list me within the current company. 

Should I continue to explore these positions or better to wait and allow for more career growth at current company? Go for the money and title? These Director jobs are type where people don't leave for 10-15 yrs, so tough to not consider.

1kiyqix,Need advice on Computer Science as career.,"  
I've been scrolling through the posts on r/CSMajors and I've been seeing almost endless doom and gloom. The numbers do look bad from what I'm seeing. Crapload of applications, a few interviews, and sometimes no offers. Which is not reflected in the statistics of the Bureau of Labor, but I'm not sure how they derive their numbers.

I'm about to decide by May 15th whether to matriculate to somewhat prestigious college (public Ivy) and they're a liberal arts school, so they don't have an engineering program. I have completed an associate's in both math and computer science. I really love math and the idea of being a teacher, but I know it's hard to find a job in that field. I also have always been into computers since I was a kid, I just never taught myself to code for some reason until recently (I'm 39 years old). I wish I'd learned to code when it was less saturated, but you wishing is pointless.

I kinda figured that learning machine learning might make a good career choice for building a career for the next 20 years, but now I'm not so sure. I had planned on completing a bachelor's in math and cs and then getting a master's in CS specializing in machine learning/data science. Now I'm wondering if I should go to a lower ranked school that has an engineering program and major in EE instead. Honestly, it doesn't interest me as much as stuff like graph theory or algorithms, but alas I don't live in a world in which pure passion pays my bills.

Additionally, one other consideration is that the more prestigious school will cover all my financial aid, whereas the school with engineering will not. Not to mention, I'd probably need to take some circuit classes at a cc first (I already know most of the math/physics), so that would potentially put me a year behind.

Any thoughts?",mathemetica,0,0.5,2,1746840505,2025-05-10 01:28:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kiyqix/need_advice_on_computer_science_as_career/,5,2025
1kiyhyw,AITAH for leaving a toxic environment but good co-workers?,"I recently recieved an offer for a new position at a different company after MONTHS of searching, interviewing and rejections/declining offers. I already accepted the new position as it is more in line with my career goals and what I want to do, but I do feel bad about leaving behind some good people I have worked with over the years.

For some context, the current job I have I have held for the past 2 years. Shortly after taking this position I realized why the job was open (very high turnover rate on my team) and quickly identified that it was not a good fit for me. I did not enjoy the work and was not particularly interested in it, good at it, or saw a clear path for career progression. Work environment was highly toxic with lots of stress and a “always on” mentality. Overtime with no additional pay and very short notice (I’m salary so on the very RARE occasion we would get overtime it would only be our straight hourly rate, no bonus or time and a half). I would lose sleep, be miserable outside of work and on weekends/holidays/vacations, and I noticed how the effects of this started changing my behavior and how I acted. 

After 2 years of learning the job and recognizing that while my skills did improve & I did get better, the job was still making me miserable. Had multiple conversations with HR & Management about how I did not feel like this role was the best fit for me only to be told to “stick it out” longer and that “change was coming” which never happened. Ultimately, this is what caused me to start looking externally. I was and still am burned out and recognize I needed a change.

While I know I am making the right decision for my career and happiness, I do feel bad leaving behind the good people I do get to work with knowing that the additional work will fall back onto them (they are already overworked just like I am) and also seeing younger engineers with less experience than me being misled into coming onto our team like I was. Should I try and give these younger folks a heads up? Or should I just say nothing and move on to a better opportunity like so many others have?

1kiy8q5,What do you do with a degree you no longer care about?,"I received a degree in film and media studies around 2 years ago. Quite honestly, if I really had thought about things, I never would have pursued that degree — but I truly didn’t know any better when I was 17 and choosing my major. 

I loved the aspects of my degree that were theoretical. Writing essays on film theory, filmmaking aspects and different media types was SO me. I loved a good seminar debate. But everyone goes to film school to work on sets or edit, right? So that’s the lane I pivoted into because that had a better chance of paying the bills (or so I thought).

But god, 2 years out and I quickly realized that I really don’t give a fuck about all of that. I worked a 6 month internship that made me realize that I hate 12 hour days on sets. I do find myself a skilled post production editor, but finding full time work in that field is next to impossible. I’ve been doing advertising work to fill my portfolio, but nothing entices potential employers.

1kixzh3,I may have some options but idk,"So background: I'm a 25 y/o college grad. I'm currently in grad school for a Master's in Business Information Systems. The majority of my experience is education/administration/HR related. I currently work as a Instructional Designer/ Sys Admin for a bank. This is the first job that I actually like and is leading me in the direction I'd like to go career wise. The team is small and friendly. Not really a lot of area for growth though. I am having to commute 30 minutes to work. The pay could be better, and I'm not sure how much growth or money there is available. I do like the freedom and support I have. Love my boss.

The dilemma:
I've gotten a new job every 6-12 months for the past 4 years. As a result of this and my time in HR, I've learned a lot about applying, interviewing, and selling myself. That being said, usually around this time is when I apply to higher paying jobs just to see what my skills can get me. Eventually, I usually end up leaving. That said, I'm in a predicament where I've been applying and I have been getting hits but I'm kind of iffy about interviewing because my department is about to go through this huge project where my involvement is evident. If I were to leave, it'd leave my really nice, personable, cool boss in a frenzy because she is dealing with a lot of at home stuff  and is also in grad school as well. I also think this experience could really line me up for a job doing what I actually would like to be doing and make much more. On the other hand, the hits I'm getting are 15-20k+ more than what I'm being paid now and I would not have to commute. I'd also likely be hybrid/remote. One of the companies has some unfavorable recent reviews but it's not for the department I'd be in. I also live in a studio apartment and am trying to pay down debt. And that kind of money would be pivotal for me to get caught up. I wouldn't have to take out as many student loans for school either.

All in all, I'm afraid to burn another bridge especially when my boss and team are so favorable. I don't see a big jump in pay coming for this position before I graduate which was when I originally intended to leave. I also don't feel the director is very open to me working from home. The current plan is to apply and interview and take what they offer me to my current employer and see what I can get. My worry is if what my current employer can do isn't worth it.

1kiv2sh,Strategies to successfully navigating a wage increase,"Looking for advice as I've never negotiated wages after the hiring process before...
So while I used to love my job it's hitting burnout due to task overload (work in healthcare and do a 50/50 job management and floor) and since starting I have seen a double in the amount of office work im tasked with and recently they've been asking me to scale up my floor hours....largely I believe to compensate for over promising other workers then realizing we didn't actually have enough staff to compensate for allowing their schedule demands (ie no longer working weekends/holidays, or floating to a specialty subsection of the facility 1-2 daya a week so they dont quit) ...so they've been paying me an obscene amount of overtime to ensure the unit remains fully staffed... I have talked with my boss and it's not going to change or be backed off for another 6 months at least(and thats being optimistic)

I currently technically fill 4 roles for my job (2 of which got piled on after another person quit during a time when I was backing down to nearly as needed on the floor however that has significantly scaled back up). This was causing me to consider asking for a raise. However due to some arguments that have happened on the floor I have discovered that there are a handful of people who i have significantly more overall and facility experience than (nearly a decade) in addition to more tasks and responsibilities....who make on average atleast $1/hr more than I do....(one was bitching a potential job lowballed their salary compared to current and it was my wage so thats fun)...I don't want to quit as ill be done with school and looking to change jobs in 2 years...plus i have a couple pet projects that I want to see finished next year... this has pushed me to ask for a raise...

So Im wanting to negotiate my wage....nothing crazy but I would like fairly compensated. But which role do I select to negotiate off of? Highest paying role? I dont want to burn bridges but I kinda feel like im getting screwed over....
Would it be overkill to bring in print outs of the 4 roles I fill (most of which in places are a full time job on their own) and say hey can we negotiate based on contribution....does starting at the highest end then scaling back usually work...I don't want to threaten to quit to get more $$ but I also don't want to not ask and regret it...do I meet my boss, hr, or both??",Own-Tap-2136,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1746829464,2025-05-09 22:24:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kiv2sh/strategies_to_successfully_navigating_a_wage/,5,2025

My manager and I dont like eachother, I think he is a greedy fuck that all he wants is to make a name for himself at our expense. He probably thinks I am a rebelious brat that has a problem with his authority ( wich is true). 

My concern is boss wants to probably eventually push me out. I say this based on some very hostile emails I am constantly having to cover my ass on.

My performance review is coming up with boss and higher boss and I am dreading it. 

I dont know if I should go in on the defensive, offensive or passive or a combination of both. I am not good at the whole ass kissing nonsense and I am terrible at liying and making up corporate bullshit. 

By defensive I mean ignore corporates forms and come in with numbers of how much $$$ I made to the company so at least higher boss knows my value.

By offensive I mean do I call them out on the complete lack of incentives, ignored agreed actions from previous reviews, and garbage office morale, in the hopes higher boss gets my drift and implements some change ( fat chance but hey I dont know).

By passive just go in, keep my head down and let them spew their nonsense and put no effort whatsoever. I feel this puts me at risk of him pushing a narrative against me.

1kisxyq,Got a 45% counter offer after accepting a new offer. Can i inform my new company to revisit compensation?,"


I’m currently based in the US. I accepted an offer from a new company (let’s call it Company B) a few weeks ago for $100k base — this was a ~17% bump from my current $85k salary at Company A. I’ve already signed the offer, resigned, and even finalized my relocation to the new city where Company B is located.

Now, a few days before my last day, Company A came back with a huge counteroffer of $145k base — that’s a 45% increase over what I was making. I have zero interest in staying at Company A (long hours, toxic culture, etc.), but this new counter has made me wonder: should I at least let Company B know about the counter and see if there’s any room for adjustment?

To be clear — I absolutely want to join Company B. I’m not looking to pit offers against each other or back out. I’m just asking if it’s reasonable to respectfully ask if they’d consider revising comp in light of this unexpected counter — or is that too risky after already accepting? I do know few folks in my team are earning around 115k-135k range (similar experience)

Would really appreciate thoughts, especially from anyone who’s been on either side of this.

I got an advice to change my academic background, so I got masters in economics. After that I got job in environment protection so I didn't even really use or have never used my economics degree. I guess it was kinda pointless.
Few years later I was planning to change my life a bit and got into a program that employed me as a teacher and I also got teachers degree kinda on accident.
So I have three degrees now. And I work in biology. Also as a teacher but im ending it this year, because im getting a lot of work in biology and also teachers salary is low.
I like money and general trend in biology for last 10 years of my life since im in the field is I don't see how to make money there. It feels as when I get good job opportunities it's always luck. It's opportunity based. There is no source of income that I'd know would be ther in 5 years. I always have a fear of having to do some low paid job where I can barely afford to eat. I really don't want to be poor and struggling.
I mean, i could probably get a job with my biology or my economy degree. But it would be barely mean salary in my country. And getting mean salary basically means being poor.
I have used to getting much more. Amount that I can live comfortably. And I really don't want to go back to struggling.
So I thought I could go back to university. At first I thought I should get masters and Phd in biology, as Ive got good money here at the moment. But then I realize, yeah, there's gonna probably not gonna be any jobs in few years and building career in this fields seems ridiculous and depends a lot of ass licking for older folks, which I just dont want to do.
So I was always thinking how sad I am that I have no skills that I could sell independently. You can't normally sell biology skills. You work in lab under some old folk and it's a lot of social climbing. I want more control of my income that doesn't depend on how much one old guy likes me.
Recently I started looking into land surveying (i hope this is right name for this field??). As it seems that these people have actual jobs that pay well. And that they have skills to sell. Seems like something where i could develop.

But. I don't know if its smart to get so many educations and not actually achieve and dig deep in one field?
I feel as maybe I want to study land surveying because i just cannot see my next steps and studying has always kinda been a way to make myself feel like im achieving something. When in reality I should maybe focus on degrees I already have??
Also I cannot decide if 29 isnt too old to start 4 year degree. On the other hand, i feel as studying is  a privilege and if i can afford it, why shouldn't I just take it?

Has anyone been in similar situation?
Maybe someone has any good advices?

1kirqr9,BA in Business Management OR BA in Healthcare Management??,"Coming to reddit because I struggle with trusting my own judgment lol.

I almost have an Associates in Business Management. I am approximately 6 classes away from completion. I have always struggled and generally disliked ""traditional"" schooling. I have been on a break from school for about a year and a half. Was attending online courses. I recently started considering some Google courses to further my education rather than finishing the degree. Then all of a sudden my job is offering an opportunity for what seems to be a more flexible way to finish a bachelors degree through Rivet schooling (if you have experience with them would love to hear your feedback!) I never considered i would get as far as a bachelors because I struggle with school but since it's ""competency based"" learning (as soon as you demonstrate you understand the concept, you get to progress), I'm hoping this might be different for me. Luckily, I have 6 weeks to back out risk free so I likely will give it the trial period to decide.

For me to start, I have to choose the degree pathway. The majority of my work experience is with my current job, and within the health care sector which has me wondering if I should consider the BA in Healthcare Management. However, I am in Sales, so I wonder if the BA in Business Management would be any better. It's also worth noting that I'm working towards a promotion. I was leaning towards project management and data analytics courses when i was looking into things so my hope is that by demonstrating my willingness to continue growing on my own (and utilizing programs and resources offered by the company) that I'll be able to move into some type of role like that. 

Any advice or thoughts are welcome!",icyMoonstone,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1746820718,2025-05-09 19:58:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kirqr9/ba_in_business_management_or_ba_in_healthcare/,5,2025

1kirbpr,"Got 45% hike after accepting a new offer, should i let new company know?","I’m currently based in the US. I accepted an offer from a new company (let’s call it Company B) a few weeks ago for $100k base — this was a ~17% bump from my current $85k salary at Company A. I’ve already signed the offer, resigned, and even finalized my relocation to the new city where Company B is located.

Now, a few days before my last day, Company A came back with a huge counteroffer of $145k base — that’s a 45% increase over what I was making. I have zero interest in staying at Company A (long hours, toxic culture, etc.), but this new counter has made me wonder: should I at least let Company B know about the counter and see if there’s any room for adjustment?

To be clear — I absolutely want to join Company B. I’m not looking to pit offers against each other or back out. I’m just asking if it’s reasonable to respectfully ask if they’d consider revising comp in light of this unexpected counter — or is that too risky after already accepting?

1kir8ej,Was I out of line in this convo with my boss?,"For background, I've worked with my current boss for a little over a year and we have historically had a great working relationship. He is very casual and jokes around a lot, and the culture on our team isn't super stuffy. 

My boss is a great manager, but at times he can micromanage. I don't think it's with any ill intent, I think he genuinely likes being in the weeds of a problem or data (i'm a Senior Analyst). This is generally great as he is very supportive and I can go to him for help and feedback easily.

A couple times over the past year there were situations where he jumped into a situation I in no way was asking for help on. It was never a big deal, but I jokingly told him sometimes he ""rides off on his horse"" to fix problems. 

Recently I heard through the grapevine about a project that will be coming my way from the business area I support and I casually mentioned it to him when we were on a call about something else. He immediately started digging into the project, asking questions and diagraming a solution while we were on the phone. By the end of the day he has sent his diagram to his boss for feedback, forwarding it to me after because he had ""meant to copy me"". I was frustrated by this because I hadn't even had a chance to formally meet with the business on their request yet and start solutioning. I brushed it off but I was upset that he took the project from me and basically did it himself. The next day he called me in the afternoon with another question as part of his research into how to solution this project and I felt my frustration bubbling up. He could tell something was off so I told him as nicely as I could (though my voice was shaky because I want to cry when I'm mad lol) that I felt like he took the project and solutioned it before I even had a chance and historically my role as a senior analyst is to own that type of thing. He got defensive and seemed to misunderstand my point, saying that it's normal to collaborate with your boss. I tried to clarify that I love collaborating with him and would of course always talk through my ideas before doing anything, but that in this case I hadn't even been formally asked to do this project yet by the business so I felt like he prematurely cut in. In trying to explain what I felt he did I said he kind of ""took off on his horse"" on this project before I could even start it.

Well, today we talked things through and I basically apologized for what I said and said that I know his intention is always to be helpful and perhaps I miscommunicated where I was with things ok that project, etc, etc, to which he apologized and said he didn't mean to imply that he didn't trust me and my work, etc. All
good except he said it did bother him that I said he ""rode off on his horse"".. lol he said he's pretty relaxed with his own boss and would never say that to him.

Now i feel super anxious like I was really rude and disrespectful and i've ruined the working relationship forever. What are your thoughts? Was my saying that in that manner totally out of line? Should I stop spiraling or look for a new job?

1kir2mb,Made an attempt to put in my notice,"Basically for the past couple months I've been burning out. I'm a work in for a marketing agency and the past couple months have been hard sprints of a wide variety of tasks across too many clients. I should've flagged I was drowning earlier but I've hit slumps like this before and bounced back so thought this was just one of those cycles. I've been with this company for half a decade and have generally have a good reputation for being hard working and getting things done but this slump cycle has been really bad. Early mornings and late evenings, weekends, cancelling OOO time to try to stay afloat. And then the panic attacks, insomnia, and nausea kicked in. Finally hit a point where I admitted to myself I'm not really bouncing back as things are, something needs to change. During this period my quality of work has declined, causing tension amongst my internal team (I think, could be me being dramatic) and I have even made some client facing mistakes. Was job hunting on the side but do not have any prospects lined up yet.

I know the general rule of them is to let them fire you, especially without another offer lined up, but I'm way past my limit and doesn't seem like my head is hitting the chopping block soon. So had a chat with my manager today and basically said ""think it would be beneficial for myself and the company if we parted ways"". I also said I want to make sure the transition was smooth and that I didn't leave all the client teams I'm on in the lurch with my departure. He was very understanding and supportive but asked me to give him a week before he made the notice official and I acquiesced, which I'm now regretting. I don't really think there's much he can say that will change my mind.   
  
Did I screw myself over by trying to put in my notice and then giving him time? Kind of worried I set myself up for punitive measures not necessarily from my manager, as over the past 5 years we've worked well together and haven't had any issues even with this recent slump, but maybe from project leads or HR or something like that",crocsgalore,3,1.0,3,1746818965,2025-05-09 19:29:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kir2mb/made_an_attempt_to_put_in_my_notice/,5,2025

When I entered this career (2019) IA wasn’t a thing yet, and design was thriving, as was something I loved, so I studied for it. Six years later, the market is hell and the competition is beutal, there’s no way to stand out without networking and even that doesn’t help as much. 

So, I was researching and found out I can get into college again without having to pass any exam, because I already hold a degree. And I’ve consulted which medical careers I could pursuit, and I could enter nursing, physioterapy and dentistry (even though is not 100% sure because spots are limited) 

The thing is, medical fields are stable, in demand, and recession-proof. Yes, I’ve read about the hardships and burnouts those professionals suffer too, but honestly, I’d prefer to feel that rather than the suicidal thinking I’ve been having while looking for job and thinking… is this going to be like this forever?

I have a few concerns too. First, my mind is my enemy and I keep thinking is late for me, but it’s not, right? Second… I don’t think I’m trained for the leven of study those careers hold, but I’m so, so ready to do it if I get in.

I like most things about the job - the work itself, the people seem like they would be nice to work with, the opportunities for advancing pretty quickly, the pay - it checks pretty much every box and I would accept the offer without question if not for one thing.

I don't like the location. I don't mind working fully on site, but this location just is not nice. I felt a little uneasy when I first got there, and going inside, its not like a typical office building. It almost looks like a giant old house that has not been kept up with.

I would prefer to go to a job that has nice facilities, but I am also aware that I don't know when other offers may come. I have a few 1st interviews coming up next week (for jobs that would be nice as well, with good pay, but don't have as clear of a path for growth), but this company mentioned that my written job offer will be next week as well.

I would hate to let it go hoping for something better that doesn't end up coming, or to accept it and then have to back out of it if something with a better location does come along before start date.

I just feel a little stuck and not sure what to do. I think this role might really get my career going and I think I will enjoy working with the people. Is it silly to want to work in a nice location? Or at least something that doesn't look like a rickety old house, where your boss's office is like a room in the house?

What's bothering me is that I have to work my way up—that's fine, start from the bottom—but none of their recent hires have gone to a trade school; they even have little to no experience.

1kinmyc,From Line cook to Cloud Security Engineer,"**Hey everyone, just wanted to share my journey in case it helps anyone else trying to break into cybersecurity.**

Less than a year ago, I was working in a kitchen with *zero* background in IT or security. I had no idea where to start—I just knew I wanted something different and was willing to grind for it.

I first signed up for a virtual career fair for IT, needed to get an IBM badge to participate in this. I came across an unpaid internship with the IRS (in the cloud security department). Not something I ever saw myself doing, but I figured, why not? It was only 12 hours a week and didn’t teach me much technically, but it gave me something to put on a resume.

At the same time, I enrolled in the cybersecurity bachelor's program at WGU. I treated it like a full-time job—40+ hours a week—and ended up finishing **22 classes in my first 6-month term**. By the end of it, I had knocked out **A+, Network+, ITIL 4, and the ISC2 CC**.

That November, I applied to 80+ jobs. Most didn’t even respond. I got two callbacks—one for a help desk job (not quite what I wanted), and another for a cybersecurity engineering consultant role. Three interview rounds later—HR, technical, and a project presentation—I got the offer.

**And I still can’t believe it.**

Now I’m working mostly remote, choosing my hours, and getting paid to finish my degree. The benefits are amazing—full medical, dental, vision, phone, tuition help, even sports tickets.

I’m sharing this because I used to read posts like this to stay motivated when I was just starting. So if you’re feeling stuck or overwhelmed, just know it’s possible.

If you’re on a similar path or have any questions, I’m happy to help however I can.",MeanHippo7926,2,1.0,0,1746810281,2025-05-09 17:04:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kinmyc/from_line_cook_to_cloud_security_engineer/,5,2025

In my A levels I got an A in Maths, a B in Further Maths and a C in Economics (1 mark off a B- got all papers remarked and went up on one paper above the boundary but went below on another by more lol). I underperformed massively and was devastated. After opening the results, I just completely distanced myself from academics overall and tried to shut them out.  During the gap year, I decided to go into sales as that was a skill I wanted to learn (and it wasn’t really related to school). I have had a few jobs in sales. Two door to door, one as an SDR in tech. I was really ecstatic when I got the job a few months back. I was working hard trying to improve but out of the blue the company decided to fire me with no prior warning.

Now I’m genuinely lost. That experience kinda ruined my perception of tech sales and sales as a whole. And my experience with education has long since been ruined. I cant go to the Universities I once wanted to go to and even if I could, I honestly don’t even know what I would study anymore. I feel nothing towards any career path. It really hurts to say that because as a kid I fell in love with so many different career paths: Lawyer, Forensic Scientist, Accountant, Prime Minister (yes I’m being serious)- you name it, I saw beauty in it.

Work-life balance is a priority for me and though I’m grateful to get a good salary, breaks & benefits, the drive is an hour each way so I feel like 10+ hours of my day is spent working.

I don’t know if I’m making the right call.","I don’t usually post stuff like this but I’m in a place where I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I worked in cybersecurity for the last 7 years. It wasn’t a glamorous job but mostly internal security audits, risk assessments, vendor compliance, etc. It paid the bills and for the most part I was good at it. Now when I think of it, I feel I just got too comfortable in the role.

Last month our entire division was let go. The company said they were streamlining with AI tools to handle most of our internal workflows. We knew changes were coming but not like this and not so fast. One day you’re reviewing access logs, the next you’re boxed up and escorted out the office.

I don’t even know what I’m good at outside of compliance reports and network diagrams. I’ve been toying with the idea of switching to something more stable or human focused.

1kiknq1,Taken advantage of,"I am looking for advice on how to deal with my current job situation. I’ve been with this company for about a year and a half now.
It’s a company that does contracts, so it hires employees for specific contracts. I started with a particular contract, however they way overhired and ended up having to move nearly everyone from the desk. I was one of the top performers and was lucky to get moved to another contract.

A few months into said contract, I was told that it would be ending June 30th. I was told they’d be looking for a new contract for me. I have asked multiple times about this and am not getting answers. It is now May, June is approaching and I’m getting really anxious.

I messaged my TL on teams days ago and he literally left me on read. Do I keep messaging him? Do I try to go above him? What do I do?

It feels like I’m being taken advantage of, like they’re getting as much work out of me as possible until they just lay me off. 

I make codes for insurance advisors, that’s what I was hired for. During this time, someone else was doing them as well. Then they moved her and made me take all those tickets on alone. I was drowning, had 30 tickets in my box at any given time.

Now they’ve hired and are training someone to do that. I was supposed to then be training to do contract reviews. However, this new person isn’t catching on as quickly. The daily quota is 12 codes, and they could have as little as 14 and ask for help which I have to do. I never received help when I was drowning. Now I’m helping them AND trying to juggle my own tickets/learn this new thing.

Are they purposely taking advantage of me? It feels like my work load keeps increasing or changing and I’ve seen no change in pay or any sort of answer regarding job stability.

What can I do? What SHOULD I do?",Kittenxkills,3,0.8100000023841858,2,1746802908,2025-05-09 15:01:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kiknq1/taken_advantage_of/,5,2025

My question is, is the base + commission considerably higher for a PCB? 

Also, I understand that if I go to NYC I would pay double taxes (NJ/NY) and with the hassle of taking the bus and walking 10 blocks every day, do you think it would be worth taking that offer just because it's a higher position?

1kijlq7,Working at Skyscanner,"Wanted to share my experience for a few reasons: 
1 - To help others make informed decisions & hopefully learn from my mistakes 
2 - To help anyone in a similar situation, so they know they're not alone 
3 - Hoping it makes a difference in what felt like a pretty hopeless situation where I couldn't do anything to change the outcome 

Storytime - 

I left my previous role where I had been at the company for 5 years. I generally enjoyed it - interesting work, nice colleagues, good perks but I wasn't learning or developing and wanted a new challenge.

I interviewed with and was offered a role at Skyscanner after a 5 stage interview process including calls, a task and a culture / leadership fit where I met with various people. In hindsight, there were a few red flags that I should have paid more attention to - 
When I asked how the role came about, I was told the person who was in the role previously wasn't a good fit and the hiring manager 'had' to step in and pick up work so they 'mutually' agreed that this person should leave 
There was just something a bit off about the hiring manager that got my spidey senses tingling, you know when you're just not certain that the person you're speaking to is genuine? Yea, that. But I thought that it's not easy to judge someone's character from a  couple of Zoom calls. I was wrong & should have listened to my gut instinct but was feeling a bit fed up and bored in my current role so took the risk. 

Fast forward 5 and a half months later and I was in what I thought was a regular 1:1 with my manager on a Friday afternoon being told my employment was being terminated. This was with no one from HR present, after no feedback on my performance over the last 5 and half months. This was following positive reviews from stakeholders and team mates in my end of year review and felt completely out of the blue. When I told her I felt blindsided by the news & asked if there was room for discussion, I was told no and she hoped I ""enjoy my weekend"". 

I spent quite a lot of time going over what I could have done better (tricky given I'd had no feedback, no probation check in etc.) and found out that as well as my direct predecessor, the same manager had also fired 2 other people from the same team in less than a year. I was number 4. 

I've since found out that 2 more people from the same team have also had their roles terminated both after around 2 months so I guess I was kind of lucky to last a whole 5 and a half. That's 6 people from the same team in less than a year. 

To give context on the kind of manager I had - she once set up a meeting with senior stakeholders where I was due to present my work. She didn't invite me. I found out after one of my reports told me about the meeting and forwarded it to me. Said meeting had no agenda and a generic title so I asked if I was expected to present my work (surely I wouldn't be expected to know that I'm presenting at an agenda-less meeting I haven't been invited to?). I was. I found out 2 days before the meeting after messaging her three times...the response? ""I thought that was clear"". Minutes before the meeting is due to happen, my manager is changing titles on slides, adding / removing content which naturally put me on the back foot and was something we discussed later about how that wasn't ideal and what I could do in future to stop it happening. 

I shared feedback about my experience with our people team, as far as I'm aware nothing has been done about it. I added reviews to Glassdoor which were removed so here's my shot at hopefully warning others - something I would have appreciated before accepting the offer. 

The most toxic, self-serving, narcissistic manager I have ever had the misfortune of coming across in my career. 

In better news, I'm now in a role I enjoy with a much healthier working environment. As much as this was a very unpleasant experience, it taught me how much a value culture and security over salary and a trendy sounding company. No amount of free snacks, drinks  and other perks make up for a horrible work environment.

1kijjfr,"My boss is an anxious wreck and it's hurting me and the business, how do I approach this situation?","I (F26) am the assistant manager for a small business. Less than 2 dozen employees. Been with the company for 8 months. I have learned a lot from my boss (F36), but a lot of the time I feel like her cleanup crew.

My boss has a lot of trouble with focus. Everything she does she does by brute force. If it doesn't have immediate consequences, it's not worth putting time into. There's very little time to plan ahead. I understand that when the business started she was more or less on her own, and it took a long time to realize she needed help.

She is an aggravating combo of incredibly anxious and unable to focus. We needed to put a piece of furniture together, and instead of reading the directions she just did it by eye. She wants to run through lists of accounts really quickly, but then sends messages to mistyped email addresses. Her spelling is awful, while I'm always very careful with the messages I send. This is a little bit of armchair psychology but both I and one of her family members that works in the business agree she has some untreated form of ADD and ADHD.

When she talks to customers she is incredibly reactive, makes big promises in ways that we cannot achieve. Every unhappy customer is the end of the world. There's never any time to celebrate the victories. It's always onto the next thing, and it makes it feel like **nothing is ever good enough**. She's been acknowledged by the company we franchise from as having done incredibly well, and still she's afraid. It's always so obvious that she takes the business personally. And she has had a whole life before this business, but this thing has taken over her life. She's obsessed and it's feeding her anxiety and worries in a way that makes her very difficult to deal with.

Her mindset is really bringing me down, so I could use advice on how to block out her nonsense. But really, I want her to see that we are not running this business out of survival mode anymore. She runs the place like we are three days from going out of business, everything is a desperate struggle to survive. Me personally, I want to run the place like the navy: be super strict and clear cut, cut out any room for finagling. How do I demonstrate to her that we are doing well nothing here is as life-threatening as she treats it?

For the record, I really like my boss as a person. She's super charismatic and attractive and sometimes that ball-of-energy is exactly what you need. It's just unfortunate that what makes her good at certain things in business makes her a liability in others. Normally I am a huge proponent of ""use your words"" when you have issues with people, but she has a nasty streak, and is not great with criticism, and I am in no way looking to leave or burn bridges here. I want to know if there's a way to demonstrate a better mindset, a way to effectively show her, since I know talk will just bounce off of her.

  
Thanks in advance for any ideas/advice you might have! I hope this hasn't been too ranty, I really did try to delete all of my nitpicks of her that aren't relevant to what's happening on the business side of things.

1kiircx,Bad vibes in my new job,"
I’ve started a new job in compliance at a law firm. Quite a large law firm too, have previously worked in one of a similar scale but I was a legal assistant. 

Thought this would be a step up and allow me to  figure out if compliance could be a career path for me. One month in and I’ve realised it’s not. Personally finding it quite dull and repetitive. 

To make matters worse I’ve been given a brief intro and explanation of the tasks and processes and then been shown how to do one task as part of this. 

The task is quite simple just going through new case requests. Although in reality it’s not that simple as there are a few things to check and then input onto the system. 

The person on my team training me totally rushed through the process, she was also rude and dismissive making it harder for me to ask questions etc 

Then I got thrown into the deep end doing case after case and it’s been soo repetitive and honestly volume of work was quite stressful, end of financial year business making things worse. 

Unfortunately have been making some errors which of course is my fault. But also feels a bit of a setup when my manager tells me to check this and that and it’s like the first time I’ve seen this on the system. 

I feel like the person training me has set me up by telling me to basically just rush though things, and now I’m getting told to be more careful and you actually have to check XYZ first. 


Now I honestly feel like my team is treating me like an idiot, but I really don’t understand why they wouldn’t give me proper training and explain things first. I have no idea when I’ll be able to move on from this task and learn more things, it also is driving me crazy to do the same thing again and again. 

It’s also been quite stressful, I constantly feel like I’m about to be in trouble. The person training me was just totally unpleasant, swearing all the time. I’m quite frustrated as I came into this job willing to learn things, work hard etc but now I’m just sick of it already. 

Overall I think compliance is not for me and this job is making me miserable. I’ve actually decided to study for the legal qualification exams/ do a masters in September. As I’ve realised I want to pursue being a lawyer so I suppose that’s one good thing to come out of this job… I just have to survive until September.

I had a child in 2022 and took 6months off. Then last year had to fight for my job (market development), the whole team  then got reassigned to report to VP of BD. Our roles changed from regional to national with no change in pay. I was also told job titles don't matter, but then my role was benchmarked and I was told I was being paid too much. I asked for opportunity for promotion but was denied. In the meantime, the VP appointed himself Chief Growth Officer.

I recently have had my second baby, and just before I went on maternity leave they finally had created a role that would be promotion. I applied but it was made apparent that they didn't want someone in the existing team as they hadn't hired them and they wanted someone they could mold. I'm now on maternity leave and when I return in October I have to stay 12months before leaving otherwise I have to pay enhanced maternity leave. 

Is there anything I should work on while on maternity leave and when I return for 12 months that will set me up for a more senior position? I don't see me working for the CGO any longer, he is a clear narcissist.

1kifr9l,Just found out a new starter of only 6 months gets paid more than me.,"So, regardless of the fact I'm actually leaving this company (funnily enough because of career prospects/promotion issues). 

  
I just found out that a new starter, who has had a lot of issues in their probation period might I add, is getting paid more than me. I've been here 8.5 years and have qualifications, etc. that beat him. 

  
I was going for a promotion to senior and working on this the last few months, long story short... my managers kept dragging it on and it's been 6 months and should have only taken 1-2 at most (I've already had many promotions at this company over the 8.5 years so know the process). My managers wouldn't update me and it would be 6-8 weeks with nothing from them and all that was left was a 30 minute conversation to finalize the promotion... but they can't seem to find the time for that.

  
I've spoken with them a few times of the past 1-2 years about salary and obviously during the promotion process and they advised the most I could go up to was by around £2k as I was already at the top of the banding for my role. 

  
I just found out my colleague who has no expereice in this industry, role, anything is actually getting paid the promotion salary I was told.. as their starting salary with no expereince or anything. I tried negotiating my salary a while back and was told a flat no, they don't negotiate.

  
I know I'm leaving, so this is kind of voided... but I still feel like I've been slapped in the face and the fact I've been doing the senior role of a year and even trained this guy feels Sh\*t.

The job stayed open until March, and then interviews began to be scheduled.

The panel told me then that it would be 2-3 weeks before they would know anything. 2-3 weeks passed with crickets, so I sent an email to the search committee to ask gently if there were any updates. They emailed back expeditiously and said that they were so glad to hear from me, and that they sent their recommendations to the dean and were waiting for the dean to do whatever he/she needed to do and they should know something very soon. Well, that was 3 weeks ago. It’s now been a total of 6 weeks, and the one email I sent to follow up has been my only correspondence. I don’t know if I’m just not in their running, and they are waiting to send rejection emails until they have their candidate hired, or if I could be their choice or at least one of their top recommendations?

 * A valuable, in-demand certification.
 * Salary range of $55k-$80k.
 * Flexible work hours.
 * A variety of job opportunities within the field.
My Confusion:

1kibqb8,Temporary Entry to Dream Job or Permanent Meh Job,"I've been job searching for about 8 months and was having no luck at all. I started applying more broadly and all of a sudden got three interviews in the same week. I've got a phone screening tomorrow for a development role in the arts and culture sector, I'm through to the second and last proper interview of a grant writing position with a non-profit, and I'm at the final interview stage for a fellowship with a state run museum.

I know I'm in a really privileged position as so many people are struggling to get interviews right now. Before two weeks ago, I was too. But now, I'm spiraling a little bit trying to get my priorities straight.

My dream job is working in museum collections. It's a really competitive field and this could be a much needed break into the industry for me, moving up from volunteer/internship positions to a paid role with a state museum. But...it's temporary. It's a 9 month contract and pays about $15 an hour and it's a 2.5 to 3 hour commute one way.

The other two roles are not at all what I want to do as a long term career. But they're permanent positions, still a 1.5 to 2 hour commute one way, but pay about $33 per hour and come with good benefits.

I've been really dejected and depressed for a few months from the job search and I'm not sure I'm thinking through my options clearly. I really want the stability and financial security of the permanent positions, but I'm scared of getting 'stuck' on a career path that I'm really not excited by. I'm about to turn 27 and I sunk half my 20s into getting doing internships, volunteer positions, and two master's degrees geared towards museums.

1kibpmo,Feeling Lost After One Year in Cybersecurity Sales – Need Advice on Where to Go Next,"Some context: 27M I recently graduated the year before with a VFX, animation major. But during my fyp, I already wanted to leave the field professionally as the job prospects where I'm at is really really bad. I managed to land a role as a BDR in a cybersecurity company, which felt like a lucky break.

But 1 year in, and I have grown to absolutely hate cold calling and the pressure of meeting that monthly sales goal. My lack of proper internships and relevant background doesn't help either and I've been asked to put in my notice if I can't hit my number. 

That said I have to say that in the past year of working here, I've gained some exposure to the space - though admittedly from a limited and probably rose-tinted perspective, as I have observed from the community. That said, if given the opportunity, I'd love to continue working in this field, just not as a BDR/AE (Sales role), I would be more interested in moving towards an operations, or as a Customer Success/SE.

  
Now the problem I'm faced with is this: Where should I go or what should I do? 

I've been told that the cybersecurity space is dying by seniors, joining the military division under cybersecurity requires a technical degree and isn't worth it. I'm years too late compared to my peers. And most companies in the region don't want to hire a junior CSM/SE. 

I'm considering to go for certain bootcamps, some backed by the government. But I would say I'm lost at this point on where should I be looking or what questions I should be asking. Has anyone gone through something similar? Anyone with advice or opinions would really help me right now.

Should I take the offer?

1kib6b4,Thinking of a second bachelor’s in Computer Engineering from a CSU — advice?,"I’m a 25M from California, using a throwaway Reddit account for privacy reasons.

I originally majored in biochemistry at a UC because my parents really pushed me toward becoming a doctor. Back then, I didn’t know what I truly wanted, so I went along with it. But during college, I realized I was actually more passionate about computer engineering especially topics like GPU systems and parallel programming. Unfortunately, by the time I figured this out, it was too late to change majors.

Now, after spending a year working as a medical assistant, I’ve decided I want to pursue a second bachelor’s in computer engineering. The problem is most UCs don’t accept second bachelor’s students, so I’ve been looking into CSUs instead.

My family thinks this is a waste of time and money, especially since the degree would come from a CSU and not a UC. They say engineering jobs aren’t guaranteed anymore and think I won’t find a job. While I understand their concerns, I still believe there’s a future in this field especially if I build strong projects and focus on something like parallel computing.

Has anyone here gone through something similar—switching fields with a second bachelor’s from a CSU? Did you find job opportunities after graduation? Would love to hear your experience or advice on how to approach this the smart way.

1kiaitk,Don't know what to do with my cs degree.,I'm 25 and I graduated with a cs degree about 3 years ago and haven't been able to land a solid position yet. Had some internships related to data analytics and IT/web development after I graduated. Then I was contracted to make some games using Unity for a big alcohol company last year \[can't show on portfolio since it's their property\]. I haven't had a tech role since that contract ended and have been working for the family business since last summer up until I found a new job. I am currently working a shitty customer service job that doesn't seem to have growth opportunities related to tech. I feel really stuck and confused and don't know what to do. The path I am considering is risky which is to work a shitty job while making indie games and hope that one of them does well. ,tirejuice,1,1.0,2,1746766884,2025-05-09 05:01:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kiaitk/dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_cs_degree/,5,2025
1kiado9,Struggling to get interviews despite sending out dozens of applications? (DO THIS),"This year, I helped 2 job seekers land full-time roles at F500 companies and venture-backed startups. Before working with me, they had applied to 100+ jobs and heard nothing back.

Here’s what changed:

	1.	Shift the Focus: I asked them to obsess over one metric—Interview Conversion Rate. It’s not about how many jobs you apply to. It’s about how many of those applications turn into interviews.

	2.	Stop Waiting, Start Reaching Out: In 2025, applying and waiting isn’t a strategy. I taught them how to send cold emails at every stage of the recruiting funnel to get noticed.

The result? No more silence from recruiters. Confidence restored. Better interviews.

Here’s a YouTube video I made about the learnings:

1ki9ax9,Struggling with indecisiveness in choosing a career path. Anyone else relate?,"I’ve always been indecisive when it comes to choosing a career path. I come from an Electronics and Communication Engineering background, but I’ve never felt genuinely interested in core electronics subjects. I’ve tried exploring different areas over time including front-end development, data analysis, and even considered business-related paths like an MBA.

Data analysis feels like a middle ground less technical than software development, somewhat related to my field, and something I might find fulfilling. I’m also drawn to the idea of doing an MBA, as I feel I could thrive more in roles involving leadership, decision-making, and strategy. But despite all this exploration, I still keep wondering: Am I truly passionate about these fields, or just running from what I don’t enjoy?

This indecisiveness is draining. I keep bouncing between options engineering, software, data, business and nothing feels like the perfect fit. I know I have potential, but I’m stuck in a loop of overthinking and second-guessing.

1ki8atv,Underpaid or just overthinking it - AmexGBT TC,"Hey everyone, I’m hoping to get some outside perspective on this because I’m starting to feel a little stuck. I work as a corporate travel agent and I’ve been in the travel industry since 2015. When I first got hired I asked for $25–$27 an hour but was told that range was really for people with 20+ years of experience. The recruiter countered with $23.

Now I’m making $23 and some change an hour, but we're hiring on my team with a pay range of $17 to $29 an hour. And honestly, that’s making me wonder if I’m underpaid—especially because:

I’ve got 10 years of experience at this point.

I handle executive-level small group travel for my account, train new agents, work on a lot of special projects from the GCM, and taken on all the extra work that our previous senior agent did before she change departments. I also know I could probably try and apply for a VIP or First team but I really love my team and clients.

I’m thinking about asking my manager for a salary review and requesting something closer to $25–$26 an hour, but I keep second-guessing myself.

1ki7t8n,How to make good money in insurance?,"I am 24 years old and recently made a huge switch from the world of esthetics (waxing, in particular), to INSURANCE. I know, completely different. I have my reasons. 

To be frank, I never had a goal for what I wanted to do growing up. I just wanted a job that kept me secure and able to afford things that make me happy. I grew up in a low income home, so I’m trying hard to not relive that as an adult- there’s lots of trauma to unpack there. 

Needless to say, I am happy with this job, but not the pay. I took quite the cut transitioning to an entry level insurance position because of the opportunity for financial growth. Which leads me to my big question- I am making $23/hr. My husband does ok for us, but we are still having a hard time in this financial market. I am not interested in going back to school, I do not want to tack on any debt other than the house we just bought together, but I am interested in courses to help me further myself into the insurance world. 

Right now I am an underwriter support with little knowledge. My goal is to be an underwriter (or something financially successful in the insurance world) as soon as possible. I am hoping 1-1.5 years. I do love commission based things as I do have the personality for it, but realistically, I need stability. My goal is to make 70k by the beginning of 2027. 

Any advice? Job roles, courses, licenses, etc.

1ki7sd7,"I understand the circumstances are not ok, however I need another perspective.","I work for a mom and pop company who grow 200% during COVID, basically it had an inflated backlog, I was hired for a Supply Chain Strategic Management; at the beginning the main problem was this company had containers being held for months at the port which is unacceptable, the COO told me they were OK with that because they were deciding what container to bring depending on the urgency of the orders (That was the firat red flag), I told them the planning in materials needed to change by looking at least 12 weeks production and customer orders to optimize the containers flow and stop paying detention and when I looked at the “backlog” the company only had enough orders for a month (that was the second red flag), then production started to freak out because there weren’t enough orders, and the “action plan” was to create work orders to keep production busy, but there are not customers allocated and when I asked the COO what was the budget for procurement, logistics and supply chain he gave me the numbers as if we had the inflated backlog (That was the third red flag). 
I looked in the system to see the trends in customers and what were the most common products to successfully push if the plan was to move from Manufacure to Order to Manufacture to stock, then the CEO told me the data was polluted and to not trust it (we are on the 4th red flag). And 3 weeks ago there was a meeting with the leadership team where basically I was blamed for not ordering enough material to support the orders (the floor is full of material and the inventory value is on the roof), but like I said there are no customers allocated to these products and the finished inventory is reaching millions of dollars and the sales are not even 25% close to that inventory and production wants to keep producing. Honestly I would like to hear another point of view, I have been with the company for 3 Months and I do not want to believe they want to declare bankruptcy or something. I have tried to talk to them about the risk in inventory value (taxes), now the tariffs and the interest rates if the company keeps doing things like this and they just blame me.

1ki7ai7,"Job posted online, how to start conversation with my boss","Im looking for advice on how to bring up the topic of seeing my job posted online with my general manager. I don’t believe I was supposed to see the posting since they used a different job board site than what they usually do. I have hiring authority but have never seen them use or been given access to this one. I’m expecting to catch them off guard and looking to make them as uncomfortable as I can about it. 

Additional info: 

I started this job over 3 years ago. I had performed a similar job for 14 years before leaving during the pandemic due to toxic work culture. 

I was unaware of when I accepted the position that The person who previously held it was not made aware they were going to be replaced. They just quietly posted and waited for applicants. I was told after the fact he was a toxic employee (of 30+ years). This seems to be the MO, as they have done it for another position while I was here. 

I have only received positive feedback or constructive criticism, never anything negative or threats of being put on probation or anything like that. The only “talk” we had was about me leaving early for kids sports/family events which was discussed in my initial interviews, with the owner and GM, and both agreed it wasn’t a deal breaker. I’ve even gone as far as switching days, making up hours, or using PTO to cover these events which overall happen 2-3 days over the course of 6 weeks 3x per year.  My GM does similarly for his kids sports as well, but he leaves much earlier than I do. 

 I am at peace with what is happening as I never wanted to get back into this industry in the first place. But my family had to eat. I’m already applying to jobs.

I've been with this company for 7 years now. I feel my concern about the role is more rooted in fear of the unknown and because I'm ""comfortable"" in my current position. 

Leadership even reached out directly to my own manager to let her know they see me as a good fit.

What are some things I should consider? Is it common to feel this sense of ""doubt"" to some extent?

Hi, I'm 19 and recently graduated from an online college with a degree in education, and near the end, I realized I didn't want to be a teacher, so I graduated through a non-licensure route. I chose an education degree. I'm 19 and recently graduated from an online college with a degree in education. Towards the end of my studies, I realized I didn’t want to be a teacher, so I completed my program without a teaching license. I chose education because I lived in a rural area with few job options, and I wanted to avoid being stuck in minimum-wage or manual labor jobs. I thought teaching would be a safer career with good job opportunities right after college, but I didn’t consider whether I would enjoy it.

Now I am thinking that I would enjoy a job in finance or business more. I just started working as a ramp and gate agent and accepted a summer internship related to education/office work. After that, I am thinking about going back to college for a business-related degree. Right now, I am considering a master’s in Data Analytics or Business Administration.

At first, I thought about pursuing a master’s in Accounting, but the college I want to attend requires a bachelor’s in Accounting to enroll in that program. I am unsure if it is worth it to earn a second bachelor's degree. Instead, I thought maybe I might pursue a master’s in Data Analytics/Business Administration, then if I can find a job in business or finance, I may later return to school for a bachelor’s in Accounting and work toward getting a CPA if I'm still interested in the accounting path.",AnxiousBrilliant3,4,1.0,2,1746752322,2025-05-09 00:58:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ki673r/should_i_go_back_to_college/,5,2025

1ki51gb,Healthcare job suggestions?,"
Hello, people of Reddit. I'm 31, and became a Medical Assistant about a year ago. Prior to that, I worked as a personal trainer. I'm trying to figure out what my next step should be as far as career.

I like being an MA so far, and currently work in orthopedics. I just don't know if I see myself doing it for the next 30+ years. I'd also like to make more money of course. 

The obvious choice sounds like nursing. It would give me a lot of options as far as where I could work, plus the ability to continue with education if I have the desire. I also know of a couple evening/weekend nursing programs I could get into that wouldn't conflict with my current job.

I'm also considering Physical Therapy Assistant. I really enjoyed being a personal trainer, and I think I could do well as a PTA. My biggest concern is trying to fit clinical hours for the program in with my MA schedule. Both my job in a physician's office and clinical hours for school would require daytime weekday hours, and I'd like to stick with my current job until I figure out my next move, especially since they do tuition reimbursement for employees.

If I'm being honest, neither one of these possible paths lights me up with excitement. I could see myself doing either one, and likely being content, but nothing has really ""clicked"" that it's what I want to do for the rest of my life. Maybe I'm asking for too much wanting to be excited about work, but let's be real...if I'm going to spend 40ish hours a week for the next 30+ years doing something, I want to make sure I don't hate it.

So, I'm here, asking for career suggestions. Biggest thing I'd like to avoid is many years of schooling... ideally, I'd get an Associates degree, but if anyone has suggestions that don't involve hefty student loans, I'd love to hear them lol. I don't hate the idea of going back for a Bachelor's eventually, but I want to make sure I'm earning decent money in the mean time.",ShamefulLizard,3,1.0,7,1746748732,2025-05-08 23:58:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ki51gb/healthcare_job_suggestions/,5,2025

1ki3xn7,Advice needed- jumping ship,"Hi everyone- usual disclaimer and apologies as I’m typing this on mobile. 
I’ve got family in a rural state and have, for a while, been wanting to move that way. My job, while pretty accommodating with WFH during the pandemic and years after still requires 3 days in office and has very few/set offices where I can work. I have a potential opportunity in a house that’s actually in my price range and near my family (does not happen often) but it would be 6 hours from the nearest office. 

There have been….significant changes in our leadership that has essentially destroyed the last 5 years I’ve had networking, building my brand, and maneuvering into the positions I wanted to go. I work in a pretty particular niche of the payroll industry and am trying to figure out if it would be worth giving up this opportunity to live near my family, or if I should just power through the changes coming through this next fiscal year. I worry it would be difficult to find a remote job that pays equivalent to what I currently make AND have similar duties, which makes me hesitate the concept of leaving. 

Im the breadwinner in our family as my husband has disabilities where he unfortunately wouldn’t be able to provide enough for us to survive. I know if I make a mistake, it could be disaster for our family, and where I currently am is, at least, somewhat consistent.

I’ll be honest- I also adore many of the people I work with and it would hurt to leave them and start fresh. I’m not the most social and am known for being “quirky” which my current team and coworkers find endearing but I know all too well has made it hard for me to fit in elsewhere.

1ki3qh8,Not sure how to move forward,"Hi all,

So I’ve been working this sales-y job since March and prior to that I was laid off from another sales role. Today I met with my two supervisors at the current org I’m at and they let me know my options are either to take a 30 day performance improvement plan or take 2 weeks severance and today could be my last day. I went with the 30 day pip with the goal to find another role within those 30 days. I am now not sure how to proceed, I want to get back into working in the nonprofit field since that is what I’m more passionate about and what I’m actually good, I used to be an educator in that field. 

I no longer want to do sales roles since the metrics are often overwhelming and I am not consistently achieving those quota requirements. I am also considering looking into customer success, client enablement or onboarding. 

I am good with people, strong communication skills both written and verbal and I am also organized. What are some tips or advice you all have for me? I am feeling anxious because I don’t like being told my livelihood is on the line especially considering I’m moving soon. 

Thanks everyone ",StatisticianSure1336,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1746744943,2025-05-08 22:55:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ki3qh8/not_sure_how_to_move_forward/,5,2025
1ki3qfg,Paranoia about new job offer,"A little background info. I am 33 years old, a married mom of 2 young children who has been working part time retail for the past 3 years. Now that my children are getting older I have been looking for a full time Mon-Fri job. I apply to a home health agency for a full time receptionist that is a close commute to daycare for the kids, as well as my house, which seems like a dream, the perfect opportunity.

This job initially called me maybe a few days after I applied, (Monday) left me a voicemail, called again next day left a voicemail again, and sent an email. 
Now I have been applying to so many jobs and had a lot of interviews at this point. When I finally get back to them (on Tuesday), I was told that I can pick from two interview dates that same week, Wednesday and Thursday of the same week. Person tells me they're looking to hire very fast, how soon can I come in to interview. I picked Thursday, today.
So- The first alarm bell (if that's what it is) went off when I couldn't find anything about the company on yelp, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, ect. There is a website, looks authentic, so I'm thinking okay it's just a small company.
Next alarm is when the interviewer gives me a different address than the one listed on my Google maps. Tells me that the one on google maps is corporate. Okay..
When I get there it is in a respectable building, 3 elevators, other businesses inside as well, has a plaque outside the door with the company name. Door is locked. Have to call to enter.
Guy who opens it (business office manager it turns out) gawks at me. (At first I thought, well, I am decent looking I guess, so maybe that's why?) 
He doesn't seem super professional, his demeanor is a little  awkward, not well spoken. This is another alarm bell to me for some reason. 

I have a weird gut feeling coming on already that I can't explain. Inside is clean, quiet. I am taken to a vacant staff room. 
I am interviewed by the head of the home health agency, and a woman at his side, who chimes in on how she started there/ect.
Interview goes fine, they have a lot of information on the history of the company, what kind of companies they also work with, and what my job duties would entail. How much I would be paid. That I also would be receiving an offer letter if I get the job, very official. 
Answered all my questions, asked if I had more, which eased my feeling of foreboding a little.
They are already talking like I am going to get the job(though keep pointing out IF I get the position at the same time) and asking how soon I can start. 
Truthfully I am not the best candidate, many other offices have turned me down due to only 1 year of receptionist experience. 
Like I mentioned, the whole time I have a strange gut feeling in my head. I am not nervous, not worried about a possible lifestyle change. I just can't shake the feeling the whole time I'm there. They tell me I will hear back by Friday. 
About 5 hours later I get 3 back to back calls from a different number than the company; however I have a feeling it's them. Then a voice mail that  is left by the business office manager; super awkward btw. He leaves his full name on the text message; so I look him up on Linked In. Surely a business offfice manager has a linked in? Nope. The voice mail and text say I got the job, and they're waiting back to hear if I accept the offer.
Please tell me that the gut feeling I have is just paranoia. Not sure why my thoughts went this way but for some reason I'm thinking, what if this is a scam, what if I would be in danger if I take the job, they're all working together to get me into human trafficking or something?! lol 
Just wanting a little reassurance that I am just being paranoid of such a good thing happening to me. I do want this job, it's perfect, but can't shake this odd feeling.
Any one else have this feeling about a job opportunity? Am I just being crazy?",EtherealAngelCake,1,1.0,0,1746744940,2025-05-08 22:55:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ki3qfg/paranoia_about_new_job_offer/,5,2025

I come from a relatively poor European country, and at 18 I decided to chase my dreams by moving to the UK completely alone to pursue my studies.

I studied at University of Bristol and did a masters in quantum mathematics. Super hard degree... part of it was learning python, quantum computation (high paying sector), and applied mathematics.

I feel extremely stuck as my CV seems incompetent. I graduated with a 2:2 or 58%, due to an unforeseen event that affected my family and cost me my mental clarity for my exams. I didn't wish to disclose all details to my university as it was truly scarring and too personal but shared enough to show that I was really struggling. But they didn't allow me to hide one exam from my average, which resulted in a 2:2 instead of 2:1.

Fast forward 2 years later. I got a job after months and months of searching and working in retail just making enough to get by in London (super expensive city I know, but was thinking here are all the opportunities and wouldn't want to miss out so decided to be broke for a while).

My job is in a tiny office where they have low retention rates (I thought it was good enough to offer me a start and enrich my cv although I should've probably gone for a graduate scheme). The company's owners son makes racist comments/jokes(?) about my country saying what's terrible about it and making me feel bad about being from there- and although he is married with multiple children has tried to flirt with me with relatively innocent but inappropriate gestures which I immediately set boundaries on and showed I was bothered with. He's also doing that with the girl I work with who has been there longer than me. I don't think she ever set a boundary for that however, not sure. I don't know if I can trust her she's given several serious hints I can't ...

I also get minimum support for my exams (only the books and no explanation of how the exams work or how I can book the next test with my boss claiming I don't need to study for the tests and he never studied just worked in his dads company for a few years and learned it naturally- he also claims his dad didn't teach him anything, I guess he might have absorbed it through osmosis lol-, no work from home, absolutely minimum pay ( I spend money every month from my savings just to get by and I still avoid going out with friends except for once a week when I cook with my only close friend to keep costs low) and I have the least amount of holiday allowed in the uk and no bonuses or any insurance or perks. Work feels often super high volume with no breaks other than the one for lunch.

This is getting long but I want to move to another company but I'm worried how it's gonna look in my cv. There is no way I can finish my qualification in a year and then look for another company as I am completely burnt out here and want to change sooner. Is there any chance I could do it without affecting my future opportunities? I feel often drained and the racism is high and the environment exhausting... it is affecting all my relationships as I've started to withdraw from them or they withdraw from me as I'm often in an exhausted state and not as cheerful anymore...

1ki2vl6,Should I change jobs for better pay and growth while still in university?,"I'm looking for some advice on a career move and would appreciate your thoughts.

Here’s a quick rundown of my work history:

* Worked full time at an insurance company during university for 6 months.
* Took 5 months to find my next job, which only lasted a week.
* A few months later, I got a full-time job in insurance that I held for 1 year and 3 months.
* I’ve been at my current banking job for the past 3 months now. I really like it — great environment and solid experience — but the pay isn’t great.

I recently got an invitation to interview for another job in the same field (banking). It pays $15K more than my current role and includes travel opportunities, which sounds exciting and like a good next step. I'm still in university and have 5 courses left until I graduate, but I’m managing well with work and studies so far.

My main concern is the job hopping on my résumé. I don’t want to appear unreliable, but at the same time, I don’t want to miss out on a better opportunity for growth and income.

Would it be a mistake to leave my current job after just 3 months for this new one? Or is it smart to make the move now while I'm young and still figuring out my career path?",Green-Soil2670,1,0.6600000262260437,0,1746742577,2025-05-08 22:16:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ki2vl6/should_i_change_jobs_for_better_pay_and_growth/,5,2025
1ki2tpk,Do I quit my job to pursue my side hustle? Is it time or am I just miserable?,"Hi everyone. I never normally write into reddit but I have found myself at a stand still moment where I don’t know what to do. Basically, i have known that my job is not for me for a year or so now. I have been pursuing a done for you editing business since November of last year, because quite frankly, I love editing and content creation so why not get paid for it? I have a mentor, who is an old friend of mine, who has been extremely helpful in this whole process and isn’t charging me a dime which is a blessing. Over the last 6 months I have gained so much knowledge and confidence in myself when it comes to finding and securing clients, and it’s starting to get to the point where my day job is starting to suffer. I wake up at 6, workout, work on my business for 2 hours before work, work for 8 hours (sometimes more) come home, make dinner with my boyfriend, then go back to work until I’m tired. Most nights 11pm-12am and I do it all over again. I have had some success and it has given me the opportunity to expand my portfolio and put some money back into ads for myself and software I have been using. I have been thinking about putting my two weeks in this month (May 2025), but I can’t seem to get the balls to set a date. My boyfriend says he thinks I should quit as soon as possible, but I’m still hesitant. I have 6 months worth of savings in my account, plus HSA money that would go to me after quitting, covering another 4ish months of expenses given I don’t have a medical emergency. My boyfriend also has a high paying job and works overtime most weekends, so if I need the extra support I know I have it. My day job is in an industry that is not very stable at the moment, so I’m worried about layoffs anyway. However I know it is a real struggle out there for finding jobs, and I would feel foolish leaving a job that on paper, treats me very well. Not to mention what my parents would have to say. 
Another thing that’s holding me back- I was thinking about putting in my two weeks next Friday, however my manager is on PTO. I’m thinking I have to wait til he gets back? I want to give him the courtesy of telling him myself before going straight to HR. And I don’t want to add stress to his vacation knowing he will be down a team member soon. What should I do? I’m losing my mind over this.

Got my first job (13 months):After 1,800+ applications, I finally landed my first role, but only stayed for one month. I had just finished my onboarding week when I got the news. It felt surreal, almost hilarious in a dark way. But through that experience, I finally figured out what I truly want and set clear goals for my future target roles.  
Laid off, accepted reality, and started searching again (2 months): I had barely accepted that I got a new job when I found out I was being laid off. I knew I didn’t have time to cry or feel sad. I could only convince myself that the “old new job” was just a dream.

I know the job market is rough for Computer Science everywhere—oversaturation, layoffs, AI panic, but I live outside the U.S., and the situation for other engineering majors (like MechE or EE) feels even worse.

Take the automotive industry in Europe, for example. It’s currently a mess, and a lot of MechE and Mechatronics jobs in my country used to be tied to it. Many local engineers were basically working as R&D outsourcing hubs for European car companies. Now that demand is drying up, those jobs are vanishing.

So yeah, even though CS is tough and uncertain, is it still the “less bad” option compared to MechE/EE right now?

1ki00n5,Advice re: Changing subject matter expertise + impacts on career,"Hi everyone. I'm lucky to be writing with a generally positive situation, which is that I recently received a job offer that has a lot going for it - located in my city (rather than remote), good pay, meaningful work and opps to learn, and a solid, interesting company. I took the job!

Nonetheless, I'm struggling with the content of the work. Without sharing too much about my work area, let's say I've built my expertise in one sector over the past decade in strategy for food and groceries. To get this new job, I'm using transferrable skills, but now the subject matter I'll work on is for, let's say, shoes and retail. I'm interested in the sector of my new company, but there are also unique and very interesting areas of my prior sector that I'm going to have to leave behind, or at least set aside. 

I feel a little sad about this! I feel like I'm going to lose sight of trends in the sector, and miss out on opportunities to use the subject matter expertise I've built, not to mention close relationships with colleagues.

**Has anyone else experienced something like this? How do you let go of some of your existing knowledge base and interests to make room for the new one and fully appreciate it?**

I can understand that I know a lot more about what I'm walking away from, and I know a lot less about what I'm walking into ... so maybe this affects how I view what is valuable and what is a loss vs. what the opportunity is?

1khz4ok,Hard to stay motivated at work when I’m pretty sure they won’t keep me,"I’ve been working as a contractor at a major SaaS company since March. Things started off really well — I got up to speed fast, my teammates like working with me, and I’ve been getting consistent praise.

But over time, I’ve noticed they haven’t expanded my responsibilities at all. I’ve been doing the same task the whole time (which I’m good at), but I can’t help but feel like they’re not planning to invest in me long-term. On top of that, the team is shifting some of their workload to another region and automating part of the process.

My contract ends in June, and I’d love nothing more than to stay. But at this point, I feel like no matter how well I perform, it’s not going to change the outcome.

Today’s especially hard. I just don’t have the motivation to give it my all when it feels like I’m running toward a finish line that leads to nowhere.

Companies already cheat by using AI auto-rejection and other not ethical approaches to deal with thousands of applicants. They don't even see your resume if it doesn't match 99% of the requirements.

To anyone that neede to hear this: It's okay to cheat, lie a bit, do whatever is needed to land the interview, because guess what, if you don't, others DO and THEY will get the inteview and the job.

1khww2l,I have 2 job offers on the table suddenly. How do I decide which to choose? I don’t want to regret my decision.,"I’m 25 in the US. I’ve been working at a company for almost a year now as an engineer. It was supposed to be a 6 month contract-to-hire position, but there was a CEO change and they put on a hiring freeze. After I reached 6 months I started following up weekly with my manager about moving onto direct hire. He kept saying “just another week or two” or “I’m actively following up on it” but it kept dragging on. As a result, I started looking for other positions. Yesterday I got an offer from another company, and 2 hours later my current company finally offered me the direct hire position. Here’s a rundown:

Company 1 (current company):

105k/year plus 10% bonus, great OT pay, 20 days PTO plus holidays, remote, in a specialized industry that I have experience in. I’m still learning how to be more independent in this industry, and while I do provide a lot of value to the company, I often feel overwhelmed by expectations and resort to asking for tons of help. I feel overworked and often work directly through lunch without leaving the office in my house. I also often work hours after 5pm and sometimes on weekends. They offer $75/hr overtime, and I’ve made very good money when I have busy weeks (probably adding around $10k to my yearly earnings), but it takes a toll on my mental health. I feel like I’m drowning in work and we’re constantly pushing deadlines and working extra hard, but at 25 I don’t have kids yet and I feel like front loading my earnings/savings early on could make like easier down the road. I often miss getting human interaction and find myself depressed without leaving the house for multiple days in a row, but I also enjoy gardening and hanging out with my cat during the little downtime I get during the day. Remote is nice, but it’s hard to get away from work when I eat and sleep right next to my “office”. 

Company 2:

$110k/year plus 10% bonus, unlimited PTO (yes, I know this isn’t always a good thing) plus holidays, in-person, and 30 minutes (worse with rush hour traffic) away. Engineering job in a field I’ve always wanted to get into (renewables) that I feel would be rewarding. It feels like a startup vibe, which is kind of concerning, but it’s been around for 20 years and has a good portfolio of projects. They’ve been growing quickly for their entire existence. It would be strictly 9-5, with little/no worries once I’m done for the day. No expectation of overtime. I would actually see the projects I’m completing since they’re local, which would be fulfilling for me. I mentioned that my main concern was the commute and the fact that I would need to buy a car, and they offered a $10k stipend to help me buy a car. 


I’m extremely hesitant to give up my remote job, especially cause 1+ hours per day round trip is pretty significant. I used to drive 1.5hrs round trip to work and it sucked. It’s like committing extra time to work without getting paid for it. I work much more than 9-5 at my current job, but at least I get paid for it. I don’t want to accept this new job and realize I made the wrong choice. 

How do I even begin to make this decision?",king-shnipple,5,0.8600000143051147,38,1746727668,2025-05-08 18:07:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1khww2l/i_have_2_job_offers_on_the_table_suddenly_how_do/,5,2025

1khwjz1,45 year old stuck in customer service. Where can I go next?,"Trying to get the best advice I can, so laying it all out there:

I'm 45, not far away from 46. Been working in Customer Service my whole working life; the better part of 30 years. No degree, just high school qualifications. I don't drive and haven't ever learned.

Had a lot of mental health, financial, and other issues in my life. Not sure if this is the right way to describe it, but I've managed to get my 'act' together and have a stable job, my mental health issues are under control, and I have a comfortable place to live.

As a result of my issues in the past, I've stuck earning £25k a year as my resume is littered with jobs I had to quit, I self-sabotaged, or just ran away from. No pension to speak of, no money set aside for a rainy day, and seemingly no hope of getting out of the self-created career doldrums I find myself in.

In all my jobs, I always do really well initially and there's always talk of me getting promoted into management or a better role - but it never comes due to my previous mental health issues and whatnot.

Now that I'm in a better place, I'd like to explore options for growing some kind of career beyond customer service. I have evening and weekends to develop, learn, and grow with something.

I'm happy to look into any type of job if theres a chance for it to go somewhere.

1khvt5v,My job is Unprofessional as a Whole,"I have been at my current job for 2 years now. I have been working since I was 16 (29 now) and I’ve worked at grocery stores, law firms, courthouses. Majority of my jobs are city/state government.

Currently I am employed through the city and the department that I am in is the most unprofessional place I have ever experienced. It is an agency full of different people and departments and it’s a prime example of anyone gets promoted because we are so short handed. Our manager never even interprets her emails correctly, they don’t hold people accountable, it is just a mess for someone who actually cares about their job. My job is heavily customer based, and the only way I feel I can mentally do this job is if I don’t care much about the customer.

We are literally about 20 people short handed, system goes down at least once daily, our agency keeps receiving complaints about how horrible our customer service is. I can’t even focus the three days that I’m in the office because there are people constantly joking, laughing, yelling, and even people who hum and sing and their desk constantly. I bought up how distracting the humming was and my manager spoke to us all in a meeting about it as a whole, but nothing has changed.

I’ve never worked such an unprofessional place. It is worst than high school. The attention seeking, fact that we are short handed, constant noise and distractions, I’m overwhelmed and ready to leave. However, I don’t know if I should stick it out because I do have Mondays off and only work in the office 3 days per week. Also with how poorly we are managed, it’s kind of like I can’t really get in trouble for much because there’s an excuse for everything (for example - late on processing work? That’s fine, we are shorthanded and the system was down anyway).

1khvcba,Best Path for Healthcare Technology?,"I am interested in Healthcare and Technology. I am trying to decide what education/career path makes the most sense.

I have the opportunity to go to medical school (accepted into a program). It would be fun to learn that curriculum, and feel rewarding to help people. I enjoy achieving and expect that an MD will likely be valuable whatever my future path is and add personal fulfillment. I am nervous about the insane cost of medical school debt (\~$200k in debt), and the long years of no work-life balance in my late 20s and early 30s. It seems like a broken system. I have been interested in healthcare ever since I was 6.

  
I have been working in tech now for 2 years, with experience in Electronic Medical Records. I did not major in computer science but took several high level comp sci during undergrad (and enjoyed it), and am capable of self-learning more. I enjoy innovating and thinking at a systems level. I have been intersted in tech ever since I was 12. I like the flexibility and financial stability of staying in tech. I am concerned that without more credentials in the space I may struggle to excel, but would be open to getting a masters in the future (still costs $ but less expensive and shorter timeframe). The future of tech seems a little uncertain with AI.

  
I know I want to be in healthcare no matter what, and I know I want to be in tech no matter what. I could either get education credentials on the medical side and specialize in tech, or get credentials on the tech side and specialize in medicine. The medical path seem more costly, but possibly more certain/stable. The tech path seems more flexible, but possibly less stable.

I recently graduated with my BS in microbiology and a BA in sociology, and I was also admitted into a MSPH program to study epidemiology and global communicable disease. For years, I was set on becoming an epidemiologist, but the job market is incredibly saturated with all that is going on with this administration, and the outlook for public health in general is very poor. 

I just feel terrible about committing to this program, and am wondering if there is something I am missing with regards to what I can do with these degrees/what masters programs I can apply to with these degrees that have higher pay and more job stability. 

I feel like I've wasted 4 years of my life by not going on the pre-med track, and I have no idea what I want to do now. I have considered getting my PhD, but I do not feel passionate about anything research-related to make the 5 years of minimum wage pay feel worth it.

I was thinking about moving soon, meaning I would start my 4th job. However, I know that I will be moving in July or August of 2026 so I would have to find another job again. In that case, I would be living wherever I end up moving to for 5 years minimum. If I were to move this year, by the time I move next Fall I would be applying for my 5th job. Does that look bad to hiring managers? Would I not be able to find a job because of all my job hopping?",Subject_Big_1245,6,1.0,2,1746712459,2025-05-08 13:54:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1khqp07/job_hopping/,5,2025
1khqkav,"Market adjustment, show offer letter?","

So I'm in the middle of negotiating a market adjustment to my salary. My managers, their managers are all in support of the move. They said they are preparing their discussion with HR wrt the justification

I told my manager my I had my been interviewing other places and got offers (this is true) and could provide these as evidence. My manager said they would raise it as a bargaining point, if needed, during their talks with HR.

Should they request the offers, do I show them the letter/emails as is, everything disclosed? Or do I hide the details of the interviewing company, logo, name of the hiring manager etc?

Fwiw I have a great relationship with my managers, have a good reputation as being reliable, been at the current company for 5+ years. I work in accounting. My preference would be to stay at the company with the market adjustment. And if not that, I would leave and move onto a new company

1khqjas,Anyone else feel completely checked out of their career but unsure what’s next?,"Lately I’ve been feeling totally disconnected from my work. I’ve built a solid career, I’m good at what I do, and from the outside everything looks “right.” But internally, I feel like I’ve completely checked out.

Not in a dramatic way — I still show up and get things done. But mentally and emotionally, I’m somewhere else. And the hardest part is, I don’t know *where* I want to go next.

I keep asking myself:

* Is this just burnout, or have I outgrown this path?
* What would I even do instead?
* How do I figure out what fits now — not who I was 10 years ago?

Curious if others have gone through this.  
What helped you navigate that “in between” space when you knew something had to change, but didn’t know what?

1khq448,How do you stay proactive in your job search without burning out?,"Job searching can feel like a full time job, and staying proactive without burning out is tough. I’m going after roles at Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, and I’ve found that timing is everything applying early can make a huge difference. I try to check their career pages directly, since jobs often show up there before LinkedIn or Indeed, but refreshing multiple sites every day was draining. I also set aside time to network, like messaging recruiters on LinkedIn, and keep my skills sharp with online courses to stay confident. Organization is key using a simple doc to track applications and follow ups keeps me from dropping the ball.

To save time, I’ve been using a tool called Onency that monitors career pages for me. You add URLs, like Google’s job page, and it checks for new postings every few hours on the Starter plan I’m on. It sends email alerts when new jobs match my filters, which lets me focus on applying instead of searching. It’s been a solid way to stay proactive without the constant grind. You can see it at onency.com if you’re curious. Another tip is to pace yourself set a daily goal, like two applications, to avoid overwhelm. Rejections sting, but I treat them as feedback to tweak my approach, like refining my cover letter. I’m still working on the balance, so I’d love to hear your strategies.

1khq2ko,Should I tell an annoying coworker how I got better at my job?,"I work as a project coordination at a totally average midsize firm. Organizing tasks, chasing people for updates, and trying to keep up with all the info. Google Sheets, Google Docs, emails. Nothing revolutionary.

Anyway, this is about her (let’s call her Karen). She’s a lot and somehow, I just don’t vibe with her.

She once booked a meeting with me just to remind me to book a meeting with someone else.

She prints most of her emails. Prints. Why?

She regularly ends team calls with “Okay, let’s circle back offline” which means nothing but sounds like it should.

A couple months ago, I hit a wall. Work was piling up, and no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn’t keep up. One night, I was scrolling TT and saw some videos about AI. I thought “lol ok sure” but looked into it cause I was desperate.

Luckily, I found helpful ones, nothing fancy, just simple like perplexity to research, otter to record meeting notes, saner to mange my docs and emails... But they really make me feel like finally I'm on top of everything again and people notice it too

Then, last week, Karen corners me by the microwave and goes:

“Sooo, what’s changed lately? You seem way more productive, like you found some new system?”

I wanted to say “Yeah, I found a few tools...”

But then I remembered when she accidentally deleted our shared task tracker. And when she told our boss I was being too experimental with my workflow. And the 13 back-and-forth edits on a Word doc

So instead I said “Oh, I just started organizing my notes better and keeping a closer eye on my to-dos.”

She nodded. Silence.

Now I feel kind of bad. Maybe I should’ve told her? Like... it might’ve helped the whole team? What if someone else finds out I’ve been using these tools and Karen hears about it from them? I don’t want to create drama. And what if this somehow backfires when it comes to promotions? Team spirit stuff?",ThenPar,104,0.6899999976158142,82,1746710752,2025-05-08 13:25:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1khq2ko/should_i_tell_an_annoying_coworker_how_i_got/,5,2025

1khozuc,Starting a career late in life with little success. Any advice would be appreciated.,"As the title suggests, I'm a late bloomer. There's some backstory context, skip to paragraph 3 if not interested. I got married very young, gave up education (didn't even have a high-school diploma) and had a couple babies while staying at home. Plot twist: husband leaves for another woman, hands me full custody and suddenly I'm at a cross-roads. 

That decision point led me to go back to school and subsist as best I could on part-time work, scholarships, grants, loans and what child support I could glean. I'm in Canada so there were many funding funnels through OSAP and bursairies. I grinded it out while raising kids and went to uiversity. I thought I would be set once I was done. 

I graduated with a honours bachelors in health science and just finished a Master of Public Health October 2024.I am 38 now. On this side of things, I'm not sure I made the right choice on that. I was altruistic and wanted to be a cog in the wheel of preventative medicine.

Since my graduation I have found finding work pretty much impossible. Lower-end roles won't consider me, higher-end roles are literally hiring people with PhDs or MDs in some sort of wild credential inflation even if the job says masters needed only. 

I've done *several* internships and practicums in government and local health unit organizations across policy, infection prevention, social programming evaluation. I even held a short term global health role in Namibia while my girls were enjoying a few weeks with family. 

I have gone to career counseling and have had my resume redone professionally but being in such an oversaturated market where I live (southern Ontario) I can't even get an administrative role to bite.

What should I try next? Do I leave some of my education off my resume? Do I focus on my general employment instead of my internships when applying to basic roles to secure a survival job?

I'm looking for any advice on how to pivot here. I'm open to trying anything that will at least allow me to pay my bills while I figure out a pathway into my field. I fully admit I am beginning to believe that might never happen.

Thank you for any advice or input you might have.

1kholz4,How to manage being called aggressive by my manager,"I am a recent engineering graduate and took a first job in consulting. I have been here 2 months and am the only female on my team of 10-ish. Around my 2nd week, I had a meeting with both of my managers where I was trying to get clarity about a project, asking lots of questions. Afterwards, I got a message that I was ""too feisty"" on the call, and is everything OK. I said yes, just trying to learn. Last week, I presented to the client and led a 30 min meeting. Felt I did a very good job. I've worked years of customer service and am very good at speaking with the customers. Always had so many compliments and great tips (restaurants). Now my boss told me that I'm ""too aggressive"" and that I need to tone it down. He said not to be offended, because all of the higher-up women are similar to myself and also ""too aggressive"". Keep in mind this is a guy who constantly says ""fuck"" and talks about how he loves fighting and bashing heads in, in front of his clients. I asked for specific examples and he entirely distorted one instance with a client. I mean, his recollection was 90% false. I want to get  feedback but I anticipate this is going to be a continued issue, because I'm really not sure what to change. I'm friendly yet professional and concise with my client. I understand this is an issue for women in male dominated fields, as I even saw it with my male counterparts complaining about the very few female professors in college, who were very similar to me. Friendly yet direct. Much ""nicer"" than many male profs. Can't help but think this is just sexism. What to do? Is it dramatic to want to leave the job over this? I had an internship for 1 year at a different company prior, and they said I was ""charismatic"" and specifically wanted to hire me into a sales role when I graduated, but there was a hiring freeze.

I know the AI tool will not influence the result or not guarantee you finally can get a job, but at least it will save the time.

I don't want to spend 5 hours/week to just check the visa status, and skill gap, why I can't using LLM to read the JD for me?

As for cover letters, I know most of my friends will write a template and then use chatgpt to make it better. why not just build some tool to automate it?

why using AI for job seekers seems unacceptable, but not for companies?

It's a four-hour bus ride for the job, and I'm too broke to afford any other way to get there

I'm going to take this history class, but I wanted this particular professor; he's literally the best teacher you could ever meet in your entire life, and it's kinda hard to get in, however, I did. I have three more chances to take this class at another time, but it's kinda tricky. The first chance I have, I would take a total of 6 classes, which I'm poor and can't afford, the other chance is where people usually pile on, so I'll be testing my luck. The last chance is to take it next summer, which I would struggle to get in again because no one is here during the summer, but I'm graduating a semester before. The school said that I can still graduate at that time if I only have one class left, but I don't want to take my chances with FASFA.

The problem is I can't do both because they happen at the same time, but what do I do? I have to decide today because the job already said they wanted me and if i wait longer to drop the class ill have to pay for it anyway.

1khlldy,"Stuck in My Internship – Should I Leave, Start My Own Thing, or Keep Looking?","Hey everyone, I’m currently 8 months into a 12-month internship working on internal GUIs and client-facing dashboards. Initially, I was excited, but now I feel stuck and unfulfilled - I dread work every day. My goal has always been to work as a web developer/frontend developer building user-focused web and mobile apps, but I’m not getting that experience here.

I’m graduating this year and I’ve been actively searching for junior frontend roles and graduate programs, but no luck so far. Recently, I got a call from a recruiter about two junior software engineer positions. The catch? They’re mainly Java-focused (which I’m not that proficient in) and seem more backend-heavy—not really what I’m looking for. Both would require technical tests or interviews.

Here’s my situation: 
- I live at home, so I’m not dependent on my salary to live. 
- I have some money saved up, so I could afford a few months of focusing purely on job hunting or building my own thing. 
- I’ve been working on a side project: a mobile app that I really believe could turn into an income source with the right dedication.

My dilemma: Should I stick out the last 4 months of my internship even though I’m unfulfilled, take a shot at these Java roles even though they aren’t frontend-focused, or leave now and go all-in on my app and job hunt?

TL;DR: 4 months left in an unfulfilling internship - kinda guilty about the thought of leaving early. No luck with frontend roles yet. Got called for Java-focused junior roles that aren’t quite what I want. Considering leaving to go all in on my app. I live at home, have some savings, and I’m graduating this year. 

Should I stick it out, take the potentially backend roles, or bet on my own project?

1khjaeq,"Just acquired a BGS, but feeling like I made a huge mistake after doing some research regarding my degree choice. If anyone has any advice, I’d certainly appreciate it.","For anyone who isn’t aware, a BGS is a bachelor’s of general studies. Frankly, the reason I decided to get a BGS because it was the one major that accepted most of the credits I had earned at a community college. I didn’t want my time spent at said CC to have been all for naught. None of my advisors ever said this was a bad decision, but I’m feeling that way after seeing a LOT of people absolutely blast the degree, particularly on Reddit, with some going as far to call it “worthless” or “useless”.

Yes, it is totally fair if you’re currently thinking “why didn’t you do this research before you went and acquired the degree?” I’m asking myself the same damn question. I did do some research, but clearly not enough.

I’ve gone from being quite proud of myself and being excited about commencement next week, to now not feeling proud at all and considering not even attending commencement. I really struggled with apathy regarding my education back in high school, so I was quite proud that I’ve now secured a bachelor’s degree. Now, that feeling is heavily deteriorating. I feel like I’m going to be totally unable to find an even decent job. I also went into debt for this degree. 

Any advice or suggestions regarding this situation I’ve put myself in would be immensely appreciated.",c_rorick,1,1.0,0,1746685277,2025-05-08 06:21:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1khjaeq/just_acquired_a_bgs_but_feeling_like_i_made_a/,5,2025
1khiyze,10 Tips for Creating a Standout Resume,"**Hey everyone!**  
I wanted to share some quick tips for creating a resume that will help you stand out to employers. Whether you're applying for your first job or looking to make a career change, these strategies will help you showcase your skills and achievements effectively.

1. **Tailor it to the Job** Customize your resume for each job application. Align your skills and experiences with the job description to show that you’re a perfect fit.
2. **Craft a Strong Summary** At the top of your resume, include a brief summary of your key strengths, experience, and what you're looking for in your next role.
3. **Focus on Achievements, Not Just Duties** Instead of listing your job responsibilities, highlight the measurable results you achieved, like how you increased sales or improved efficiency.
4. **Use Action Verbs** Power your resume with strong action verbs like ""managed,"" ""led,"" ""designed,"" and ""developed"" to make your accomplishments more impactful.
5. **Keep it Concise** Stick to one page, or two pages if necessary. Employers often skim resumes, so get to the point quickly.
6. **Showcase Your Skills** Include a ""Skills"" section where you list both hard and soft skills that are relevant to the job.
7. **Format for Readability** Use a simple, professional layout with clear headings and bullet points. Avoid clutter and excessive colors or graphics.
8. **Highlight Your Education and Certifications** Include your highest degree, institution, and any relevant certifications or coursework to show you're continuing to grow in your field.
9. **Include Volunteer Work or Side Projects** If applicable, add relevant volunteer work or side projects to show initiative and passion beyond your professional experience.
10. **Proofread and Get Feedback** Double-check for spelling and grammar mistakes, and ask for feedback from friends or mentors to ensure your resume is polished and professional.

I hope these tips help you create a resume that gets noticed! If anyone has additional tips or experiences, feel free to share them in the comments.

1khiylk,I don’t know what to do with my life. Needing help.,"Hi guys, I almost never post on Reddit so giving it a go because honestly, it doesn’t seem like any amount of push in my life so far has told me which way I should go.

I’m an Australian 23 year old male, graduated high school with year 12 certificate, put off uni and applied for Policing. I have been a police officer now for a little bit over 2 years, about to finally get my diploma of Policing. 

My problem - I am hating it. 

I don’t know whether it’s the work that I hate necessarily, but the stress itself that is involved and how much of an impact it has on my moods outside of working. It’s just not who I am as a person. It seems to have had a mostly negative affect on who I am. 

My dilemma - What to do now?

I have applied for and was pretty well instantly accepted into a degree in Environmental Science at a reputable university. It’s due to start beginning of next year. 

I have only about $20k saved in my bank account and I’m worried going to university will be a mistake financially, since Policing (for my age) pays well, despite it lowkey ruining me. 

I’m honestly feeling hopeless. I have a beautiful partner, some really great outside of work opportunities due to money and I feel like if I go to university and lose that cash-flow, my partner will be dissatisfied in me (whether she admits/ is truthful about it or not) and I’ll end up screwing my life up. I also feel like at the age of 23 years old, I am too old to attempt uni in my circumstance.

Summed up - Do I bite the bullet and just continue working where I am for the sake of money, or do I pursue university for a different lifestyle whether it may be a mistake or not? Any personal experiences?

1khiqrq,I (22M) am confused about which career path would be a better option.,"**Context (You can skip to the question if you don't want to know bg):**

I live in India, I completed all of my formal education from below average institute as I always valued skills over degrees, plus I knew my parents won't be able to afford costly education like engineering, MBA, etc. So I did my bachelor's in Commerce. I was always curious about tech, but I used to think like coding is just another hobby. When I was in my second year of [B.com](http://B.com) I realised how big the tech industry is and then I started to learn coding on my 2gb ram PC. I got average in it, but realised there are multiple paths within tech as well. I tried most of them (Frontend, Backend, UX design, Database, AI/ML and Data Science) until I figured that AI/ML and Data Science is something I like.

  
While I was learning these, I worked at a startup for Digital marketing role because of my interest in Entrepreneurship. I learnt Sales, Marketing, Lead Generation, Business Strategy, team handling, Optimized landing pages, etc. It was totally worth it. I practiced my coding and building skills along with it and built multiple ai tools and projects. Also, I took a course on Data Science and Machine Learning. Along the way I found that I like building tech products and found out about the product management role, so I am learning about product management.

**Question:**

Now my question is, I am familiar with design, business, and tech, and I have a keen interest in Tech. I have no real-world experience with both product and tech roles (although I have built tech products for my current company's internal use), my long-term (10-year) goal is to build and scale tech products. So 

1. Should I get into an AI/ML role, then transition into a Product role?
2. Should I get into a product role, then transition into a tech role?
3. Should I directly get into a Product role by utilizing my current surface-level tech skills?",introspector_01,1,1.0,1,1746683080,2025-05-08 05:44:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1khiqrq/i_22m_am_confused_about_which_career_path_would/,5,2025

1khidvh,Should I take the job?,"Hone my skills or take the job?

Hey all,
So I've got this job offer that's making me feel kinda conflicted, and I could really use some outside perspective.

I'm an iOS dev with some solid experience (came from web originally), and this new gig has a few things making me pause.

First off, it's fully in-office with a brutal 3-hour commute every day (oof). The vibe I'm getting is fast-paced but also low-trust, and apparently the tech stack is constantly changing depending on whatever project is hot that month. They're big on ""learning as you go"" which, honestly, is starting to sound like code for ""figure it out yourself while we breathe down your neck.""

What I'm really after is deepening my iOS skills - not just frantically adapting to new frameworks every other week, you know?

The pay structure is interesting too - base salary is... ok... but they've got this whole thing with project performance bonuses and quarterly incentives tied to GP%. Feels like they're dangling carrots to make up for what might be a pretty unstable environment.

Part of me is like ""hey, challenge accepted!"" but my gut is screaming ""burnout factory."" Also, if I burn out within the 6 month probation and my performance drops then I’m fired and wasted 6 months I could have been honing my iOS skills. 

Anyone been through something similar? Would you roll the dice on this or hold out for something more stable/remote?

1khhz5a,Advice on job offers,"I currently work a job with a local small business, sole proprietor in the real estate and construction space. Recently, I got an offer from a larger, well known company with an offer that is significantly higher comp compared to my current job, about 35% more. The comp is a base salary + commission + bonus. 

The thing is, I initially planned on leaving my current job because the new pay was enticing, but I recently learned that there is a plan in place for the current company I’m working for to incorporate, and I can get a fair piece of that, 10-20%. They also offered to match the base and up my commision. Of course, they did acknowledge that they can’t compete with the overall salary offered in the larger company. But with this new change, the difference in comp would only be about 10-15%, which is not small, but from my perspective the extra share of ownership could be a win in the long run. 

Sorry if there’s not enough details. I don’t want to give too much specifics because it’s a really small space and it would be easy to figure out what company if someone I work with reads this.

I’m in my late 20s. From my point of view owning a share of a consistently growing business has a real chance for upside in the future. But I don’t think it will ever reach the level of the bigger company. It’s a situation where I’m asking myself do I want a bigger slice of a smaller pie, or a tiny slice of an enormous pie. 

I’ve made a list of pros and cons, but I feel like I’m inexperienced and there are a lot of angles to this decision that I haven’t thought about or don’t even know to think about. If anyone has any perspectives or personal experiences with this, I would love the advice. 

TLDR: new big company with 10-15% more pay or same small company with less pay but 10-20% ownership + potential growth/losses.

1. I was super frustrated by my peers who decided to suddenly implementing a software to manage a process. I’m all for technology but this is just complicating our current workflow. It brings me no benefit. It’s unbearable to change for the sake of changing.
2. I don’t get along well with my peers, I feel that they create issues more than they fix them. I don’t lunch with them, but I am good in workplace niceties and can make decent conversation with them. But as friends, nah. 
3. I’m also stuck and possibly wouldn’t be getting more pay increment because I’m at the pay grade ceiling. I can’t get promoted in my dept simply because the positions r filled, and the management here prefers hiring external folks for these higher positions. I have been repeatedly told to seek rotation out of my department and consider other companies affiliated to ours. 
4. I don’t like my senior management, well not all of them. I just feel that our director likes to stir the pot too much. I can still maintain fake niceties with the director.
5. We have a decent work from home policy. There r some days we should be at workplace in person admittedly I’m abusing this a lot lately. I do like 1-2 days at office and turn up for meetings. My bosses does this as well.
6. My performance is average, I hit my targets. I don’t necessarily need to over perform and I’m kinda happy with the amount of pay I’m getting as I don’t really put in much effort. I mean I can hit my targets without much effort.
7. I sense my management do not like me and wants me out.
8. I don’t mind the pay for the amount of effort I put in. Just that I would not qualify for pay increments.

I’m feeling quite unmotivated at work but I need the money.. I’m also looking at other job openings, tho this means I have to be on my best behaviour for months and turn up physically at work. It also means I have to network and build connections again.

1khgpa3,A non-native English Teacher who wants to work abroad but don’t know how to increase chances of getting hired.,"❗️ The first three paragraphs are me personally ranting about my frustrations.❗️

I don’t feel comfortable writing vulnerably for strangers to read details about my life, but I truly feel lost. I am in a desperate need for guidance. No amount of doing “research” would be equivalent to an advice from an experienced person in the field, especially if their life circumstances are similar to mine. 

I live in a “developing upper-middle-income country” but I hate using this academically fancy term when the reality of living here narrates a different story. Let’s use the term “Third world”for my country despite its obsolescence, mainly to summarize the amount of struggles and underprivileged circumstances that are overwhelming my desire to thrive in my twenties.

My government goes out of its way to make traveling abroad VERY hard, pushing a lot of the younger citizens to travel ILLEGALLY. Of course, those who choose such path are most of the time those who shouldn’t immigrate at ALL because they offer nothing besides social corruption (⚠️This pov is uniquely reserved to my country’s illegal immigrants⚠️). Thanks to this category of people, now even foreign countries put heavy restrictions on my nation’s travelers (Cant even blame them tbh..) I am just absolutely sick of living in 2025, as a 24 y.o adult, and not having the basic right to travel freely. I feel absolutely suffocated. 

Now, I have a Bachelor degree in English language, a masters in English Literature and Civilization, and I have recently became a PhD candidate (English Literature). That means I am expected to get my PhD degree in 2027~2028. I have a TEFL certificate and experiences of teaching at the level of university for a year now (still teaching), and at private language schools. One of them is a somewhat of a respected international center (that I’m quitting from, unfortunately, so I guess goodbye to that reference... ) and I do speak three languages (although i don’t think that’s strongly relevant.)

Now, my CV may look a little fancy at the beginning but it’s really not, and it’s depressing me tbh. What I want is to teach ABROAD. I want to experience the joy of teaching while moving around because I have a great passion for learning about other languages and cultures. I don’t want to stay in one place, teaching in one institution for the rest of my life. I want to move around, see the world, and experience life, all while working as a teacher. I am also a writer and want to publish a novel I’m working on, hopefully with a foreign publisher, so traveling would help me greatly in that aspect as well. 

My questions are what should I do? Do I have to keep working here to strengthen my CV or do I start applying overseas?? And what countries would they be the most open to hiring foreign teachers from non-native countries (I have few in mind because I have done some research, but I want to know through your experiences what countries do ACTUALLY hire regardless of nationality.)

Another question is: do I have to travel to that country(s)and physically submit my CV to increase my chances or it wouldn’t be a problem that I am located across the ocean and will only be down to travel once I am actually getting hired?? And what about my PhD? I wonder what are the actual procedures I have to take to continue it in a foreign country if I ever get hired. Each source says something different. 

Another important question is: if not a teacher, what other job positions could I still have a chance of occupying with my educational background?


I just truly dont know what to do, and Im sick of people shutting me down (quite rudely) the moment I say I am not a native speaker so I won’t get hired anywhere. Although in some countries, that is true, but I refuse to believe that my degrees and academic journey mean absolutely nothing. Please be kind when giving advice,  you don’t have to be rude even when you’re being straightforward. I need some people to understand that. 

Ps: Money isn’t a problem !! It’s getting a job abroad (which would make the visa application process a little easier) that I desperately NEED.

Touches all of HR and would learn a ton. Some stuff I’ve never had exposure to before but they were fine with it. Successful and stable company in much smaller scale. 

Honestly, I’m mostly torn on the bonuses. In 5+ years my current employer is projecting those to be around 25k. I will never receive bonuses similar again. 

However, this new role is a way more relaxed culture, more flexibility, a more exciting role (at least on paper), and would potentially help me learn hr much faster. I have only ever worked at current employer so going from 10k employees, consistent bonuses, and very corporate to a much smaller, laid back, less resources environment would be a HUGE culture shock. 

Base pay the same.

1khffiq,How to handle unfair expectations and gaslighting manager?,"I have a question on how to handle a career dilemma and gaslighting from my manager. 

Sharing some context, and TLDR in the end:

I have a little less than 3 years with my current company but have 7+ years of experience in my field. 

Over the last year, I’ve somehow become the de facto go-to person to get things done and for all questions. My manager has commented that I’m the fastest learner he’s had on our team. Our team consisted of 1 manager, 1 senior member, and 2 journey team members (myself and someone else). 

I’m currently the only person in our team (including manager) with experience in a specific tool, so all provisioning, development, maintenance, and reporting updates land on me. This is in addition to all other work our team does. The tool was introduced to us all on the team at the same time. The Sr member also learned the tool, but shes no longer with our team. 

The other journey level member of the team doesn’t carry her weight. She was hired 2 months before I was. She makes excuses for why she doesn’t have time to learn a job specific tool and other skills needed on the job. She does contribute, but as long as it’s in her area of expertise and can done in excel. I’m guessing she was hired for her business knowledge in hopes she’d eventually develop the technical skills. My manager is not very technical either and comes from the same business background so I can see why he thought that hiring decision was a good choice. 

The senior member of our team was promoted to new department last year, so I inherited her duties. The fact that I was completing work of a “senior” member prompted me to ask my manager how members were promoted and what criteria was used to determine that readiness. Manager responded with a couple of points (ie, stakeholder management, less supervision) as criteria for promotion… some of which I do but still consult with my manager for guidance since I’ve been at the role just shy of 3 years. Despite complimenting my quick learning, my manager suggested I wasn’t quite ready for the promotion. So I took that as a hint not to apply for the senior level vacancy in the team. 

Fast forward, we get a new senior member who was an external hire. I was tasked with training. New hire is now leaving for another offer after 6 months with our company. So the senior role is vacant again. I considered applying thinking I might as well get the pay bump if I’m doing the work. Coincidently, out of the blue my manager said I’m showing a lot of promise for the senior role, so I plainly asked if that statement was meant as encouragement to apply for the newly vacant senior role… he said no, that it mean I had potential and that he plans to assign special projects as opportunities for me to demonstrate my capability. Ouch, no thanks.  

Another thing to point out about the new hire’s work… My manager has asked me to inherit their duties so I can continue the work. I’ve caught mistakes multiple times while getting “trained” from the new hire. I brought the mistakes to my manager’s attention in hopes of getting some clarity. Instead, I get the feeling that he thinks I’m rocking the boat too much. He just brushed me off as if he wants me to put up with it for the sake of the deadlines. I didn’t even get the chance to explain that I don’t feel comfortable taking over the duties because I’m seeing potential issues down the line due to the new hire’s mistakes, not to mention that I also don’t want the responsibilities because I’m not being paid for the senior role.

As a team we can’t even keep our head above water with projects and deadlines. My manager loves to appease leadership and keep them happy regardless of our collective bandwidth and capacity. We have an upcoming deadline, and we have to also produce updated reports within that deadline… but again I’m the only person on the team capable of doing that portion of work. So hypothetically if we scrape by and finish with 1 day to spare, I’m still stuck doing the remaining work on the tool that no one else has bothered to learn. 

TLDR- It really bothers me that my manager doesn’t have consistent expectations between myself and my other team member. Additionally, it bothers me that he expects me to work in the capacity of senior member and train senior team members while outright telling me I’m not ready to be considered for for that position. Given that my manager has been dismissive over my personal concerns, I’m struggling on my to navigate this imbalance and advocate for myself. If I speak up, I’m perceived as selfish and not a team player. 

Thoughts? advice?

1kherx2,"Feeling hopeless with no idea where to turn, hoping for some helpful advice.","So I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this so sorry if it's not.  I'll be turning 38 in about a month and I have no career to speak of and no real prospects.  I went to college with the original intention of becoming a teacher but decided against it as I was concerned I wasn't mature enough to handle it.  To be honest all I was concerned about at the time was smoking weed and playing video so I just thought I'd finish my degree (bachelor's in english) and figure things out from there.  But, somewhat predictably, I never really figured anything out and just wound up bouncing from one dead end job to another.

Fast forward to now, I'm recently divorced with a 6 year old son and desperately trying to find a way forward.  I need to find a way to make more money and make up for lost time and I'm more and more worried that it's too late.

So I guess what im.hoping to find is a viable career path for someone my age.  Something I could train for, if necessary, within two years or less while still working full time.  Also, because of my son it can't require relocating or being away for extended periods of time and would ideally leave my weekends free as that is when I have custody of him currently.

So, if anyone is aware of any options that fit I would really love to hear about it.

1khcy3r,Interactive brokers/ stripe 2.5 years of looking for a job,"Hi guys, I need help. 
I’ve been applying for jobs since 2023 and was barely invited to the interview and never received any offers. I’m applying for around 50 jobs each week, and this was a really tough journey. 

I’m working in a SaaS company right now with a salary of 50-55k yearly. 

 I just passed 2 stages of an interview for Interactive Brokers (Bilingual Client Technical Support role).
They didn’t mention salary at all, but I told them that my target is 70-80k. 

The recruiter wanted to have a call about the final steps. This job requires being on the phone most of the time, from my understanding. 

I also just got another interview from Stripe - Product Support Specialist. I like the descriptions of this job more, and they have a range salary provided (70-105k).

I know they have multiple stages of an interview as well. On Glassdoor, it says it usually takes 3-6 weeks. 
I’m not sure what to do. I never received any offers before and had 2 interviews in a row as well. 
I know that if I pass in Stripe, it would be my best job ever because I can finally start to practice SQL and API more. 

Both jobs are hybrid. 
Any advice or maybe anyone has had an interview or worked for them?

1khcm6x,Torn on making a decision about a new job offer,"Hello everyone, 28M who works in IT. I have about 4 years experience and work as a Systems Administrator for a large local non profit. I make 35/hr with no benefits (contractor) (HCoL) and I've been there about 2 years now, my responsibilities have grown over the years to the level of engineer but ""budgets"" call for no new openings or raises for me. I got offered a Sales Engineer role for a IT company that is full time remote 100k with 6 weeks PTO and health/dental/retirement. I know it seems like a no brainer but here's my concern: 

At my current role I'm getting to be highly technical hands on and work on the top cutting edge equipment everyday, I have some major exciting projects coming up that would look like gold on a resume and if I stick it out a little longer here I could gain the experience to move on to a high level engineering role. I love my teammates and I love the mission we support but the pay is killing me and my manager is frustrating to deal with at times. This new role would be less hands on and more design and discussion heavy. Im very introverted and don't have that sales type of personality. On top of that im afraid I would lose my technical chops in the process and have a hard time breaking back in. Also I live alone and I'm not sure full remote would be good for my mental health? Not sure. But these are my concerns. 

TLDR: New role offered more pay and benefits but I'm concerned I'll lose my technical skills, forced to be overly social and become lonely due to being full remote. Love my current role and I'm on the brink of gaining gold experience soon but pay and management sucks. Scared to make the wrong career move.

I was given a role in upper management as a director in March 2025. I spent a week in the city discussing deliverables, what the role entails…everything that was expected of me. All of this was created with the COO. 

COO calls me this week and asks if I want to handle our largest customer and be solely responsible for that rather than being solely responsible for a handful of small accounts. It requires an entirely different set of expectations, deliverables etc. 

1) He has asked me to not speak to the current people involved with the account for information to see what I’m signing up for. 

2) even though it’s now an entirely different role, he’s made it clear to me that no financial assurance will be made until next year. 

So, I’ve got a great gig now and make good money.

1kh8ncz,One habit that really helped me with performance reviews and resume updates,"Hi everyone I just wanted to share something that’s helped me a lot over the past few years. I work in tech as a software developer but I think this could help anyone trying to grow in their career.

I’ve been in the habit of writing down my work achievements and ideas both the big things and the small day to day stuff like fixing a tricky bug, improving a workflow or noting down an idea.

It started as a way to keep track of what I was doing but it ended up being really useful when preparing for performance reviews because I wasn’t trying to remember everything at the last minute. Same with updating my resume. I had a concrete list of things I could pick from and tailor to the role I was applying for.

The idea tracking part helped too. Sometimes I’d come back to something I wrote down and it would turn into a small improvement or side project that actually got recognized.

If you’re not already doing something like this I’d genuinely recommend it. Doesn’t have to be fancy. A simple word doc or a note in notepad works.

1kh8ixx,I'm being consistently overlooked for internal positions despite showing strong interest—what should I do?,"I 24M have been working at a large private insurance brokerage since I graduated college just under 2 years ago. I’m currently working in the trucking division but have been trying to transition to our health department for a while now. I’m feeling stuck and honestly, I’m not sure how to approach this anymore, so I’m hoping for some advice.

May/June 2024: I applied and interviewed for the same position I currently am, just in the Health department instead. The first interview went really well and I had some good references from my current department as well as colleagues I had made friends with in the health department. But before the second interview could take place, I was abruptly told I was removed from consideration by the newly appointed VP, who wasn’t even part of the interview process and whom I have never spoken to before. The reason given was a preference for someone with ""more experience,"" despite the fact I have internal knowledge of the company and its systems. At this time, I was told while I wouldn't be considered for the current opening, they would keep me in mind when other positions open up down the line.

November 2024: I see on LinkedIn that my company hired two new grads for the same position I applied for previously. Both of these new employees have no real work experience (one worked at a local pizza place and the other at Starbucks per their LinkedIn profiles). I was pretty frustrated at this point and sent an email to HR and my boss, asking for an explanation. The VP of our HR department ended up getting dragged into it and told me he understands why I am frustrated. At this point he reached out to the department leads in Health asking I be kept in mind for any additional positions as they open throughout the year as those other two had already been filled.

February 2025: I followed up directly with leadership in Health, reiterating my interest. No response.

Today, I discovered another open position in Health, only to find out that it had been open for over four weeks and multiple applicants were already being considered—yet no one notified me. I emailed HR again and I’m waiting for a response.

The most frustrating part of this is that despite expressing my interest multiple times and showing I’m qualified for the role (even more so than some external candidates), I feel like I’m being intentionally overlooked. I’ve tried to be professional and patient, but the lack of communication and transparency feels disrespectful. I am starting to think this is being done intentionally because they don't want to go through the work of training me in another department as well as finding someone to replace me and training them in my current department. Did I mention that they are always looking for more staff in my department because, shocker, nobody wants to work in truck insurance.  Additionally, I have been very transparent with my company and supervisor that I do not enjoy my current job at all. I was actively job searching for about 5 months before I kind of gave up for a while. They requested during that time that I be transparent with them which I was. I notified them whenever I got far into an interview process so that they could prepare for my replacement were I to be given an offer. 

I don’t have another job lined up, so I can’t just threaten to quit and demand better treatment. My current boss always tells me he’s impressed with my perseverance—he knows I’m unhappy in my current role—but it feels like they’re just stringing me along because they know it’s hard to replace me in trucking. I’m not sure how much more I can push without seeming desperate or like a broken record.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How can I advocate for myself without risking my position here, especially when it feels like they’re intentionally overlooking me? Is it worth continuing to push, or is it time to start looking for a new opportunity outside of the company?",Horror-Reflection905,2,0.75,5,1746651760,2025-05-07 21:02:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kh8ixx/im_being_consistently_overlooked_for_internal/,5,2025

1kh7qv1,Professional Transition After Becoming a Parent,"Looking for advice on professions that might suit my desires and skills. I've work in non-profit education management for the past 15 years. Very dedicated and loyal. Stayed at my company 6 years and the second almost 10 years. Worked my way up to senior director role. A few years ago, I had a child and everything changed. I was no longer interested or able in working 60-70 hour weeks, evenings and weekends. I was also getting bored of solving the same problems year after year after year. Staffing shortages, fundraising and revenue goals, policy and operations management, interpersonal politics, etc. These challenges that used to excite me were starting to like mud. Stuck in it.

I took a break for employment last year to spend time with my toddler and get some perspective (highly recommend). Now that she's almost old enough to go to school, I'm thinking about where I want my efforts to go in the professional sphere.

Maybe, I should have been spending more of my time over the past year in ""career search mode"", but instead I was reveling in the joys and sorrows of parenthood. Now I'm ready to think about professional aspirations. What I'm looking for:

* Cognitively challenging (some mindless work is ok)
* Flexibility in work schedule (priority with my family needs)
* Has a social aspect, but not 100% people-oriented work. 50% independent work 50% social is ideal.
* Good potential for growth within company or industry 

A little about me:

* 40 years old
* BS in Operational Management
* I love to learn and tackle new projects. I thrive on novelty and cognitive stimulation.
* Skilled in interpersonal interactions and social/team dynamic management
* I don't mind going back to school, but would rather not take on the debt unless I'm 100% sure of a career path
* Fairly software savvy and can learn new systems quickly
* I can manage people and projects, but I'd rather manage myself and my own efforts

1kh6stb,Need advice on salary/changing jobs/current situation,"Hi! 

This is my first Reddit post. This is mainly to vent and try to put my feelings into words. There is a lot to unpack, so, I will be more than happy to read and reply to anyone who's willing to read. There is a lot of personal stuff going on, so I will try to keep it as generic as possible for privacy. 

  
To give you some context, I am a 30yo immigrant living in Madrid, Spain. I have a finances background, working at a big bank. I have some experience, even though not relevant for my current job (1 year at a big four +3 more as a team leader of 3). Furthermore, I have a C1-C2 in English (not certified). In my current role I have experience with data analysis such as excel, BI tools, reports, automation, digitalization, and so on... lately my bosses boss has taken a like to me and has been handing me more and more responsibilities as leader of projects (project management basically). Where I am, among other things, the middleman between the end user and the developers. I have learned A LOT, and it's very good stuff on paper. 

The bad? You've guessed it. The salary. I'm making about €36k/year. Which in all honesty is not *bad, really*. The thing is, I keep getting responsibilities that are very well above my pay grade, such as representing the company in forums where I do not really have the ability to decide or reply the type of questions that are being thrown around. And even though I did get a raise this year (around €3k), I am still the lowest category the company has. 

Now, this company has the most stupid policy for raises. They only give raises *once a year.* Moreover, the amount of raises is *capped by department.* Meaning that the big boss gets X amount of raises per year to split among the entire department. So, to put that into perspective, this year, less than 10% of the department received a raise (I know, lucky me). But wait, it gets better. Because of the way the categories are structured, if I happen to be among the lucky few the next year, my raise will only be for about €1k because I am at the higher cap of the salary for my category. This means I need to get lucky three years in a row in order to reach the 40k threshold. Highly unlikely. This said, I know this is not impossible since my bosses boss has me basically under his wing. He keeps promising things like hiring people under me, and so on. Which I kind of believe him, but I know it will be a very slow career. 

I know my bosses boss make around € 80-140k a year as upper management (they are super unclear on the career path) but I don't think I can get there for at least 20 years (he got there in 14) unless I jump to a different department.

The good? I have a lot of stability. I know I will not get fired unless I make a massive mistake. The workload is not insanely high. Like any job, there are high peaks at times, but generally speaking, I am pretty much left to manage my work the way I want without any micromanagement, and it is super chill as long as I am on top of everything. Because the bureaucracy is crazy high, I can handle several projects at the same time while each one go at their own pace. 

Because I work at a financial entity, one of the main benefits I get is a mortgage. Let's say, without this benefit, it would be at least 5 years until I can afford a house, but it really is no use for me at the moment anyway because, at my salary, I cannot afford anything where I would live for at least 3 years. I could just buy and rent, but even then, I would be basically at €0 left, and I would get a crazy high interest rate if I leave the company (this is how they keep people from leaving). 

There's also my team. They are all about my age, and we have a very good work environment. I know that my closest colleague could switch jobs any time now (not getting into details because this post is already long as it is) but most of my other work friends will stay indefinitely, or for at the very least another 5 years. Mainly because they have a low workload, a secure job, and hopes to grow, although slow. 

About a year ago, a colleague left the company because he found a job with €50k/year salary. This is where I started considering also look for another job. After summer, I had been in three processes, one for €42k, and two for €45k at two digital banks and regular bank. But due to ""bad timing"" none came through. Long story short, I joined the processes over two weeks after the opening where a few applicants were ahead on the process, but my profile was excellent for all the openings. At that moment, the workload became insanely high, so I stopped looking because basically, looking for a job requires a lot of effort which I simply did not have the energy for at that time. 

The job market is not particularly good in Spain, this one friend got fired due to bad management from his boss (or so he says) and another colleague who jumped departments also got fired (reasons unknown to me). 

There is also the job location. I have a hybrid contract, and I get to work remotely one day of the week. But the office is about 1h15m from my house in public transport and I don't have enough money to neither move nor to get a car. 

I have been looking at Data analysis jobs and figured if learned python I could get a job somewhat easily. I have started as a personal hobby and I really enjoy it. Although I know ChatGPT is carrying me through most of it, it has been very good to get into a more developer mindset. Since I know the logic that I need, I just need help with the syntax. I also love integrating systems (backend, frontend, DB, BI, etc.). I also have a friend in the fintech industry, where he mentioned that considering what I am currently working on, I could apply to product owner/management jobs, which apparently are very high paying and have a lot of growth potential. This one friend is also earning about €60k/year, which depresses me. 

  
I guess where I am getting at, is:   
Am I crazy for wanting to switch jobs? Is my salary really that bad, or are these people just lucky to have these high paying jobs? 

I am very proactive and love tech, I know I can do high demanding jobs for higher salary, as long as there is more remote options and/or the commute is not as insufferable. But job searching is just *exhausting*

  
I do not know if I want to risk it and look for €45k+ positions. At the end of the day, I do not feel like I moved from a different continent to not just get by. I want to have a good quality of life, and money to not be an issue. But at the same time, I am very comfortable in my current job. I think I am finally getting the hang of it.

  
What do you think? Maybe I should wait for the 5-year mark and look for even higher positions? (€50k?)   
Should I try to get a data analyst job or maybe look for a product owner/management role??

If you are EU/Spain based, by any chance, what companies do you think I should look for that could get a good salary with growth opportunities? And, in your experience, what are good methods to reach out? 

In my personal experience, LinkedIn has gotten me a good *zero* calls. I get a lot of positive feedback from InfoJobs, but I find that those are mainly external recruiters. I also feel like my profile would do good with a headhunter, but I have not been able to connect with one yet (granted, not a lot of effort from my part in that specific regard).

Anyway, thank you for reading my vent, and would love to hear your opinions/experiences, even if they are not exactly relevant to my situation.

1kh5u1p,What am I expected to know for my entry level finance job out of college?,"Hi everyone,

I'm about to graduate with a degree in Finance next summer (Financial Management track), and I've been feeling pretty anxious about what to expect when I start applying for jobs. Even though I’ve spent four years in college studying finance, I feel like I haven’t learned enough to be truly prepared for a role in the field. My main concern is that when I apply for jobs, I’ll be clueless and not ready for the work expected of me.

Specifically, what financial literature or skills am I expected to know before I get hired? Should I be proficient in creating large financial models, and analyzing financial statements in detail, or is it more about understanding the general framework of finance? For example, should I just be comfortable interpreting financial statements and have a basic understanding of finance concepts, or is more advanced knowledge expected?

I’m worried that I’ll get into a job and feel overwhelmed by the expectation to have skills I wasn’t taught/didn't memorize, even though I have a degree in finance. I am constantly stressed, and overwhelmed with the thought of going to a job application and being completely clueless. I plan on studying and taking the SIE exam over the next couple months to help acquire a stronger foundation for my financial knowledge, and also plan on joining our Student Investment Fund for my final year of college. Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated from those who’ve been in a similar position!

1kh5b8z,"Had to take medical leave, got put on a PIP when I got back. Feels retaliatory.","Throwaway account here to protect my privacy, and I'm going to be deliberately vague because my field is small enough that too many details will make me identifiable. I might be able to go into more detail in PMs if anyone's interested.

So this is part rant, and part solicitation of community advice to cover my bases. Long story short(ish):

* I work on a pretty dysfunctional group that has a track record of people quitting due to unequal treatment. The 4 people who had joined before me had all left. Two others have joined after me, but they're both within their first 1-2 yrs here and have family reasons they can't leave (for now). The team members senior to the 4 who have left are the problems, and have a track record of being resource hogs while dodging work. They also have a neutral-to-negative reputation in the organization, and have been known to be difficult to work with. I only say all this to provide context. Obviously all rants are onesided and I'm sure you can get a similarly angry rant from my colleagues if you asked, but... there's strong prior evidence that they're the problem here.
* I had to go out on medical leave. I had a condition that would eventually threaten my livelihood if I didn't take care of it, as it would affect my ability to perform the work that I do.
* The leave was done somewhat abruptly, as injury/illness usually doesn't wait on your convenience. In my field, when one person goes out on leave, the work can't wait - it falls on everyone else. Reportedly my colleagues were super angry about having to take on extra work to cover for me.
* For more context - in the previous months a senior member of the group had taken 12 weeks of leave as well, essentially for mental health. I (and others) covered for this person without complaint.
* Upon my return, my senior colleagues were palpably hostile. Apparently one of the main complaints was that they had to spend extra time deciphering my documentation format, which was quite different from theirs - but this is not unusual, as we all have our own documentation styles. We all had to spend extra time deciphering the senior group member's documentation as well. No one had never raised a complaint about my documentation prior to this, and my documentation format had never been considered substandard prior to this.
* They demanded that I change my documentation format to match one of theirs.
* At the same time, I was up for a formal review that happens every 3 years or so. This requires peer references.
* At least one, but I suspect 2-3 of my senior colleagues, complained about my documentation in their peer references.
* This triggered a Performance Improvement Plan from the head of the organization. The wording of it was relatively vague, and the exact complaints were not identified, nor evidenced.
* Simultaneous to all this, I had already been seriously looking for a job switch over the last few months. All of the above was just icing on the cake. The overall dysfunction and unfairnesses in the group had long before already convinced me to move on. I'm already sitting on 2 solid offers, have 2 more on backup, and am working on a 5th. I'm just trying to decide between 5 great opportunities. So part of me wants to just bail and run immediately.
* BUT - this feels unfair and like something I should tread carefully on. There was NO discussion of any of this to my face, and there had been zero concerns registered prior to the PIP suddenly being put in place. It feels 0-60 in 0.2 seconds, and frankly it feels retaliatory. I want to protect myself. I don't want this to somehow become a black cloud that follows me in the future. The PIP is, as far as I know, confidential and not something that can really affect me in the future - but I want to, as much as I can, cover my ass and leave on good terms because I don't trust these assholes not to try to retaliate further. Soon after I joined this group, one of the disgruntled previous members left, and one of the senior members was talking about reporting the one that left to our gov't supervisory body for ... bullshit reasons, basically. So they have a history of doing shit like this.
* For still more context - these people also have a habit of escalating shit to extreme levels with no warning. They tried to get a junior member of the organization fired just last year (a HUGE escalation) for minor concerns that half of us didn't even share, with absolutely no prior communication of concerns to her.
* One last bit of context - for what it's worth, the supervisor who had the PIP meeting with me was not one of the problem group of colleagues. He seemed positive and it didn't feel like a formality on the way to a firing. I'm fortunate to be in an industry that's a bit of a ""buyer's market"" - employees with my particular skillset are rare and very highly in demand. I'll just put it this way: over the last few months of looking for a job change (which started long before this ""final straw"" moment), there wasn't a single job that I applied to that I didn't get an offer from. Meanwhile my organization is struggling and likely to go under a hiring freeze. I think they are motivated to retain me if possible, but I am not going to stay - especially not after this. This isn't a ""how do I save my job"" post; it's a ""how do I get out without further damage.""
* And finally, I'm just pissed as hell about this. I've frankly done more than my fair share of doing the work my senior colleagues have been dodging. I'm pissed as hell these ungrateful MFers not only have dumped extra work on me for the last few years, they'd turn around and basically punish me for daring to have a career-threatening medical issue that caused me to dump work back on them.

The PIP meeting happened just this morning. I'm already seeking an employment lawyer - not necessarily because I plan to sue or anything, but just so I have my ass covered in case THEY try to retaliate further. But I'd appreciate any thoughts on things I might need to watch out for/think about/do.",Regular_Blueberry170,5,0.7300000190734863,9,1746643964,2025-05-07 18:52:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kh5b8z/had_to_take_medical_leave_got_put_on_a_pip_when_i/,5,2025
1kh5817,ChatGPT Said Social Worker Is One of the Worst Jobs—And That Tech Is Much Better… Should I Make the Jump?,"Lately, I’ve been seriously reflecting on my career. I’m a social worker, and while I’ve poured my heart into this field, I just can’t see myself doing this for the next 20 years. The workload is intense, the pay is low (especially in high-cost cities like Los Angeles), and the emotional toll is relentless. On top of that, being in a role that requires constant communication can be draining—especially since English isn’t my first language, even though I’m fluent.

I asked ChatGPT what the worst jobs in the U.S. are, and social work made the list. No surprise there. It also said that careers in tech—like UX design/research, cybersecurity, and software engineering—offer better pay, more flexibility, and lower emotional burnout. That really got me thinking.

I’m now seriously considering transitioning into one of these fields. I’m based in the U.S. and would love advice from anyone who’s made a similar shift, especially from a non-tech background. How do you know which path is the right one? Where’s the best place to start if I want to explore these options without going back to school full-time?

1kh4j06,If my job is making me cry should I quit despite crazy good benefits?,"Context: I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and work in a manufacturing facility.

I had 0 internships/relevant experience in college, ok grades, and just 1 offer coming out of college. I started out in one of those rotational programs specific for a manufacturing/quality role, and after the rotational program I became the head manufacturing quality engineer for 2 different segements in the production plant. This job started out not so bad, however my job has become very frustrating and sometimes overwhelming since January. Since the deparment I work in doesn't make as much money as the other departments, they don't give us as much funding. So we are stuck using crappy machines/equipment from the 80's, then the next thing you know a bad part gets to a customer, we get a complaint, and it's all kinds of bs after that.

In March we had one of our 2 big audits of the year, and it was the worst two days of work I have ever had. After working those two 15 and 16 hour days, I actually called my father whom I speak to most days on my drive home and even cried on the phone telling him I hate this job and I want to find a new one and move back home. He is very understanding and says I am always free to come home.

Thing is, I would be leaving a job with crazy good pay. I'm now making $94,000 since a few months ago working in a rural LCOL southern state (USA) not even 3 years out of college. At this job I have saved $18,000 in my high-yield savings account and recently passed $50,000 in my retirement accounts, not to mention buying my first car cash last year. I realize I am incredibly fortunate with what I am getting at this age. But I am unhappy with my life

I hate my frustrating job, I hate my nearly hour-long commute everyday, I hate living & working in this rural area, I hate that my location has prevented me from having a social life, and I hate that I rarely see my friends.

Since late March I have started to apply for new jobs, but obviously with the current market it is difficult. I've applied to 30 jobs so far, and from those I had 6 different screening calls. Only one got back to me saying they wanted a few more years exeperience. I understand getting ghosted from an application, but getting ghosted by 5 different people after a call kinda hurts.

I don't really care what kind of job I have, I just hope I like it and it pays decent. I don't care about being the ""top-level design engineer who makes cool stuff,"" nor do I want to put in the years of work it would take to become that person knowing that there are plently of people already ahead of me in that situation.

If I am unable to find a new job by the time my current lease ends (early september), I'm prepared to quit my job even without having something lined up and go back home. I know I will mentally be better after that, but I am worried about my finances. I still have $70,000 in student loans since I recieved no scholarships or financial aid in college, and I am worried I may be unemployed for too long amd will burn my savings paying off my loans.

1kh33ea,"Would it be stupid to leave my current job for one that pays less, even if it would make me happier?","I’m 28 years old. Just feel mentally burned out and bored where I’m at for a number of reasons. So I made a pros and cons list but still not sure what to do. 

To keep it short I would essentially be going to one grocery store to another (different company) and the issue I’m having is if I leave where I’m at now I’ll make less than what I do now. 

I currently make $18.80 where I’m at now and I’m not sure what I’ll make at the new job. I would imagine $17.50-$18.00. Also I would get time and a half on Sundays. 

I would still be able to eat and pay all my bills but I would miss out on having the extra money to put into savings. I would go from having $600 to probably $300 left over a month. 

Here’s the pros and cons list for both. 

Current Job: “Grocery store A”

Pros:
- I take home $557 a week after taxes (Also includes taking out $19 health insurance, and $12 union dues.)
- I get 3 weeks of paid vacation, 72 hours of sick time, and 3 PTO days.
- I’m in the union, so my job is protected and I have seniority.
- I’ve been with the company for 8 years. 6 part-time across different departments, and 2 full-time in produce.
- I’m familiar with the environment and how everything works.

Cons:
- I work 9-hour days, 8 hours paid, with an unpaid 1-hour lunch. So what should be a 7–3 or 9–5 shift is really 7–4 or 9–6.
- I’m bored of the environment. It’s repetitive and draining.
- The job is about 18–20 minutes away, totaling 22 miles round trip each day.
- Must work mandatory 1 night shift a week. (12-8pm)
- My coworkers are cool and easy to get along with, but they can be nitpicky. On top of that, the other full-timer used to be both a produce manager and assistant manager, which makes me feel like the odd one out. I don’t feel like I fully fit in experience-wise, and I sometimes feel silently judged.

⸻

Potential New Job: “Grocery store B”

Pros:
- It’s a new environment and a chance to reset. I’d get to meet new people and have new experiences.
- It’s still in produce, so it’s a similar role I already know.
- I’d only be at work for 8 hours a day, no unpaid lunch adding to the day.
- I’d likely be out by 2:00–3:30 PM, which gives me more of the day back.
- I’d be working at the same place as my best friend (even if he’s in another department).
- It’s closer to home, about 12 minutes away and only 6.4 miles round trip.
- I’d still have 2 days off per week but actually at work less hours per week. 
- Can work overtime (on top of my Sunday overtime) if I want to. So I could work my regular 40 hours but if I want work 50 that week to make extra money. (Not 100% sure how accurate this is)

Cons:
- I’d probably make roughly $50 less per week than I do now.
- Health insurance would cost $40 a week, which is more than double what I currently pay.
- I’d be the new guy, no seniority, no job protection.
- I wouldn’t get vacation or sick time right away. I’d have to accrue both over time.

1kh311j,Seeking advice moving from the ecommerce industry to nonprofit work,"I’ve worked in the E-commerce space, specifically with outdoor, apparel, and footwear brands, for the last 6 years. Working in this world was never my passion, aside from the first few years when I worked with a rock climbing brand (I’ve climbed for over a decade), and I’m burning out doing passionless work. I’d love to do purpose-driven work, but I’m struggling to identify the types of positions my experience transfers to, that I’d also enjoy. 

For background, my roles have been (oldest to current):
-2 years as an Event Sales & Marketing Manager at a summer camp for a nonprofit (Covid took this job out)
-1.5yrs running my own wedding planning company on the side while at the nonprofit
-3 years at the climbing company as Head of Sales & Marketing (for the first year), Director of Strategic Ops the last 2 (In this role I was essentially a COO to give a sense of responsibilities)
-1.5 yrs as an Ecommerce Specialist for a private label manufacturer (managing the marketing and product data for 5 brand category catalogs)
-Currently 1.5 yrs as an Ecommerce Strategist for an apparel accessory brand (managing marketing, website, and marketplaces)

I thrive in the strategic environment; planning roadmaps, connecting departments and coordinating tasks to get things done on time, proj management, budget planning/forecasting, and analysis for KPIs or Inventory planning. Because I’ve worked at smaller company’s (under $5M revenue, teams less than 20), I inevitably wear several hats. That’s put me in the marketing world a lot - doing everything from copywriting, managing ad agencies, planning promo calendars - but honestly I don’t really love that work. It’s the same for Sales - interfacing with retailers, etc. I like being behind the scenes, doing research, bridging gaps between internal teams to stay aligned, and turning ambiguous goals into an actionable plan.

I’m not sure if there’s a great recruiting firm that works specifically with nonprofits I should connect with? I see several Executive Director roles an NPs I think I could be a good fit for, but it seems like a big jump with just breaking into the nonprofit space.",LooseCannonMoose,2,1.0,1,1746638501,2025-05-07 17:21:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kh311j/seeking_advice_moving_from_the_ecommerce_industry/,5,2025
1kh2zvl,Should i contact them again?," have been applying to jobs after jobs after jobs but nothing but 99% of rejection emails. My anxiety, frustration, and you name it have been increasing by the day. I am running low on funds and do not know what I will do when it runs out, as I live in a new state not really knowing anyone. Somes days or weeks I am able to talk myself out of the negativity and just keep applying but in the back of my mind, I worry. I decided to study to get a Security+ certification and I passed within a month. I hoped this would be somewhat of a game changing, add to my skills and 6+ yrs of experience in my field.

However, Sine the 4 months I have been unemployed and after getting certification. I have gotten only 4-5 interviews. I felt all of them went well but particularly I felt I was a very strong candidate for 2. I checked all the boxes for the position, which the recruiters also said during the interview, the salary range was within what we both were looking for and everything seemed good. I was hoping and waiting to at least be interviewed by the hiring manager, as that normally would be the next step.

Did the whole wait a few days/week and send a follow up email after an interview thing. However, no response. Waited a few more weeks and sent another follow up email but still nothing.

I know normally, after at least 2 follow email to a recruiter and you don't hear back from them. There might be a high chance you didn't get the job and you move on. However, once in a while I will get email from linkedin showing me the same position and both companies, It's been maybe a month now and when you check the company's site you still see the position is available.

I am really interested in these 2 position and believe I can perform the duties of these position. I am not sure if I should try reaching out to them again or maybe just try to contact hiring manager directly on Linkedin. I just don't understand why ghost a potential good candidates and not at least follow up with them after getting 2 follow up email?

Why not just reply and let them know if the company has moved on or put a pause to hiring? The lack of communication, which is ironic since that is one of the questions they love to always ask during an interview is downton to me.

Any suggestion, advice or insight is appreciated.

Data analysis has always been something that drives me very much! It has always caught my attention. 

Would it be able to land any decent jobs, assuming that experience is always a factor? Should I consider any others? Given that my bachelor is not very tech savvy.

1kh26sl,Moderately successful trans woman with a useless Bachelor's trying to make a career change,"So some background. I started working full-time at my current office job while I was attending school. It's been almost five years since I graduated, seven years total I've been working as a manager with changing roles here. I am a trans woman, and I've been actively transitioning for 3 years now, but I'm closeted at my current job because although it's an easy office position, it's still a stereotypical HVAC company, run by and filled with some serious bigots. 

I make decent money for my age (65k salary at 26, not to mention my gf moving in and providing income of her own for us), I'm very lucky to own rather than rent our home, and it's also very fortunate that my current job allows me to present sort of however I want - tattoos, piercings, colored hair, etc. 

With that all said, I still really need to get out of here for my own sanity and well-being. The constant fear of being found out and ostracized or even fired is a struggle. 

I have a bachelor's degree in applied linguistics, and I have an abundance of qualifications from the various roles I've filled at my current employer including fleet management, dispatch, conflict resolution, overnight cross-country supply runs, managing large projects, PR, and more. I was here when the staff list was shorter than ten names and helped this place grow into the idk-how-many-million-dollars company it is today, so I've kind of done everything one can do in the office of a company in the trades, including an abundance of handiwork (which I've been doing since I was old enough to hold a drill). I'm trying to figure out a pursuit in a relatively accepting field that doesn't require years and years of extra schooling. Quite frankly I'm a very fast learner and can adapt to any work environment. 

I live in Atlanta, which is known for its queer population but is surrounded by redneck hell. I know that if I look long and hard enough I can find *something* but most leads are unsurprisingly at unsafe companies in unsafe areas. Knowing that all my professional experience in my adult life is at one company in an office position, I'd be willing to consider an MBA if there were places asking for that which also valued people like me, but I'm just not sure what positions or key words I should be searching for.

1kh1o63,Need Salary advice,"This is a long rant I’ll try to keep it short.

For over 3 years, I’ve been working doing Accounts Receivable stuff (billing coordinator) at this company. I have a college degree in business management. In the accounts receivable office, we have 6 billing coordinators and me and one other guy are the only ones with college degrees. 

When I first got the job I feel like I low balled my pay because I thought everyone working there in that position had a degree but it turns out they don’t. 

My coworkers basically work at most 20% of the day while they are at work while I’m working a majority of the day. The only time they act like they are busy is when the manager comes in the room. Me, my supervisor and the other guy with a college degree are the only ones who are working a majority of the day. 

After being here for 3 years, you hear what people talking about spending money wise and all I can think about is, “are these people who don’t have college education, started around the same time as me, do way less work than me, come in late and leave early, getting paid more than me?”

These people literally talk all day and have almost no responsibility but I have no real way to prove how much they make.

After a bachelor's degree in computer engineering finished with top marks (including an internship abroad in a large company), I threw myself into a master's in computer science here abroad. By the end of June, I will have collected 52.5 ECTS credits (I skipped one exam). In parallel, I work part-time in the same company as my internship, where I did a hackathon. 

The initial idea was to specialize in AI/Machine Learning, but after two courses (machine learning a and reinforcement learning) I realized that it doesn't interest me. Now, 6 months of Erasmus + 6 months of thesis await me. 

The problem is that so far I haven't found a course that has truly grabbed me, and the master's should serve precisely to specialize, right? 

Then there's the job issue: SWE is a field that requires continuous updating and personal projects in your free time to stay up-to-date. Spoiler: I prefer to spend my free time doing completely different things, like going out with friends. I'm not exactly obsessed with staying at home at the PC programming, quite the opposite, and this isn't just happening now but also during my bachelor's. 

The job market as a developer is super competitive, with a lot of layoffs going around that make life even harder for a junior like me. I have to compete with mid or senior people with much more skills. Regarding AI in the long term, I see it as tough: if a senior becomes 2x more productive and also does junior tasks, it's logical that the market for newcomers will become even tighter. 

In my field (computer science): 

\- SW Engineer: projects, continuous updating (exponential), LEETCODE (bleah!) 

**-** Robotics Engineer: super niche (still software development in the end) and a lot, a lot of competition. - Frontend/WebDev: no 

\- GameDev: no 

\- ML/AI Engineer: no 

\- DevOps: maybe 

\- Quality Assurance: maybe 

\- System Engineer: no 

\- Product/Project Manager: maybe 

\- Tech Sales: maybe Cybersecurity: no 

\- Algorithmics/theoretical stuff: no 

Alternatives that are buzzing in my head (but I don't know if they are valid): 

\- Physiotherapy: 3 years, I like the idea because I love sports (I had thought about it before computer science), but the entrance exam is tough (1 out of 12 pass). 

\- Becoming a plumber, gardener, arborist, installer (like HVAC), welder. 

The advice I received is to take more time, even 6+ months. By July, it might not be enough, but I would lose the Erasmus opportunity and might be late to prepare for the physiotherapy test. Or to push through and finish the master's, but I don't know what sense that makes if I don't even know what to specialize in and at the moment I don't see all this interest from my side. 

I feel like I've wasted 4 years of my life. 

What do you think? Advice? What could I specialize in? Thanks!

1kh11df,Is it worth it to get a masters degree in CS when working in fashion?,"I’m a 27 yo male who has been in the fashion field for a few years now and I plan on staying in the field for the foreseeable future. I am on the operations side of things and don’t really get any thrill or challenge by what I do. The job entails managing our retail stores’ inventory and being efficient with these resources, along with store openings and other inventory/efficiency management. 

I was always strong in math and enjoyed complex problem solving when growing up in school. Part of me regrets not pursuing a degree in math/CS - I guess my mom was right. I have been thinking about getting a masters in “Software Design and Management” from my undergrad (Liberty University) since it is quite cheap (≈$22k) and provides another avenue of growth and revenue, especially with the way tech is advancing and becoming more integral in jobs today.

I have 3 concerns. 

1. I’m curious how robust the fashion-tech job market is. Will there even be a worth it opportunity with this degree? I figure tech will become more intertwined with jobs as time goes on, so more careers aligned with my experience and new masters degree could become available.

2. The degree may not be very strong. I know Liberty is known more for their pastoral degrees than tech degrees lol, but will this greatly inhibit my ability to find a quality job in the space? They aren’t very known for their fashion degrees either but I’ve made out okay so far!

3. I hear the tech job market is awful. It sounds very competitive, as expected, but I hear there aren’t a ton of quality jobs out there to begin with. Is this true?

1kh0l15,"boss doing my job for me, leaving me nothing to do.","I have a job where I do a lot of field work.  I took this job two years ago and I have done an excellent job that I've kind of put myself out of work by being so efficient. Especially compared to the guy who I took over for who was a lazy POS who didn't do anything, I've spent the last 2 years fixing all the mistakes and cleaning up all the messes. I don't have enough work for 40 full hours a week so I do what I have to do and then am just ""on call"" the rest of the week. (it is a great gig, i know).

I am worried about my job future in this role if things continue to go this smoothly. I have expressed this to my boss several times and he has reassured me that I am safe (we are union so I guaranteed have a job unless we do massive company wide lay offs).

Fast forward to last week, my boss (who has also been kind of bored lately) told me that he went out and did a lot of my site visits for me, leaving me with even LESS work than I had before. at first I didn't say anything but then he kept bringing it up until I finally said ""stop stealing my work!! that is my job!!"" very firmly several times but in a light handed casual manner. the last time, it sunk in and he sheepishly agreed to stop doing my work. It isn't my fault he is bored and he isn't ""helping me"" because he knows I have more than enough time to complete this task. 

i am just wondering if I should bring it up in a more formal setting that I do not appreciate him doing my work for me or just leave it as is?

1kgznzn,Is it worth asking for feedback further? [internal candidate],"I recently underwent 3 gruesome interview rounds for a role I applied for internally and then waited for the outcome for two long months only to get a rejection.

The interviews went mostly great, so I am a bit disappointed, and trying to ensure that I am seeking feedback for the right reasons, and in the right way.

I replied to the rejection email sent by the recruiter and asked for feedback, but their reply was, *“honestly, you did great, there isn’t much to share, but there are certain criteria we were looking for”*

Now, I am left with a couple of questions for internal networking (and if I’m honest, seeking answers).

* Should I reach out to my specific interviewers for feedback - as an internal candidate I have this access; I didn’t do this in-between rounds. I am suspecting the final round with a partner (who is leaving the firm soon) was my undoing. There is a question we didn’t agree on approach, though I did explain my logic as you normally would in case interviews.
* Just after getting confirmation of my first interview, I had reached out to a senior manager in that department who advised we should connect after the interview, just incase he was chosen to be my interviewer (he wasn’t). Should I reach out to him now, prospecting for future opportunities, is it too soon? I dont want it to seem like I am complaining...

1kgzclo,Sub optimal college performance,"I got my bachelors in Civil Engineering 3 years ago. I started studying for Civil because I wanted to be work on bridges after a small project I did in middle school and I enjoyed statics in my high school physics class.

I did relatively well the first three years in college. Not amazing but I got into the school of engineering going into my junior year. (3.2 GPA) I was living at home before my junior year. 

My parents had some issues in their marriage at the time, and I was helping take care of my siblings and helping them talk things through in an effort to help save the marriage. In retrospect, it gave me a sense of purpose, and I was very motivated to do well in school because of this.


Around my before my senior year. I made many sacrifices in my social and romantic life for my parents. I realized that I wasn’t helping the marriage but instead just delaying them from facing their problems. And for some reason I let that break me as a person. My family was probably one of the best things that I had when times were good, and I realized I was going to lose it. 

I let myself go my senior year, and my grades slipped severely. And I tried to continue helping my parents even if it distracted me from school. That is 100% my fault, and in retrospect I should’ve found a way to muscle through it and continue to do the best I could and it haunts me to this day. 

Thankfully, I was able to land a job as a construction inspector for a water main consulting firm and they pay well. 

I’ve been content for the job because it felt like an opportunity to make up for my poor performance in school. I have gotten to the point where my bosses are very happy with my work and it makes me proud. 

But now I’ve come to the point where I feel like I’m settling for this job, and I want to look for a structural engineering job not because it’s what I wanted initially. I haven’t had any luck with my applications because it’s been too long since I graduated school for them to be willing to hire me

I have gotten much better since school at setting boundaries with my family and for this reason I have been able to do well at work. 

My question is, what do I do now? How can I move to the bridge industry when all I know is water main? How do I get over the feeling of failure?

Companies complain they can’t find talent but refuse to look at the people interested in the role because they aren’t perfect. The corporate world needs a culture shift.

1kgwc5t,Advice Needed: Should I Take a 17 LPA Support Role in Bangalore or Pursue a Master's in Software Engineering at SJSU?,"Hi,  
  
I need some advice on a career decision and would appreciate insights, especially from those who have been in this field or pursuing higher education abroad.

Background:

* I’m a 26-year-old Technical Consultant at an MNC in India, earning 11 LPA.
* I have 2 years of experience in technical consulting, with skills in java.
* My long-term goal is to go into a software engineering role, ideally with opportunities for growth in India or abroad.

Options:

1. Support Engineer Role (17 LPA):
   * US-based AI startup in Bangalore (16 LPA base + 1 LPA performance based).
   * It involves debugging, customer-facing technical support but no core software development.
   * Concerns:
      * Is a support role a step backward for a software engineering career?
      * I have been wanting to get a remote job or move out of bangalore, but this would not help in that. Even worse, it is a 5-day WFO job.
      * I’ve signed the offer letter but haven’t joined yet. Would declining it now be unprofessional?
2. Master’s in Software Engineering at SJSU (San Jose State University):
   * I have been accepted into the program, starting Fall 2025.
   * Estimated cost: $65,000 (₹50-60L with living expenses). Did not get the Visa yet.
   * Concerns:
      * Is the financial risk worth it given job market uncertainties in the US?
      * How valuable is a US master’s for Indian developers returning to India?
      * Will leaving a stable job and offer for education set me back financially?

Questions:

* For those in Bangalore, how does a 16 LPA support role compare to development roles in terms of career growth and work-life balance?
* Has anyone transitioned from a support role to a software engineering role in India? What steps did you take?
* For those who pursued a master’s abroad (especially in the US), was it worth the investment? How did it impact your career in India or globally?
* Any advice on managing the guilt of declining a signed offer to pursue education?

I understand this is a personal decision, but I would love some feedback to make this choice.

We also didn’t put as much thought as we should have into the UI initially so we’ve added more advanced filtering.
The support from community and users has been incredibly useful to enable us to build something that helps people.

The goal is to level the playing field between employers and applicants. The tool doesn’t flood employers with applications (that would cost too much money anyway) instead the agent targets roles that match skills and experience that people already have.

There’s a couple other tools that can do auto apply through a chrome extension with varying results. However, users are also noticing we’re able to find a ton of remote jobs for them that they can’t find anywhere else. So you don’t even need to use auto apply (people have varying opinions about it) to find jobs you want to apply to. As an additional bonus we also added a job match score, optimizing for the likelihood a user will get an interview.

There’s 3 ways to use it:

1.	⁠⁠Have the AI Agent just find and apply a score to the jobs then you can manually apply for each job
2.	⁠⁠Same as above but you can task the AI agent to apply to jobs you select
3.	⁠⁠Full blown auto apply for jobs that are over 60% match (based on how likely you are to get an interview)

It’s as simple as uploading your resume and our AI agent does the rest. Plus it’s free to use and the paid tier gets you unlimited applies, with a money back guarantee. It’s called SimpleApply",Individual_Mood6573,13,0.5600000023841858,6,1746620414,2025-05-07 12:20:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kgvy0g/i_built_an_ai_agent_to_find_and_auto_apply_to/,5,2025
1kgvt2w,I have to work 45+ hours to earn what digital professionals do. What potential jobs i can train in from home to earn $40k/year from a computer/without having to be physically at a job?,"I'm an electrician making decent money, but my brother works 35 hours a week on computers from home and earns what i do. I am out the house at 7am and work 40+ hours a week.

I know i know - training is hard job market is hard etc etc. I want to know something i can train in without having to pay for uni which can land me a job making £30k/$40k a year from a computer. So for instance, accountancy here in the UK pays decent money and training can be done from home via AAT. Web dev pays well and can be done from home although eventually an office job may be needed for CV purposes.

Hit me with your suggestions. But please, hard skills, nothing like 'digital marketing' etc.

Obviously there's IT, accountancy, finance, but what about things like 3D modelling (i used to love Sketchup and Auto CAD back in the day) or mortgage brokering or real estate?

1kgvhpf,Should I pivot careers or continue down this treacherous path?,"I’m a first generational college grad and first one in my family to ever work for a tech job. I was working with a tech start up as an analyst and stayed there about 4 years until I reached a supervisor level. The position was completely WFH with a couple of other great benefits, but I was going through a pretty rough year with external things in life like a move to a new state, some friends passing, my family member going through a serious illness and several other things. 

I felt like no one at my company was willing to give me guidance on what to actually do at work or what would be needed from me in my role and I started to slack off in between meetings, but I almost made sure my basic responsibilities were taken care of. I was so overwhelmed with so much in my life that I really just didn’t care about the job anymore and was just finding ways to get by everyday. Eventually I had a melt down while on a work trip, got drunk and the rest of the management team basically pushed me out of the company while offering a fake “mental health leave” which I knew meant coming back to either being demoted/disciplined or ostracized. 

I decided to get out while I could, use whatever savings I had to take some time to find a new job and realign myself. I feel equal parts proud of myself for realizing that the situation wasn’t good for me and taking action, but also totally ashamed that I made terrible judgements and for acting as unprofessional as I did. 

Is it worth staying in the same industry? Should I just pack it up and try something else?

1kgv1uv,Motivation to last 1 year in a job you know you will leave?,"Hey all!

In September of 2024 I decided to pursue a masters degree with a start date of September 2025. This meant staying at my current role for around a year until the master begins.

My motivation plummeted straight away. 8 months into my ""quiet quitting"" period and on most weeks I've been managing fine, especially when I've been busy as that was a motivation to buckle down and get things done. But now that the workload has cleared up I cannot bring myself to even care about anything.

I am not getting anything done. It's worse because I'm doing a career pivot with my masters, which means it's unlikely I will work again with my current colleagues, or that whatever I learn at work during these last few months will serve me in my future role. So those two motivation sources are also gone.

The hours feel like days and the days feel like weeks.

I know I am privileged to have a reasonably comfortable office job and that so many others have it much tougher, and that I am close to the end, etc. Still, none of that sinks in and motivates me.

Does anyone have any motivational thoughts to share?

1kgt0z9,Need real advice. I'm about to  quit with no job lined up to pursue something different.,"I'm gonna be honest. I'm 26 and have struggled with depression, anxiety, and attendence at work this year. Last year and the year before (started job 2.5 yrs ago), I had no problems, but this year, the schedule is kickin my butt and it's hard to keep it going. 

I've hard on myself for this, so much so that my confidence has taken a hit. So please din't shame me. I have enough guilt lol. So I know I'm burnt out and because I'm currently a somewhat high-functioning individual with depression, it's hard for me to know what's best for me. I struggle with big decisions always, but especially right now. 

This job is doing damage to my mind and my inner peace. In short, I work in nees productions and the amount of news I have to watch has changed my outlook on life as a whole, and I've told my therapist about this. She of course wouldn't tell what to do, but I could tell she is concerned I can't do anything to switch off the news. It's hard to explain, but the anxiety I feel watching news has made me so negative. Please don't tell me to just guard my mind, check out and dissociate while at work. I do this already and it's only made me feel more like an NPC everyday. I can't live like this longterm, so I of course ask myself why I'm staying in my current workplace. And I ask myself this every night and every morning.

I think it's time for me to leave. I have a couple interviews next week but nothing lined up.

I work a full time job as a printmedia designer and vocational trainer (I‘m responsible for teaching practical knowhow to an apprentice). I don’t like my current job though. The work we do is just so boring and bland. I‘d love to use my creative side more often by creating layouts or editing photos. But that’s just not the type of work my current employer has. 

I‘d love to go into webdesign (interaction design specifically) but the next degree only starts in summer 2027. So I‘m stuck here for at least the next 2 years. And if I apply for it and they don’t take me, I don’t have a clue what to do in that case. 

This is my long-ish term goal currently. But I can’t start working towards it as I can only apply for it in January 2027. So until then, I’m kinda stuck in limbo. I can’t even make any short term goals as I don’t know what I even want to achieve in the meantime.

What should I do?

I appreciate anyone who reads this. 

I have put out at least 500+ apps over the last year - that includes easy applies on LinkedIn and Indeed (which I know from this sub can be iffy but also career sites for companies), taken jobs I’ve never made the same $ for ever (but reorged and messed with job description and life / work balance).

I went back to teaching, which is wonderful in some ways but not my best decision. It does not work with my work / life balance at all. I have a job as far as I know for the next year so I’m lucky in some ways, but so unlucky for my family life: 

I’ve worked in corporate security, safety, strategy, medical, education, semis, and many other fields. I’m currently learning coding (SQL and html but with python, C++, and Java in progress or on the horizon). 

I’m so frustrated like so many others at the point. I wonder if I have “too much” or “too little” for every job. I don’t expect a solely tech job or anything, but I have worked with tech teams. What is wrong here???

Oh and I’m a PMP with other various security certs (non-tech). 

Bay Area, CA, fwiw.

I’ve been down lately when recent event…So I’ve been working for a company for almost two years, and recently, I was let go unexpectedly, with no prior communication from my manager. Despite being a top performer and managing a significant workload, I had been struggling with unclear expectations and lack of recognition for my contributions. I was performing senior-level tasks, but wasn’t given the official title or proper compensation until I voiced my concerns during my performance evaluation. In the end, I only received the new title on the resignation paper.

Right now, I’m feeling a mix of relief that I’m out of the toxic environment and confusion about what to do next. While I’m grateful to be free of that pressure, I’m also uncertain about my next steps.

It’s hard to shake the feeling of being discarded, especially after contributing so much to the company’s success, only to be treated this way in the end.

1kgpkxl,What should I do in this time in my life?,"Hello everyone. I m/21 have a girlfriend f/22 of about 2 1/2 years. I live in California. I’ve known her since elementary school, she liked me through middle school then she moved to a different high school and we didn’t see or talk to each other since. 2023 my friends girlfriend worked with her and they got us together again and we kicked it off.

She even lived 5 mins away for me with her stepdad and mom for a bit then moved a little farther away couple weeks later to live with her aunt. Her mom stepdad and little sister all moved to Tennessee as well so she had nobody once she moved. After a year or so her being away from her family and other difficult stuff caused her to move back in with her family in Tennessee. We’ve been long distance for about a couple months now and she’s struggling with it.

I play tennis and my original plan was trying to get a scholarship to play else where and hopefully that pays for my schools and we could just get a place together. But after a while when it came time i didn’t have enough money saved up for a move like that so it didn’t work. I come visit maybe every 2 months or so but she is really struggling with not having me there living her new life without me in it.

What im trying to get at is that i love this girl and i really feel like she’s the one for me she’s so amazing to me and we always have such a great time with whatever we do. We’ve been talking these past days and we’ve honestly been struggling with it all and with our future and how that’s going to look like. I don’t even know if i want to do college I’ve never really wanted to do it but i have a Hispanic family that believes only in college, while i have my girlfriends family being business owners and always telling me to be my own boss and schools a scam and how you should always be ur own boss (also Christians) he’s always trying to help me with ideas of how i can start and just always gives me tips and knowledge on things. I’ve honestly felt like i need a change from California and the life i live here and that being tennis, school, weed repeat lol and i just feel like im going nowhere in life. I feel like a move would be great for me not just for a change but to also better myself such as being away from home will make me want to work harder since i won’t have my parents to help me. Idk if im looking for people to just say do it but im just confused on what i want because i know that if i stay here there’s really nothing going for me but my tennis and school even tho i dont even want to do school.

I just feel like i have such a good opportunity moving to somewhere new starting from “scratch” living cheaper and eventually buy property here in Tennessee. I’m just looking for any opinions on my situation or if you’ve lived thru my experience or even hearing someone else’s experience. Thanks! (Everything is telling me to do it, but for some reason i don’t know why i can’t)

1kgou8l,The company I previously rejected is offering again-should I consider switching now?,"I work at a media agency (mostly support work). A few months ago, in-house digital marketing team of a well-known company (let's call it company A) interviewed me for a senior position (more responsibilites than my current role). I cleared all the interview rounds and initially asked for ₹14-15 LPA but they offered ₹12 LPA (₹1L of that was performance-based variable pay) and said they say they were now considering me for a junior-level based on my interview performance, that too only after the salary negotiation.

It felt like a tactic to give a lowball offer, so I wasn’t fully satisfied and declined the offer stating personal reasons). I used the offer to get a counteroffer from my current company, which matched the ₹12L—without variable pay, so my in-hand was better. I also got extended WFH option. So, I stayed back.

Now-3 months later-Company A has reached out again saying that the role is open again and asked if I’m open to opportunities. Company A is offering a permanent WFH role and I'm in a good spot to negotiate for ₹15LPA again this time and it could be the fastest way to a salary jump for me

I have a stable, low pressure setup at my current company + great manager and everyone of my team is working from office while I was given exception to WFH, that exception holds only if I work with current manager.

Should I reconsider Company A if they offer a stronger package and proper title this time? Im skeptical and have slight trust issues due to how the first offer played out with Company A.

1kgoq65,What is a seemingly small decision you made that ended up changing your life?,"A couple of years ago, I made what I thought was a throwaway decision—and it ended up changing my entire life.

I saw a Facebook ad for a free weekend workshop on digital marketing. I had zero plans that weekend and figured, “Why not? Worst case, I waste a few hours.” I didn’t expect much. But during a break, I ended up chatting with a guy who freelanced in the field. He told me how he got started with just a laptop, a couple of online courses, and some patience.

That conversation stuck with me.

The next week, I signed up for a freelancing platform and picked up a small gig—something like writing ad copy for $20. Then another. And another. Over the next few months, I built a little portfolio and started getting better clients.

Eventually, I built a basic website to showcase my work. It was nothing fancy, just a free template and a YouTube tutorial. But it made me feel like I was actually doing something.

A year later, I left my 9-to-5 job and went full-time freelance. I now set my own schedule, work with clients I like, and honestly, I’ve never been happier.

All because I clicked on a random ad and showed up to a free class.

1kgon2r,25M Feeling lost in their career in Ontario Canada. What do I do next?,"

Hi Reddit,

This one is gonna be a long duzy so buckle up and get ready for this!

I went to school for accounting, hated the classes, hated the co-ops, bad at it, transferred into business administration got a degree in that.

I tried real estate for a bit in 2022 I believe? I was way over my head as I just saw the recent inflation, saw how easy it was to sell, and was ready to be a millionaire by 30 lol. 

Obviously, that didn't pan out so I worked for an accounting firm 50min away, and an hour and a half coming back. I did this for about 7 months and really hated myself, my life on what it was becoming, I was depressed making money. I quit in April due to me getting caught stealing time due to burn out. 

Until about September 2024 I was jobless not able to collect EI because I quit. I decided to start up my own bookkeeping service. I want easy books that I go in once a month and bill accordingly. I have one client, but I've since stopped searching because I really want to do more with my life. The one client I do have are amazing and I met them through this app actually which was honestly gods fate. I make approx. $300 a month from them.

Obviously not enough to live. So what does one do? Sports gamble!!! Some weeks were good, others awful. I lost $800 in a week in November and decided enough was enough and banned myself from the apps. Best decision I've ever done! Proud of myself there.

I now work at a golf course. The golf benefits are great! Really happy with that. I am a porter who sets up events. Moves tables, polishes cutlery, etc. I get paid $18 an hour. Cool.

Myself as a person knows what I enjoy. I love sports, I love talking, looking into the tactical side of things, how formations are made, how defense works, etc.

I also am a people pleaser, I believe I am very good with people and can pick up on when somethings up, or I can paint an image In my head on how a person is with some info and lead a conversation down that path.

I've applied to sales jobs over the past year, and to become a coach in Canada specially for soccer I would need to pay a course and go through schooling, with no guarantee of a job again.

I recently (today) got rejected from a parking enforcement officer job with the city of Toronto after having an internal reference. That job would have set me up for life and I would be fine doing it. Sure, people would hate me, but that's the fun part, trying to descalate them and move on with the day. I would be outside staying engaged and the pay was great with amazing benefits. 

Since that failed, I've came here for some guidance. I'm lost. I don't know what to do. It feels like I'm destined to be the loser who has to stay at the mercy of their parents because I can't accomplish anything myself.

I am currently thinking of spending my time learning a language and moving abroad to find work because I don't enjoy my time in Canada anymore. The country is no longer the one I loved growing up. Ideally, I will be in a country with a white sandy coast line, saltwater, and from 5:00PM-Sunset relax on the beach. 

I've also been thinking about walking into a car sales dealership (not a brand one) and asking for a chance. I no minimal about cars, but enough about sales and human psychology to ask the right questions, read the room, and get the deal done. Yet, I've never been given the chance to.

Hoping I can get some grounding advice. Had a very depressive episode last winter and I don't want to go through that ever again.

Thanks for reading this if you did, I appreciate you.

Take care and stay safe.

1kgmw1e,"""On call"" responsibilities mentioned 9 months into salaried job","I began a salaried engineering job 9 months ago and when I was negotiating there was no mention of ""on call product support"" as a responsibility of the job. Nothing mentioned in offer letter about hours either. 

Suddenly I've just heard from my team that I am now being expected to take up ""on call shifts"" as part of the job, and that this is ""just something that all of our engineers do."" This feels super slimy to slip in after the offer letter is signed and the salary is already negotiated, is this normal or something I'm able to push back against even though all my other coworkers seem to be complying? 

Something else to note: the ""on call"" schedule is a WEEK at a time. So I would be expected to be 24/7 ""on call"" in addition to working my regularly scheduled 40 hours for one week every 6-8 weeks. Management seems to think that ""this is no big deal because usually you don't get called"" but this seems like a huge burden to me to never be able to fully log off and relax (even if you are not called, you have to have your laptop at the ready, be checking your phone every few hours and waking up in the middle of the night to do this, be sober, be somewhere there is sufficient wifi....). They also only put out the on call schedule at the beginning of each month, so it seems like a nightmare to schedule around/find someone to trade with you (as is expected) if you have a commitment. And it doesn't make sense to me that I would be ""on call"" on the same days that I am working a 9-5? It sounds like there is an unofficial policy of ""if you did have to work while you were on call, you can miss part of the work day tomorrow to get that time back"", but nothing official, and this is only for days that you were actually called.
This feels.... unethical at best. I fear that because I am salaried and there is nothing in my offer letter about hours there may not be much I can do rather than quiet quit and start searching. But are there any protections put in place for me in this situation? Please advise this feels icky!",Hot-Complaint9349,4,0.6299999952316284,31,1746585833,2025-05-07 02:43:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kgmw1e/on_call_responsibilities_mentioned_9_months_into/,5,2025
1kgmo20,New added job duties but no higher compensation ?,"I’ve been at my job for over a year and a half and recently had meeting with my manager that I will be taking on new responsibilities. It’s currently slower in our business lately and another department close to us had an employee who sucked so they reshuffled her elsewhere. So instead of hiring someone else, they want me to help the other manager who is busy while still doing my regular duties. They said the other managers duties needed for me are more of priority so I can put my main stuff more on the back burner but the work load will still be 50/50 between departments. So still do my regular work but also help other department. I asked for additional compensation for additional duties and they said since it’s slow and I’m more having some duties “swapped” that I won’t be. And I asked if it’s open to discussion at year end and they said i am lucky to get Merritt every year as other companies don’t. And it’s normal for everyone to help each other in this company. So I will have to get all trained on these new duties and will have to juggle between two managers which is crazy. And my job position name will stay the same.

1kgma4k,repeatedly have had bad work experiences.... would love thoughts or just listening,"Hi!

I""m 35/F and am am occupatiional therapist in a school. i have never felt I was that great at my job. In the almost 10 years of practice I have had a few jobs that were better fits but I never felt that great. I feel like i may be neurodivergent a bit. I suspect ADHD. I never have been one to juggle or multitask well. I'm quite disorganized. Struggle more w work in times of stress. I struggled alot to get through grad school so maybe that should have been a sign it wasn't the best fit but I barely passed. 

  
This past school year I have been working through an agency at two different schools (1 they let me go from). I am now at my second that I've been at since Novemeber and it's also goign increasingly poorly. I feel like it must be me since it's happened a few times esp lately. I feel like maybe i don't com across well or very professionally. I""m so upset and wish I knew exactly why people don't read me well in professional settings.

  
I will explain the jobs. I started the first in late August. I was newly married (2nd marriage). it was a big transition. I was taking on a 4 year old bonus son almost full time and the family blending with my 7 y/o was rough at first. I also had just moved to a different state which has different ways of doing things from the one I moved from. To top it off the first week of the job  i discovered i was pregnant (timing was earlier than we pictured). I didn't tell the job but i had to be late for various appointmnets, blood work etc. I was very stressed and not myself. i missed some sessions made a few careless mistakes in reports  i struggle w bad anxiety and depression when pregnant so I proobably wasn't myself even though I tried to pull myself together. the job was unreasonable in my opinion. I did miss some deadlines, and i felt they didn't like me. The work load was insane though and I feel like they started to do things to try to make me look bad such as give me reports due like before they gave it to me to prove I was not keeping up. they were overall unkind. i ended up having a msicarriage about a month after I found out and still didn't tell them but mentioned i was going through a medical situation and no one cared. A week after my pregnany loss I got a call that I was fired. My agency found me a new position right away. 

  
Overall I felt like this was a better fit. everyone seemed nicer and it seemed more reasonable. At first this seemed to be going ok. I thought i was getting things in on time, etc At first it seemed good. I did drop a few balls recently like a small mistake in a report and almost forgetting some stuff like an evaluation. i did turn a few in close to the deadline but it was on time. My boss reached out recently that she'd like to meet and I was freaking out. PTSD from my last school. after freaking today a few days before the meeting I asked if I could chat about something else I had a question about and briefly asked about the meeting. Apparently she wants to discuss concerns about my performance. While I had a bad feeling I thought this was going decently and I'm crushed and feel so pathetic. While I will discuss more in depth Friday at the meeting, she seemed to have overall concerns but not much specific. It seemed like she thought maybe I needed more ""support"" and the school might be too fast paced. I""m confused bc I thought it was ok. I'm not sure if someone went behind my back and shared stuff which would suck. She complained that I've turned in evaluations down to the wire w the deadlines (i said they were on time but she said they should be much earlier). i'm so confused and will hear more friday. I felt this one was going ok. I feel maybe i'm just not very good. maybe i don't come across confidently. Maybe she already had a bad impression since she works for the therapy agency that hired me for both jobs, maybe she heard about my past experience and her view was already colored that i'm not that competent. She said someting like ""i've seen you need more support that we thought"". i really felt i'm doing my job, with a few dropped balls lately but i thought it was going much better. I hope I'm not fired again. hopefully she gives me concrete things to let me change and let me improve.

  
i am so frustrated and feel like i'm just not good at this. maybe i'll look for a non school job if i'm fired. Anyone else get fired repeatedly? Also frustrating we started trying for a baby a few months ago w out success. I'm not even sure if it's wise to do when my job may be in jeopardy and I may need to look for a new job. We can't survive on my husband's salary alone. They might definitely let me go if i was pregnant and if i'm fired no one would hire a pregnant lady. I'm 35 so the clock is ticking.

1kglsy6,Should I leave being a PSW?,"For context I’m in Ontario, have worked as a certified PSW for the last almost 9 years, primarily in home care. My company rarely offers full time positions, so I am in a part time position, very few hours some weeks. There is no benefits or pension other than CPP & it’s $20.69 an hour. Clients have slowly picked up the last week or so and the new ones really like me which is making this hard.

Last two biweekly paycheques were $364 and $517 after taxes.

1kglsq0,Never thought I would be this lost at 40+ years old,"I’m stuck at the lowest paying position at the company I work for.  

I started there 6 years ago in a position with lots of earnings and growth potential. Almost one year in I was injured on the job and was out of work for 3 months and on limited work for 6 more months. Because of my injury I could no longer do the job I had originally been hired for. The company offered me another job in a position I had no desire to do but I took it anyway.  I thought it would buy me time while I figured out my next move.  

Fast forward to today and I am still in the same position just with a lot more responsibilities. There have been other positions that make more money and are less work but they have  hired outside people.  

I really feel I do such a good job at this position they don’t want to move me anywhere else because they will have trouble finding someone at my pay to do as much as I do.  Yet I don’t know how to make this transition to more money.  

Ive been looking at other companies to compare pay but there is an issue with that.  We are a small company with around a dozen people and I do 5 different jobs.  If I went to another larger company I could do just one of any of my 5 separate responsibilities for similar pay. Basically at my current job I spend my 40 hour week juggling 5 separate responsibilities (those are 5 separate main responsibilities not including a dozen random side quest I do each month). When I look up any of those on job sites they all pay within 5-10% of what I make and I would just be doing one.  

I really like my boss and the people there and the environment but I don’t like the feeling that I will forever be in the lowest paying position.  

I constantly get praised by my bosses for my work ethic.  For always staying busy and taking on so many task.  They compliment my attention to details.  They praise me for catching other people’s mistakes before they turn into huge issues.  They literally tell me monthly how great of a job I’m doing. I’m always on time and rarely miss days yet 50% of the other employees are late and miss days quite frequently.  Which wouldnt bother me as much if I didn’t know I made the least amount of money. 

I know it’s my fault but basically being at the bottom all these task that no one wants to do seems to fall to me and I have to stay busy (for my own sanity) so I just keep doing more and more.  Then after a while it becomes just another task that everyone assumes I’ll do and I keep doing it.  Some days I feel like a b itch and not one that’s paid all that great.  I literally stay up at night thinking about how stuck I feel.  
I get so worked up about a few lazy employees who do one job and get paid more and how they should have gave me a chance in that position.  

I’m really lost and don’t know what to do.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

1kgl7n8,How to Ask for Promotion,"Ok - I am not one to speak up for myself, so some backstory - I have been working in my current position (very much entry level role) for 2 years. During those two years, I have taken on learning new skills and working on extra projects on the weekends outside of my normal scope.

These extra weekend projects have turned into company wide/larger project requests from the CPO. I am now working 80+ hours a week to get my normal responsibilities completed, as work on leading and managing special project requests (he doesn’t go to my manager bc my manager doesn’t know how to do anything/doesn’t get anything done). 

They have agreed to hire some help for me, though it still feels wrong that I am leading company-wide large-scale projects for the CPO in an entry level position. I also am presenting in meetings with other chief executives on a semi-regular basis, etc. My pay and title don’t match the responsibility level I think I have, as well as the time constraints. The learning opportunities for growth don’t seem like learning opportunities- they now seem like expectations.

My mental health juggling multiple jobs, and doing the work of my Director (multiple people at the organization flat out have told me I need to find another company to work for because I am doing her job) with entry level pay has gotten me to the point of quitting.

I am meeting with the CPO and am going to try to see if I can get a promotion. If not, I am quitting.

I don’t want to quit, ESPECIALLY in this economy because I really love my company (I mean who would work every weekend pretty much for 2 years if they didn’t), but for my mental sanity, and to be able to shower/sleep normal again, I need help, and I need a promotion- I just don’t know how to best approach that conversation/how to word things without sounding complain-y or that I don’t want to/can’t handle the stress working on the high level work (I know I 100% could if I wasn’t juggling my normal job on top of it) 🙃",Sweet-Quality-8580,2,1.0,4,1746580616,2025-05-07 01:16:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kgl7n8/how_to_ask_for_promotion/,5,2025

I currently work for a bank doing cybersecurity but my desire is to work in finance (IB would be the dream like everyone else lol). I have spoken to internal colleagues within capital markets and investment banking. One of the directors recommend I check out a credit analyst role because they like to recruit them for capital markets jobs.

Shortly after speaking to them, one was posted internally with the healthcare team. It’s a Credit Analyst role and it sounds like something I would be interested in based on my conversations with the hiring manager.

Problem is, it would be a ~10k pay cut. I’m currently at 75 with a 3k bonus, so essentially 78. This job would be 65k but with a higher bonus (not known yet obviously, but HR told me it’s a higher incentive plan due to being in a revenue-generating position). I would also be from fully remote to in office. My commute would be an hour each way plus some traffic. So at least two hours daily. The credit analyst job is eligible for overtime, something else to note.

I really would like out of my current job. I am very unhappy and it is extremely unfulfilling. It’s essentially reading search histories and scanning emails all day.

Should I go through with the switch? Is a desired role worth a roughly 10k decrease and a commute?

1kgkq7u,Didn’t get annual raise,"Hey all,

Ive been with my company for 2 years. We are supposed to get a 2% raise each year (I got my first one after my first year) and had my yearly review on Monday. My manager went on about how amazing I am and how I am one of the best hires he has ever had in his 40 year career and blah blah. I do feel I am very valuable to my team and I work very hard. At the end after talking me up and saying how great I am, he told me I will not be getting my 2% raise. He said this is due to the owner of the company giving all workers a permanent $2 raise back around Christmas which I did get. That was nice, but it was never stated that that $2 bump would replace our annual raise this year. I feel like this is pretty dumb and I deserve my 2%. Yes I know its not much (it comes out to a little short of $1000 for the whole year) but I feel I deserve it and with how my manager and coworkers talk about me I should definitely deserve my raise. 

Am I wrong to feel this way? Sure its not alot of money but what bothers me is the act of not getting the raise, not the actual amount. It kind of feels like a slap in the face and that my hard work does not matter. It makes me question if I want to invest my time in a company like this that doesn’t give their annual raises to workers who deserve it. I do plan on talking to my manager and stating I feel that I do deserve my 2% but I am afraid I will feel guilty about it for some reason. What would you all do?

1kgk7pb,OT or social work masters with a bachelor's in communications?,"I graduated 2 years ago with a bachelor's degree in journalism and media production but have been very interested in going back to school to be an occupational therapist or social worker. 

I am torn between the 2 and also have questions if people have done this masters program without a bachelors degree in a related field. 

I am interested in occupational therapy for a few reasons, I really like the idea of being hands on and interacting with the patients I was looking into pediatrics specifically. Play therapy was also something that I was drawn to as I had a cousin that did this and it benefited him tremendously as he grew up. Being able to work in different environments as well as the pay seems better as well as job security which is a big factor for me at the moment. I heard schooling for this can be quite challenging. 

For social work I know less about the profession but with some more research have become interested. I liked the aspect of being able to work in different environments as you can as an OT as well. The schooling on this stood out to me as you can do it online which would be easier for me to work as I have bills to pay. 

Has anyone went into these careers without a related bachelor's degree? If so how did you like the schooling? Which career would you pick and why?

1kgj6m1,Is it unwise for me to pivot my career completely adding to my already high hecs debt?,"
25f I’m a designer, I studied for 4 years with a diploma and an undergraduate degree, this cost me 60k in hecs debt (originally 80k but the government decreased it). This industry has been very humbling and it’s taken away the love I had for it. I am very interested in human behaviour and helping people and want to become a psychologist, though I did some research it will be minimum 6 years of study, with 4 years of a psychology degree costing 20k a year, followed by 2 years masters (which can range from 20k to extremely high) or another 4 years doctorate. 

All up this will be at least $120,000 in hecs plus my already $60,000 so together it will be $180,000 hecs debt. It’s a lot of money and time, I won’t be finished until my early 30s. But it would be a more fulfilling career. I’m not sure what the smartest decision here is. 

I would still be working while studying ofc but I’d have to work less.

I'm in the Midwest for context, and I interned with this firm in the summer. Knowing I already had an offer took away much of the stress of the last semester. This most recent tax season, I worked for a small tax firm in my town, which was a great experience and helped me save some money for my upcoming move this fall. Considering I was still short of my savings goal for the move, I decided, ""What the hell,"" and applied to a midsize firm in my town. Went in for an interview on May 2nd and got an offer later on in the day. I very much still plan on moving out west, but obviously, I did not mention that to this firm on the 2nd. Should I just keep my cards close to my chest when it comes to that?

If I end up accepting the offer from the midsize firm, I would only be there for around 4 months, which isn't much time, but being able to make and save the amount that they would be paying me would help so much with moving.

My background is primarily in corporate FP&A and commercial finance, where I’ve had solid exposure to investment analysis, ROI evaluation, financial modeling, and presenting insights to senior leadership.

I’ve built complex models for scenario analysis, evaluated capital allocation strategies, and worked on cross-functional projects that touched on market and performance metrics. I’m currently a CFA Level 1 candidate and am actively trying to skill up in Power BI and further refine my valuation and deal-modeling abilities.

That said, I know the leap into IB/PE is tough, especially coming from a non-traditional path. Based on my current resume:

What needs to change in terms of structure, content, or tone?

Am I framing my experience in the most effective way for a deal-oriented transition?

Are there any glaring gaps or missing elements that would be red flags for hiring managers in IB/PE/Private Credit?

Realistically, do I stand a chance, or do I need to take an intermediate step?

Right after college (24) I worked in (the upcoming) E-commerce, first in online marketing, but grew to a more generic IT Consultant job.

E-commerce has changed a lot lately, AI is upcoming and will replace a lot of processes. Good for the efficiency, but the creativity is gone. In the last 10 years my live changed a lot too. Got married, kids and work is no longer my first priority. The energy and motivation in my current job is gone.

I am looking for change. A job which fits being a parent, but will give me back the energy I had in the start of my career. But what will fit with my profile?

Any tips or advice?

1kggiis,Suspicious Interview Question,"I did a phone screen interview for a job today with the Operations Manager for a nonprofit. One of the first questions she asked me threw me totally off guard. It was something along the lines of, “Do you have anything in your personal life that would interfere with doing this job?” Or maybe “Are there any obligations you have outside of work that would interfere with doing this role?” 

I tried to cover my surprise with a “No, after I finish grad school this week I am completely flexible and don’t foresee anything interfering with successfully performing the duties of this role.” But the “honest” response that question first primed my brain to say was, “Yes, I have children.” In reality, they won’t interfere at all with my job (they’re in school/aftercare AND this job is fully remote) but because that was my subconscious reaction to that kind of question, it did feel in the moment like she was poking to find out if I had kids. Which would be illegal. Right?

Thinking about this now, there’s no honest response that wouldn’t provide a basis for illegal discrimination. The only things I can think of that would truly interfere with a person’s ability to do this job would be things like chronic illness, mental health issues, caregiving workload, etc. 

So basically—do you agree they were prying for “illegal” information? Should I report this? Why ask this anyway, when no one is likely to answer honestly? And if they did answer honestly it would simply reveal information that the employer isn’t allowed to use in their decision making (I understand employers often see what they can get away with)?

I’m especially disappointed because this nonprofit is supposedly on a mission to help women, but trying to eke out info about pregnancy, parenting, chronic illness, etc. shows a distinct bias AGAINST women.",Person98765432110,0,0.5,10,1746567490,2025-05-06 21:38:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kggiis/suspicious_interview_question/,5,2025

1kgeyzs,Possibly taking a job in supply chain management…. what about tariffs?,"Hi everyone,

I interviewed for a role back in December that was paused until recently. I was asked by the recruiter to interview again as they still had interest in me. I just did my final round today, and it went really well! 

One of the questions I asked was along the lines of, “What kind of problems do you run into on a day to day basis?” One of the interviewers stated tariffs are going to become a problem. 

This got me to thinking, should I be afraid to take on this role in supply chain management? I’ve already been through a layoff in my career. 

I should mention, the company itself is not creating and supplying product. They are sort of a middle man in negotiating contracts for medical supplies. 

Would it be super silly to take on this role? I do not currently work in supply chain, I’m in luxury real estate (which is umm not great right now). 

I am highly interested in this company and industry (I was in a similar industry when I got laid off except they were a manufacturer). This would be a pay bump for me, more benefits (currently have none at my job right now), and a better office environment. 

I am extra scared bc I am already taking a risk possibly getting a new job since I’m under contract for a new build. I talked to the loan officer and she said I’d be perfectly fine given the circumstances (enough time for pay stubs, still W-2, and pay increase). I just don’t want to sign onto a new job and get laid off before my house closes (I’d hate for it to happen at all, but ideally if it did happen it’d be after closing).

1kgepml,linkedin cheats u shouldn’t use,"wrote this in my newsletter for working professionals last week, they love it. share it here.

——

This weekend I’m digging through LinkedIn’s algorithm guidelines, community policies, engineering blogs… so you don’t have to.

Here’s the gist:

1. Automated engagement tools could get you shadowbanned.

We all wish for AI doing all the work for us. But be careful what you wish for!

A friend of mine - a YC founder - used Taplio, a tool that helps automate content and engagement on LinkedIn. It boosted the engagement to 100,000+ impressions!

Then LinkedIn banned Taplio. Both the CEO’s and company’s accounts were banned permanently. Many of their users have been penalized. 

My friend’s posts hover at 1,000 impressions. Today he asked me to talk to someone in LinkedIn HQ to get him out of the LinkedIn jail… 

2. LinkedIn isn’t designed for virality. 

Still seeing cringy viral posts and thinking “What’s wrong with LinkedIn?”. Well, they know it’s wrong and they’re trying to fix it.

Their AI models are getting more accurate at scoring content and creators. 

Odd engagement patterns raise red flags. And even if your post gets real engagement, if it’s too clickbaity, your content, or even your account, might get flagged.

3. Engagement pods (like for like) are ALSO being cracked down. 

LinkedIn distributes your content to relevant people in your network. But most pods are filled with random folks from unrelated industries, or worse, fake accounts.

If they like or comment on your content, it confuses the algorithm. Your content score might get downgraded, or your entire account could suffer.

4. Posting every day used to be the golden rule. Not anymore.

The algorithm now tags over-posting as noise. It’s not about being daily, it’s about sharing thoughtful insights. Let’s be honest, do you have thoughtful insights everyday?

In short:
Optimize for sustainability: respect their policies, be patient & consistent with quality content.

1kged7y,"At a challenging time in my career, looking for some guidance, what can I do?","
Hi All, so I’ll try to keep this short since it’s basically my life story. I’m (male) about to hit 50 this year. I’ve never been a career oriented person, which looking back there are fields I wish I would’ve pursued, but I was always in a semi-survival mode so I usually just went with the path of least resistance. I was a food server until 2009 until I really wanted out and did a volunteer gig with Americorps (which I just learned they’re trying to gut 😞) Anyway, that gig turned into a full time job with a hunger relief organization, which I learned a lot from and eventually led (with a coworker) the last few years. After 14 years of that, there was no more growth opportunity and it was time to leave for other reasons. Well, leaving that job sparked a full on mental health crisis, feeling like I didn’t have a direction to go in and having a family to support. I spiraled for a couple of years, while working a similar new job, but hating it, then hit a low point last August. In the meantime I started working in maintenance at my wife’s school just to get back on my feet and to be productive. I actually don’t mind this work at all, everyone is very nice and appreciative and the crew is cool too. The pay is very low though, not sustainable. I’m in a much better place mentally, which is great, but I need to make a move soon. I guess what I’m asking is if anybody else had to find a new direction around 50, and how they accomplished it.

1kgeaw1,Advice Needed: Training a Know-It-All Internal Hire.,"So my manager (we’ll call her Anna) recently made an internal hire into our department — let’s call her Liz. Anna asked me to train Liz on some of our team’s job functions. For background, Liz has been with the company for over 15 years. I’ve been here a little less than 5. Anna and Liz go way back, too — they’ve worked together for a long time and are clearly friendly.

When Liz joined our team, Anna introduced her as a fantastic addition with a wealth of company knowledge. And to be fair, I don’t doubt Liz does have a ton of knowledge…about what she’s done the last 15 years. But that was in a completely different department. Yes, her old team worked closely with ours, but their responsibilities are totally different. She doesn’t really know our systems, our processes, or how we handle things. Which is exactly why I was asked to help train her.

Now, it's been about a month, and Liz has already raised some red flags. I’m not sure if it’s because she’s been here forever and sees me as “new,” so she doesn’t take me seriously — but it’s starting to get frustrating. Here are some examples:

1. Her whole attitude during training is dismissive.

On day one of training, her tone was very much “Oh, cute, you’re going to teach me something?” We finished the session, I asked if she had any questions, and she just said, “No, I got it.”

Fast forward a few days — she puts a meeting on my calendar to go over the same training topics. I’m thinking she just wants a refresher, no big deal. But while I’m walking her through the process again, she’s sitting there going “uh-huh, mmhmm” in the most bored tone. I glance over — SHE'S NOT EVEN LOOKING AT MY SCREEN! Just staring into space like I’m telling her a long-winded story about my weekend.

Then yesterday, she gets an email related to what we went over in both training sessions. She forwards it to me and says: “Let me know when you get a chance to show me how to do this.”

Rage

2. She ignores the training materials I spent time creating.

I created full training guides listing the step-by-step process on how to do everything I was tasked to train her on. The full process and how to navigate systems we use during that process. This wasn't created already. I took time away from my normal duties to do this for her because I really wanted this training to be a success.

But clearly, that was a waste of time because she either skims them or doesn’t bother to look at them at all. She continues to ask the same questions over email or chat — stuff I’ve already told her multiple times, walked her through in person, or included word-for-word in the guide that’s been emailed to her and saved in our shared folder.

3. This one sent me over the edge.

She walks up to my desk, full-on accusatory tone, and says: “You left out some information during training.” I’m caught off guard and ask what she means. She says: “ABC and XYZ are connected. They have different names in the system, but they’re the same.”

Now I’ve worked with “ABC” for about four years. There is ZERO connection to “XYZ” that I’ve ever seen. But she says it with such confidence that I actually thought ""Crap, have I been doing ABC wrong this entire time?!""

So, while she’s standing there, I go into the system to double-check — and yep, no connection at all. I tell her, “I’m sorry, but I don’t know where you’re getting that info. There’s no link between the two from what I see and know.” Her response...“Well, I don’t know…someone needs to get me the right information. I’ll have to do some research and find out what’s going on.” And then she just walks away. I was completely baffled.

Anyway, I KNOW I need to bring this all up to my manager. That’s not what I’m asking in this post — I know this needs to be addressed. The issue is: how?

They’ve worked together way longer than I’ve been here. Liz is well-known around the company — her name carries weight with people in different departments, just from her being here so long. So now I’m stuck in this awkward spot where I have to figure out how to say, essentially, “She was a bad hire,” without it blowing back on me.

It would probably be easier if Anna and Liz weren’t friendly, but they are. And that makes this way more uncomfortable. I can’t keep doing this. It’s pulling me away from my regular responsibilities (even outside of scheduled training time), and I know it’s going to come back to bite me when Liz eventually messes something up and tries to blame me for “inadequate training.”

Sorry for the long rant — if you read this far, thanks.

How would you handle this?",Express_Hyena5992,3,0.8100000023841858,6,1746562038,2025-05-06 20:07:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kgeaw1/advice_needed_training_a_knowitall_internal_hire/,5,2025

1kgds2s,"Started a new job 2 months ago but a company I like is hiring again for a role I previously interviewed for, should I apply and interview again?","Hi!

So I started a new job about 2 months ago and I am liking it but a role that I had previously made it to final interview round (got rejected) is hiring for the same role again. I interviewed for this other role about 6 months ago. 

I am unsure of what to do, should I ignore this altogether? Should atleast apply and see what happens?

The thing is I don't know if I should update my resume before applying or just leave it off, I have only been here for 2 months. I already updated my linkedin profile as well.

My role is client-facing so it would be a mess if I left (ofc if I get this job in the first place) becuase the person I replaced stayed longer simply because they had to hire someone to overtake things. But the role that I want to reapply for would be great for my career not just in terms of salary but overall growth.

1kgdmbb,I'm a Year 13 student in the UK with multiple offers from big engineering companies to study various kinds of engineering and need some advice with this pivotal decision in my life from experienced engineers.,"Hi everyone, I'm in my final year of A Levels (18 and about to leave high school if not from the UK) and I'm doing my exams in about a month. During the year, I applied to various companies and secured 6 degree apprenticeship offers and I need some help to make the most informed decision that sets me up for a successful career. 



These offers are for degree apprentice positions, which if you're unfamiliar, the UK government pays companies to take on 'degree apprentices' each year, where these apprentices work for 4-5 years in a regular engineering job while earning studying towards a degree, completely funded by the company.



Currently I have offers from BAE Systems, Thales, UK Ministry of Defence, Bentley Motors, Atkins Realis and Sellafield to study various engineering degrees including Systems, Mechanical and Electromechanical Engineering. 



This is a very big decision I need to make by September and was hoping some engineers could help me with the decision, where the best companies are and which jobs/degrees set me up best for a profitable and successful engineering career. 



I'd appreciate any questions or DM's about the matter, or even a call with any experienced engineers.



Thanks.

1kgdl4g,"Went to law school, passed the bar, got promoted... Miserable","Five years ago I went on a trip for work and ended up really enjoying it in a way I hadn't expected. I work for an insurance company and my department does some lobbying and general government relations. On this trip I was not tasked with entertaining regulators or cultivating relationships but I did. I formed a couple of good relationships and, if I had any status in my company, that could have been really great for me professionally. I decided to go to law school part time at night while I worked my full time job as a paralegal. I told my company what I was doing and why and they even contributed to my tuition. I completed law school with an excellent GPA, passed the bar exam on the first try with a newborn baby at home, and went to my boss to ask for the promotion we discussed before I started attending school. 

Apparently there wasn't money in the budget for the position I wanted. My boss, to their credit, created a new position for me that included a pay increase of $20k and was an attorney position. Unfortunately, the new position is literally my old job for more money. I'm still doing administrative work, I'm still basically a paralegal. They told me to wait it out and see what happens next year. 

Then, one of the other attorneys in our department took a better job with another company. The day he announced he was leaving, his job duties started to be transferred to me. The following week my boss announced to the whole office that they were posting a job opening to fill his position. I asked her what this means for me and she basically told me that because I'm a recent law school graduate, despite working for this company for over a decade and specifically going to law school to work here, I didn't have the experience necessary for the position but don't worry, a position under them will open up eventually.

At this point my ego is a bit bruised. I'm taking on new responsibilities but still none of them are what I wanted, I'm not good enough for the position I want, there's ""not enough money in the budget"" to pay me what I think I deserve, the company has no problem spending several times my salary on complete nonsense, and I don't even really care anymore. I don't think I want to work in insurance anymore and I don't even know if I want to be a lawyer.

I know there are plenty of JD required jobs I can do that aren't attorney jobs but I just don't even know what I want to do. I used to love criminal law but ever since I had my child I have no stomach for crime anymore. I don't want to draft motions and schedule depositions and do all the litigation grind work that comes along with traditional law firms. I don't even know how to figure out what I want. I did not expect to be this lost at this point. 

Can someone suggest something that I can do to refocus and at least come up with a new goal? I feel deeply unsatisfied.

a couple months ago, i thought i wanted to get into crisis management work, with youth, because i have decent experience with kids of all ages. i wanted the long day/night shifts- not your average 9-5 job. ive never been interested a corporate/office job, i want to do hands on work. 
but recently, i started working with a puppy rescue organization in a wierd way- i had a volunteer admin assistant position in return for classes at a sports facility, and a puppy yoga place opened up downstairs. i took a class and fell in love- and started working with the founder. shes been rescuing for 25 years and the yoga place is a new endeavour to help pay for the vet bills, + the pups can be adopted. so i started teaching the yoga classes and hanging around before + after classes to volunteer my time, and i learned so much i can basically run the whole program myself. she trusts me and values me a-lot and wants to keep me involved as the business grows. i have also been given complete freedom on directing kids and family classes and kids private parties. given the business is so new and its based off a rescue organization - i only make about $300 a month. im still on support from my father as my graduation is recent. but he has been struggling a bit financially recently and wants me to put myself in the ""adult world"" and find a full time job. everytime i call him he gives me more tips on finding a job in the psych field, which is helpful, but its also stressful. i dont know if thats something i want to pursue now and he doesnt listen when i try to tell him about what ive been doing in this job and how i may want to continue down a different path instead- like maybe i go into fitness, maybe a dog groomer? i dont know what to do. i absolutely could and am willing to find a part time job just as a server or cashier somewhere to pull myself off his financial support, but i know that is not his worries- he wants me in a quote en quote real job. how do i go about this? what should i focus on? i also feel bad for ""not using my degree"" if i continue where im headed currently. please help!

With my summer break approaching, I'm determined to secure an internship at a reputed firm (ideally one of the Big 4) I know many of you here have valuable experience, so I'd really appreciate any advice on how to strengthen my profile, approach applications, and increase my chances of getting selected.

1kg9bx5,Should I Switch jobs internally even though leaving for another company would get me more money.,"Hey I work in cyber security I'm 28 . I just got a job offer from a sub company in my company. I want to make more as I just moved to NYC and I am currently making 96k the new job would be identical in every way, but the pay is 108k team is smaller and there is more work. 

The thing is this job was posted at a higher level I was fully qualified for the position but based on my current pay range level they dropped the level of the position so that I wouldn't do a 2 level jump. Had I come from outside they would have paid me for the higher pay range but now they are offering 108k instead of the 110k-160k that the original offer had listed.

I'm looking to save for a house and a kid and I am making good money, trust me I know. I grew up without and now I have the money to even think about saying no to this. My concerns are:

Why not just give me the higher paying job and title? Bureaucracy

If I take it I'll be thrust into a new environment and I'll probably get a promotion where I'm at but it won't be to 108k.

I will probably find more learning opportunities in the new job. 

The sub company is having its contract up for renewal so I don't know what that means for it's future

If I take the job wouldn't it look bad on my resume if I jumped withing 6 months looking for another job?

Should I just look for a job at another company even though I have an offer right here?

Am I dumb for being hesitant?",akuwa12,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1746550053,2025-05-06 16:47:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kg9bx5/should_i_switch_jobs_internally_even_though/,5,2025
1kg96jl,Brining up pre-planned vacation at new job?,"I’m interviewing for a new role, and while I’m in initial stages of the process, I was wondering if there is a way to bring up my pre-planned vacation or if it’s even appropriate to be taking this time off.

I have an about 5 days planned last week of June for travel.

And then about 9 days planned in the first week to August. 

And then in the first week of Jan, combined with remote work in Dec it they allow so I can attend my sister’s wedding in my home country (and see my siblings after 3 years). 

Unfortunately, the August is also not very flexible because one is a religious trip I’ve been meaning to take for years and happens on specific dates annually. 

The only things I can be flexible with is my June vacation, but I was curious if it would be too much if I asked for a start date after one month of signing so I can take that time off as well?

I haven’t been able to take much time off or travel for the past two years due to some immigration related issues which prevented me from leaving the country, so really hoping to take this time. 

Curious what everyone thinks about this and how you would see it as a hiring manager or manager?

1kg8rpp,Mid 30’s Career Shifts?,"Hey, folks.

I’ll try to keep it brief. I worked hard early in my career and I’m lucky. 

Like some of you might have, I’ve climbed the ladder high enough at my company that promotion opportunities are becoming sparse (and the level of bs you have to put up with in those positions is unappealing). That said, though I stay pretty busy (50-55 hours, calls on weekends, out of town 1-2 days a week), I make good money (~$270k) and enjoy my job despite the occasional heavy stress.

My question is, is there a career shift you could make in your mid 30’s that could get you to a career that could beat these stats (higher pay OR same pay, but low stress, OR same pay but less hours, etc.)?

Have any of you folks pulled this off? If so, are you happy with the change you made?

1kg8gup,Software Engineer feeling stuck and undervalued,"# Current Situation

* Working on a technically complex, critical legacy component
* Leadership enthusiastically pushing AI tools without improving fundamental processes
* Subpar engineering quality and processes with frequent bugs and issues
* Siloed work environment with minimal collaboration
* Superficial code reviews focused on quick approvals rather than substantive feedback
* Lacking fundamental engineering practices (commented-out tests, no pipelines, superficial fixes, minimal design)
* Contradictory workplace dynamics where technical contributions are verbally praised but systematically underutilized

# Key Concerns

* Shift from promised product input/client interaction to purely technical work
* Unfulfilled promises about role scope (full-stack, product input)
* Limited opportunities for broader experience despite explicit requests
* Lack of transparent feedback despite repeated requests
* Pushback when discussing career growth aspirations
* Unavailable management positions of interest
* Perception that enthusiasm for improvements might threaten established leadership
* CEO's AI obsession causing anxiety that impacts life outside work

# Personal Reflection

* Recognition of need for more proactivity in driving improvements
* Some improvements made, but not as many as desired
* Hesitation to initiate practice discussions or retrospectives
* Decreased motivation to drive improvements as time passes and feeling less valued

# Considering

* Moving to another company for better compensation and growth
* Finding an environment with healthier engineering culture and transparent feedback
* Seeking roles with clear paths to management or technical leadership
* Working on being more proactive regardless of environment

# Questions

1. How to position oneself for senior/management roles without formal management experience?
2. Best interview questions for evaluating engineering culture and ensuring promises materialise?
3. How to determine if the issue is lack of proactivity versus a limiting environment?

In Colorado. 
Accepted a job, got the offer, completed onboarding and still no drug test.

 During the inital interview they said there would be background checks and drug screen (per the interviewer). After that interview they called me back to shadow for a day before extending the offer.

Corp. HR reached out with all the onboarding shit, background checks, a whole list of things that did not include a drug test. 

Onboarding stuff and all that went fine and the hiring manager called a week or so later to schedule my first week, starting tomorrow.

What do you think the chances are of them testing me at work the first day?

The position is one that required a degree and numerous certificatons and licenses.....so really not sure what to think. Any other similar type place i have been always drug tested before starting there.

I  carefully reviewed the original job posting, my offer letter, and corp. employee handbook. The only thing it said about testing was it would be done if you are hurt or they suspect it.

I have looked to see what job availability is out there, but the thing is I feel really stuck. I work as a MCO and Newscast Director and I will be starting my 8th year come June. My coworkers and I have not had a raise in 3 years and we are making about the same as new employees. We know we are getting scammed out of the wages we should be making, which should be $20 something an hour and not just barely $19. I also have a bachelor degree too. 

The thing is I don’t know even know what other jobs/careers I would be qualified for with the experience I have. (I also do a lot of theatre and I have made a couple of short films. My BA is actually in theatre/film studies). I don’t know what I would like to do or what I would be good at. I just know I deserve to be getting more esp with inflation and the costs of living. If rent goes up come Sept I will have to move back in temporarily with my mom. I am 34. I will also be getting more PTO come June (160 hours max for the year. It carries over into the next year too and we’re always accruing hours at the start of every month) and the benefits are nice. I’ve also been working weekends this whole time and I am sick of it. I work 4 10s so having days off on the weekdays is nice. 

I just want advice on what I should be looking for and doing that I haven’t already when looking at new jobs.

I’ve tried various careers, but they all felt somewhat disconnected from my personal values. Still, I’m not wealthy, and since I don’t have capital or land, I have to trade my time to earn money.

Right now, I’m aiming for financial independence, and I’m okay with that, but I truly can’t pinpoint a career direction.

Some became real estate agents, others fishmongers, and I can assure you they earn at least five times more than a corporate manager who studied for years, at least here in my country.

I know I have time to study, but what’s the practical value of getting a degree in economics, psychology, computer science, or civil engineering? I could buy a truck, make some contacts, and start selling fish, or get into real estate and build a career much faster.

Im excited about this increased job security being the only one on the team who knows how to handle this type of work. However the issue of how to handle vacation has come up.

If no one else knows how to handle this work, I’m wondering if I’ll ever be able to go on vacation and truly log off for a meaningful amount of time. The guy before me (before I came a long) basically never took a real vacation. He was always just checking his emails.

I do have the option to train someone else on my team to handle this work so they can cover me while I’m out, but I’m worried that decreases my newly earned security.

I know the pros and cons are pretty clear here. I guess I’m wondering what you would do in this situation? Train someone to cover while you’re out, or always stay semi logged in? Or is there a 3rd option I’m not considering?

1kg62s6,"New Manager Basically ""Soft Fired"" Me","I was working at a pretty prestitigious company but wasn't really enjoying it. It was a new project from an established group and there was a lot of pressure for things to go well so stress was high and that wasn't good for me. Also the hours were a little wonky so I wanted a change to that as well.

I found a new job and the hours were closer to what I wanted, the environment was less stressful, and it just generally seemed like a better fit. To that end, I came in with a really good attitude. I was quick to introduce myself to everyone, I was eager to listen/learn, I was diligent etc. Seemed like things were going well. I genuinely enjoyed going to work somedays and my coworkers and I would often hang out after work. 

Then came last week. I was about to leave for the weekend when my boss asked to speak with me. I was a little nervous but it had been almost exactly one month since I had started there so I figured he was just checking in to see how things were going. And that is exactly where the conversation started but then he started getting a little long winded and I started feeling like things were taking a turn. I told him I thought things were going well and if there are things that I could work on then I would be happy to do so. 

That's when he got kinda animated. Not mad, just animated. He basically said, ""I'm genuinely confused by your work performance. I'm not seeing what I expected from your resume and the job interview. You don't seem to be picking up and basic stuff and some of your coworkers have expressed frustration."" That last part is what really hurt. 

My manager seemed like a bit of a pissant so I figured maybe it was just his MO to be tough up front to keep people in line but to say that about my coworkers. And now, that taints the whole dynamic. I liked these people and I thought they liked me but now I don't know anymore. 

To further complicate things, my manager asked me, ""Do you want to keep working here?"". I said, ""yes"" and that I was willing to adjust my work style as need be and I am not above constructive criticism and feedback. He honestly seemed a little disappointed that I didn't just say, ""No, I quit. Bye!"". I tried telling myself - I can turn things around just stay positive, keep your head down, work hard, be polite and courteous and hopefully things work out. I'm not sure if that's what I want though. 

I feel blindsided and kinda offended by my manager's comments, I feel anxious about working with people who potentially resent me, and, to throw in another monkey wrench, my industry is dependent on tourism and we are just at the beginning of the dead season. That might mean we'll be slower for a couple months and the group will be more willing to give me time to get up to speed. Or it could mean they want to lay off people and that's one more reason to get rid of me. 

At this point, I'm kinda ambivalent. I am just gonna go day by day. Everyday may or may not be my last day. I guess that was kinda always the case.

TL;DR: Started a new job. Thought it was going well. One month in my manager blindsides me saying I seem lost/not learning fast enough/management and staff are very concerned. He basically asks me if I'd like to just quit. I said I would try to turn things around. He was open but unsure. I am upset and unsure.",ofthedappersort,32,0.9200000166893005,24,1746542191,2025-05-06 14:36:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kg62s6/new_manager_basically_soft_fired_me/,5,2025

1kg56x8,How far can former employees go with hiring a lawyer after they get fired?,"
I can get if they were being harassed, whether it’d be sexually or even if not to that extent. But for bad performance? My mom worked with 2 women who had very bad reps at the company. Lazy, calling out all the time, on corrective action etc. Yet one quit right before she was about to get fired and another one decided to go on disability but still employed there. But both have talked about hiring a lawyer if they were fired. The one on disability is tbd but she’s been in all kinds of trouble and retrained too. I always thought if it was justified and they have the record to back it up, a lawyer wouldn’t do much.

1kg530r,Determining whether it's worth it to accept a job that's a huge pay raise but not as interesting.,"I'm 28 in engineering and I currently make around $110k in my current role, and I've been offered a job that's paying $165k with annual bonuses on top. This would be a massive pay raise and would go a long ways towards achieving some financial goals much sooner. I wasn't actively looking for a job but this company is working hard to recruit people right now.

The problem is that I like my current job a lot, and I like my coworkers a lot. The work is really interesting and is likely more interesting than what I'd be doing at the new place. Work life balance seems like it would be similar between the places but I know for certain that I have a really good thing going where I am.

1kg4ldk,Career crisis - what should I do?,"Hi everyone, I'm 25M (26 in Sept) and I'm a tattooist of 4.5 years in Australia. For the last year I've been having a career crisis. The first 3 years was great, it was during the peak of the tattoo industry after the covid lockdown. When the economy hit hard from like 2023, it affected the industry greatly as many people can't afford tattoos and also the industry has also become quite over saturated and many tattooists has been struggling to get work so many of them has a second job. My income has dropped too and I used to consistently have bookings ahead but now I'm struggling to get work. I'd like to say that I'm a pretty good tattooist, I do quality work, fast and charge very reasonably, and I do have a good rep but it's just that people can't afford tattoos. 

So with how this career path being unstable, it's not really something I want to deal with for the rest of my life worrying about getting work. So I've been looking into other career path and I've interested in the trades. I just had some trial runs for brickie and fitter and turner but after experiencing it its not something I want as a career path. 

I'm not exactly in a position to worry financially as I have enough saved and I'm making enough tattooing to be just fine, it's more for my future and being able to get a loan for a house because I probably couldn't get one with this job. I'm also married with a 5 year old. My wife will graduate uni end of next year so another 1.5 years till she'll be working full time too.

So yeah with all that said, I'm seeking guidance on my career crisis and what I should do with my career path? What are some career path I could take being someone who's only done tattooing? And has anyone else has been in a similar situation before?

1kg4i58,I(M20) want to do something more meaningful other than Consultancy.,"I(M21) have completed my undergraduate studies at a prestigious university in India.

Recently, I got into a pretty good MBA college. But I do not want to do a job in Consultancy or Finance. I want to work at a job that is more on the social impact side. Something that creates meaningful outcomes in the lives of underprivileged people.   
I want to work against income inequality or the healthcare system. I am interested in subjects like Sociology or Labour Laws. But...I also have a HUGE education loan that I have to pay off (of my UG+PG). 

Also, the MBA program I got into is a VERY good opportunity, it almost guarantees a lucrative job. I will for sure do an MBA as I am in a VERY VERY crappy job right now. My best hope right now is that I work in some MNC consultancy firm in a Government department branch. But I honestly have no idea.

Does any of you here have an idea about jobs that are high paying (even if not as much as the ones I would get in a typical Finance job), and are in the Social Impact sector? Please let me know.

I have worked with several NGOs, and I know I genuinely want to work towards a noble cause, it's just I have a loan which tempts me to go into Business jobs.

I started a new job in a local govt office. It's kind of boring but I'm coming from the non-profit world so I like that I get better benefits, a better salary, and still get to do work that I think is good for ny community. 

Anyway I've been working here for about a month and during my training I did things like: taught a coworker how to copy and paste in excel, taught a few people about keyboard short cuts (literally for copy and paste) set up phone link on everyone's PCs so they don't have to pull out their work phone every time they text a client and done a factory reset on some tech that they had been locked out of for 6 months.

All really simple stuff that I'm surprised they struggled with. I then got an email from my director thanking me for all the tech help I've given the dept. 

What can I do to ride this wave? Are there some simple tech things I can learn that will come in hand further down the line and be useful for propelling my career a bit more?

1kg362i,I hate my WFH job and I need help getting through it.,"Long story short: I work from home at a Fortune 500 tech company doing order support. I’m on the phone all day dealing with customer/employee/driver issues. The phone never stops. I log complaints, calm people down like they’re toddlers, and jump to the next. It gets old fast.

I knew this job wasn’t going to be amazing. But I took it with the mindset that it could aid me in climbing the corporate ladder. I've been with the company for about 6 years in different departments and figured this could be part of a successful path for me. I’ve been in this role for 7 months, and while I knew it would suck, I didn’t expect to feel this burned out this quickly. 4 months in, and I already hated it.

Then things turned around for a bit. I got temporarily assigned to another department that handled proactive customer resolutions in February. No phones constantly ringing. Just fixing issues before customers even knew there was a problem. I felt like I could breathe. I liked the work. I liked the people. The feeling was mutual, and there were even talks about making it permanent. It felt like a path forward. I was supposed to be there through June.

Then, last week, the entire department got laid off. Everyone, managers and employees alike gone. Except me, because I wasn’t technically part of it. Just like that, it was over. No warning. No goodbye.

Now I’m back on my old duties, and I feel completely drained. The dread starts before I even wake up. I find myself avoiding going to bed because I know that will just make work come faster. The sound of the phone ringing feels like it’s pulling the life out of me. I’m applying to other companies, but we all know how that goes lately. It’s hard to feel hopeful.

So I’m just asking: how do you deal with this kind of burnout while you’re stuck in it? I’m trying to hold on until something better comes, but I’m running on fumes. Any advice or coping strategies would help.

Thank you so much for reading!

TL;DR - I loathe my job, was then given an opportunity to do something I enjoyed, but then it got taken away from me with short notice.

I was told that growth in QA in the company is quicker since they have wider focus, which is not only on testing but scripting, network design and analysis and developing other tools using golang.

There is no difference in salary is what I am told.

My plan is to stay in the company for 2 years years gain the min experience and then move on for masters or jump.

Keeping in mind I need time to prep for exams to get into a reputed uni for masters.

I want to continue writing code and learning intersting things without restrictions.

What do I do?

It's a bit weird, but I have a degree in computer science, but did not pursue a career in computer science. Rather, I started working as admin staff in a company for a few years now. Now that I am 30 yo. A position opened in the accounts department of my company, and they offered me the job since they could not find a new hire immediately. I took the role about 10 months ago, and my job includes making invoices, setting up the prices for the customers, giving quotes to customers, communicating with clients regarding the payments, and now I have started filling out tenders as well. I feel like this is the career for me, I have learned Excel and I feel I am pretty good at it now, learned about the company finances, and balancing the sheets. Can you guys recommend some certifications and courses that I can do with my job to learn and add to my resume, so that in the future if I switch jobs, I'll be more legitimate.

1kg06w0,Should I consider a change?,"I (40F) have worked in the same call center for 6 years. I loved the job at first, but it’s becoming harder to make ends meet. Also, little things have been happening that are making me question whether I should find work elsewhere.
1) people who have been there for only a year or so are getting promoted ahead of me.
2) My salary is lower than the average for my state. My company decided that they no longer wanted offices in my state, so I’m exclusively work at home. Because of this, it’s next to impossible for an employee from my state to even apply for a higher position. 
3) This is what’s tipping me toward leaving. I now have to clock out to use the bathroom/answer my door etc (this is a rule for everyone not just me). I don’t know about anyone else but if I have to pee I’m gonna get up and go, not screw around clocking off for 5 extra minutes and risk not making it to the restroom. 
4) I’ve been feeling invalidated when I bring up valid concerns to my team lead about things. He shuts me down a lot.

1kfz0zd,Would you take the leap or stay where it’s safe? Trying to decide if I should accept an Executive Director role,"Hi all, I’d love some perspective on a big career decision I’m wrestling with.

I’m a 26-year-old woman working in social impact, specifically education policy, currently in a fairly stable and flexible consulting role for a boutique firm with decent pay (100k) and room to grow, albeit slowly since the company is so small. The work aligns with my values, and I have a decent amount of autonomy and time for my toddler, writing, and life outside of work. I’m a fully remote worker and travel about once a month for 2-4 days out of state. It’s not perfect (some interpersonal issues with management and their culture/communication style but nothing major), but it’s sustainable and safe.

Now I’ve been offered an Executive Director role at a mission-aligned nonprofit focused on reproductive justice in the South. The role is incredibly meaningful to me. It’s high-profile, values-aligned, and would give me real influence in a movement I deeply care about. It’s the kind of role that could seriously accelerate my career and put me on the map in terms of national visibility, strategy, and leadership. I’d get to be a public voice for something I believe in with my whole chest.

But I also have big reservations. The salary is lower than what this kind of responsibility usually pays (around $120K which is a bump in pay but not a ton given it’s a job hop not a promotion), and the scope is… a lot. Fundraising, ops, coalition management, public comms, HR, all rolled into one. I don’t have a ton formal fundraising experience, most of it comes from supporting nonprofits through that process as a consultant, but it’s never been on my shoulders directly, and while I know I could figure it out, I also know I’d be stepping into a very emotionally and politically demanding job during a pretty intense life stage. I’ve been told the role is flexible (also fully remote with 2-5 days of in-person events and in-state travel per month) and the team is supportive, but I don’t want to be in a position where I’m pouring from an empty cup six months in. I also worry that being in the top position of a nonprofit could mean needing to cut this salary if I have a learning curve with fundraising and increasing donors. Stability is very important to me since I have a small child. 

What makes this so hard is that I want to lead. I want to be seen as a serious player in this work. And this role could absolutely do that. But I’m also scared of stepping into something that isn’t sustainable or well-resourced enough to hold me, especially as a young mom trying to balance purpose with preservation. I currently work and side job doing a different kind of consulting work that is 5-15 hours per week and brings in about $20-25k extra per year. This goes toward paying off student loans and part time care for my daughter. 

If I take on a job with a lot more responsibility, I’m almost confident I’d need to fork up more money to get full time care, which is another $10k a year. And with the extra demands, I think it would be recipe for burnout to try to keep freelance consulting on the side. I’d prefer to have just one job anyway, but as it currently stands, what I make right now with that supplemental income is what I “need” to afford the kind of lifestyle I want for myself and my family. Could I make budget cuts if needed? Yes, but I don’t want to if I don’t need to. 

If you’ve made a big leap like this or chosen to walk away from an opportunity like this one, I’d love to hear how you decided.
How did you weigh ambition vs. stability?
What would you do if you were me?

Thanks in advance. This is one of those moments where I feel like whatever I choose will shape a lot of what comes next. I know there’s no “right” answer, but I truly feel unable to make a choice because of all the “what ifs” on both sides. 

TL;DR:
I’m 26, working in a stable and flexible $100K consulting job in education policy with some extra income (~20k) from part time freelance consulting. I was offered an Executive Director role at a reproductive justice nonprofit that aligns with my values and would raise my profile, but it comes with a lot more responsibility, and only a modest pay increase (120k salary). I’m a mom to a toddler, and I’m nervous about the financial and emotional sustainability of taking on such a demanding role with limited fundraising experience and higher childcare costs to support the extra work demands of a bigger role. I want to lead and propel my career, but I also want flexibility and stability. Would you take the leap or stay where it’s safe? How do you balance ambition and stability?

1kfxll2,Burned Out 31M in EU Residency—Feeling Lost and Looking for Stories of Reinvention,"Hey everyone,

I’m a 31M physician in residency somewhere in the EU, and lately I feel completely drained by hospital life. I wake up each day dreading another shift, and even the thought of studying for in-service exams feels meaningless. The chaos, the rigid hierarchy and witnessing how poorly even the senior doctors are treated have pushed me to the brink. I no longer believe this environment fits who I am or the kind of life I want to build.

I’ve begun to seriously consider stepping off the clinical track entirely. On one hand, I’m curious about non-clinical fields like health management, medical writing, public health policy or digital health; on the other, I fantasize about something hands-on—perhaps a trade or craft that lets me see tangible results every day. Truth is, I don’t yet know exactly where I belong, but I’m desperate for a sense of purpose and well-being that I no longer find within hospital walls.

If any of you have ever faced a similar crossroads—leaving or pausing medicine to reinvent yourselves—I’d love to know what finally pushed you to make the change, how you prepared (whether through additional courses, new certifications, or building a safety net), and what you’ve landed in since. Was there a moment when you realized your medical degree could open doors beyond the wards? How did you manage the financial stress, the guilt or loss of identity, and the fear of the unknown? And alongside the struggles, what unexpected rewards or new passions did you discover once you took that leap?

Right now, I feel trapped by the steady pay and the prestige of a medical career, but I also fear that if I don’t try something new now, I’ll regret it forever. Any honest stories, practical advice, or even tough love would mean the world to me as I search for a healthier, more fulfilling path.",dothebestforyourhope,3,1.0,0,1746512098,2025-05-06 06:14:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kfxll2/burned_out_31m_in_eu_residencyfeeling_lost_and/,5,2025

1kfwa0f,Demoted after my sons death,"I had my son back in December, and I told them that in order to stay I needed to be made an hourly wage employee, not just an employee based on tips, I was a server and bartender for them. I came back after 2 weeks of maternity leave because I didn’t have enough saved for when I went on maternity leave. They gave me a cook position every couple of days but still had me serving the days they couldn’t give me a cook position. After a couple weeks they told me I was progressing enough that o could become a manager in a few weeks. The few weeks pass and I become a manager 2 days a week, cook 2 days a week and I serve the other day. It was that way for like 2 months. I ended up helping out in the two positions at other stores and such. The only complaints they ever had about me were about going to the bathroom and checking on my kids 16 month old and 0-4 month old) during my shift. My 4 month old passed away unexpectedly on April 11, and when I came back to work, they had me back on just serving and bartending. Didn’t say anything. Just switched me back. I thought it was just to get back into the routine of things. It’s my 3rd week back. I asked my manager earlier this week why I couldn’t at least cook for a little while just to get back into the routine of things. She says they don’t have the hours to give me and she’ll see what she can do. I came in Friday night to a new cook on the line. I tried to just brush it off but something kept bugging me to ask. He had all these hours (he’s worked 3 of the shifts I’ve worked since Friday) and she had told me “they didn’t have the hours to give me”. The math just wasn’t mathing. Before my manager left today I asked her what was going on. It just wasn’t mathing the way it needed to for me to understand. She said we had given you warnings about having to go to the bathroom and checking on your kids during shifts, the manager at the other store even said it was a problem during his shifts with you. None of us think this is right for you anymore, we’ll come back to it when we think you’re ready again. I had some of the best ticket times and rarely got food sent back to the kitchen, none of the other cooks had any complaints about me before I left for the week to grieve my son. The manager at the other store also repeatedly told me I was doing good over there and had no complaints (I’m close with that manager, he would have told me if he had complaints). I came back and now they’re saying I’ve just not been good enough and they can’t give me the positions anymore. Without actually saying anything to me, I feel like I’ve been double demoted. I don’t know what I wanted out of this post but I guess just some reassurance that I’m correct for feeling extremely upset about the whole thing. They’re playing with my money and acting like it’s not a big deal.

BUT when I went out on my leave to have the baby, it’s like a weight was lifted. No more anxiety and stress.

1kfw0bg,How to handle micromanager?,"I’ve been doing data analytics for 8 years now. Started a new job 6 months ago and have encountered my first micromanager. 

I was hired onto a broader strategy team to be a data analytics expert. Only one on my team. Manager knows some things about analytics / bI tools but no where near the level I do. 

I am working on this huge project transitioning Power BI systems. There were so many problems with the last system so there’s a ton of improvement opportunities. Problem is… I’m being micromanaged and told to do things that are not best practice by someone who doesn’t have a full understanding of how bi systems should work. 

Manager gets super into the details and doesn’t really explain or think about the broader goal either. I struggle to efficiently execute a project when I don’t know what the goal is. I can tell she frustrated that I’m  getting confused and not doing the project up to her standards. 

Tried to broach this to my manager today. I said something along the lines of “I would like to understand what the goal is of this phase of the project, and the overall goal, as well as have some more follow up discussions with the broader team to understand the true needs.” Manager said we already did that and wouldn’t discuss the goal or entertain the idea of meeting with stakeholders again. She jumped right back into the details. 

So - how do I handle people like this at work?Should I just let the project be shitty for the sake of keeping the peace or push back? Seriously never have worked for a micromanager before and I am struggling. 

Also I know it’s not just me, she does this in pretty much every aspect of her life that I’ve seen. ",DenverDogMom,3,1.0,7,1746505800,2025-05-06 04:30:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kfw0bg/how_to_handle_micromanager/,5,2025
1kfvzmy,What helps you actually get better at soft skills like handling tough conversations?,"Hey everyone—genuinely curious here.

I’ve been thinking about how a lot of our struggles at work and personal life come down to how we handle awkward or emotionally tense conversations. Stuff like:

* Responding to your partner who feels excluded
* Standing Up for Yourself to a Bullying Classmate
* Responding to a Family Member Criticizing Your Career Choice

I feel like we read books, take courses, or watch TED Talks—but when the real moment hits, it’s hard to *apply* any of that.

So I’ve been quietly building something that helps people practice these kinds of conversations in a simple, daily way (just 3 minutes a day). Think: personalized scenarios, short interactive roleplays, and actionable feedback.

Before I go too far down this rabbit hole, I just wanted to get a pulse from others:

* Have you tried to improve your communication or soft skills before?
* What actually helped you?
* Would you use something that lets you practice daily “micro-interactions” to get better?

Curious to hear your thoughts.

1kfvj82,How can I turn a solo summer project into a publishable research paper?,"Hey all,  
I’m an undergrad engineering student who’s feeling really motivated to take on a self-guided research project this summer. It’s simulation-based (no lab work), and I have a clear question I want to explore — something that involves comparing how materials behave under certain physical conditions.

I don’t need funding or credit; I just want to commit to doing something meaningful that I can hopefully turn into a publishable paper by the end of summer.

That said, I’ve never published before and I’m working mostly solo (possibly with light input from a professor if they have time).

If anyone here has done this or something similar, I’d love advice on:

* How to structure the project so it’s actually *publishable*
* Where undergrads can realistically submit papers (especially simulation-only work)
* Any tips or mistakes to avoid when doing an independent research paper

1kfuv4d,What career path should I take (PH),"Hi everyone! I’d like to ask for your opinions and hopefully get some advice about my current situation.

I graduated with a degree in Hospitality Management from one of the top 4 universities. After graduation, I worked as a barista. I was scheduled to work six days a week, with only one day off during weekdays. The pay was also minimum wage. I eventually resigned before completing a year because I felt physically and mentally exhausted.

I started to feel like there was no work-life balance in the service industry. I used to always be present at family gatherings, birthdays, and outings, but once I started working, I missed all of those moments. That caused me to lose my passion for the industry. It felt like I was just living to work, not working to live.

Now, I’m confused about which path to take. I’ve been applying for work-from-home or office-based jobs, hoping for weekends off and a higher salary than my previous job. I also believe this type of work would give me a better work-life balance. However, despite applying to many companies, I still haven’t landed a job.

At the moment, I’m torn between two options:

1.	⁠Work in a BPO company for 1–2 years to gain experience. After that, I plan to transition to an in-house company, since I’ve read that long-term growth and better pay are more likely in those roles.

2.	⁠Go back to the food service industry and apply through an agency. I’ve tried applying directly to hotels, but most haven’t responded. My plan here is to gain 1–2 years of experience and then apply to international hotels or cruise lines.

I would really appreciate any advice or insights you can share based on your experience. Thank you!",Ok-Truck5788,2,1.0,2,1746501800,2025-05-06 03:23:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kfuv4d/what_career_path_should_i_take_ph/,5,2025

1kfuin1,"[Inspiration] Don’t stress—you’ve got this. With focus, preparation, and the right support, it’s amazing how quickly things can turn around.","A few weeks ago, I received a message from a recent UCLA graduate—we’ll call him Alex—who was deep into preparing for Amazon’s SDE 1 interview process. His message was short but urgent: “I don’t have enough stories for the behavioral round, and I’m freaking out.”

We set up a call soon after, and it became clear within minutes that the issue wasn’t a lack of experience—it was that he couldn’t quite see how to frame the work he had already done. His resume listed several projects and responsibilities, but he hadn’t yet connected those to the kinds of impactful, structured narratives Amazon looks for in its behavioral interviews.

30 minutes into the call, I told him directly that I didn’t think he was ready to interview next week and suggested that he ask for a reschedule. Understandably, he was hesitant; student hiring cycles are tight, and reschedules aren’t always guaranteed. But I helped him draft a professional, polite message to his recruiter, and luckily, they allowed him to push the interview back.

With some wiggle room, now we were ready to work.

What Alex struggled with most—something I see often among early-career engineers—was identifying impact. He could talk about what he built, what languages he used, and which tasks he owned, but when I asked how his work influenced the broader team or business, there was a pause.

So I asked questions that helped him think more broadly: What would have happened if your script delivered incorrect data? How would that have affected the research? What would happen if the tool you built went down? Did you help your startup save time and money, reduce bugs, or unblock progress?

Those questions sparked what I call a lightbulb moment. Suddenly, Alex began to see that the work he had once thought of as routine actually had meaningful consequences. From there, we crafted six to eight strong, structured behavioral stories that reflected not just what he did, but why it mattered—especially in the context of Amazon’s Leadership Principles.

Midway through our prep, it became clear that system design was another weak area. So we shifted gears and spent time reviewing core concepts like scalability, fault tolerance, trade-offs, and how to talk through architecture on a whiteboard. We kept practicing until he felt confident thinking out loud, under pressure.

Over the course of two weeks, we met for about six hours in total and stayed in touch between sessions through Discord—especially important since he was abroad at the time and juggling travel logistics. When the offer finally came in, he messaged me right away with a huge smile and a simple line: “I got it. I’m joining Amazon in Seattle.”

The takeaway is that many candidates have the right experience, but they often don’t know how to frame it in a way that’s compelling to interviewers. With the right guidance and a focused approach, it’s possible to turn confusion and anxiety into clarity and confidence—and ultimately, into a job offer.",ApprehensiveCar4900,1,1.0,0,1746500661,2025-05-06 03:04:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kfuin1/inspiration_dont_stressyouve_got_this_with_focus/,5,2025

1kftiw6,Career Crossroads After Near-Firing—Accept “Safe” Industry Offer or Hold Out for Better Fit?,"Hello

I’m a scientist in industry, and I’m facing a tough decision that I think many here might relate to. I could really use your insights.

I work at a large company that’s currently undergoing layoffs and a slow-moving site closure. No hard end date yet, but the writing is on the wall. Recently, I ran into serious conflict with leadership—largely over process vs. speed. I tend to prioritize quality and compliance (doing it the *right* way), which clashed with the “get it done now” culture.

This escalated to a suspension where I was told I had a 90% chance of being terminated. I fought it, pled my case, and ultimately won. I’m now back at work… reporting to the same leadership that tried to fire me. The atmosphere is understandably strained, and I’ve accelerated my job search.

Here’s my current situation:

* **Current job**: High pay, strong resume growth, but high stress and working under a leadership team that tried to push me out. Future is uncertain due to site closure.
* **Offer 1 (Accepted Offer, but still in process of background checks)**: Contract science at a small company, decent pay but lower title/responsibility. Requires long-distance relocation. Less prestige, but more stability—for now.
* **Offer 2 (coming this week)**: Better pay than Offer 1, more aligned with my skill set, but located in a much more expensive region. Bigger company and more stability, but cost-of-living is a concern.
* **Startups/local options**: A few early-stage companies are ramping up closer to home. Higher risk, but shorter moves and possibly more upside.

My conflict:  
Do I take the stable (but uninspiring) offer I’ve already accepted to escape the current toxic situation? Or do I hold out for something better—despite the risk of losing these options in a tough job market? I also have to factor in that I can’t afford a big salary drop long-term, as my current income supports my home.

If anyone’s faced a similar situation—especially in contract science, pharma/biotech transitions, or post-layoff survival—I’d love to hear your take. How do you balance survival, career trajectory, and risk when all the options are compromises?

I graduated with a BSc in Biochemistry last August and completed a one-year co-op at a pharmaceutical company. Since then, I’ve been actively applying to jobs in my field but haven’t had much success—either I’m rejected or don’t meet the qualifications.

Currently, I work in production at a generic drug manufacturing company. While I’m grateful for the job, it comes with downsides: rotating shifts every two weeks, low pay, and a toxic work environment. Even the hiring manager referred to it as a “general labor job,” which makes me feel like my degree isn’t being put to good use.

* **Job 5  hse officer (1 year, after my master’s):** I was told I wasn't a good to be able to start talking to clients. It felt like they gave up on me without any real support.
* **Job 6 hygiene manager(3 months):** The director had no understanding of hygiene or work organization. He wanted random execution, and I couldn't survive in that chaos.
* **Now:** I’m unemployed, and questioning everything.

I’m looking for some insight because I’m really torn between two opportunities right now. I just started as a Finacial Counselor at a large hospital. The job in-person, pays is $27/hr, which I feel is a bit low, but there are some solid perks:

\- Very flexible schedule (my manager is super kind and accommodating).

\- Potential to complete my clinicals there (I’m currently waiting to get into a nursing program).

\- I can basically set my own work hours.

\- Access to the hospital’s library and resources.

\- Great potential for networking and building connections in the medical field.

\- Only a 20-minute commute. 

The new opportunity is a Public Health Safety role with the Dept. of Corrections.

\- $85K+ annually (huge bump).

\- Commute is about 1.5 hours each way.

\- I don’t have all the job details yet (interviewing tomorrow), but it seems like a solid opportunity.

Additional context:

\- I’m 100% working toward becoming a nurse (waiting for nursing school acceptance).

\- I have a graduate degree in Public Health, so the DOC job could potentially tie in with that.

I just had my first official day at work after going through a 1-month training period. They told us we would be paid for the training, but so far we haven’t received anything. I assumed we would sign a contract on the first day in person, but nothing was mentioned—no contract, no details about salary, hours, or anything formal.

Honestly, the company feels very disorganized. No one seems to know what’s going on, and nothing looks like what they initially promised. I’m starting to feel like I’m being taken advantage of.

So I’m stuck wondering:

Should I go in tomorrow anyway?

1kfskmd,Not quite the right position.,"Hi, I currently work in manufacturing in the US and I’m pretty experienced with quality management. My job now is an analytical chemist and my working peers are well educated in science where I am not... but I have much more working experience than they do. It is a strange dynamic and it’s somewhat frustrating. I like my job, I wish I was taken more seriously though. I might struggle with the math and sciencey stuff a bit, but I’m one of the few audacious enough to enforce rules and routines. 

I guess I want to tell my employer I want to learn more at work or help in a different department or something.

1kfs0ki,"Mid-20s HR Manager, completely overwhelmed - seeking perspective.","Throwaway account for obvious reasons. My husband asked me to write this and get an outsider view that’s not him or my therapist.

I work in HR in higher ed. I have a liberal arts degree; when I started this job in an entry level data entry/hiring position in 2020, I didn’t even know what HR was. It was also my first real job, other jobs I’d held previously were copywriting, tutoring, etc. I enjoyed the position and learned everything very quickly. When our Payroll Manager decided to leave early 2022, I was cross trained three weeks before she left to run MN payroll. Another HRBP was cross trained to run BI payroll. That HRBP ended up resigning a month later so I was cross trained to run both. My boss and the VP of the department ended up asking me to apply for the position and I got it. The next year was hell. My boss nor the VP had any idea how to run payroll. In fact, the reason the previous Payroll Manager left was because of the VP—he didn’t support her cross training anyone in the span of 5 years and often argued about the way things should be done with no actual knowledge of how payroll is run in our very manual, very higher ed payroll system (IYKYK). 

I made every mistake known to man….short of accidentally paying everyone twice or forgetting to pay people at all by several days…(though I did forget to drop the bank file once). I cried constantly, would work til 6 most nights and usually work on the weekends to get caught up. By spring of 2023, I finally had it down and was doing amazing. Too amazing…because when my boss resigned mid-year 2023, the VP of the department encouraged me to apply for the HR Manager position she left. I applied for it and was offered the position that fall, one month before my maternity leave. 

This position is over two positions, soon to be three, and our work is focused solely on compensation, benefit administration, payroll, HRIS and our workforce management system. I had never supervised anyone before and I had to hire both of the people that report to me because we needed to backfill my position and the benefit person had quit around the same time as my boss. I was in my mid-20s at the time and in way over my head. Especially when I got back from maternity leave. My boss, the VP, was supposed to push projects along while I was out related to an integration with our HRIS and launch performance evaluations…he did neither and I feel like this was just the first in a long list of things he’s done to not support me. I struggled intensely (and still do) managing people for the first time. My boss’s boss ended up signing me up for supervisor classes because my boss wasn’t doing anything to help me. 

In addition to struggling as a first time supervisor, my workload is unsustainable. Our HRIS and workforce management systems are still not integrated and everything is so incredibly manual and tedious. For a year I was basically micromanaging my folks to get them to do their job because as a new mom with PPD and a new supervisor, I SUCKED at training them and was completely incapable at the time of having tough conversations with them. Now that I do feel more comfortable /confident in having these discussions, I am having them frequently in our 1-1s and at times have still not seen improvement in my direct reports. I have mentioned wanting to give one of them a written warning and my boss is completely unsupportive and is constantly coming up with excuses of why she might not be doing her work and to give her more grace. 

I started supervisor classes this year and those have helped but I am constantly stressing and worrying about work. When I am at the office, I am barely even taking restroom breaks because there is just so much to do when I am not in a meeting, which is probably 60% of my work week at this point. Furthermore, the rest of the department is kind of a mess also. The majority rarely try to figure things out on their own and make pretty frequent and severe mistakes like overpayments to employees (for example, not terminating someone). The culture in our department is very much no consequences. No matter how much someone messes up, no one has been written up to my knowledge since I joined. 

However, the turnover in the department is pretty telling. We are currently a department 9 and since I joined in late 2020, 10 people have come and gone. (That’s what—an annual 27% turnover rate?) 

I have another person reporting to me that’s starting in June to help me with our HRIS and workforce management system and I’m very hopeful that’s going to help but my husband’s concern is that it’s not going to change the negative effects this job has had on me for 3 years. My mental health is not great because of this job. I feel brain dead at 5 o’clock and Sunday night is the worst night of the week because it means work starts again tomorrow. My husband says I used to be fun, carefree and creative and this job has robbed me of that joyful life I used to have. At the same time, I feel immense conflict about quitting—I was promoted to an HR Manager in 4 years coming in with 0 years of experience in HR and I am often the smartest and most hardworking person in the room. 

But my husband insists my situation is not normal, nor healthy. It does feel completely unsustainable. I never feel caught up. It’s always something. The department as a whole has a bad rap for not being responsive (for example, most folks work from home 2 days a week and they refuse to forward their phone to their cell phone so for those two days, no one is actually answering the phone) and so by the time someone gets ahold of me, they’re already mad because they couldn’t get ahold of who they wanted to talk to in the first place. I feel like it’s just an utter mess but this is also my first job in HR. Apologies for the length—hard to condense 4 years of madness.

I have an offer from a T2 business school (Tier 1 overall school) for a bachelor of commerce. Here I can specialize in finance and economics, and potentially take on a minor in math or stats (or CS if I’m super lucky). Despite these great things, this place is known for its academic rigour (gpa killer) and it’s super expensive.

Now I also have a counter offer to another T1 overall school for a Bachelor of Arts. Here I can double major in Economics and CS, or Economics and Math. This might be less of a “target” but it’s cheaper, less rigorous, and keeps my options option for more technical careers - not just banking/consulting.

1kfofl7,How can i support my partner’s Career?,"
Hi all, 

TL;DR:
Seeking advice here for my partner who has almost 7 years of gap in her career because of the relocation, covid, baby and career changes and however nothing is working out. She is loosing her confidence month by month and year by year to get back to work.

Long story:

Before we met: We come from Asia and lived in different part of it with similar culture and values near to our families. He moved and lived in different part of same region because of family relocation and study opportunities for graduation and post graduation and then moved to cities for work while she grew up in same city and studied and worked there and almost lived her life there.

Marriage: After marriage we settled down in same city and he had technology job with occasionally traveling to different countries and she worked in city with her administration job till they both were 30 years old.

Big relocation: he got job opportunity in europe and with that they both moved to one of the major tech city where he immediately joined the work and she found herself in strange world where people spoke different languages, way of life  and weather was different, there are no nearby friends and families.

Integration: She decided to learn language of the land since she has experience in administrative work where language plays a role.she spent good time (2 years) reaching a language level B1 where she should not be uncomfortable making a conversation. She also found few friends from Asia in new place.

Covid and baby : as soon as covid came we also become parents and pufff she was locked in for 2 years. However kid is able to spend independent time mid 2023 in day care leaving few hours for her to work on her own plans.

Career change: She did course to change her career in to UX/UI but that is not working out as she feels that everyone else is better than her and she needs to be more smarter to get the job in the UX field.

Change Back to original: Recently she changed her plans to pursue her career in administrative/ support roles and it is also not easy to find a job there.

At the moment: she is loosing confidence in everything and most importantly in herself. Which is triggering me to seek advice here.

Relationship dynamics: i push her to achieve best but i think i am anyway considered as “pusher” by her which means that ‘ she thinks saying is easy and doing is difficult’ for me. I give her advice with best of my knowledge and sometimes follow up as well but followup dont end up well maybe because i get into manager mode. I myself search for jobs for her and share with her and then she takes day or two to apply on it. 

All in all : this is also spoiling our relationship because i keep on pushing her to find job or start business or do anything which gives her an exposure to outside world and she thinks that i just want to have her working and i am pushing her because she is burden on me.

Financially we are stable, living pay check to paycheck but living good life with god’s grace.

Question:
1. How can i support her encouraging doing anything i.e. finding a job, starting a business. Even taking coaching to get out of this situation. 
2. Are there any affordable options like bettercoach ? Is there any place where women support other women in such situations?

Please be kind , it took me a courage to open up on internet 🙏🏻

I’ve worked since I was like 13, never did not have a day job, and always had a side hustle. I’m smart, in a very outside the box way, and have made my life work out pretty well. But as I’m getting older, I desperately need a life change so I can move forward with things like marriage/family, and stop relying on anything illicit to pay bills. 

I’ve toyed with the idea of coding/accounting, I’ve worked in shipping/receiving biz for a long time at a franchise. But ideally I’m looking for something remote, that I can still do while I’m on the road with the band, get a laptop and get work done daily during travels. Willing to learn, get certified in something, but also not at a point where I want to do something completely brand new that I’ll have to give up my life for.

Looking to make a change this year after some of my other commitments settle down, but can learn and do research in the meantime.

I’m interested in tech but don’t have a tech background outside of sales. I feel like there are so many random jobs people do that I’ve never even heard of so I want to see what’s out there to see if I can find something I might enjoy just a little bit. 

Any advice would be appreciated and if I can help clarify anything the help narrow things down just let me know.

1kfl8rj,"History grad, but I don’t want to be pigeonholed into a writing job","I’m 25 working in marketing and communications for a university. I worked only part-time for a year before this, so I’m grateful to have a FT job with benefits and a salary.

However, the work is just so uninspiring for me. I work on writing and tweaking ad copy which I’m pretty sure does not make the slightest difference to the audience. I also write news “stories” that are just PR puff pieces rather than a real analysis of interesting topics. The only part that I kind of enjoy (relatively) is sending out internal newsletters every week to staff.

I got here because I started my career in journalism. I had a postgrad internship that lasted a year, then a part-time job at a small paper, where I ended up getting laid off because of the paper’s financial challenges. So, after a stint working at a bookstore to pay the bills, I decided to give up on journalism and “sell my soul” to do marketing so that I could actually make a livable wage.

Not only do I not care for this job — I dread the whole field. I don’t think there could be another marketing job where I could feel like I am using something close to my potential and knowledge. If the journalism industry magically revived tomorrow and there were jobs at general interest magazines again, I would jump on that immediately, but that’s just not reality.

I’ve thought about going back to school for engineering or physics. Physics was actually my first major before I changed to history, but despite the change I’m still deeply fascinated with the science. I’ve done some digging online and it sounds like job prospects are glum for physics too.

I’ve done a lot — a lot — of digging in this sub and others to see what people had to say in similar situations. And I’ve found some good general advice! But every situation is unique, so I wanted to see if anyone had tailored advice.",DoughnutConscious487,4,1.0,11,1746475032,2025-05-05 19:57:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kfl8rj/history_grad_but_i_dont_want_to_be_pigeonholed/,5,2025
1kfkbm5,Advice for a job fair (for an entry-level position),"So there is this job fair happening on Wednesday at my city that has been held for the past 2 years and actually 2 of the people I went to school with got a summer job there. There is everything from jobs that require degrees, to entry-level factory/sales/hospitality roles (most of them are that actually). I am taking a break from education because I entered a degree I realised that wasn’t for me and left it, and since then I’ve focused on my driving theory/practice. 

Unfortunately I don’t talk to them in that way so I cannot ask them for advice on it, but if you all could give me some notes on how to present myself, how to dress (specially this because my wardrobe is a mess), what to ask, what will I be asked, etc…

I’m not sure how to portray this in the professional way, and obviously without explaining details that are seen as ‘bad’, but I’ll literally take a job in anything but I, realistically, cannot start until mid june, unless it is an afternoon job, because I have got  several driving lessons inbetween and if I change them they might put them in 3 months time (waiting list at my driving school is crazy). After that, I can do any schedule meanwhile the company is near me (I might not pass my driver’s license test, so I cannot go further than my town and another one I can walk to - but there are companies from both of these two towns at the fair).

I’m 20M and in Europe (Spain) if that helps anything. ",Puzzleheaded-Till690,3,1.0,1,1746472825,2025-05-05 19:20:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kfkbm5/advice_for_a_job_fair_for_an_entrylevel_position/,5,2025

1kfjadf,Should I continue getting an MBA?,"I am currently halfway through an online MBA program. I honestly had no clear path on what I wanted to do with the degree, but knew it could potentially land me a job making more money. 

I think I really want to eventually go to Law School but thought about getting my feet wet going the paralegal route. I am also the primary earner in my household and can’t go to school full time right now, especially with 3 children under 10. I know the more niche areas are higher paid but honestly I’m not hard pressed on that yet. 

So, my question is: should I continue to purse the MBA and start the paralegal program after? Should I just axe the MBA all together and focus on the paralegal program? I have 7 classes left for the MBA and the paralegal program is 9 courses. 

I’ve read that an MBA doesn’t really help in the paralegal field so I just don’t want to waste any money or time doing something I don’t really care about. Those loans add up.

1kfj4f8,Late to the game SQL dev looking for direction,"Hello folks! So, in my late 20's I decided to go back to school and got an associates in computer science through a software development program at my tech college back home. It's worked fine enough, I got in with a job not long after taking over the tech side of a SQL query heavy department for a decently sized company, they needed someone to bug fix a bunch of queries which led into things like writing for their new modules etc. but mainly is just query related. I'm great with SQL itself at this point, but I haven't done much more, we got bought out by another company, and for the last while I've done quite literally nothing. There's just no real work for me to do. I'll be shortly transferring into a department handling a lot of ETL requests, but I've been feeling stagnant in my role/career and would like to move into something like business intelligence potentially.

1kfj0w7,"How to win as a freelancer. I started my freelancing journey in 2021, and by the end of 2023, I was among the top 1% of freelancers in India.","Freelancing has given me the freedom to experiment.  
  
I started my freelancing journey in 2021, and by the end of 2023, I was among the top 1% of freelancers in India.  
  
Let me break down how you can start your freelancing journey, step by step.

1. Create your portfolio.   
  
If you’re a web developer, your first priority should be creating your portfolio. It’s much easier to find your first clients through your own contacts than online.  
  
Reach out to everyone you know and build websites for them accept whatever budget they have. People don’t trust subdomain websites; you’ll need 2–3 real projects under your belt before you can land bigger ones.

2. Now you need customers.   
  
Register yourself on 2–3 major freelancing platforms.  
Yes, there’s a lot of competition but who cares? Your goal is simply to increase your surface area of luck and land those first few clients.

3. Take care of these things.   
  
\- Get a decent head cut profile picture.   
\- Check top 10 profiles in your domain and write title and description accordingly.   
\- Initially try to target keywords with low competition and low to medium traffic.

**Why target low to medium traffic and not high traffic?**  
  
Because there’s no such thing as high traffic with low competition. In the beginning, you need to become a big fish in a small pond, not a small fish in a big one. You have to position yourself as the most professional freelancer among just 10 profiles, not thousands.

4. Keyword research on these platforms isn’t that hard.  
  
Just type a keyword and see how many profiles show up. Search at least 10–15 keywords and build your profile around the ones with the least competition and low traffic. Don’t get greedy in the beginning.

5. Now for description and title.   
  
Filter out 10 mid-level profiles and study their titles and descriptions. Don’t just copy/paste stealing the right way is a skill.  
Take the best parts from each, but make sure your profile stays focused. Your main pitch should stick to just 1–2 services, not everything.

6. Now for other channels.   
  
\-Stay active on Twitter.  
\-Discord is also one of the best place to find potential clients.   
\-You can reach out to people on Instagram too. For example, if someone is posting reels and photos about cakes but doesn’t have a website yet, just send them a message.

\--------

My story!! 

Honestly finding first customer is not that hard. If you will follow all the above points and ask for humble $$ initially. You will definitely get client in first 20-30 days.   
  
**Many people think there is so much competition in freelancing but that's not true from one POV.**

I realized this when I started hiring freelancers to delegate projects.  
  
Most people really don’t care you’ll have to chase them with dozens of messages for updates, and they’ll rarely meet deadlines.

Under-promise and over-deliver that’s the essence of retaining customers.  
  
\- Deliver before time.   
\- Reply on time (I must have replied to more than 90% of the queries within an hour through out my freelancing journey)  
\- Do some extra work. Don't just add hourly rate for 1-2 hour work.

If you really want to make good money through freelancing you have to make good relationship with your customers. You have to retain them.   
  
In 2024 50% of my revenue was from old clients.

If you can consistently deliver good work and build strong relationships, people won't hesitate to pay you. You can increase your rates for existing clients every 5–6 months.  
  
For new clients, once you have 10–15 projects in your portfolio, you can literally raise your prices with every new project. It's just simple demand and supply.

Transparency is the key to maintaining good relationships. You don’t get frustrated with an Amazon order because it's late you get frustrated because you were expecting it early.  
  
If you're facing delays for any reason, be transparent. Keep people updated about everything.

Last but not least, you need patience. You won’t start making money from day one. It usually takes at least 8–9 months to reach a decent level but you will start making some money from 1st month if you will follow above mentioned things.   
  
Don’t waste your money on courses by every random Didi (Madam) or Bhaiya (Sir). They’ll teach you the same stuff there’s no secret sauce.

1kfj0o1,I got a dry promotion and I’m not taking it well.,"I was given a quiet, dry “promotion” and received the title for the job I have been doing for 2 years (2 years to prove myself I guess, got the title 2 months ago). I expected a raise, especially since I am constantly complimented on my work, and this was a big promotion. My gift was a lunch. They took me to lunch to patronize me and tell me how beneficial I am to the team and that was it.

I’ve been growing incredibly resentful, especially as I was underpaid to start and it has only continued to get worse. I have mentally checked out and am applying for jobs while at work. I have stopped working hard, and only do what I am asked. Today in a meeting, they asked me for an update on my department and I said I had none. They seemed a bit shocked, but I will not be doing anything extra and only what I am asked. Unless they ask me to do something, I will not be doing it. This was after my boss mansplained part of my job to me although it was his fuck up, not mine. They could tell I was pissed, but I’m close to not really caring. 

I am a hard worker and enjoy challenging work. My work ethic is one of the only things I am proud of when it comes to myself, and this job is killing me. I relapsed in January and drink every night when I come home. The kicker? *My bosses skipped over raises, took their entire family out of the country, and then brought me home alcohol as a gift*. They knew I was sober for 2 years and I relapsed shortly after (not on the cheap shit they bought me). 

I feel guilty, I feel angry, I feel like a low life. I’m young and trying. I can’t cover my bills. I work full time, I can’t afford to go to the dentist. I leave here seething. I just needed to rant and also some feedback if maybe I just need to suck it up.

I am also older, hitting 60 although I am told I look and act young for my age (although I am sure my resume tells my age) I am also current with the latest technologies. But its been a year now and I have not been able to land any work in my field and I am desperate, close to being evicted. I am not sure what is going on but I feel blacklisted, could be my age, I had some medical issues during my last contract so my performance was sub-par, its possible I could be blacklisted for that reason. The market is also horrible right now in the Toronto area. 

So I am looking for any job just to be bring in some cash to eat and pay rent.

The problem is my resume is 10 pages long and highly technical, its not too long for my industry and i have been told that by many headhunters.

How do I change my resume to be more palatable to the general job market and how should I explain myself in a cover letter ? Changing careers ? Im just looking for any old job and yours will do ?

I'm currently exploring a potential opportunity as a **GenAI Engineer at Capgemini Invent** and would love to hear from anyone who has direct experience with their Generative AI projects.

I'm currently working at **Cognizant**, but I’ve been struggling to find roles where the GenAI work is actually meaningful. In several places, despite big promises during the hiring process, I’ve ended up on repetitive POCs or demo projects with limited technical challenge or learning scope. It often feels like the focus is more on buzzwords than actual innovation or implementation.

If you're currently at Capgemini Invent or have been part of their GenAI team, could you share some insights?

* Are there real client-facing GenAI projects being executed, or is it mostly internal/dummy work?
* What kind of tech stacks or platforms do they typically work with (e.g., OpenAI, Azure AI, LangChain, etc.)?
* Is the team dynamic more innovative or bureaucratic?
* How steep is the learning curve, and is there room for growth?

I’m especially looking for **challenging and impactful work**—not just another AI role with flashy slide decks and no substance.

1kfhxs8,Boss asking me to provide a list of my responsibilities to justify a raise,"Context : I've been working full-time at my current job for 7 years, right out of university. I was underpaid for most of it and didn't realize it because I trusted my boss, until I finally saw some data that made me see how I was being underpaid and managed to ask for a raise in March. For reference, the average salary for my position is 35$ an hour in my country, and I was paid 25$ until last February. After some back and forth, they graciously offered me a raise to 29$ and I was anxious (damn imposter syndrome) and settled, with a verbal agreement that we could revisit it in May to see if it still made me happy. 

I took on significantly more responsibilities over the last year, especially management wise, which wasn't part of my job description, that's also why I asked for a raise. I also got a new job title prior to my raise request, that I didn't ask for, but I figured, hey why not? It was probably naive of me, but since I was already doing the work, I didn't see a problem with having a new fancy title.

After about 3 weeks, I realized I might get some hours cut during the summer if the volume of work goes down, which would bring me back to the equivalent of my initial salary. 

I took the time to write a new message to my boss, since we had already agreed to go over it again in May, and he did not react in an open way. He took about two weeks to think and then tried to offer me another benefit instead of raising my salary. I refused (it was not equivalent to the raise I want).

Then, I thought I could get my desired salary if I got another job (or even use another job offer to negotiate with my boss), and started looking, I got 2 interviews, and they were offering from 35 to 45$ an hour, so it seems 35$ is a typical salary, I haven't heard back from one of them yet, and I declined the other because the schedule was not suited to my needs.

Today, he said he's ready to talk about my offer but he's asking me to provide a job description of what I do to ''justify'' the raise to average salary for my position and to ''justify'' my new title, which they themselves gave me, without me asking.

We are a very small company, but they've been in business for over a decade and doing well, but I can say they're pretty disorganized and getting closer to retirement.



I'm not sure what my next move should be here, even if I do get another job offer somewhere else, I like my current job a lot, but I feel disrespected and frustrated. I do feel guilty about thinking of leaving them, I know they would struggle if I did, because I'm the only employee and I've been basically ''trained'' to do exactly what they need for 7 years, but I have to think of my future too.",Weary-Pop3524,13,0.8799999952316284,29,1746467182,2025-05-05 17:46:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kfhxs8/boss_asking_me_to_provide_a_list_of_my/,5,2025

1kfgl3w,Social anxiety and low confidence at work as a new grad,"I'm 6 months into my first real post grad job. I started out as an intern, which has been a great experience and I feel like I was thriving. I was able to secure a permanent role after my internship and my social anxiety has been the worst its ever been these past few months.

  
The thing I've been struggling with the most is meetings. I feel like I can't find the right timing to contribute and when I get the chance to do so, my mind goes blank, I go silent or stutter and I feel like my input just ends up being useless. One on one meetings and meetings with smaller groups I am normally ok. But anything that involves a larger group has been difficult for me. I feel so awkward and finding it hard to be visible. The only time I end up talking is when someone asks me a question, and even then, my response ends up being a few sentences/words. My lack of experience also has also been making me feel bad in general, as I feel like everyone else ends up picking up my ""slack."" I know I am still learning, but it feels like the team just finds me a burden and unreliable. 

I'm an introvert and have struggled with social anxiety most of my life, but after starting this corporate job, I feel that this has been the worst it's ever been. I am not sure if this is the new grad imposter syndrome or social anxiety, but it just hurts me to see my confidence dropping and potentially lose such a great job. I've been lucky to be working in a supportive environment but I can't help but still feel this way. I just feel like I'm setting myself back in my career development...

  
Has anyone else struggled with this as a new grad? Any advice on how to overcome this?

1kfgkn1,I don't know whether to finish my degree and find a job or do a private master's degree?,"I'm about to finish my degree in Tourism at the university. I should have finished it by now, but there's a professor who's very strict with his grading and has no vocation as a teacher. I'm going to do my best to finish this year.

The thing is, there's a private university offering me a master's degree at two different universities in Europe, and if I don't pass the subjects at the university I'm currently attending, I can finish everything with them. They convinced me from the start, and I gave initially 600 euros to sign up, but then I started questioning whether it was a good idea or not. The master's degree is supposed to allow me to get a very good job, but it's very expensive, it doesn't include residency, and if I don't pass a certain number of subjects, I have to return the scholarship they gave me.

Honestly, I don't know if I'm capable of giving my all in this master's program because I'm in a state of burnout due to various life situations, and I just don't feel like studying anymore. At the university I'm now, I've taken memorizing, writing, and forgetting exams, and class projects that I've done alone or with very few people because I've been assigned to terrible teams.

1kfg295,Take a safe job or the one that aligns with my future?,"Hey everyone, I’m feeling pretty torn and could use some advice.

Before starting university, I worked at a thrift store for two years. I trained a bunch of new employees, the manager seemed to like me, and for a while, I really loved it. But things have changed. After moving away for school, I had to leave the job, and now that I’m back home for the summer, I don’t feel the same way about it. The environment’s different, the energy’s not what it used to be, and honestly, I’ve outgrown it. What used to excite me now feels draining.

Since I need a job to help pay for school, I figured I’d try going back to the thrift store. I stopped by and asked the manager if they were hiring again, but she told me business was slow, and they weren’t bringing anyone new on — in fact, they’d been laying people off. So I moved on and decided to focus on something that actually aligns with my long-term goals.

I’m majoring in Human Kinetics, and I’ve become really passionate about health and fitness. So I started applying to gyms, wellness centers, and personal training jobs — through LinkedIn, Indeed, and in person. I wasn’t getting many responses at first, probably because I didn’t have my certifications yet, but now I’m actively working on them through online courses. I’m also doing summer school online, so my schedule’s already packed — but I’m committed.

On top of that, I’ve been planning out a few small side gigs of my own that I want to start this summer. Ideally, I’d like a job that still gives me a bit of flexibility to work on those projects too.

One gym manager I emailed got back to me, said she liked my story, and asked me to send over my resume. I did that about four days ago, and she said she’d get in touch to set up an interview — but I haven’t heard anything back since then, so I’m kind of in limbo right now.

Then just this morning, I got a message from the thrift store manager again. She said she spoke with HR and they’d actually be happy to have me back.

So now I’m stuck. I’ve got a guaranteed job offer from the thrift store — but it’s not something I’m passionate about anymore. On the other hand, I have this potential fitness job that’s more in line with my career, but it’s not guaranteed, and I haven’t heard back yet.

What would you do in my shoes? Take the safer job, or keep holding out for something that aligns with my passion and long-term goals (while also leaving time for my own side projects)?

Should I go back to my old, mentally draining, part time job or should I hold off and wait for a response back from a manager at a workplace that aligns with my career path?",zandax_art,1,1.0,0,1746462747,2025-05-05 16:32:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kfg295/take_a_safe_job_or_the_one_that_aligns_with_my/,5,2025

I got roped into this because I was initially a Chem major, immediately switched to Biological premed major because students in the grades above me told me to. After a year, I switched to Health Humanities, not premed due to mental health, and very unsupportive, unhelpful professions who told me to drop out of a class instead of helping me (You know, the whole purpose of office hours?) So now that I'm about to graduate, and realize if I even want a slight chance in medicine, I'd have to spend even more money but at a community college and take physics, bio, and chem classes I need. I'm already 115k in the toilet. I desperately need a job with the degree I have now that I could possibly get into. Even if I have to shadow, or do Internet work then start working, I really need a job that would accept me with this degree.
If there is no jobs out there that work for a Health Humanities BS.. I don't know what I'm going to do. I'd love to be a social worker, which requires a masters in social work since I already have a bachelor's, I cannot afford to get another one, and some colleges/Universities allow other bachelor's to get into social work masters (SWM). I have no idea how to get there, and would love anything that could help.

1.) What jobs can I get with my degree now?
2.) If NOTHING is possible with just my degree, how can I get a SWM with such a low GPA?

I have a Bachelor’s in Math with a minor in Finance. I was recently laid off and am currently pursuing a teaching certification—mainly because I felt out of options.

I’ve had this job for eight months. Just finally getting into the swing of things, lots of little nuances that took a while to learn but finally settling in. I love my supervisor, he recognizes my talents and is very flexible and gentle with his employees. 

Last Friday my supervisors boss has a department-wide meeting indicating structural changes. My supervisor and this boss have always butted heads, and during this meeting the big boss didn’t want to field questions regarding these changes. 

In a nutshell, a few employees are moving departments, and myself specifically is moving to a different part of the department, changing job duties from accounting to basically an assistant to a different supervisor, no longer gaining job experience in accounting (which is my field of study and what I applied for) but keeping the accountant title. I asked HR if this was something the big boss could even do and they said that as long as it is within the same department and job title stays the same, they are able to move me and switch my supervisor. 

I would just find a new job but they’re paying for my school 100% and I have to stay for a year after their final school payment so I’m locked in another year and a half or else I have to pay it all back.

1kfdv7d,How can I secure a promotion?,"Recently the director who is myboss’s boss let me know she needs help in her area and has been talking to my boss about freeing up more of my time so I can help her. She said nothing is official yet, so like she doesn’t know how much of my time I need yet. 


Im looking forward to helping her because it’s the type of work I like. I’ve told my manager many times that I’ve grown out of the current work I’m doing. I don’t enjoy it anymore and am not challenged at all. I’ve expressed my interest in doing the type of work my director does but my boss said that the opportunity would come only if business calls for it, which I understand. She personally didn’t think she’d see a need until maybe next year or later but she said she also doesn’t know how fast things will change. I also don’t think she knows everything about the subset dept of the director(which is just her). Side note, I’ve already been steeping out side my normal job duties, trying to do more, to show them I’m capable of  more opportunity.


Fast forward a few months later, things did pick up more. We have more work to do, we’re hiring more ppl in our dept. that’s why I’m guessing the Director asked for my help because she can’t do it all. I think she has been scoping out my knowledge in this area and is learning that I do have some experience. 


Our promotion cycles are coming up and I’m hoping to get one… I know from our convo it maybe doesn’t seem like it since she specifically stated she wants to free up only part of my time, which implies I’m still going to be doing my current work but at a smaller scale. 



How do I ensure or at least try to get a promotion? Im going to have a convo with her soon and will bring this up but I want to bring it up the right way.

I’d love your thoughts on a big career/life decision I’m trying to make. I’m a woman in my early 30s, just got out of a long-term relationship, and I’m trying to decide what next chapter makes the most sense—both professionally and personally.

I have two job offers on the table:

1. Walmart Global Tech – Sunnyvale, CA
	•	$185K base, 15% annual bonus
	•	$50K in RSUs vesting over 4 years (starts vesting after 1 year)
	•	Unlimited PTO
	•	Work involves machine learning and would probably be stronger on a resume
	•	Would require moving to the Bay Area at the end of May

2. Capital One – McLean, VA (Greater DC Area)
	•	$180K base, $14–24K target bonus
	•	No equity, but might be able to negotiate a sign-on
	•	Standard PTO
	•	Culture seems strong, and internal mobility could give me options
	•	Could potentially start later (July/Aug), which gives me time to travel this summer

Comp aside, I’m also thinking about quality of life, dating, and long-term roots.
Would love to hear from people who know:
	•	What’s life like in Sunnyvale or DC for a single woman in her 30s hoping to meet someone emotionally mature and build a healthy life?
	•	Is one city noticeably better for dating, making friends, or settling down?
	•	Is the Walmart ML opportunity worth the earlier start and higher pay vs. taking time off to rest + start slower with Capital One?

Lastly, I was recently put on a PIP at Amazon, so I’m wrapping up my time there and have the option to stay on paid leave through July. That means I could:
	•	Take a break, travel, then start Capital One in August
	•	Jump straight into Walmart at the end of May for a fresh start

Would love thoughts, especially from anyone who’s been in similar shoes. Thanks in advance!

1kfafhz,Medical or trade? Starting over in 30s,"Hello, I'm looking for some real, raw, and honest advice on starting a career/school in my early 30s. I had a rough upbringing and didn't have many options. I had children young, one of whom has had health issues, and I wasn't able to go back to school or take time to focus on building a stable career for myself until now. My children are all in school all day, and I'm finally in a more stable place to return to school and pursue a career. I'm thinking about the future, retirement, job demand, and financial stability. I'm considering trade school (welding, plumbing, electrician, etc.) or the medical field. I know both have pros and cons. I want to know from personal experience what was more worthwhile, especially at my age (early 30s). I don't want to spend a lot of time in school—four years maximum—so, in the medical field, I'd lean toward nursing, RT etc. I have a great work ethic, I'm naturally handy, but I'm not strong in math. I don't have any college experience but am motivated to learn! Honest opinions are welcome. Is it worth it to enter these fields in my 30s?",Ancient-Way4667,2,1.0,2,1746448258,2025-05-05 12:30:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kfafhz/medical_or_trade_starting_over_in_30s/,5,2025
1kfabeq,"Your work experience, passion projects and fancy CV don't matter to a German (or most other national) company","\[Do you like Memes? Here is the original post with meme - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Germany\_Jobs/comments/1kf8wm6/comment/mqoysli/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Germany_Jobs/comments/1kf8wm6/comment/mqoysli/) \]

I know this is intuitive to many, but I see the opposite happening way too often so here I go (again):

**You. Need. To. Take. Care. Of. The Basics. First!**

That means if you want to find work in a country, you need to be able to speak the local language (this might not be true for some \[Scandinavian?\] countries but it certainly is for Germany). Communication is the very basis of all interaction. So no matter what other skills you have, if you don't speak the local/regional/national language, you are significantly less valuable to a company. Let me repeat that:

**Your work experience, passion projects and fancy CV don't matter to a German company, if you don't speak German.**

Yes, theoretically it makes sense that people get by with English in the modern world. IT is one of those industries where that should be especially true. And yes, migration is a two-way street. I don't wan't to argue those points. I can relate.

I'm just here to tell you that the companies I talk to repeat one thing again and again:

1kf826j,I know I get paid nothing compared to my coworkers,"I've been working at this e-commerce company for 2.5 years now. When I was hired I negotiated my salary to the top of the range, which was 65k. I also earn commissions. My OTE is quite good and the job is very comfortable. 

A year after I started, another person was hired. They make 10k more than I do. Then, recently, 4 more people were hired. I don't know how much they make but I remember the job being posted and the minimum salary range was higher than my salary. I trained all of these people, I do well at my job, but there is 0 room for upward mobility and leadership does not care. My manager knows this all and is on my side, but doesn't know how to get me more money. Last time he put me up for a promotion, he was told ""we don't do promotions"". I am the only non white person on my team of 12 people. 

Is there any way at all that I can approach HR for a higher salary, for fairness? I blew it out of the park the first year but since then I'm doing well, just not anything extraordinary. Any advice is appreciated, I'm relatively young in my career, very new to this sort of conversation.

1kf821g,Should a person suffering from severe MDD QUITTTT being a Developer????????,"I sincerely apologize for the huge text but this needed context.. i didnt want superficial advise because of my lack of alertness in giving you the whole story..  I hope you bear with me!!

I'm a 26 year old with a MDD diagnosis surviving on regular medications. Due to monetary issues I stopped taking therapy but that's still in the picture. My MDD brought forth a lot of things which I struggle with daily. Here's a list: 
Onset of hypothyroidism 
Panic attacks
Anxious episodes regular
Severe Haemorrhoids 
Severe migraines (lasts for atleast 3 days)
Severe vitamin deficiency for which i take meds
Onset of fatty liver
Extreme sinusitis 
PCOD
(And yes I've had all the physical tests done before I got this mental diagnosis)
I'm overweight ever since I was a kid but have been exercising and fit as long as I can remember. But after 11th couldn't continue and stressful eating habits led to me being obese. Anywho I'm controlling my eating and calories intake and I've always been a good eater so it isn't a problem. 

My issues :
I've been working since my third year of college, interning and then FTE for 2.5 years post 2021, worked till 2023 oct. 
While staying outside, had a toxic manager and acute micromanagement leading to regular suicidal episodes with me tying myself up and you know the drill. Still have the marks on my body from the attempts. 

My manager didn't even approve wfh even for a single day of dysmenhorrea even though we had no bounds related to that. 
Basically worked for 14+ hours a day. 
(I'm a child of bully so I suffer from severe anxiety leading to nausea and freeze mode when I was going to school and post that as well)

Which lead to : 
Sunken eyes and my parents worrying. 
Had social paralysis leading to me staying at home till December last year since oct 2023 and taking regular therapy with meds leading to getting better.
 In December, got diagnosed with the above physical problems which led to a two months of doctor's visits and getting myself back on track.
 
Now, since Feb im interviewing, but with no luck as I had a break. The interviews that I had were horrendous, basically managers were tatti.. got questions like ""how many times have you interviewed"" asked to me with his hands behind his head and smiling and smirking whenever I said "" I'm not sure but looking at the question this is what I deduced and this is how I did it"" then another one asking "" max of an array"" in the name of coding questions and then rejecting me because I couldn't build her a Spring MVC app with jsp to say "" hello"" when my expertise was frontend... And when I protested that this was a coding and problem solving round and she didn't even ask me DSA.. she said that she did when she asked me that max problem and then second max.

Anywho.. I didn't falter and have been applying but can't shake that fear off my chest. My father keeps telling me to give GATE and secure a govt job but it's not who I am. I would want to do a job where I'm valued because ik I'm excellent. 

I'm such a hardworker and intelligent but often think what if I chose Maths over this because I was in love with that subject.. I mean I slept with the book in my hand but often overthink that what if it was just me as a child in 12th and just did it because it was easy and now I don't have the brains for it. But still I want to see if I can actually do it or it was pure luck, by solving some problems and reading about it. 

But I've already had a gap year. Not sure what to do. The gap continues and I feel worry. I want a job first so that I can support my family is what I'm thinking. Can I be helped? Ofc I can be.. but what should I do??

1kf8077,Resume advice - Applying for a completely different role within same organization,"I'm currently in customer service as a customer coordinator, and I want to apply for a position in marketing as a marketing coordinator. Of course, the resume that I used when I applied was tailored to customer service and honestly, I did not do a lot of marketing in that role. My past experience as a small business owner gave me the skills and qualifications in the role that I'm wanting to apply for but almost none of those are showcased on the resume. It is the same recruiter that will read the resume and who I initially interviewed with and who will likely interview again as part of the preselection process. 

The new role requires strong PowerPoint skills, so I was thinking I could take the resume I used to apply and make a PowerPoint of it OR make a cover letter with PowerPoint and highlight specific skills I obtained as a business owner with marketing our own products. 

Lastly, should I share ideas that I have for the business in the cover letter or save it for the interview if I get one? I've never applied for an internal position before, and I'm clueless.

1kf7pvo,Is it unethical to update my LinkedIn and CV with my new job after telling my old boss I was just “taking a break”?,"I recently resigned from my job to take a position at another company. When I left, I told my boss I just wanted to “take a break” instead of mentioning the new job. I did this because I didn’t want to deal with unnecessary questions or drama — they were sometimes being kind of nosy, and I preferred to keep things low-key.

Now that I’ve started the new job, I want to update my LinkedIn and CV. The thing is, I’m still friends with my old boss on LinkedIn. I'm wondering: would it be unethical for me to update my profile now, even though I didn’t mention the new job when I left?

For context, I didn’t breach any contract, non-compete, or NDA — I was well within my rights to resign and move on. I just chose not to disclose everything at the time to avoid awkwardness.

Is this a problem, or just normal career discretion?

1kf5pta,Should I take a higher paying job or go for my master’s in AI management,"
I'm torn between accepting a new job offer with a significant salary increase or pursuing a 1-year Master's in AI Management in the US. 

The issue is:

1. I’d need to take a $25k loan to attend.
I have a 75% tuition scholarship, but the university doesn’t allow deferrals.
2. If I take the job, I could save and apply again next year—but there’s no guarantee I’ll get the same scholarship.
3. I'm also worried it may be harder to find a job after graduation without strong work experience. I currently have 2 years of work experience.

What would you do in my position? Any advice would help!

Please note that the university is one of the top universities in Tech.

1kf5i6d,Need education/career advice,"So I am currently in the undergrad to get my BA in Human Services. Bit of background, I am 25 years old so I am technically a non traditional student. I am also a nanny and have worked with small children for years. I felt pretty confident that I wanted to go on to get my masters in counseling for small children and adolescents because I have a passion to work with them and help them. But now, I am weighting it all out. First, it’s 40,000+ to get the degree and then I have to have additional supervision hours to finally be able to practice. I would have high monthly payments paying off the debt. BUT it would be a secure solid degree and job that I have. On the other hand, I could work with my bachelors and get experience and not go right into grad, open my own in home daycare and make decent income from that and have the option to stay at home with my children at the same time. My partner and I plan to get married and have children by 30. 
Should I go onto get my masters now before having kids just to have it in my back pocket in case I want to get licensed once my kids get older? Or just do the in home daycare and go back and get my masters later? I feel pressured to get my masters “just in case” or when my kids get older I could do therapy. Idk what do you think my 5 year plan should be?

1kf51ch,Career Crisis,"I have been in school for a bit and graduated with a BA in history with plans to be a history teacher. I am currently attending National University working on my credentials but I feel like I can’t see myself being a teacher anymore. Not just because of all the teachers quitting recently because of the educational system, but I don’t know if I’m burnt out but I can barely get myself to turn in assignments or even care, even with no distractions. Of course I feel stressed and disappointed but at the end of the day I really just want to have a job that I can make decent money and not be miserable. I know I’m not the only person who has ever gone through this, I am 27 and thought I’d be in a different place in my life right now. I’m by no means just trying to complain but for those of you who have been at a similar point in life is there any careers that aren’t horrible that you can make a decent living on?

1kf4m0b,"I’m 20, Feeling Lost, and Running Out of Time — Need Real Guidance","

Hi. I’m 20 years old and have spent the last three years preparing for NEET (a very competitive medical entrance exam in India). This was my third attempt, and I scored 177—not enough to qualify.

Before COVID, I was one of the top students in school. Everyone had big expectations from me—teachers, relatives, and especially my parents. But after the pandemic, I lost direction. I started struggling emotionally and academically, and now I feel like I’ve let everyone down.

My parents are now pushing me toward private medical college or other options like dentistry or Ayurveda, but deep down, I know I don’t want this. I’ve realized I was just chasing what society expected from me, not what truly fits who I am.

The truth is, I’ve never really been exposed to other possibilities in life. I feel like my mindset has been very limited because I never had the chance to explore different careers, skills, or lifestyles. I want to understand what *living* really means—not just studying to survive.

The problem is, most college application deadlines are closing soon (this month), and I’m stuck. I want to choose a path that feels right for me—but I’m scared of disappointing my strict, traditional family. I’m stuck between choosing what makes them happy and what could give me a future I won’t regret.

If you’ve ever been in a similar situation, changed your path, or found your way after failure—I’d love to hear your story or advice. I just need a starting point, and a little courage.

Thanks for reading. I still believe I have potential—I just need help finding the right direction.",Life_Blueberry2344,0,0.5,0,1746425284,2025-05-05 06:08:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kf4m0b/im_20_feeling_lost_and_running_out_of_time_need/,5,2025
1kf4lz6,"Career Stalled, what to do next?","Hi, I am here for advice since I feel like I have f-up my career and I now feel fully trapped. 
I started my education from Bachelor's in Hotel Management, did internships in brands like JW Marriott (6 months) and Le Meridien (1 month). I also did an international internship of 1.5 months in Nimes, France. But I graduated in 2020 when the whole hotel industry was in shutdown. Hence I decided to pursue my MBA in HR & Marketing. I did multiple internships and freelance content writing along with MBA. I passed out with 4 job offers in hand and had my picture put up all across the college and its website for getting highest package. I joined the highest package which was from a bank. I became a Probationary Officer (equivalent to Assistant Manager). I was told it will be a marketing job but it was an operations role and I became the head of CASA section of my branch. During that time I realised how risky the profession was (legal and financial) so after giving my 1.8 years I resigned and decided to switch my career to second specialization i.e. HR. My monthly salary was 1,00,000 in bank. But when I started looking for jobs in HR no one even offered me half of that citing zero experience in the department. I joined HCl as HR Executive at 22000 monthly. I was at my lowest, my financials were a mess thankfully my husband took on more responsibilities. When I joined the company I realised my responsibilities were a little too easy. My daily work used to get done in 1 hour and I was free whole day. While I know it's some people's dream job, it was a nightmare for me. I knew in my gut I was made for something better. I was used to multitasking due to my experience in the bank. I used to work 11-12 hours there and now I was barely working at all and earning quarter of what I used to earn. While I didn't regret my decision to resign, I knew I had to keep looking for something better. That's when I reached out to my professor who had moved onto work as a Director HR in a hospitality chain. He offered me Senior HR Executive and paid me 50k per month. Now here I am. The company is mid level and while I had many expectations from this job, it failed miserably. I switched cities for it. My work is nowhere related to HR functions, I create newsletters, daily content for TVs shown across units and sometimes I am asked to do recruitment. I am stuck and when I try to switch I am again being told that due to no actual experience in HR I need to go back to earning 20k. Please advice.

I thought about dropping the data scientist for a while and trying to just practice for a data analyst role. Now I'm worried that because of AI and a rough job market, that even this will be too hard to get a job for. 

I also looked into jobs like data engineer and machine learning engineer, but it seems like they are requiring a lot of experience, and is more comp sci based. This sucks, because I did a lot of machine learning in college and still practice it. 

So, what's the moves? Do you guys suggest that I focus on something lower like a data analyst, or do I try something different?

1kf1ina,Do i leave my first job after three months?,"I graduated film school this January, and started my first job as a ‘video editor’ for a small-mid sized digital media agency. I signed a 3 month probation contract.

At first, i joined without thinking twice about it because it was a remote position, okay pay(to increase by a little after probation), and because i just wanted to learn and earn. I was told a lot of things, that i would be started off slow, that they wanted me for my animation work ( i am an animator/motion graphics artist primarily ) and that it was okay that it was my first job as an ‘editor’.

Pretty quickly it has become apparent that is not the case.

The work is overwhelming and has stressful deadlines, especially because a lot of the work that is assigned to me always has some ‘new’ element to it, which is not always properly explained. The guy who is supposed to be mentoring me, has over thrice now called me slow and told me I have 0 output and that i am too slow for the 2 months i have been here. PS. Every other editor on the team has at least a year of experience there. He keeps comparing me to them, saying that they do way more work than me, and assign me more work saying i need to manage. It is pretty demotivating because i have been glued to my desk 10am-7pm pretty much Mon-Sat trying my best to be creative and maintain deadlines. And i have put out good work as well. But no praise, words of affirmation. He keeps telling me that other people who i co ordinate with keep complaining about me to him, but are only ever sweet to me. I dont understand. Also, they expect me to perform like every other editor who has atleast a year of experience there, and also atleast 20% more pay? I also live alone, and i have chores to do, food to make and eat, but it’s like i barely have time to do any of that during the workday.

Also, because it is remote, it is so isolating. I have not made a single friend, only contacts who pop in my messages to give me work. The work i have been putting out has been fulfilling to a certain extent, but also not. I do not see a future in video editing, especially with work culture like this. I do not know who to speak about this to at work. I do not like this that i feel stressed out before work now, always thinking i need to be faster, or anxious about not understanding things, not being able to be creative enough.

Part of me wants to quit after probation, and take some time between my next job to upskill my motion design skills, and exclusively seek positions in that space. This current job profile demands everything, not just editing, and it is not something i see myself doing for a long time anyway. Every editor there is currently overworked, but they expect me to be as well as underpaid. And because it’s remote, it’s isolating and i am not learning much at all, just figuring things out on my own.

Sorry for ranting so much, what should i do? Is it fine to leave? Thats what a probation period is for right? I don’t know what to do, am i being a wuss? Better things are out there surely no? I want to grind at a place that creatively fulfils me and where i can learn, feel important and does not fill me with dread every morning, i am hard working i know it, maybe this isn’t the best fit for me but i don’t know since it is my first job.

1kf177b,Should I negotiate my wage?,"I have been working at this company for a little over six months now. I absolutely love it, but I have heard multiple times from my coworkers that the pay at this company is lower than what they would make at another place. A lot of people stay because they love the culture so much, and I do too. 

But my friend referred me to a company that’s hiring for a position very similar to mine. The starting pay range is $4-7 more than what I make now hourly. The benefits are the same as the company I currently work for and both jobs allow remote work. My dilemma here is that the company I currently work for really stuck out their neck for me. I had zero experience in the field, and they took a chance on me and hired me on anyways. I feel like leaving would be a big slap in their face. I understand that I should put myself first, but I would really hate to burn bridges with people that I really like working with. 

I was considering approaching my boss to see if I could negotiate a better wage, informing them that I was presented this other job opportunity with a similar role and responsibilities, but I’m worried that I might step on some toes given that I’ve only been working here for 6 months.

The weirdest thing happened. My boss called me in yesterday and gave me a 15% raise ""for showing such impressive growth in prioritization and efficiency."" He actually said I'm ""more focused and delivering higher quality work"" than ever before.

I'm completely baffled. Everything I thought would get me ahead (overworking, being available 24/7) actually worked against me, and now that I've stopped trying so hard, suddenly I'm promotion material? Corporate logic makes zero sense.

1keyljm,Accounting Major Who Doesn't Want Big4 Stress,"Hello everyone! I am a current junior majoring in accounting. I have a Big4 internship next summer which I am excited about, but I am unsure of if I want to continue on that track postgrad. I am a huge equestrian, and a lot of my motivation in life comes from the love for the horse and the goals that surround the sport. However, it is the unfortunate combination of being somewhat time consuming and extremely expensive. 

When talking to accountants, they all say that the workload is large, unexpected projects come up often, hours are long, and it's not a straightforward 40 hour, clock out at 5 job. I don't know if that life is for me! I also struggle with mental health and the idea of having my job control my entire life like how Big4 accounting will is making me fall into a pit of doom and despair.

So, what other careers can I pursue with an accounting degree (and possible CPA license) that won't take up my entire life but still be successful enough that I can continue riding? If we want to go really rogue, I also enjoy nature and wildlife, and I don't mind tasks that are a bit mindless.",OilWorried41,1,1.0,1,1746404492,2025-05-05 00:21:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1keyljm/accounting_major_who_doesnt_want_big4_stress/,5,2025
1keyhz0,What to do when HR is blocking a promotion,"I have worked for my company for over 10 years. I have 8 years of management experience, and I have had 2 management promotions, then a lateral transfer into the department where I currently work. I have worked in my current department for 5 years now. There have been several vacancies for some time putting a lot of pressure on my team. I have stepped up and filled the gap on multiple occasions and have been doing my normal job in addition to the work that belongs to a vacant position higher than mine.

That position is now being filled and the hiring manager wants me to take the position as I have been essentially doing the work for the past year. I meet and even exceed all requirements except 1 where it requires 8 years of experience in my current department, where I only have 5.

1kexpkf,Accepting new job offer - Cold feet,"For some back story
I've been a cable contractor (W2 Piece rate pay) for a major ISP since 22'. Recently I came back to the original contractor I worked for after being laid off. I've been here a few months again. I recently got an officer for a Fiber Technician position. 
The pay is $24 an hour, full benefits package, and in house with the actual company vs contracting. 
I'm just a little scared taking this next step, I will be losing my take home vehicle and company phone, and I make about $22 average now. But no benefits(they're very bad but are there). 
I will have to drive my car to work for a few months before I get a truck. It's a 35 minute drive, but including dropping my niece off at school it's an hour commute. Currently I work close to home and take the van home.

I left my old contractor for a new job and got burned, so I am hesitant. But learning fiber will open many doors as fiber makes way more. ",Dean9mm,1,1.0,0,1746401833,2025-05-04 23:37:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kexpkf/accepting_new_job_offer_cold_feet/,5,2025

Recently, I sat down with my boss and created a plan to transition into part-time work so I can begin studying. I’ve applied to start a beauty therapy course in July, and I’m currently about 75% of the way through the enrolment and financial process. I was feeling excited and ready for the change.

But just this week, something unexpected happened: I was offered an opportunity to join a well-known rural real estate agency and begin the process of getting my real estate licence. 

Now I feel completely torn. Beauty therapy was something I was looking forward to as it was something I had an interest in but also because it was finally a chance to get out of TTM, but this real estate offer feels like a big opportunity that’s just landed in my lap and its something that won't be there forever and I think i could be pretty good at it if i really applied myself— I just don’t know what to do.",Forward_Ad_2330,4,1.0,1,1746399139,2025-05-04 22:52:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kewrio/career_dilemma/,5,2025

1kevku7,"Should I postpone my graduation, or risk graduating during a recession?","
Hello! I am rising senior getting my Bachelor's in English with a minor in technical writing. I don't have a ton of work experience. I did an internship at my community college's library in my freshman year and I've had a few customer service jobs. Right now, I'm writing for a small financial firm as a freelancer. I have no clue how long the job is going to last since it seems like a ""your contract ends when we randomly decide it does"" situation. I've had zero luck getting anything useful this summer either. I've even filled out some volunteer applications and interviewed for unpaid positions, and somehow THOSE are competitive. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with my resume either since I've gotten interviews at nine different companies, two of which went second round. 

I am supposed to graduate in May of 2026, and I'm really concerned that I'll land in a 2008 style recession. However, my college has a one-time ""free"" leave of absence policy that I could use to wait things out a little more. Basically, I can take a semester off and come back without affecting my scholarships. Either that, or I could just postpone a couple of required classes instead of graduating. That way, I would graduate in December of 2026. This would not mess with my finances since I have leftover scholarship money and live with my parents. 

Graduating later might let me:
-Land a summer internship (I had one for the summer, but it cancelled because our lovely administration pulled their funding).
-Wait out more of the impending recession. 
-Possibly give me more time to network at my college since I'm a transfer.

Graduating earlier would let me:
-Have my Bachelor's earlier
-Get temp/contract jobs quicker since most need a degree
-Possibly save a little more in the long run since I can't make much money in college 

Of course, there's also the risk that choosing to graduate later won't get me any more experience. I would be a lot more qualified this time around if I did postpone and try for a summer job, but the job market might decide that it hates me anyway. I also can't really predict recessions, so it might be even worse if I wait. 

Also, for anyone wondering what I would do during my gap semester, I would probably just learn some software to add to my resume, maybe try to pick up a contract (though I doubt that'll work), or just like fix my insomnia and pick up more hours at my restaurant job.

1keu4im,General Advice Regarding Entering the Tech Field.  Schooling or Certifications?,"For starters, I'm a 19yr old male with just a high school diploma from a small town in Oklahoma.  My work history consists of mostly kitchen experience, roughly 4 years collectively, 2.5 years as a Line Cook cook at a restaurant, with me getting a promotion to a Team Lead Line Cook within that last year.  I very recently just quit that job to start a new maintenance position for an increased salary.  My main focus is to get myself into the tech field.  I have quite a bit of knowledge regarding computers and technology in general, and so far this is the only path I've found in life that I want to take a step in.  While I have this general knowledge, I do not know how to code, and I would like to learn to.  My current plan was to get the CompTIA A+ certification, and then hopefully by the end of this year, I would be able to move out of my parent's house and get an apartment with my girlfriend.  The benefit of doing this is I could actually get a job that would benefit my work history in the tech field, as there realistically aren't any options where I live.  With that info out of the way, what should I do? 



TL:DR: I'm studying to get the CompTIA A+ cert, but now I feel as though I'm wasting my time by not going to school and getting a degree.  I would like to avoid as much debt as I can, but if it'll be worth it and it'll pay off, then I wouldn't mind.

1ketxtw,Does anyone have advice on choosing between two offers? UX vs digital marketing,"Hi everyone, I'd appreciate any guidance from people who may have been in a similar situation, like those who chose between industries or marketing vs pure UI/UX design. (I hesitate to call it a situation, because I'm extremely fortunate to be graduating this month with two offers to choose from). Honestly, if anyone wants any advice I'd be happy to provide that also!

For context, my Bachelor's will be in computer science and design. I've been an intern at a biotech/pharma company for nearly two years, and my work has been focused on designing advertisements. My full-time offer from this company would allow me to manage the experience and design of our websites, essentially offering more ownership over my projects. However, there wouldn't be much internal design support, and therefore not much I can learn from. I've also been experiencing some burnout after being there for so long, but I love the ability to make an impact on our patients' experience, love my team, and the job would be mostly remote.

The other offer I received has the same base salary, comparable benefits, and is even around the same location. This role would actually give me a UI/UX title that aligns more with my overall career goals. The key differences are that the industry is financial services rather than biotech, and would require more in-person office days, making it more difficult for me to live near home. The company culture feels more innovative, but I'm not sure whether either industry is very ""creative."" I'd also be adjusting to a new team with less existing connections to company leadership.

So, I guess I'd most like to ask if anyone in creative roles can vouch for one position or the other based on the ability to move up in design positions. If I wanted to be a creative director in the future, would one of these offer more opportunity? Thanks for reading through, and best of luck to anyone searching.

1ketpc0,Burned Out or Just Fed Up? 10 Years in Geospatial Has Me Wondering What's Next,"I've spent the last decade neck-deep in geospatial and aerial mapping—everything from collecting LiDAR via manned flights, flying drones for photogrammetry, running ground control surveys, managing production workflows, and leading a full geospatial department. It's been a wild ride. Drones have been a big part of the journey, but honestly, ""drone pilot"" has never felt like the right title for me.

I see myself as a geospatial professional and production manager first. Sure, I've logged plenty of flight hours, but most of my work has been behind the scenes—transforming raw LiDAR and imagery into actual deliverables. And that’s where I’ve found the most satisfaction: solving problems, optimizing workflows, and getting maps dialed in just right.

But here’s where it gets frustrating.

Every drone-focused company I’ve worked with has seriously underinvested in processing. It’s always the same: minimal staff, tight timelines, and all the pressure pushed to the back end. I’ve often been the only person handling post-processing—sometimes with one other person, if I'm lucky. That usually means long nights, weekends, and missing time with my family just to hit deadlines. With a second kid on the way, I just can’t keep sacrificing that time anymore. I’m doing the job of three people, for less than one person’s pay.

So yeah—burned out? Maybe. Frustrated and ready for a change? Definitely.

I’ve been thinking about pivoting. Maybe into programming, or going back to school for GIS or something more sustainable. But honestly? It’s scary. I’m the sole provider for my family, and I have no idea what a realistic next step looks like—financially or professionally.

Just needed to get this out. If you’ve been here or made a career shift—what worked for you?

1ket1tz,"Found out new hires make more than me, how do I ask for a raise?","So a little break down to give you all a good picture of my career with my company so far. I'm a caregiver in California, currently working 60 hours a week. I've been with my company for almost 2 years and I have 5 years previous experience caregiving privately for a family friend. I would say I'm a pretty decent employee. I've taken plenty of fill in shifts, even working a double on Christmas, I'm very good at communicating with my office regarding client needs and/or changes, I always give plenty of notice before hand if I need a day off. I do have health issues, which has caused me to need to take days off but I let them know before being hired, I would need days off sometimes. And again, I gave plenty of notice of which days I would need off. At most, it was 2 days a month and over the past year, my health as got significantly better and I haven't needed to take nearly as many days off. 

When I got hired with my company, I was hired at $17 an hour. At the time, it was better than other job I could find. No one was hiring for more then $15, so I was happy and I got my first raise at the beginning of this year which put me at $17.50. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I get a call 30 minutes before my 12 hour shift ends and I'm asked to do an hour fill in and I'll get paid for 2 hours. Okay, sure, it's right down the street anyways and I'm already on overtime. The next caregiver gets there and we start talking. She asks me how long I've been with the company and I learn she's a new hire, hasn't even been with the company for a month yet. I ask her out of curiosity, how much she makes. I've seen my company posting on Indeed hiring for 18-19 so I already figured she made 18. She says 18.50 and she has no past experience. She's not even a career caregiver. She has a full time office job and she's only doing this on the side to make extra money for her daughters quinceañera. 


When I saw the Indeed post hiring at 18-19, I was already a little ticked off. I know we are extremely short staffed and our turnover rate is very high so I understand why they raised the hiring pay. I was grandfathered in to the $17 I guess and I was already thinking about talking to my manager about it. But learning someone who has no previous experience was hired at $18.50 made me pretty upset. Even she said I should go talk to them and ask for a raise. My issue is, I really don't know what to say. I love my company and I love the office staff. They've been very helpful and understanding when I needed my days off and I don't want to ruin the relationship I've build with my company or make them feel like I don't appreciate them being so understanding.
 Is it even worth bringing up? And how would I word it if I do bring it up? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you. 


TLDR; I found out new hires with no experience make a dollar more then me, someone who has 2 years with the company and 5 years previous experience. How do I talk to my work about a raise?

There is modules on your account that provide study guides and videos to help you learn the content better and quizzes to follow that up. Very easy to navigate. You are required to submit three health coaching sessions and even though it can seem scary it really helps a lot to build confidence. You also get a free functional nutrition course along with the health coaching course. I could go on and on about why this program seems to be the best offered. The industry is growing and a high demand is needed for health and life coaches. I will provide a promo code for $750 the course if you want to take the step of becoming a board certified health and wellness coach. If you are interested in becoming a life coach I have a separate code for that. To enroll you go to mindbodygreen health coach certification - add the class to the card and then you have the option to enter the code: 
 HCCSTUDENT628 on the checkout page. You should then see the price adjusted.

Out of all the courses offered I would highly recommend this one! ",Queen-bee1996,0,0.5,0,1746385343,2025-05-04 19:02:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kerj9w/mindbodygreen_health_coach_certification_750_off/,5,2025

1ker7in,I feel like I'm stuck and I don't know what to do,"When I was 19 I decided to get into a trade , that trade was auto technician. I started by working at jiffy lube and was there for 2 and a half years, I've been to a few other shops but I always ran into the same problem.. 

With trades it's hard to go in and just start working you need people to show you things and you need people to teach you how things work. For 3 years straight while going from shop to shop nobody would teach me anything. All i knew how to do was change oil. 

Last year i found a mazda to work at, mind you this mazda is small. Only 8 techs work there, so i figured id have a better chance (also this mazda has been through 4 different service managers the first 6 months i was there)  The first few months i was doing jobs other than oil changes. Belts, tensioners, valve covers and timing covers. No diag and no electrical just yet. One day I messed up. And I got sent back to doing oil changes full time for a year. WHATEVER. im fine with making mistakes and dealing with my consequences. One week i got written up 2 times. One was because my foreman told me to work on this car so i did. I could not tell him no. Then a oil change rolls up and I take maybe 5 minutes to get to it. Unfortunately 5 minutes was too much and I got written up again. Whatever fine. 

Now im an apprentice tech. Doing bigger jobs and actually diagnosing cars and doing electrical diag and working on one car for more then 4 hours if needed for a job. Recalls, etc. I got told the beginning of this month (may) ill be going flate rate at $22 an hour. Great. 3 days ago I get told that I won't be going flat rate because we basically do not have enough work. To me that's fine. I don't want to have to make my own hours if we don't have 80 hours to contribute between 5 main shop techs. I tried to ask for a raise at least and my boss (mind you we got another new service manager 3 months ago) told me she can't give me a raise without going flatw rate. 

Am I wasting my time at this dealership or even in the industry in general ? I feel so undervalued and so unappreciated. I feel like i have done everything to show this company that I'm willing and they just keep shitting on me. It's really affecting my self esteem and I can't get my own place on $19hr here in oregon. I need some genuine advice. Not just ""get a new job"" like honestly. I've been looking for 6 months and can't land a different position at a different company. I WANT TO GET OUT OF THE INDUSTRY HOW DO I DO THAT??? 

I apologize if this is a mess I'm so stressed out and I feel so stuck and I feel so hopeless.

1ker1v1,Advice on leaving permanent position (which I currently dislike and boss dislikes me) for a summer temp job to make connections?,"I'm in an industry (News/Media production) I thought I could make work, but the hours and schedules for everyone are crappy as hell. I am not happy, haven't been for a year. The job search has been abysmal. I had two people cancel interviews this week, but I have the opportunity to go be a summer camp photographer and the person hiring probably had a lot of connections (I've checked out her LinkedIn and would like to at least make that connection). 

Only problem I have is the camp is a Christian summer camp, but I do have experience with them even though I'm no longer religious in any way. I don't think that will be a barrier to this job, but it's basically only 8 weeks of work for about $3000. So I'd be out of a job at the end of it, but it would diversify my photography  and videography portfolio, which is currently lacking. 

I am trying my best in my current role but I may leave soon regardless of whether I have a job lined up soooo I'm not sure what to do. This is my only current opportunity to leave.

1keqqo8,Looking for Advice and direction to transfer into a career I'll actually enjoy.,"I'm looking for advice and direction on a few things:

* What jobs/careers would fit my current skillset and experience 
* What sort of job could I get into today that will pay my bills
* How do I transfer into a job with little to no experience?
* How should I write my CV/resume? Do I ommit my previous experiences if they don't apply to the job I'm applying for?



I'm 28F from the state of Indiana. Since my first job at 14 I've jumped all over the place trying to figure out what sort of career and education I'd like to pursue long term. My resume and CV definitely represent that. I am a 2023 grad with a background in Art and Customer service. I want to transfer my skills into a professional career but I am unsure how to do that. I've always struggled to land an job that isnt working in a kitchen or customer service because that's all I've worked in. Now I'm struggling to find anything after leaving my last job not even Walmart will look at my application. I feel like I'm over qualified for a basic job but not experienced for a proper career. So I'm really at a loss of what to do.

I'm interested in something creative and structured full time. Being a regular artist full time does not interest me and I have considered things like Arts Administration and Visual Merchandising but again not sure where to start or what I'd be a good fit for. Going back to school isn't a problem and I'm open to relocation but would prefer to stay local. 


Experience
- I have mostly worked in kitchens and customer service roles for aprox 7yrs combined and 6 months as a retail associate at Walmart. One job was as a Dietary Cook for 3 months while I was stuck in another state. 
- last job was at 7 brew coffee

1keqfkm,If you were in my situation would you stick around or leave? I truly can't decide.,"I (38M) have been at my current employer for \~9 years. There are plenty of days when work is great. I have a great boss, the team I manage is small but mighty, and overall the people I work with are pleasant to work with. But lately there are more and more days where I dread signing on for the day. I loathe the idea of continuing in my current role. Days when I'm absolutely positive it's time for me to move on. And frankly, I'm a bit bored and in need of a new challenge.

Since joining, I have made several moves internally, including a couple promotions and my income has increased substantially over these 9 years, so it's not been all bad.

**Why move?**

* I know I could make quite a bit more money taking an outside role
* I would enjoy a new challenge and something fresh to energize me throughout the day and regain that passion for getting up and working
* I would like to be in an industry that I'm actually passionate about. I don't dislike my current industry by any means, I really just couldn't care less

**Why stay?**

* The potential future of the US economy scares me. If layoffs start happening en masse I'm terrified that as the new guy I'd be out the door first. We don't have more than a month's salary saved so not having a job for any reasonable period of time would be a big struggle
* I'm pretty secure in my role so if layoffs start happening, it would be highly unlikely that I'd be impacted
* My boss is great; a great leader and mentor and frankly a friend
* My direct reports are great to work with; we are a small but mighty team and I truly enjoy getting to lead them and help the grow
* My boss plans to retire in 2-3 years (of course the economy could change that) and I've already been tapped to replace him. Though I openly admit nothing is guaranteed.
* Change of this magnitude scares me. There's so many unknowns and what-ifs

During some of the rougher days and weeks lately, I decided to brush up my resume. I had a professional help me improve it and help target the level of jobs that I'd potentially be seeking.

My thought right now is that since I don't *have* to make a move, that I should casually see what's out there and apply to roles that I'm truly excited about. It also affords me the opportunity to hold out for somewhat of a substantial raise since I can be selective. But I go back and forth daily.

So what would you do in my position? Updating a resume and applying is one thing, but would you make a move given the potential risks/unknowns? Or would you hold out until we see where things like the economy will land in a few years and then make a move.",CampOpen8215,2,1.0,12,1746382512,2025-05-04 18:15:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1keqfkm/if_you_were_in_my_situation_would_you_stick/,5,2025

What I’d really like to be able to do is go into an industry that I can get a job relatively quickly (maybe trades?) and then work and live as frugally as possible for a year or two to save up so I can quit for a couple months to a year and tour by bicycle, then going and getting a job again. I don’t think going to a 4-year school wouldn’t help me with that. What kind of careers/industries could I do this in?

1keokmu,How do I positively handle a toxic leader from another org?," I’m a Sr. Marketing Manager and joined a new company 3 months ago. Main responsibility is drive sales of a new product in my region.  There's a female Sr. Director (global) whose team is developing the product and while her team is nice, she is extremely controlling, aggressive, and disrespectful toward everyone—including my manager (regional marketing leader), who has voiced concerns but nothing has changed.  She often undermines him and now she’s starting to step into my responsibilities. She has been in the same industry for a while and every person who has worked for and with her, hates her!

She recently invited my sales team to a recurring meeting with an agenda that covers about 50% of my role, bypassing me entirely (I am copied on the invite but was not given a heads up or anything). This sets a precedent that could sideline me altogether. While I have the experience to perform well, it’s demotivating to be undermined like this, especially in front of sales.

 I’ve quit in similar toxic situations before but want to handle this one differently. My usual style has been take shit smiling and staying positive and quit when unbearable. I love the company, my role, my manager n org but this lady who is developing the product, and I have to market in the region, is a nightmare to work with. Hearing similar murmurs from other regions.

1kenhq4,Co-worker’s AI use making my job harder,"Twice in the past month I’ve been given the task of reviewing my co-worker’s projects for accuracy. However, their use of generative AI is making my life a lot harder (and threatening the company’s image) and I don’t know what to do. 

Essentially, my team does research that her team is supposed to use to make a public facing product. However, it’s quite obvious to me that instead of actually reviewing our research, she has plugged in key terms to some AI and had it do her work for her. Not only does this leave me more work to do when I review her product, it is also compromising the company as a whole. The AI generated text in her work is often full of inaccuracies, which is extremely troubling seeing as we are an education-based cultural institution. If something were to slip past my team’s review it could potentially affect the company’s image and reputation. 

The thing is I don’t know what to do (if I should do anything at all). 
•I can’t just talk to just her one-on-one (I work remote and she doesn’t) 
•I don’t want to be seen as a snitch or have this affect my image within the company 
•I sometimes use AI to help me make my writing better, but I only use it to rewrite things I’ve already written and I never use it to do research for me like she does. But I am worried that if i point out her mistakes I will also implicate myself.

1kem67g,Offered a VP role: Moving from a large corporation to a startup.,"I’ve been offered a role as VP of Business Development & Strategy at a startup (<$5 million annual revenue). The offer includes a 15% salary increase, performance-based bonuses and stock options.

I have a background from both engineering and sales, and I am currently working as an Engineering Manager in a large multinational corporation (>$5 billion annual revenue). I have a very good career progression plan within the company. Realistically I can be at a director-level in 4-5 years, and VP level in 7-8 years. 

Per my own analysis I see the benefit as:
- Increased responsibility giving me hands-on experience with an array of executive-level skills.
- Potential value of the stock options if the company grows significantly or is acquired.
- Significant exposure to key players in the industry increasing my network and potential future employers.

And the risks as:
- Loss of career path with a large corporation.
- Possibility that stock options are diluted and/or practically worthless.
- Increased workload offsetting the value of the salary increase.

1kel4pu,WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?,"I’ve been working as a web developer for five years now. Although I had strong academic performance and a CS degree, I always struggled with coding independently. In university, I often relied on Googling and help from seniors to get through projects. Despite good grades, coding brought me intense stress, especially during my final year project, which led to frequent breakdowns—even though I excelled in subjects like Math.

After graduating, I landed an international internship due to my high GPA. I was thrown into using Vue.js without any prior experience and felt overwhelmed, especially living alone abroad for the first time. The company had high expectations, but I could barely function during the first month. I didn’t understand frontend-backend flow, couldn’t comprehend documentation, and struggled to clarify requirements. This led to severe anxiety and even suicidal thoughts. I kept pushing through by copying code and trying to survive day by day.

When I returned and started my first job back home, people assumed I’d be skilled due to my international exposure—but I wasn’t. I took a low-paying job due to imposter syndrome and ended up being humiliated and scolded publicly by my team lead and even the CEO, which deeply scarred me. Every time I sit down to code, my mind is flooded with negative thoughts, making it hard to concentrate. Its getting worse now.  
I have tried alot like going to the office and it still doesn't help.

Despite five years in the field, I still heavily rely on tools like ChatGPT. I struggle with confidence, and even simple tasks take me disproportionately long. While I want to improve, trying to study or learn in my free time quickly leads to burnout and mental fatigue. Coding is the only professional skill I have, and though my current job is manageable due to low development demands, there's pressure to grow into a senior developer role—something I still don’t feel capable of achieving.",Proud_Eye_207,2,1.0,4,1746368972,2025-05-04 14:29:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kel4pu/what_is_wrong_with_me/,5,2025

1kejyb2,"Do I stay on my current, stable career path, despite not having the intellectual challenge that brings me fulfillment?","Hi, really hoping at least someone can relate and offer some kind of advice. I’m a 25 year old man living at home still in the uk.

I currently work as a scaffolder, after falling into the trade after dropping out of uni in the first year. I enjoy the job for the most part, although there are definitely downsides, e.g the physical strain on my body. There is a clear path forward for me in scaffolding, I’ll always have a reasonably well paying job, and I 100% aspire to have my own business if I stick it out.

However, in a recent therapy session, I realised how unfulfilled I am intellectually with my job. Growing up I was always the clever kid, and found most of my self love and pride coming from academic achievements. A challenge for my brain is just what satisfies me. I had planned to study astrophysics at uni originally, as the subject interests me. Nowadays I’m still interested in it, but also a lot in psychology and philosophy.

1kejxps,May I ask for help one more time?,"
I want everyone that clicks on this and reply’s. I truly appreciate you. Thank you. 

I know this is getting ridiculous but i need some advice/help

I need to know what’s a career to switch to. What’s in demand? I don’t really have an idea for school, I hear healthcare but I don’t have 2 years of school. I have a mortgage. How do people do this? 

Im 34M in Canada, Ontario. I work at a marketing agency remote it’s awful. I need a sense of purpose or a job that won’t make me walk into on coming traffic. I’ve never really had a knack for anything to do with my hands, I know trades are in demand. 

I’ve always been in sales and I’ve always been good at it. But I don’t know if I have it in me anymore. No body wants to be a team anymore. I love working and I’m a damn hard worker. If someone’s willing to teach I’m willing to learn. 

I just need advice, things are getting dark over here and I’m slightly scared. I’m not going to lie.  ",ResearchDear5942,1,1.0,2,1746365666,2025-05-04 13:34:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kejxps/may_i_ask_for_help_one_more_time/,5,2025
1kejdlu,How do I find direction after trying multiple paths and feeling lost?,"Hi all,

24M Chinese here, currently back in Beijing after a few detours in my academic and career journey. I’d really appreciate any advice on what kind of job I should be looking for right now, and how to think about my long-term future. Thank you so much!

A bit of background:

I graduated with a degree in Japanese from an international university in China.

After graduation, I pivoted into art and worked as a prompt engineer at an AI RPG roleplaying app company, where I also started learning to code and everything.

I later founded an AI-powered otome (female-oriented romance) novel app, which showed some promise.

Unfortunately, I lost control of the project due to legal inexperience and got tricked by my investor. Tried to rebuild it solo, but couldn’t make it work.

I then enrolled in a graduate school in regional economics at Kumamoto University in Japan, but I couldn’t adapt to the small city (I grew up in Beijing) and realized I wasn’t interested in the major. I dropped out after half a year and came back to Beijing.


Where I am now:

Unemployed in Beijing. I’d like to work for a while before applying for another graduate program—this time either in Japan or Canada.

I’m fortunate that I don’t have to worry too much about money thanks to my family, but I really want to earn my own way through grad school. So salary matters, but it’s not the only factor—I want to feel independent.

I’m very interdisciplinary by nature—interested in a wide range of topics, from art and LLMs to business and storytelling—but I don’t have deep expertise in one single area yet. If anything, I’m good at connecting dots across disciplines.

I don’t mind focusing on a more specific field moving forward—I’m still young—but I do feel some pressure to make decisions soon.


My problem:

I’m not sure what kind of job I should be looking for that makes the most of my current skills, helps me grow, and aligns with my future goal of grad school abroad. I’d love a role that lets me explore, learn, and make an impact.

Has anyone here been in a similar position? Any advice on roles, industries, strategies—or anything at all—would really mean a lot. I honestly feel a bit lost right now.

Some things I think I like:

1. Multicultural environments and talking to people from different backgrounds. (I once worked as a bartender at an international bar and really enjoyed it.)


2. Creating art, though I’m not highly skilled.


3. Learning cutting-edge technology—especially methodologies like reinforcement learning.

1keibms,$40000K in debt and will lose my job in 1 month,"Hi all, 

First time poster, long time lurker so please be kind and I apologize for the stupidly long post.

Im at a bit of scary time at the moment and am looking for any and all advice.  

As the title pretty much states I am $40000 in debt and have just been informed I will not have a job in 1 month. 

A little background about me 
I am a 32M living in Sydney Australia and have been in the workforce since I was 20 

I am a university/college dropout and have been the sole provider for my mother and father since I have been able to work, I am an only child and both my parents are elderly (mid to late 70's), unable and unskilled enough to work and have not had amazing health since I was a teenager. 

Unfortunately it's just us 3, all relatives are over seas and are unwilling to help, understandably they have their own lives to live. 

My parents do not own a home, and I pay their weekly rent of $400 (in Sydney, this is freaking cheap!), buy groceries, attend and pay for medical/specialist appointments, medicine and pretty much every other little thing in between for them. 

My parents are the major reason why I am in $40000 worth of debt, unfortunately medical bills, house repairs, car repairs/buying a car outright have taken up the majority of this debt and I am ashamed to say that it has snowballed quite a lot since my responsibilities for my parents have started, most of my 20s have been in debt in some way, shape or form. 

I've primarily worked in customer service, retail, sales and account management however due to what can only be described as a mental breakdown in December 2023 I was let go from my last account management role and have a pretty bad taste in my mouth regarding customer service, retail, sales etc and have absolutely no desire to return whatsoever. 

Since January 2024 I have been working as a sub-contractor for the Australian postal service aka AusPost and have enjoyed it so far, the starts are early but the work is honest and I get to be out in the fresh air for most of the day not stuck in an office or a retail floor.

I have been informed this morning that my employer, the contract holder with AusPost will be letting my run go and is giving it to someone else whom will take over instead and will be doing the run personally themselves, essential I will no longer be needed and not in the picture.

As of this evening there is no work available in my depot and I may have to say goodbye to AusPost and find something else

Given my circumstance I've lived paycheck to paycheck for as long as I can remember and have no savings prepared. 

My question to you all is, what would you do? 

I've never really had aspirations for a career if im honest, once my father could no longer work I had to leave university and begin work asap, I've been in survival mode for so long I don't really know where to go from here. 

Any and all options I can think of turn out to be difficult to work around my caretaker lifestyle. 

I can commit my self to a 5 day per week full-time job, I just need a day a week to line up medical appointments and do all of my household duties. 

Any and all advice is appreciated and I'm happy to answer any more questions if needed 

Thank you,",deusxdenim,13,0.6800000071525574,33,1746360573,2025-05-04 12:09:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1keibms/40000k_in_debt_and_will_lose_my_job_in_1_month/,5,2025

1keggse,Probation review,"Probation up for review

I’m currently working full-time in a lab-based role focused on enviro quality, and I’m nearing the end of my probation period. I was hired based on hands-on experience rather than a formal degree and have been fulfilling duties such as sample processing, reagent preparation, housekeeping, and supporting general lab operations.

At the start I wasn’t given a fair go. I was left without proper training. I was often expected to figure things out on my own and was even told at one point to copy someone else’s training record, with the comment: “Eh, it should be fine. I trust you can do it properly without seeing—just go off results.” This made me feel unsupported and like I was being set up to fail. But to be fair I was assigned another trainer which I then passed some training. 

Over time, I’ve felt increasingly targeted and excluded by a colleague who is on the same level as me. This person has repeatedly reported me for things like “disappearing” or “not communicating my whereabouts” and not prioritising the things they’ve asked me to do and often just continued off with what I’m doing.. which is a blatant lie. The same person doing the majority of the reporting in the beginning consistently sabotaged me and made reports back to my original trainer ‘paperwork and methods aren’t being done consistently and have mistakes frequently. I know this because she was the only one to consistently work along side me and somehow this information came from my trainer to management when he was around to see approximately NONE of my errors … he wasn’t even around to train me 

There is also the accusation of me not taking feedback well and being sensitive to feed back which is ‘making people uncomfortable to bring things up with me ‘ and was told to move on what’s happened to me and how I was treated specifically by management and that my defensiveness no longer needs to continue.. I’ll make it very clear by saying I’m not being defensive; I’m being gas lit. The ‘feedback’ i have been given in the past was me being pulled up for things that didn’t really make a difference and I was constantly being hammered for it daily, no positive feedback. I was always professional regardless 

Since then I’ve kept a detailed, time-stamped task log every day to show exactly what I’ve been doing and where I’ve been. I’ve also been consistently excluded from informal conversations and team dynamics often a clique group of colleagues will sit outside everyday for lunch  and actively avoided me one day when I went to sit where they normally do ; they walked straight past me with no acknowledgment.

I’ve witnessed subtle but demoralizing behaviours. One example: a song with the lyrics “Certified for this shit” was played on repeat while two others in the room joked, “Are you certified for this shit?”—a remark that seemed to indirectly reference my lack of formal certification or degree, especially since I was left out of the exchange.

I also found out that management has been scolded by a few people for hiring me without a degree, which I believe has created an undercurrent of resentment or judgment among certain staff.

When I raised my concerns with management, I was told the behaviour “wasn’t meant that way” and that I was just “very sensitive.” When I pushed back and explained why my feelings were valid, they continued to downplay my experience, leaving me feeling dismissed and blamed.

Now, just before my probation ends, I’ve been asked to submit my task log for review. Despite consistently completing my responsibilities, assisting in a lab safety inspection, and even helping train a new employee, I can’t shake the feeling that they’re building a case to justify letting me go.

At this point, I don’t know if I’m truly being too sensitive—or if I’m dealing with workplace exclusion, subtle bullying, and gaslighting. I’m reaching out because I’d really appreciate honest advice or a second opinion from someone outside of the situation.
 
Tomorrow Is my probation review where they have specifically asked me also to provide my work timestamped log.

1kefdap,Feeling guilty and unsure about the prospect of leaving my job,"I recently started applying to jobs after a few incidents that soured my feelings towards my current employer.

However, I work at a small business and I am probably the most essential employee at the company (other than the owner).

I feel immense guilt about the idea of leaving because I know it could destabilize them.

Another complication is that the owner told me he’d like to pay for a certification I am getting. He hasn’t sent the money yet because I don’t start the program for another week, but I don’t want to be in a situation where I’m ‘pulling one over’ on him by leaving immediately after he pays for this.

But I also don’t have any job offers yet (I just started applying to places on Thursday) so I don’t know if I should mention that I’m thinking of leaving yet. He always told me that if I ever feel like leaving I shouldn’t hesitate to tell him immediately because I’m essential and he’ll do anything to keep me. But I don’t want to stay. I’ve already made up my mind

Additionally, in physics, I think I am better than in bio and a little easier because of the formulas and equations and I think I would be better prepared for the test than bio, but also really burnt out.


I took AP chemistry last year in the year before that I did advanced chemistry. I really enjoyed advanced chemistry, but ap chemistry cooked me to the core. I got a 3 on the AP test.

One subjected to love was psychology and specifically the anatomy of the brain and also the clinical psychology unit in AP psychology where we talked about mental disorders and 
Neurotransmitters and synapses and stuff and I got a 5 on the test.

But because psychology is the only subject I am completely into, I was wondering, if becoming a psychiatrist and majoring in psychology on the pre-route in undergraduate is a bad idea. I mainly did it because I wanted to help people with mental disorders by being a psychiatrist specifically a child psychiatrist, but I am questioning this choice because of biology which I think is a big part of medical school.

1kecmn0,For those who did a Master's accredited by the CIP and are doing a government planner job. How is it going?,"Dear planners / future planners,

I am a third-year student doing a sociology degree and an economics minor at UBC, and my cumulative GPA may be around 76-80% by the time I graduate.

I want to go into city planning - environmental or social housing planning.

I can seek out two academic references and two professional references (one professional who I am sure is very confident in my abilities).

I hold two entry-level positions at a municipal government in Metro Vancouver (one may be laid off - sessional, one auxiliary - will stay on).

For CIP-accredited school master's programs, I am not confident in my chances for UBC, perhaps SFU, even Vancouver Island University or U of Alberta. BCIT have GIS programs too, but I do wish to be a city planner, so it must be CIP accredited.

**If you don't mind sharing, I'll love to hear from anyone on that path, or already working in the field. I sincerely appreciate all of your inputs :D**

1. What grade were you getting into the master's programs, and which school did you choose?
2. Do the schools omit irrelevant and lower-level courses and focus on 300-400 level courses?
3. What do you learn in the programs? GIS operations? Government policies? Writing research in a government format? Learning how to read public contracts? Drafting permits?
4. What was your career path? From internships to landing a city planner's job? How many years did it take you after graduation? And how did your income progress throughout the years?
5. What kind of person are you? What kind of person is needed for the job? High stress levels?
6. What exactly does the job entail? Connect with external contractors? Processing permits? Drafting contracts? Things like doing research, like population density, distribution, trend, etc to propose housing policies?
7. If I've built a career in Vancouver as a planner, would it be possible to move within Canada or even outside of Canada and continue in something where the pay stays good in the field? Most opportunities are in the government? Or would more be in private companies?

1kead1s,Absolutely torn between two offers,"Offer 1:

- Public relations role
- $74,880
- Good benefits, government holidays off, and company insurance coverage 
- 55 min commute each way, which can be cut by as much as 15 minutes with a move 
- Pretty much the exact type of work I’ve been looking for
- Work obligation will become very demanding during crisis communications situations; will keep me away from family for periods of time

Offer 2:

- Marketing role
- $73,000
- 20+ days PTO, government holidays off, but bad company insurance coverage
- 100% remote
- Not exactly the type of work I “love”, but it can be rewarding
- In-person engagements out of state will keep me away from family for 4-6 times a year for 3-5 days at a time


One of the sticking points for me is the remote work (which I’m doing in my current role) - it’s just more family friendly. However, I have been missing in-person connection with people and needing (I think anyways) time away from the kids.

Have you been in a similar boat?

1ke9vhm,Advice for New Financial Advisor?,"Hey everyone, this is my first post here.

I am seeking advice on my first job out of undergraduate (graduating in a week).

I got a job at in financial planning and wealth management a month ago and have been getting my certifications (SIE, 65, etc.). The job is located in Charleston, SC.

The job has no base salary. I am a 1099 contractor.

My income is based on:

•Financial planning: take home 70% of the one time fee when acquiring a client. Ex: $1,000 financial planning fee -> I earn $700

•Recurring fees for AUM (charge 1% and take home 0.7%),

•Commission on “commissionable goods” which are products like annuities. I’d earn 70% of the commission and receive 50% of that commission up front. The remaining 50%  would be paid out as $600 a week. Ex: $15,000 commission -> I earn $10,500 -> I receive $5,250 up front and the other half is paid out $600/week.

The firm has a targeted marketing system to find leads.

I am young, have little experience, and looking to get advice from those of who have been in the industry.

With that being said, my questions are:

1.	⁠Is this a normal commission model for fee-based advisors?

2.	⁠How much could I expect to make in Y1?-> Recruiter says it varies person to person-> Most new advisors sign around 21 clients in year 1

3.	⁠What advice do you all have for young advisors when it comes to gaining clients early in their career?

4.	⁠Is this a solid foundation to start? I know many of these firms can be predatory on young college graduates.",United-Dimension-560,1,1.0,3,1746327151,2025-05-04 02:52:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ke9vhm/advice_for_new_financial_advisor/,5,2025
1ke9l9v,Anyone have a Director (or similar/higher) level mentor that they meet with?,"I have an opportunity to reach out to a director in a different team to essentially ask to be my mentor. My manager and general manager knows them personally and they both agreed that as a part of my next path for growth, I should look for an official mentor to guide and refine my career outlook. For quick context, I’m at an analytics level now at my job where the next role up would be a manager level. Other words I’m at the last IC (independent contributor) role. My boss and GM of course mentor me in a way as well, but I think their mindset is for me to have mentorship from outside of our direct team to not only get a new perspective, but to also get a more well-rounded mentorship if it comes from a leader that isn’t directly associated with me and my performance. I in theory agree with all of this but am a loss as to:

1. How to ask someone to be a mentor after having a coffee chat?
2. What do yall usually talk to your mentor about when you have your coffee chats and how often do you find yourself chatting with them?

Extra question: 
3. Anyone that’s had an official mentor that’s in a high position and have maintained the relationship for a long while - what other benefits have you seen from curating these types of mentor relationships

This seems to be more personal of a connection than your typical “networking/mentorship program” that many companies facilitate. So this could be a cool opportunity but also I’m just kind of nervous about how to start this, aside from the initial ask for a coffee chat.

The boss clarified that he understood and the work environment was pleasant…. a few days in one of the men I worked with who had been there for several years was already harassing me about stuff (keep in mind I was training with no prior experience) that was stupid like my hands being in my pockets or not doing something right that was an easy fix… as time went on it got worse and this guy started calling me a bich a motherfu*** a pu**y and many others… I only took it for so long before I snapped back and yelled back at him for being a dik to me… the following week the boss asked me if I wanted to be there because I seemed withdrawn… I explained the situation and how it affects my tedious mental health issues and how it wasn’t something minor that I should have or deal with… it was quite harassing and degrading… the boss told me to basically suck it up and deal with it, the next couple days it got worse the man would yell at me and throw things and get aggressive… after I had it to my limits I snapped back and told him to shut the fck up and stand up if he had something else to say… the following day the boss pulled me in again and asked what happened I explained to him and he told me that I was out of line and fired me… fast forward 2 weeks and he told me a week ago he was sending my last check to me via mail which I hadn’t received and when i reached out he claims he sent it and it’s on its way but I know it shouldn’t take this long, I explained in another text my urgency of needing it and got no response… am I able to take legal action being that he knew I had a mental health disability and did nothing to prevent the harassment I received and basically discriminated against me and fired me in the situation where I wasn’t the aggressor or am I at least able to do something about getting my final check?",Striking-Bag-3527,3,1.0,7,1746315709,2025-05-03 23:41:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ke6ejp/wrongfully_terminated_and_never_received_last/,5,2025

1ke5lrv,Co-worker threw me under the bus,"Hi,
I'm new to corporate America, and as a first-generation college graduate, this world is completely unfamiliar to me. I recently started working at an advertising agency, where my role involves creating presentations and reports.

One of my first assignments was to help create a presentation for C-suite executives from a client I didn’t know much about. My boss paired me with a coworker who has been with the agency for over two years and has worked with this client before.

I began putting the deck together using the information I had, but I repeatedly asked her to review it or confirm the details. She kept telling me she was too busy and refused to help. I explained that I didn’t feel confident doing it all on my own and would really appreciate her support, but she still didn’t assist.

Presentation day to our internal team comes along ( not the C-Suites Executives) and we present. It went horribly wrong. My boss literally said that was the worst presentation she has ever seen in her whole career. I was completely devastated. 

A weeks go by can our boss pulls me and my coworker to her office. They tell us that it was such a horrible job that they want to know who created everything. My coworker threw me under the bus immediately (keep in mind she did half of it). Without hesitation I started to get yelled at. I told my boss it was just me that we both worked on it but my coworker kept her innocence. 

What should I do or how should I act around my coworker/boss? ",Fine-Fennel-8011,69,0.7400000095367432,76,1746313330,2025-05-03 23:02:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ke5lrv/coworker_threw_me_under_the_bus/,5,2025
1ke591b,9-5 job has me working evenings and weekends,"I am thinking I may have to go to employee relations, though am not sure. (Would have left already if this job market didn’t suck)

My manager and the Chief over my area (I am in Human Resources) have been almost expecting me to work weekends. 

I moved to a new team that was better aligned with what I do to see if I can get help, as I was already working 60+ hours a week. They agreed that I had enough responsibilities for another position, though that isn’t approved yet, and won’t be approved for another few months - though don’t think that will be the golden solution.

After moving to this team, instead of getting help, I have found they are all not trained, so every conversation turns into me teaching them something new. This has led to me having to play catch up on the weekends. 

When I brought this to my managers attention, she said that is part of being a “team player”. She asked me directly (I remember this very distinctly) “have you talked with [coworker] and asked if he has any hurdles” - then later, when I asked for clarification if this was an expectation in writing, she turned around and said that she never said that. 

I told them I am stressed, working 80 hours a week, and they just say things like “we can’t leave anyone behind” and “sometimes it takes working weekends”

A most recent example is that we were asked to complete slides for something last minute for the Chief over the area (who is aware of my complaints) - since I am the only one with the knowledge to complete them. Even working through lunch to fix payroll errors for people (something I couldn’t not do) I didn’t have time to complete the slides. When I was logging off Friday, I let my manager know that I can try to see if I can log on later to complete (I know - I shouldn’t offer - I just feel all the pressure to complete it by Monday morning is on me since I am the only one who put in the time to learn these things/start these projects - nobody else wanted to start any of these things/help when I offered to include them), and her response was “let me know if you send anything over the weekend”

So they are fully aware I am stresssed/not sleeping/working weekends and I have shared examples of when I have tried to lean on my coworkers, though I end up having to train them (which takes more time) or it doesn’t get done, and if I say anything then I’m “not a team player” or “sometimes it takes working weekends”

Keep in mind, I am in a ENTRY LEVEL role- presenting at meetings for chiefs and executives (and others have admitted I am doing the job of my director/manager)

I am just lost because I am grateful for the learning opportunity, though I feel I am being taken advantage of & I don’t feel I can go to my manager anymore with any concerns without being told I am not a team player or working weekends is what is needed.

Curious if I include employee relations? (I am in HR, so we don’t have a “HR” person 🙃)

It is affecting my mental health to an extreme/I no longer have time for friends/stress is keeping me up at night - it is hard to tell the CPO that I will get to his asks in my free time/I can’t meet deadlines when he is aware/hasn’t done anything before/tells me to lean on my coworkers (who aren’t trained)",Sweet-Quality-8580,2,1.0,7,1746312277,2025-05-03 22:44:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ke591b/95_job_has_me_working_evenings_and_weekends/,5,2025
1ke532l,Lately the norm to increase your salary has been to job hop every few years. I don't think that may be the case for me. Is my thought process reasonable or am I wearing company-branded rose-colored lenses?,"Since I (26) graduated college and entered the workforce 4 years ago have been told the best way to maximize your salary is to job hop. I was a big advocate of that idea, as I was making $60k my first 1.5 years (in data science) whereas my peers were making much more.

Starting in 2023, I switched companies and also entered a new role and industry (still in tech), where my salary has been beyond what I could have imagined at my age.

My salary progression is as shown (does not include any RSUs or stock):

Age 24 - TC: $122.5k Base Salary: $92.7k

25 - TC: $142.5k Base Salary: $105k

26 (Projected) - TC: $170k Base Salary: $126k

27 (Projected)- TC: $200k Base Salary: $137k

I am hoping to be in a managerial role closer to age 30, where I could make $250k TC my first year, with a base salary of $165k. I really like my job, am starting to finally get the hang of everything, and have things looking up for me in terms of making a name for myself within the department I am part of. I have now surpassed many of my peers that I went to school with, and recognize that as much as I earned this salary, a lot of it was also right place right time (sprinkled in with luck), and there could have been a scenario where I would reach this salary progression at a much slower rate, and I am super grateful and try to pay it forward when I can. 

That being said, I am always looking to increase my earnings ceiling, but I don't know if I necessarily have to be job hopping to do that. I think I could do it by staying within the same company for years to come. I'm also concerned that moving companies would mean having to make a lateral move and not a move up the corporate ladder. I'm curious if that is possible by staying put where I am or if I am drinking too much company kool-aid and should still look for other roles to take within the next 2-3 years?

The best roles aren’t publicly listed  
They’re *unlocked*

→ Through conversations  
→ Through showing your work  
→ Through becoming too valuable to ignore

I used to send out 50+ applications a week  
Polish my resume for hours  
Wait for replies that never came

Then I flipped it:

→ I started talking to people in industries I respected  
→ I posted what I was building even if it wasn’t perfect  
→ I asked better questions like: *Who already has my dream role, and how did they get there?*

Within months, I had more momentum than I’d had in years  
Not because I was louder because I was *realer*  
More focused  
More intentional  
More visible

Several people who have the same job role have either left the company or transferred to other locations, so the opportunity is absolutely there. Like I stated, it was also agreed upon amicably. 

I brought this up twice more and I’m still in the same situation. 

For my own sanity, I’ve got to cut and run, right? I’m so sick to my stomach over this since I absolutely love what I do, but I can’t even function day to day like a human.

1ke0uqx,Trapped in Advisory Firm Politics – Need Career Advice (Ex-Director),"Throwaway for anonymity. I need advice on navigating a toxic situation with my former employer (a global advisory firm) and my current role.  

I was a Director at a well-known advisory firm. Faced internal resistance from senior execs uncomfortable with my trajectory. Resigned 6 months ago to move to a new firm, but my old employer allegedly sabotaged my transition (via internal connections at the new place). New board members informally warned me that my ex-firm is blocking my growth here to force me back.  My mentors advise returning to the ex-firm, claiming other advisory firms will avoid me due to ""market conflict"" (i.e., fear of antagonizing my old firm).  

I *don’t* want to go back to a toxic environment. Feels like my ex-employer is gatekeeping the industry. Worried about long-term reputation if I resist.  

Has anyone faced retaliation like this from a former employer? How did you break free? Are non-compete/blacklist tactics this extreme in advisory? Alternative paths? (Industry roles? Startups? Independent consulting?) Should I push back legally (if they’re actively sabotaging)?  

Throwaway but will monitor replies. Grateful for any insights.  ",Cvhgf88,1,1.0,0,1746299974,2025-05-03 19:19:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ke0uqx/trapped_in_advisory_firm_politics_need_career/,5,2025
1ke0pel,"My elder brother has been unemployed for 3+ years, and it's hurting all of us — please give me advice.","https\[://\]postimg\[.\]cc/sM8M8Qx6

This is my big brother's resume, what advice should I give him. He is unemployed from last 3 year , do not have any internship experience

In 2023 he has done some mern course of 50k (Bangalore - vector india), did not even get the 15k+ job offer and then he done some other course from Hyderabad in last 1 year near about 1.5 lakh on the course or other fees

I know you will say his resume is poor, even worse than me. But how could i said to him did not get more confident to say something. me, mummy , papa are all worried about him if we pressurize him or say something might be he takes some unusual That's why we try to not say anything

My father is in Dubai, he said come as helper here (near 2000 aed) like papa intension is not like he will do the job as helper in electrical or some other profession he said to me like a lot of engineer come here as helper and after some time he get the good job what he has done in India but here also he is not agreeing for this.

Most of the time, he says things like: “**Mera dimaag kamzor hai**” or “**Mera dimaag chalta hi nahi hai**” (my brain doesn’t work / I’m mentally weak). And to be honest, this has become his excuse for everything.

We try not to pressure him too much because we’re scared he might take it negatively or do something to harm himself. He’s not lazy, but he lacks confidence, gets distracted easily, and has no clear direction or consistency. He doesn’t even apply to jobs regularly.

As his younger sibling, I’m doing my best. I was selected for GSoC in my 2nd year, and right now I’m also doing LFX at Some CNCF. I’m learning, building projects, improving my resume — but I still feel helpless when I see him stuck like this.

I just want to help him get his confidence and career back before it’s too late. I don’t know what to say or do anymore. If I talk too honestly, I fear it might hurt him. But staying silent also doesn’t help.

1kdyy08,"Torn Between High-Risk, High-Reward Job vs. Stable Government Role — Anyone Been in My Shoes?","Hi everyone,

I’m really torn right now between two job offers and was hoping to hear from anyone who’s faced something similar — especially those who’ve been down either path and can share whether they regret or recommend the choice they made.

Here’s my situation:

Current Job (Private Sector, Auto Finance Field Credit Analyst):
	•	$54k base salary + performance-based bonuses (if I perform well, I could realistically make ~$10-12k extra per month)
	•	Role covers multiple states (including fun locations like Alaska and Hawaii) — I love travel and flexibility
	•	BUT: the market is slow, competition inside the company is stiff, and I’m under pressure to hit big numbers in a tough environment
	•	Job stability is not guaranteed — I have a 4-month ramp-up period, and if I don’t hit production targets, I could be let go
	•	Lots of driving, which will wear down my car and add out-of-pocket costs

New Offer (State Government, Program Specialist at Attorney General’s Office):
	•	$74,700 salary + 5% extra + full pension vesting in 5 years, plus great health/vision/dental benefits
	•	Much more stable, mission-driven work (consumer protection, investigating unfair business practices)
	•	BUT: emotionally and mentally draining work, highly structured hours, hybrid in-office requirements, less room for big income jumps
	•	I’d need to pay for dog sitting ($1,000/month) and possibly parking ($300/month), cutting into take-home pay
	•	Potential long-term government career path or transition into other federal/state roles — but private sector jumps from here are less clear

Personal Context:
	•	I have about $60k in student loans + $20k credit card debt + $20k car loan + $15k personal loan — so, financially, I want to dig out of debt fast
	•	I’m 34 and feel I need to start showing career stability
	•	I love the idea of public service, but I also love travel, flexibility, and the chance to clear debt quickly

I’m tempted by the money potential in the private-sector job — but I’m scared of burning out or the market collapsing. On the other hand, the government role offers long-term security but less earning potential and more rigid structure.

Questions for those who’ve faced similar decisions:
	•	Did you choose a stable government role over a higher-paying but riskier private-sector job (or vice versa)? Do you regret your choice?
	•	How did you weigh immediate financial payoff vs. long-term stability?
	•	If you’ve worked in government, was it worth it for the pension/benefits, or did you feel stuck after a few years?
	•	If you’ve stayed in high-performance private roles, were the financial rewards worth the stress and uncertainty?

Any perspectives, stories, or advice would be deeply appreciated. I want to make sure I’m not just chasing shiny numbers or, on the flip side, locking myself into a stagnant role out of fear.

Thanks in advance!

1kdyq4f,"I am at the top of the range, so I don’t get a raise.  Top of the range hasn’t been adjusted upward in years, even to reflect COLA.  BUT…. those within the salary range are getting a raise.","First time posting here.  Not sure if there’s anything I can do, but I’d love to hear your advice.

I work in higher education.  I’ve been with my employer enough years that I am now outside the top of the salary range.  There are a number of other individuals in the same circumstance— is called being “red circled.” 

My employer has not adjusted the salary range, even for a cost-of-living increase, in a few years.  Last year, as is the case this year, those who have reached the top or are now above the instructor pay range will be given a less than 2% one-time stipend.  (We actually loose $ each year… and in has implications for our pension of course.). Those still within the salary range/band for a teaching will be given a 3% raise.  Union reps* (* see note below) have approached top leadership to address this, since we have skeleton rights as a union (no real power, just a courtesy discussion) but have been told “ too bad too sad” essentially.  Management has attempted to argue. 

The argument made is that we are in deficit.  This is simply untrue.  Unlike many educational, we have been in the green and have a substantial nest egg, think double digit millions.  Excess has been moved to capital budgets and elsewhere.  Leadership claims otherwise.  Non-instructional employees are being given raises.  Leadership salaries also continue to rise significantly, all while telling faculty that we are in the red and that raises cannot be afforded.  Other faculty benefits have gone away, but that’s for another time.

The money is important, but I am mostly disheartened by the message that is being sent by this action and I wonder if it’s even worth my while to speak with a member of leadership.  I work so very hard at not only my job, but also at continually educating myself to learn what our students will be using and experiencing in their careers.  I am a high performer, I am passionate and I know my methodology teaches students essential professional skills.  Yet…. The compensation structure says otherwise.

I’m struggling right now with whether to hold this inside for the next couple of years (I hope to retire within five)… and adjust how I do my work so that I am giving less to the college… due to this lack of recognition and frankly crappy treatment.  It’s what I know others have done (create courses that are easy to lead and grade, low rigor… take on part-time work to make more money) but my conscious tells me that it is a disservice to students to do this to them and unfair to the many employers that hire them.  My moral compass also nags at me to stay the course, make this my one full-time job, and be the best educator I can be.

I’d appreciate some advice and suggestions if you have any expertise or experienced to offer.  Thank you.

* our state lost union bargaining rights for educators in 2010, we maintain a union although it has a little to no power.  That may change, as the 2010 act is now being challenged but for now faculty is represented by the union.  I would describe our culture is largely fearful of leadership right now, due to some changes.  But I would guess that’s true of a lot of educational institutions at this point.

For the most part I enjoy my job and particularly the industry I work in as my knowledge of it helps me deliver solutions quickly due to having solved these problems before or being able to anticipate further requirements. 

I’ve been offered a role in something I would consider as industry adjacent - and not as exciting. But it’s 25k a year more which is obviously massive (the only orange flag is they indicated that this was hard to get, so I expect I will need to hit the ground running m). I’m leaning towards taking it and have my pros of staying where I am or taking it. 

Pros of taking it
- pay bump. 
- get to learn something new, can leverage some of my existing domain knowledge. 
- company seems more structured and less reactive. 


Pros of staying
- have built a really good internal brand, would need to do that again. 
- get to continue working on some exciting projects I’d ideally like to see out. 
- lack of structure can sometimes be a blessing and a curse.

1kdx2ri,Struggling to Start My Data Career: Seeking Direction After an Unrelated Role,"Hi, I'm a fresh grad in Computer Science (Data Science). Since Nov 2024, I’ve been actively looking for jobs in the data field, esp Data Analyst roles. It was super hard to get in as most of the job posts ask for experience, which I don’t have.

In the end, I accepted an offer as a Credit Risk Modeller under an apprentice program at a bank. I just joined last month, but so far I haven’t been given any tasks related to modelling. Most of the tasks are more operational, which I don’t really enjoy – not strategic or analytical like I expected.

Tbh, I don’t like the working environment either. Most of the time, my colleagues just sit in front of their PC not knowing what to do. Our PC also got no internet access, so we can’t even Google anything. The working life feels quite unhealthy too.

Now I’m not sure if I should stay and see how things go, or start applying again for data-related jobs. One of my concerns is, if I stay too long in a bank, it might be harder to switch to other industries later.

Also, I’m not sure if being a Credit Risk Modeller is better long-term compared to a Data Analyst. I saw ppl saying Data Analyst roles might get replaced by AI in the future (not sure if true).

I have 10+ years of experience, up to the Director level.

A recruiter has reached out to me about an absolutely entry level job in my field (it could just be a bot).

(Obviously an increase from the $0 I am currently making). It's 5 steps back in title, 0 years of experience required. 

I know beggars can't really be choosers, but this feels like absolute career suicide, and it would really just be enough money to scrape by.

1kdvn6j,Anxious Australian - Don't Know What to Do After Graduation,"This post is for all my Aussies out there, I really need some advice.

I'm nearing graduation as I'm in year 12 right now and I have literally got no clue what I want to do after graduation. 

I feel like I'm the only kid in my grade who doesn't know what they want to do after school and my school is going to be having meetings this term with each student to make sure they have it figured out. Mine is only 4 weeks away and I have given it no thought so far.

I really need some advice from those who have been in a similar situation.

After school, I desperately want to move out as I am from a dysfunctional family. My mental health is not in a good state right now, and my parents have actually agreed that me moving out might be best for everyone. 

I also don't want to go to university right away. I am good at academic work, but I've spent years living in the same routine and I want to move away from that for a while.

Here are the things I was considering:

**1. Taking up an apprenticeship & Getting a Trade** \- I am interested in Auto Electrical work but am open to working as a regular sparky too. 

The reason I don't think I can do this is because I am hearing conflicting opinions online about whether it's possible to live by yourself while working as an apprentice. Apprentice wages are notoriously known for being quite bad, so I don't think this is right for me either.

**2. Do a Diploma at TAFE or another provider** \- By this I mean do something like a Diploma of Building and Construction and try get a job afterwards. Though it takes 2 years to finish, it's still relatively fast especially considering the only other qualifications I could find that actually lead to paying careers are ones in women's beauty fields.

**3. Work A Retail Job** \- If I go down this route, I'd literally just be working at a supermarket or something for 1-2 years.

Literally any advice or thoughts from anyone in a similar situation or who has followed any of these paths would be greatly appreciated.

Last fall, I did a 6-month placement at a firm back in Austria. They've now offered me a full-time role starting this summer or fall.

**The Job in Austria**  
The role is in R&D—exactly what I want for my career—and the company was a great place to work. The environment was supportive, the projects were genuinely interesting, and there were nice perks (free lunch, company trips, etc.). The industry itself is super fascinating and has amazing opportunities for various different projects. They also have many subsidiaries, focusing on all kinds of projects. The company is also quite reputable, Forbes ranked them 3rd for the leading companies in this sector and they're still upping their headcount every year (8000+ and growing). But all their R&D is in Austria.  
They’re offering £40k+ (which is a lot more than what I'd expect as a grad in the UK—probably £30k max), and the manager has already talked about potential project management roles down the line, which I’m very interested in.

**Problem**  
The company is in a small, quiet town (about 20,000 people), and its over two hours from where I grew up (my family and some home-friends are still there). I found it pretty isolating during the placement at times.  
Also, doing long distance with my girlfriend (we’ve been together for 2 years and just moved in together in the UK, she's studying medicine and has to stay in the UK for at least another 3 years) was tough, and I missed the life I built here. I’ve been in the UK for 5 years now—it feels like home, and I’ve got a solid group of friends here.

**My Dilemma**  
Originally, I thought I’d just turn down any return offer and stay in the UK. But after talking to the manager again and hearing about the potential future projects (including international travel, continuation of the project I started during the placement and seeing it being delivered to customers, and great pay), I’m hesitating. It’s a genuinely amazing opportunity, and I don’t know if I’ll find something similar here anytime soon.

At the same time, I value my current life a lot. I swore I’d rather have a happy, balanced life even if it meant earning less, than burn myself out in some corporate grind. But now that a big decision is staring me in the face, I’m scared. I’ve already had 10-15 rejections from other UK companies, and the job market’s rough.

**What Friends Say**  
I’ve spoken to some close friends, and their reactions have been mixed—which honestly reflects how torn I am myself. Some say it’s an amazing offer and I should just go for it, no-brainer. Others reminded me how down I felt during those 6 months and basically asked if I’m being delusional even considering going back. And yeah, I did struggle at times—the town felt isolating, and being away from my girlfriend really took a toll. But was it really that bad? It was nice to be closer to my family and being able to see them on the weekends.

**Final Thoughts**  
Part of me wants to say no and stay in the UK, even if that means being unemployed for a bit and taking a risk. I worked a lot during uni (full-time summers, part-time during terms) so I could afford to take a few months off if needed. But the fear of turning down a “sure thing” is real. My dad keeps saying I should take the job in Austria and look for other roles while working there, but I am not sure I want that. I am also thinking of moving back to mainland Europe further down the line, I am just not sure I am ready to do that yet. I would want to spend a few more years in the UK.

Has anyone else faced a similar situation? What did you do—or what would you do in my shoes? I know it is impossible to answer this for me, but any life experience tips would be amazing 😊 How important is my first job from a career perspective? It's scary starting your career! 😱",helftsma,1,1.0,6,1746285608,2025-05-03 15:20:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kdve1i/i_got_the_job_i_wanted_in_a_place_i_dont_want_to/,5,2025

1kdv2r0,Career change,"I graduated college in 2022. After moving to a new city right after graduating I was absolutely broke and needed a job ASAP. I started working at Costco. I quickly worked my way up from a part time assistant to a full time supervisor. I was making 32.40 an hour which, by the way, is pretty dang good. It felt good. But after nearly 2.5 years there I started to feel the pressure of “not using my degree” and felt like some people looked down upon a retail career. 

So in December 2024, I applied and got a new job. I now work at a big university as a Buyer. The caveat? I took a pay cut. Like a $7 an hour pay cut. $25/hr. However, my required retirement contribution is 17.5%, and my employer matches me at 17.5%.

Yes, raises and more money will come with time and promotions. But it’s been hard adjusting to making significantly less money.

1kduqt6,Btech vs bca,"I’ve recently completed my schooling and am about to start college, but I’m seriously confused about which degree to pursue. Let me give you some background: I didn’t study much in high school due to mental health issues, so my academic foundation isn't very strong. Because of that, I’m unsure if I’ll be able to perform well in a B.Tech program.

That said, I’m genuinely ready to work hard now. Still, I have this lingering fear that I might quit or drop out midway, as I did before — I had to leave my coaching classes due to  backlog. So there’s a lot of uncertainty.

Can you guide me on what might be best for me? Will choosing BCA limit my growth in the future? I understand that B.Tech is generally preferred, but people say that skills matter more than the degree in the corporate world. So maybe it won’t make much of a difference?

1kdslc4,Need advice for my career about pursuing LAW please helppp,"It's a long ranting session ahead if u wanna skip u can .

Before I start with my story , here's my situation 
I (20) belong from a tier 2 city , conservative family, single child , parents are aged : dad 63 , mom 58 , both have health issues and are pretty controllable towards me (this actually plays a serious role in my life because every decision I've to take is from my parents permission) 


So , I'm in my last semester of graduation, in a week my final exams will be over , so we can consider that I've kind of completed my graduation (it'll be over sooner or later in a few days)
As of now I'm pursuing psychology, I took this because my parents kind of pressurized me back then saying ""naam ke liye koi bhi course krlo"" & ""jada pdhke kya hi krogi"" ("" do anything course just for the sake of studying""  ""what will u do after studying so much?"" ) and i made a promise to myself that in these 3 years I'll figure out something for my earnings and touchwood I was able to make enough money to cover my one year fees in a decent college.


During these years ,I've same across various incidents that made me really interested in law & regardless of the job or career opportunities I really wanna pursue law because of this knowledge that u inherit in this field ( it can be really helpful for u to have knowledge about ur country's law and judicial system when u live in a country like India)


I searched a few colleges and found a decent one but my parents were kinda off and doesn't actually wanted me to go far away from home to just get a degree.
So I searched again and found another decent college , that one is actually pretty affordable for me because it can actually cover the hostel and college tuition fee in the money that I've & it's also closer to my home town ( it takes only 2 hours to get there)

I can't spend another year at home being a single child , I know it might sound crazy or kind of a tantrum to some ppl but trust me it sucks being a single child in an Indian family (specially when u r a girl) so I decided not to waste my another year at home appearing for CLAT and I'll just try to clear the university entrance exam. And as I've already done my BA I'll just go for a 3 year LLB program



But regardless of the family situations and all , I kinda figured out that the money I made / will be making might not be enough to cover all the expenses for the 3 year college program or for my whole life because at this pace I'll be cooked ( for reference i made 60k in 3 years/ 59.3k to be precise)so I'll be needing a job/income source soon.



I made this money by doing small side hustles like reselling,thrifting , selling books , making logos , giving tuitions to children  But majority of my income actually came from graphic designing that I did on my laptop that actually held 4gb ram & 64gb storage but after this gpt thing came , i rushed in hurry and thought that I won't be making any money as a rookie in this field so I shifted to video editing, but only after learning it for 1 week my system couldn't hold it anymore and my lappy turned off automatically one day (my laptop is around 6-7years old hp laptop) & so I don't have enough money to buy another one , either I save it for my college or I buy a laptop and I'm going with paying my college fee first . 
so here I'm vision less and confused in this situation:(


I really wanted someone to help me out with my situation and give me some good career advice about this field , like as a youngster it'll take me an entire life to do practice in this field so I'm thinking of appearing for pcsJ exam as of now , but it would be really great if someone experienced will actually guide me to a certain path as I'm really confused right now.
Will this career give me a good money? Am I taking a right decision? Will I ever be able to escape this toxic family thing or not ????
Really seeking a good mentorship .


For anyone saying why can't I take money from my parents 1) financial reasons 2) if I ask them for money they'll taunt me every second of my life and eventually marry me off in middle of my studies saying ""ham hi tujhe padha rhe hain"" ( we are paying for your studies) so instead of relying on them i really wanna take responsibility of my own .



I apologise for any grammatical mistakes or my bad english, as it's not my first language.
Thanks for reading it till here.
Looking forward for help .
Have a good day y'all :)",canvas_ofthe_dread,0,0.5,0,1746277766,2025-05-03 13:09:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kdslc4/need_advice_for_my_career_about_pursuing_law/,5,2025
1kdsevg,Out of fields masters effect on job prospects?,"Hello all,

Will keep it short;

27M, currently working at a top level automotive factory as a mechanical engineer and am approaching 4 YOE. However I feel like the job becomes more and more just a means of earning money and gaining experience aspect fades away. This is definitely not what I want to do rest of my life and don't enjoy (but don't hate as well) my job. Want to ""challenge"" myself with an out of field masters, with studying  a masters in Philosophy of Science with leaving my job.

It is a domain in which I find myself quite competent and want to see academia options with a PhD or some sort of intellectualy pleasing job after this master.

In case this scenario doesn't work, I want to return to my original field and continue in working in the industry. Question: Will my masters be seen as out of touch for future jobs? I know there isn't a definitive answer to this, but opinions or concrete answers always help.

TLDR; Will an out of field masters in philosophy of science look bad for future engineering jobs with an already 4 YOE experience as an engineer?

1kdrzeu,Is this a step backwards or forwards?,"I have about 2.5 YOE rn, working in research currently but have always wanted to be in the Space industry. I don't like my job much. It's the golden handcuffs as they say, I'm just biding my time until I find the right opportunity but it's really been eating away at me, I feel like there's increasingly a target on my back. It's been a lifelong dream for me to work for NASA. I've been job hunting for about 1.5 yr now, thankfully I don't need a paycheck coming in and my strategy has changed several times. I now finally feel close to an offer. I'd finally get to fulfill that dream of mine to work on spacecraft.

Here's the problem - pay and work life balance. Currently I make 92, 93k. MCOL area. Moving to the Cape would be slightly more expensive, but roughly the same since no income tax. Even then, the hiring manager's expected offer range would only break me even salary wise, if not a pay cut (""high"" offer would be 97.5k, maybe). To add insult to injury, I'd have to go from 50% remote to 100% on site, with night shifts, weekends, holiday shifts, etc. I've been preparing myself to take this on and ""sacrifice for my dream"", but it's definitely a hard pill to swallow. You're supposed to get the *biggest* bumps when switching companies, but this market is absolute hell and I haven't been able to secure anything better thus far. I don't know when I would, should I reject this potential offer.

Apart from that, I'd be leaving everything I know behind. My family, my friends, my partner, all of it. For the first time in my life, I'd be really on my own, and for this specific opportunity it feels like I wouldn't be getting in return what I'm putting in, yknow? I've thought maybe I can tough it out for a year, then try to transfer to a more stable department or worst case, a new company.

So, my options are: 1) reject any possible offer from this space company, and maybe regret it later. Continue looking until I find something more suitable. 
Or 2) take the shit pay and schedule to do something I care about, making my life revolve around work a lot more for my ""dream job"". I never thought I'd be so conflicted about it, but here we are.

1kdqda6,"My Journey From Service Sector to FMCG - A Story of trust, growth & New beginning","Today, I want to take a moment to reflect on a journey that has shaped who I am—both professionally and personally.
With 5 years of experience behind me, I’m finally at a place where I can say  I’m proud of how far I’ve come.

When I began my career, I stepped into the world as a Sales Executive in the service sector. I didn’t know everything—but I had curiosity, drive, and a willingness to learn. Later, I moved into consulting, supporting businesses in the service space. I enjoyed the strategic side of it, but something was missing.

That “something” was practical, on-ground experience—the kind you can only gain by doing. I realized that to truly solve real problems, I needed to live them myself. That’s when I made a bold decision to move into the FMCG sector, and that’s how I landed as a Marketing Manager.

Here’s the honest truth -
When I joined, I had no practical experience in FMCG.
But I had something far more powerful—people who trusted me.

From day one, my owner and colleagues believed in me. They didn’t just hand me tasks—they gave me learning opportunities, they shared their experiences, and most importantly, they gave me trust. That trust helped me grow, make mistakes, ask questions, and build confidence in a completely new space.

That’s why I say this with full belief:
Trust can change your life.
It’s the invisible force that lifts people, shapes careers, and builds meaningful relationships.

Looking back, I realize I’ve been lucky—because many people along the way trusted me before I even trusted myself.
And now, I try to pay it forward every chance I get.

💬 I’m sharing this because I believe we all have stories like this—transformations we’ve gone through, lessons we’ve learned, and silent battles we’ve overcome.
Maybe you haven’t shared yours yet. But maybe it’s time.

Because your story might inspire someone.
Just like others inspired me.

So here I am—5 years in, still learning, still growing, and forever grateful for those who trusted me when I was just getting started.

👉 What’s your story?

1kdq4u9,"Offered a Higher Paying Job, but at the Cost of My Work-Life Balance — What Would You Do?","Currently in a corporate hybrid role making $67.5K/year with bonus. It’s a low-stress 8–5 job, 3 days in-office and 2 remote, located in a nice part of the city and only about 10 minutes from my girlfriend. The work is internal customer support/call center management — clean, steady, and predictable.

I’ve been offered a new role as an Air Freight Operations Manager paying $85.1K/year with bonus. It’s a significant raise (about $16K more), but comes with some major trade-offs: the hours are Tuesday–Saturday from 4PM–12AM, it’s a longer commute, and the job is expected to be higher stress.

I’m 26 and feeling really torn. The extra money is great, but I’m worried I’d be sacrificing all of my work-life balance.

1kdpubf,"Married manager 40M asked me 21F out for drinks and I went, and well.. I don’t know how to feel","To preface, I’m not bragging, but the simple truth is that I’m considered a good looking woman who’s in her early 20’s

I am a new starter at a tech company and in my first week I surprisingly got a call to my personal number from my manager asking if I wanted to go out for drinks, I accepted. Later I asked him if the other guy was also coming into office that day, and he said that he would ask him about it. Not sure if he initially intended it to be a one-on-one drinking session after work.

Next day comes around, I see him softening his gaze and smiling at me every once in a while after I would finish speaking. I also caught a quick glimpse of a note saying “invite new hire to social event outside of work” so I assumed it was entirely professional.

When the time came for drinks, he was pretty blunt and cold towards me, and I thought I must have done something wrong. My manager was on his phone pretty much the whole time. The drinks between the three of us got EXTREMELY awkward at some point and the other guy left, he put away his phone to talk to me. He definitely softened up, but it still felt pretty awkward. I felt like he didn’t actually want to be there, but I must have internalised, idk. He asked me if I wanted another drink and I said “no thanks, I need to sober up otherwise I’m going to cry in the office the next day”. He laughed and said “are you sure?” And I said “yes”. We left very soon afterwards, and we went our separate ways.

The next day, he chose to sit away from us despite sitting close to us prior, and him emphasising that I should sit close to him for now as I’m being onboarded.

I don’t know if he thinks I’m interested in him, or if he suddenly remembered that he has a wife and kid at home.

I’m not going to lie, this has been driving me nuts because I really want to do well in this new role, but I can’t help but feel paranoid because of my many past experiences being pursued relentlessly by male coworkers.

I’d like to receive advice and figure out whether it was weird or not, just for my peace of mind.

1kdnxeq,Want some realistic advice,"About 9 years ago, I finished an associate's degree in math at my local community college. I took Calc I–III, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra. I transferred to a selective, somewhat prestigious 4-year school to major in math—and totally flunked out. A big part of it was being unprepared for the jump in rigor. I remember sitting in abstract algebra and complex analysis classes having absolutely no idea what was going on.

At community college, I kind of coasted by on intuition and last-minute cramming, often turning things in late. Looking back, I don’t think the courses were all that rigorous either. On top of that, while in university, I partied a lot, played too many video games, and ended up finally with a transcript full of F’s before I left and went back home.

A few years ago, I started tutoring calculus and that got me back into taking classes. I recently completed another associate’s, this time in computer science, and I’ve been accepted to another 4-year school (almost as selective as the first). I’m planning to double major in math and CS, but I’m hesitant. I’ve been self-studying math over the years, but when I was tutoring, it became clear how rusty I was, especially with Calc II/III topics like the washer method and moments. I’ve forgotten most of Diff Eq and Linear Algebra too, and honestly, I never had a solid foundation in them to begin with.

The good news is the new school allows me to take a semester off before starting. If I use that time plus the summer, I’d have about 7 months to self-study and brush up. My main question: is 7 months realistic for reviewing Calc I–III, Diff Eq, and Linear Algebra? I remember bits and pieces, but I definitely don’t feel solid, especially with Diff Eq.

Alternatively, should I just stick to CS? I do love math and would like to keep the door open to teaching it someday, maybe at a community college. I'm fairly sharp at coding and data structures right now, but I’d love to be strong in both areas. I’ve been working fast food jobs for years (no offense to anyone doing that—it just sucks most of the time), and I really don't want to go back to that. A degree feels essential to doing something I enjoy, even if it’s not what I envision in my head exactly. Even I don't teach or work as a developer, I have to hope a degree would give me some better options. Plus, I plan on trying to pursue a master's in CS (either accelerated at the university I got accepted in or an online program like GA Tech's OSMCS program).

1kdns7m,Thinking about becoming a recruiter — not sure if it's a good idea,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been trying to build an AI tool for a while now. I’ve experimented with a few ideas, but it’s been tough to get real traction. Lately, I’ve been thinking maybe I should stop trying to build a big product and instead focus on a simple service business. something I can start small, but use AI to make myself more efficient.

Recruiting came to mind. I like the idea of helping people find jobs and helping companies find good people. But instead of doing it the usual way, I was thinking I could build a small pool of pre-screened candidates first, using AI sourcing tools and mock interviews/assessment tool, and then offer that to companies who are hiring. (I have done growth before so I believe I will be good at outreach on both ends)

The thing is, I’ve seen a lot of recruiters posting about how hard things are right now. And I don’t want to jump into something that’s already super competitive or frustrating unless there’s still a real opportunity to do it differently.

Would love any honest advice. Is recruiting something worth getting into right now? Or should I be looking elsewhere?

Thanks for reading.

1kdmsnc,Should I take job offer or stay in current role? Advice needed.,"I just received a job offer for a Grant Manager position at a major university and I’m struggling to decide whether to accept. I’d love some outside perspectives.

Grant Manager

- Would be managing the full lifecycle of **50 research proposals/month** across **60 faculty members**
- In-office 3–4 days/week with a 3 hour daily commute (1.5 each way)
- Pay is roughly the same** as my current role, but with commuting, it would likely be a decrease in real terms
- Much more demanding workload, but potentially strong for career development
- Could offer better job security and resume value in the long-run

Operations Manager - current role (same university) 

- highly flexible and 100% remote, I often travel home to spend a few weeks with my family working remotely.
- There is **some growth potential** if a strategic project (moving our recharge center) goes through
- However, due to recent political changes (Trump's executive orders), **my position may only be secure until Dec 2025**
- Internal job mobility has slowed — many recruitments are getting canceled

Considerations:

* The **job market is rough** right now, especially in higher ed/admin
* I value flexibility and work-life balance, but I’m also concerned about long-term security
* I’m not sure if I should wait it out or take the ""bird in the hand""

Has anyone faced a similar choice? Would you trade flexibility and a lighter load for stability and a more demanding role during a tough job market? How do you weigh long-term career prospects vs. short-term quality of life?

Feeling real stuck between a rock and a hard place. Any advice is welcome.

It came to the point where I'm considering moving abroad (a small developing country) for a job, because I need relevant experience to get through the door. I do get interviews here and there, but all I get is a no. One recruiter gave me a call back to say I was a good candidate, but they were looking for someone with more experience.  My field is in data analytics. I worked in a marketing/admin job prior, and have a 4-month data science internship. My only concern is whether the job abroad will be applicable here. I'm thinking of working for a year or two and coming back to the US. I've heard different opinions, such as that an experience is an experience whether it's here or somewhere else, or some say that anything from a small country will mean nothing here.

1kdm2tz,Built an EdTech Platform Using Hiring Data & BI Insights — Looking for Feedback!,"Hey everyone,
I wanted to share a bit about my journey building a new EdTech startup, focused not just on teaching skills but ensuring those skills actually translate into real jobs.

The Problem We Tackled:
The biggest challenge in today’s skill market is relevance. Are we teaching what companies are actually hiring for?

Our Approach:
We reached out to multiple companies and collected their yearly hiring calendars. Based on that data, we designed our curriculum to align directly with industry demand.

But we didn’t stop there. One more major issue: who delivers the training?
Many EdTechs use full-time trainers with little-to-no real-world experience. We did the opposite — we brought in working professionals from top firms like JP Morgan, Bharat Benz, HUL, Morgan Stanley, and Volvo Eicher to train our students.

What We’ve Built:
A custom job portal where students apply to curated job opportunities.
A feedback-driven placement process: Every rejection is followed by detailed feedback and tailored training.
Partnerships and references from companies like Accenture, Oracle, Cognizant, Daimler, and more.
Our Progress So Far:
Hundreds of students placed in non-IT roles through reference openings.
In IT, our first batch (6 students) had 100% placement, and the second batch of 20 has seen 10 placed so far. We're retraining the remaining 10 with additional mentorship — at no extra cost, because we’re committed to every eligible student’s success.
Placement Process (Simplified):
Students apply via our portal and get an application number.
If rejected at any stage (HR, tech round, etc.), we gather detailed company feedback.
We hold a 1:1 class or group session to work on the issues, before moving forward to the next opportunity.

1kdlrdk,no idea what to do,"I am a dancer, and it is a huge part of me. I’ve dedicated the majority of my adult life to training and got my degree in dance. I have a neurological wiring disability that is severe when unmanaged, but through a happy accident realized that consistent (4-5 classes a week, minimum) dance really helps keep my symptoms at a baseline that I can manage. Before that I was borderline nonfunctional, at times struggled to walk, etc. But due to the financial state of things in the US, supporting myself feels impossible. I am lucky enough to have been largely rehabilitated by working my whole life around dance and have found myself working with a dance company. Overall I work 12 hour days most of the time and almost never have a day off, between my company responsibilities and my other various jobs I need to stay afloat. I struggled for a long time with a sense of self, especially when my physical health was bad, and dedication to dance in this way has given me more than I could ever hope to have. I’m just so burnt out on how much I’m working just to have no money. 

I cannot imagine myself without dance and have been working professionally in the arts since I was 11; it feels impossible to step away, but at the same time, I don’t think I can do this forever. I want to start carving out a career path for myself that provides some more stability financially and scheduling wise. 

I’ve been thinking about getting my MLIS and becoming a school librarian, but I’m not sure. I guess i’m just scared that I’ll be super into it for a year or two but then get bored and want to tap out. I’m worried I’ll never feel half as passionate about something as I do dance, and I know that you don’t need to be passionate about a day job, but I have a hard time feeling neutral about anything; i either love it or super dislike it. I can’t imagine myself doing something that doesn’t excite me at a baseline level. I guess I’m not sure what to do. There are some other careers I think I’d actually be good at, but the amount of school required would take so long that it feels daunting. I’m also nervous to experience a backslide in my symptoms and functionality. I guess I don’t know what I’m looking for, beyond some advice, and maybe some encouragement from others who have made a move after professional dance/performing arts.

1kdjrmg,Your career won’t “make sense” until you stop trying to get it perfect,"I wasted years chasing clarity.  
Trying to map out the perfect path before I took the first step.  
Thinking if I just researched enough, I’d *feel* ready.

Spoiler: I never did.

What actually changed things?

Choosing something that was *good enough*  
Committing to it like it mattered  
And letting momentum build the clarity I kept waiting for

Here’s what I learned:

→ You don’t find passion—you build it  
→ Direction matters more than “fit”  
→ The faster you try, the faster you learn what you *don’t* want  
→ Confidence comes from evidence, not thought loops

Your resume doesn’t need to be perfect.  
Your path doesn’t need to look clean.  
You just need to move.

And yeah—it might not be the dream job.  
But it might be the thing that unlocks the next level.

If you’re stuck in “figuring it out” mode, ask yourself:  
*What would I pick if I wasn’t trying to impress anyone?*

1kdjec6,Looking for ideas to transition out of video game art,"Hello! 
So as the title says, I'm not really sure if I should continue doing what I'm doing with my life.
So I live in Australia and work in game dev industry which I always dreamed of since I was a kid an now as I approach 30, I'm not sure if I should continue doing it. Im a concept artist, I visualise ideas to pass further in production. It's a fun and intellectually challenging career, but as you probably guessed, the issue is pay. After 4 years here I make like 73k AUD. I've tried to push it at work, tried to take more responsibilities, mentoring others, learning more stuff in my spare time, yada yada, but that's it what I've got. I might potentially reach to 80-90 range in next few years as I don't have a title of a 'senior' yet, or theoretically to 100-120 if I manage to get into art direction, but that might be far away. But our company recently had a rou d of layoffs so I'm not sure if I'll survive another few years and the market looks pretry bleak for my roles, especially in Aus.
Even though I'm passionate and like what I'm doing, the people and management both are great to work with, my financial prospects seem to be pretty bleak. I have a mortgage on a 2b ""townhouse"". The place itself is alright, but nowhere near enough as I want to have a family. Currently living with a partner so expenses are manageable. I also have an immigrant mother who helped me with deposit for this place, but she has no super, very low income and like 10 years till retirement age, so ideally I would like to put some money to principal of my current place, refinance it and let my mom live there for a small rent, and me and my partner will get something bigger. I also have a Masters in Architecture, but I never worked in that field and from what my partner, who is an architect tells me, the money and work life balance is shit there. So I don't want to go that path.
Another thing that concerns me is stability of my job. Currently the project I'm on is relatively fine, but in case I lose my job, I might take long months till I'll find something else. I see people with way more experience than me on Linkedin with open to work badges for 6+ months. It's depressing.
With my savings, I think I can take a break for a year or few and study something more lucrative and work part time somewhere in a cafe to keep savings from drying out too fast, but I have no idea what should I study.  I'm quite good with both 3D and 2D art and my job involves a lot of research, thinking and documentation. I've also know just a tiny bit of Python and quite enjoyed it when I worked on my small personal projects but that's it. Would love to do something with computers maybe, but people are also alright. Ideally it should be something I could learn in a relatively short time, like a year or two max. So a bootcamp would be great. I've been thinking about a lot of things, from something relative to what I'm doing like UI/UX or front end (but I've heard there's crisis in those industries too) and art teaching (it feels like a low pay field too) to software engineering (though I'm not sure about studying for another 4 years) to something completely unrelated like ""fuck it I'll go fifo in mines/trucking/abandon society and go live in a monastery"" when I get too depressed about my life. Sorry I'm just lost.
Anyway, I'm keen to hear thoughts and suggestions of people who might've had similar experiences. What did you chose, how it turned out and what advice would you give me in my situation?
Thanks!",glyph18863,2,1.0,1,1746242399,2025-05-03 03:19:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kdjec6/looking_for_ideas_to_transition_out_of_video_game/,5,2025

1kdg86m,Being asked to sign a 5 year ROS with no additional compensation or benefits offered,"So I’m being a little vague here, but I’m in a pretty unique situation.

I work in a specialized technical role at a government job. A few years ago, one of the departments at my organization had their technical specialist go off on long-term sick leave. His role is extremely niche and highly specialized — not something you can just train someone on overnight. They panicked and asked if someone from our department could temporarily step in while they hired a replacement.

I ended up taking on the role. No interim hire ever came, so I covered his responsibilities for three years and got really good at the job.

Now, the original guy is officially quitting. The department has come back to me and asked if I’ll take over the position permanently. But there’s a catch: to do the job officially, I need to attend a very expensive certification course in Europe (around $50,000). Because of that, they want me to sign a 5-year return-of-service agreement, which means I’ll owe a pro rated amount of that money back to the employer if I ever leave my job.

Here’s the kicker:
They’re offering no additional pay, benefits, title change, or incentive for this. Just the ""prestige"" of working on this highly specialized equipment. I straight-up told them there’s no way I’m signing that. They’re now scrambling and begging me to reconsider — because, realistically, there’s no one within 1,000 miles who could walk in and do this job. The learning curve is brutal, and I already know the system inside and out.

This is the first time in my life I’ve realized I have serious leverage — but I’m in a unionized, public-sector position, so negotiating benefits isn’t really straight forward.

1kdfrsi,Should I take this job?,"I'm a Planner for a large construction company. 

Currently on €38k a year, got offered €45k and asked them to bring that up to €48k. A lot has changed in the year, I'm now running the day-to-day of the largest job in our region since the senior guy left.

Also not very happy with it in many regards. I'm working insane hours 55 sometimes 60+ a week.  
Guy working under me is making my job a lot harder, but was hired by a Director so they're hesitant to get rid of him.   
They got rid of graduate off my title early which was a big deal.  
My boss is nice, and there's plenty of promises, saying that I'll make senior in 3 years vs 5 etc..   
But there's a new senior guy starting and I realised that yes he'll free up some time (which will inevitably be filled with something else), but he won't fix the problem of late nights and weekends (insane weekly reporting deadline, lack of useable schedules - meaning it's a time sink).

A recruiter reached out and I interviewed for a similar role in mainland Europe.  
It's a 17-4 rotation (there for 17 days, fly home for 4) - working 5 and a half days a week when there.  
It's significantly better money, and free shared accommodation.

52k a year + a €16.5k allowance (company pay tax on that), shared car, accommodation and they pay for flights. Job is in a crappy part of Belgium.  
I'd probably have a lot of responsibility there too and I'm a little anxious because frankly I thought the interview went horribly.   
They wanted key metrics and actuals on my current job - stuff I didn't have to hand, and I basically said to the director 'if I thought that was pertinent then I would have had it to hand'.. also my phone overheated! So the call dropped.  
The recruiter basically lied saying it would be a brief 20 minute conversation, it was an hour long deep dive into my processes, current role, P6 knowledge and how I built our tracker... Almost stopped it early to save them the time, but at the same time I held my own..  
I'd just be worried that I've oversold myself a little bit and that I'd come up short when put to it over there...

But it's better money and frankly I could really do with a change.

1kdf56o,(Update) Got Fired from a Company I worked at for 6 Years,"I originally posted about 3 months ago:
https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/s/NOtc3YheVM 

Update:
The feedback from the comments section was to begin applying immediately, and I did. After 3 months of applying and interviewing I got a job offer for that place and it seems pretty decent. I’ll be starting as a contract hire with the expectation of becoming a FTE after 6 months. 

What I learned from all this:
1) Every company has a bad side, find the one that has the least bad in your eyes and doesn’t make you miserable to think about working for. 

2) LinkedIn recruiters will actually put in work because they want you to get hired too, don’t totally write off the people in your inbox if they represent a staffing company. 

3) Let yourself feel your emotions after getting fired, I tried to numb them with substances but it made my life and all my relationships worse off because emotional repression creates tension. 

4) Apparently it’s best practice to save a digital copy of every W2 you’ve ever had because it’s on YOU to prove your work history in background checks. My old company was contacted to verify my employment history and chose not to do so, so I had to prove it myself. 

5) If you ever get put on a PIP, never believe them when they say “it’s not a death sentence,” because it is. They’re saying “we don’t like you the way you are now and are telling you to drastically change yourself or you’re fired.” Just start applying to new places immediately. 

I appreciate all the feedback from last time, it was helpful to get my ass in gear. So thank you everyone.

1kde3vt,"I have a high-paying, low stress job at a great company but no growth opportunities or intellectual challenge. When is it time to leave?","Hi everyone, Im in a bit of a crossroads in my professional career and would be great to get some advice from people who have more life/work experience. I have been at what i thought would be my ""dream job"" for 3 years but I am pretty miserable. Im not sure if the problem is work in general or something specific to my job, as this is my first job out of graduate school. I work at a large company that is considered one of the best in the field, the work I do is pretty niche and requires an advanced degree. The position I am currently in did not exist at my company before me, therefore, its been a learn as you go experience for both myself and my two managers. I am very fortunate to actually love the projects I am assigned and the work I do, however, the major issue is that both of my managers are incredibly busy and have very limited bandwidth. As a result I am often not given much work to do, and when I do I will receive zero feedback on my work. I have very little facetime with my managers (increasingly less as time as gone on), which has resulted in zero mentorship, guidance on my work, or really any sort of professional support or growth opportunities. Additionally, because of the organizational structure of my job I have really limited exposure to other individuals and often feel very lonely and isolated and stifled in terms of growth opportunities. I was a very ambitious and driven person prior to starting this job, but have found that as time has gone on I feel like ive lost my spark and feel really stuck. I always envisioned myself in a high impact job, and while my job might seem like that on the surface, I feel incredibly underutilized in my current role and like I am gaining work experience on paper but have not really developed any skillset because of lack of mentorship or 1:1 time with my managers. For example, I will meet with the one manager i work more closely with maybe once every 3 weeks for about 5-10 min to touch base. There are periods of time where I have projects I am assigned and I feel pretty fulfilled during those periods, however because my manager rarely reads or gives feedback on the work it is hard to feel like im growing. I really try to fill my days learning new things and keeping up with trends in the field I am in, but I truly feel the best way to Iearn is to do actual concrete projects with a clear deliverable. I also want to discuss work with others and feel part of a team, and because there is no one else (other than my managers) with my background it is hard to find other colleagues to work with. I have floated the idea to my manager of working with a broader group of people rather than just him and my other manager, however he said that ""he selfishly wants me to work only for him and that doing that would cause me to miss out on mentorship from him.""

Now onto whats keeping me at this job.

1. Great company with fantastic reputation and access to great resources
2. The pay, my pay is incredibly high and increases quite a bit every year. I am making more than I ever thought I would. Also, because of the low volume of work, there is really little stress. I acknowledge that I am incredibly privileged to be in this position, and in a job people would kill to have. However, as someone who has always been driven and loves to actually work, being idle a lot of the time is killing me inside and driving me crazy. I am also so afraid of staying here for a few years and being incapable of doing anything at my next job. The older I get, the more people will expect of me in my next job.
3. Fear. Fear of change. Fear of moving. I most likely will have to move to a new city if I leave my current job. I have been in this city for several years and have a solid group of friends and my life here. I love the city I am in. I am afraid that I will find a new job and be so overworked and stressed and be filled with immense regret for leaving. This is my first corporate job as I went straight from undergrad to grad school and I really dont know if ill be happier at my next job and if what I am experiencing at this job is normal and will happen at my next job.

If anyone has any advice or insight on what do that would be greatly appreciated!",AliveSwordfish4430,16,0.8100000023841858,49,1746225941,2025-05-02 22:45:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kde3vt/i_have_a_highpaying_low_stress_job_at_a_great/,5,2025
1kddxjr,Question about entertainment internships,"I'm a college student looking to go into film/entertainment, and I recently received internship offers from several different small entertainment companies, which I'm really grateful for. All of these internships are unpaid and part-time, and I've already committed to one, but I'm wondering if it's acceptable/common to take on multiple internships at once in the entertainment industry, especially with these being unpaid and part-time. I know that for some industries this is a big no-no and for others it's more acceptable. If it is acceptable, how should I approach talking to the companies about multiple offers? I do think it would be best to be transparent with all parties if it comes down to that. If not, what factors should I consider in terms of choosing one, and is it acceptable to renege my current offer if another one is better?

1kddt7s,Data analyst with full-stack bootcamp experience but limited Python/SQL?,"I’ve been a data analyst for 3 years, working on an automotive client at an agency. My work revolves around:
- __Adobe Analytics__: reporting, analysis, segment logic creation for data capture
- __Adobe Target__: A/B and multivariate testing
- __Adobe Launch__: tag management
- __QA processes__
    - Correct tagging structure
    - Proper scripts imbedded
    - Data flowing into Adobe Analytics
- Cypress automation that we shutdown
- stakeholder reporting

I have a B.Sc. in Statistics and previously completed the Google Data Analytics certificate and several DataCamp courses.

On the dev side, I completed a full-stack software engineering bootcamp where I built projects using tools like React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, TypeScript, Docker, and a bit of AWS. 

The open-source projects I’ve created include:
1. Wealth management dashboard: tracking transactions, savings, and budgets
2. Etherium tracker: dashboard tracking real wallet transactions and balance against the market
3. Chrome devtool displaying component hierarchy to identify bottlenecks 

That said—I don’t currently use Python, SQL, or R extensively in my day-to-day role. I’m starting to change that: I just kicked off a project at work using Python and SQL to streamline our reporting workflow, and I’m refreshing my foundational knowledge through DataCamp and LinkedIn Learning.

I’m curious how I can market this hybrid path and position myself as a strong data analyst in a way that’s attractive to data science or analytics roles when my professional experience is heavy in digital analytics—but I have a full-stack bootcamp and personal projects that are heavy on the dev side?

Would employers value my bootcamp experience even if I haven’t used those tools professionally (yet)? And how can I frame this transition in interviews?

Any advice would be hugely appreciated. Thanks in advance!",Elubi88,1,1.0,0,1746225120,2025-05-02 22:32:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kddt7s/data_analyst_with_fullstack_bootcamp_experience/,5,2025

Finance: 
Can spend 20s in a job building wealth through investments (around 8 more years of work then medicine)

1kdchpl,How to make the interviewer feel that you are not boring?,"I don't know how to accurately express this question. The competition in the job market is too great. I have a friend who is an HR intern. He said that he has to read more than 100 resumes every day, send test links, and then send interview invitations based on the results.

However, many interviewers in many companies are interviewing almost every day. One of my previous interviewers said that the company received more than 100 resumes in one day for a position that only recruited two people. Only a dozen people finally entered the interview stage.

""I have to interview more than a dozen candidates a week. What do you think are your characteristics that can stand out?""

This question completely stumped me... I can neither see the level of other candidates nor understand what the interviewer likes in a short time.

There's a series of cars moving on an assembly line being built. A test engineer and a quality engineer inspect each vehicle together. When brakes are ready to be added to the vehicle the rules for a process say the quality engineer must pull off a tag that's on the car. The tag is a simple tag that someone just has to remove with scissors. So, it takes like 1 second. One time the test engineer pulled off the tag on the car and told the quality engineer ""is it ok if I pull these off and then notify you since we're standing side by side""?. My senior coworker basically freaked out at that idea and said that's a big deal and should never happen. She says always ensure the quality engineer removes the tag.

1kdav3k,How likely am I to get work as a hairdresser if I hate small talk/I’m generally quiet? Be honest.,"I’ve been cutting my own hair since I was a young teen, and started trimming my family and friends’ hair when we were all stuck inside during Covid. I have a job right now, but I really hate it. I’ve always hated customer service, because I’m an introvert with clinical social anxiety, but I needed to take whatever work I could get. I’m handling it for now, but I can’t for much longer. 

I’ve been doing my best to teach myself different cuts and techniques, mainly because I like trying out a lot of different styles. I was thinking, since I have an interest in it and a bit of experience, beauty school might be worth it. But, it’s pretty much the norm for hairstyles to have long conversations the whole time they’re cutting your hair. I couldn’t stand that. I could force myself to do it, but I’d be at least as miserable at work as I am now. I’d have to quit after just a couple years.

I would REALLY enjoy every other aspect. And I’m polite, patient, and professional with customers. It’s just, no offense, making small talk with strangers for more than a few minutes really makes me feel like I’m dying inside 💀

1kda57i,I was honest about my lack of financial skills in an interview and it’s killing me,"I’m in consulting, want to break into VC. I recently got a reply from a fund I’d applied to (with one of my worst cover letters so that’s a surprise). My interview was today and I don’t have anyone to talk about this with so I’m freaking out here. 

I started off great - good intro, good pitch for “why VC”. Then, he said everything looks great and he likes my confidence. Also told me the role will require financial skills such as reading a balance sheet and conducting due diligence and would I be able to do that? Have I done that before?

I don’t know what happened. I said a very verbose answer which was essentially just “No, not in the traditional sense (what does this even mean???). I have built some financial models and cost baselines at my current role but I’m willing to learn and don’t think itll be a handicap” 

His response was “Thanks for being so honest with me.” That was it. I froze after that. He went on to say that he’s currently looking through 700 applications and he wants me to think if this is something I’m sure I want to do (finance) because if so, he won’t mind passing on my name to the next interviewer. This sounds like a soft rejection right? You don’t want to reject someone to their face so you’re soft launching the idea of so many applicants and giving a chance to rethink?

In the call itself I said yes absolutely I wanna give this a shot, and he had mentioned I can text him as well (which is where he reached out to me first) so I sent another text a few hours later reiterating that I think I could do a great job of hitting the ground running with a relevant example of why I think so. 

He just liked the message. I’m dying. This is eating me up. I didn’t even ask him any questions at the end of the interview because I was so thrown off by what happened just before. 

I don’t want to keep messing interviews up. What should my strategy be? Should I pretend I know these skills? Should I take a course (CFA1?)? Should I be honest but use more diplomatic words??? I’m so frustrated of feeling like I could’ve done better (and it’s always in a different way than the last) after interviews.

1kd94xj,Stuck between two life changing job offers,"I'm in my 30s, and I currently live with my partner in California and have been unemployed for almost 7 months. It has been defeating and depressing to say the least. My unemployment is out and I am running out of savings very quickly. After over 1,000 applications, I was offered two different job offers in the same week, and I'm completely torn.

**The First Job -** 

* 6 figure salary in a Marketing position in California.
* 15 days of annual PTO
* 6 days sick time
* Some 401k matching, health insurance, the basic stuff

This is an industry that I've wanted to get in for a long time and could open doors to many future jobs, even at other companies. But, there were a lot of red flags during the interview process from managers about the level of stress they have. And I'm concerned about how some of the employees are talking negatively about other employees to me already. My last job was so traumatic and toxic that I am extra cautious.

The job *could* be affected by the tariffs eventually since their products are made overseas and many of their products would not be seen as a need in a recession. But when it comes to job security, it's hard to say what job is really secure with how chaotic and expensive everything is now.

My rent in California is cheaper than most at around $700. I have a great place to live with lots of room and I deeply love my partner. We've been through so much together, but she has made it very clear that she wants to stay in this apartment for at least ten more years. Her reasons are valid. There's also tons of opportunity to enjoy any hobby, creative aspiration, or interest you could imagine.

However, I do not love living here. I hate the traffic. It takes months to see friends because everyone is so busy trying to make ends meet. I don't have a solid friend group, and it's so difficult to see people. I am in a creative industry as a hobby that i've wanted to explore more, and that would be far easier here than anywhere else.

**The Second Job -** 

* $10k less than the other job in a Marketing position in a different state
* 21 days of annual PTO
* 21 days annual sick leave
* Full pension (if I stay)
* Union with guaranteed raises every year
* A very hefty relocation bonus

This is not an industry I am that passionate about, but I like the work. It's a state that doesn't have a lot of other opportunities, so if something goes wrong with this position, chances are I will have to move elsewhere. ZERO red flags in the interview process and the team seemed really kind, knowledgeable, and a little more laid back than the other position.

It's a union job partially funded by the state. There are probationary periods, so I'm not sure the job is any more stable than the other. However, as it is service and not product based, tariffs wouldn't be an issue.

My rent would most likely go up eventually, by about $500-1000 for less room. My partner and I would break up.

However, I LOVE this state. It is a place I have been before and been on the lookout for opportunities for over ten years. There's so much more nature. I have tons of friends there that I have seen frequently when I visited. In the back of my mind, I had always dreamed of making a life here, but dreams are dreams and life is life. I don't expect my dream to be reality completely because every place has challenges.

**The Third Option -** Stay with my partner. Take the California job and keep looking. This is the least ideal option because I have been more depressed than I have ever been. Before the job offers, I had a deep conversation with my partner about how I don't feel like me anymore. That I feel dead and whoever I was is just gone. I've lost who I am, and it's not just job related. I also have a heart condition due to covid-era stuff that has kept me in the hospital a lot.

**Overall -** We discussed long distance while I trial run this position. It really wouldn't work. Neither position is ""the best"" option because there are so may cons of both.

I've tried working through this by making a list of my values and needs and weighing the answers by priosity. The Healthcare in California is much better, but not by much, so that isn't a concern. Everything is split down the middle. 

I love my partner so much, and I feel like everything hinges on this relationship.

1kd7z05,Disappointed with new job,"I just started at a new company.  I've been here less than 2 weeks and my manager put a meeting on my calendar today. Her feedback was that I need to be able to do multiple things at the same time. 

Her example was that if I cannot answer email,  text messages, and do other work while participating in meetings, that I would be unsuccessful. 

I have a real problem with this. 

1. I think it's rude to not give someone my full attention during a meeting, 


2. If my presence isn't necessary, then I shouldn't be there at all, 


3. Micromanaging (IMO) is a great way to make a lot of mistakes, and isn't as efficient as it feels, 


4. I'm already working 10 hour days, which seems to go unnoticed. 

I'm so disappointed. I really like the company but I'm not sure how I can meet these expectations. 

I'm usually the star performer where I work. And that has been consistent in all my jobs for the last 35 years. This just came out of left field. 

I'm going to start looking again but appreciate any other feedback.

1kd7w26,Competing with potential candidate not qualified for the position. WWYD?,"I have worked for this non-profit organization for the last 5 years in the business office, starting as an entry level accountant and climbing into a senior role. When I started, the organization had received some federal funding and had no processes or controls in place, which is one of the things that I was able to create and develop. I have helped this organization become compliant and have received additional funding thanks to my efforts.

The position for finance director got recently vacated and is available. I applied to this position, being the most senior person on the team with knowledge of  how the department works, the team, the department's weak points and how to improve some processes. I was told there were 3 candidates, 2 internal and one external.

Before applying for the position I actually was part of the interview committee and received the information of the internal candidate, which turn to be a co-worker from another department not related to the business office. After reviewing the resume, there was no experience working with accounting, finance or non-profit organizations.

I got word from the other people in the committee, that well all made it to the final round of interviews. Regarding this person's performance, they told me that the performance had much to be desired and pretty much bombed their interview, was not able to respond to some accounting and finance questions and made nonsense statements.

I don't know what to do if this person, which clearly does not have the qualifications to be in this position, ends up becoming the finance director.

1kd7qlr,( 20F ) Confused Indian Student from Commerce Background Aiming for MS in CS Abroad – Need Honest Advice!!,"Hey everyone,
I'm currently facing a lot of confusion regarding my academic path, and even after using tools like ChatGPT and doing tons of research, I haven't found a clear or satisfying answer.

I'm an Indian student who completed 11th and 12th under the CBSE board with the Commerce stream (with Computer Science as an elective). At the time, I was genuinely interested in financial markets, which is why I chose commerce. However, over time, that interest faded—and now, I find myself deeply interested in technology and computer science.

The problem? I want to pursue a B.Tech in CSE, but due to my commerce background, I'm not eligible. My ultimate goal is to pursue a Master of Science in Computer Science (MS in CS) from abroad—preferably from a top university. But I know I need a strong academic foundation in math and science for that.

Here’s the plan I’ve come up with:

Pursue a BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) + a Diploma in Computer Engineering simultaneously to gain both theoretical and technical skills.

Privately appear for Cambridge A Levels with Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science to strengthen my science background and fulfill prerequisites for MS CS abroad.


I’m hoping this will build a strong enough academic profile to later apply for MS in CS at international universities (US, Canada, UK, etc.).

Now my questions:

1. Is this a practical and effective approach considering my commerce background?


2. Will A Levels (Math, Physics, CS) help compensate for my lack of science in 12th grade?


3. Is there a better or more recognized pathway for someone like me to switch to CS and eventually pursue a Master's abroad?


4. Are there universities abroad that accept non-engineering undergrad students for MS in CS, especially with BCA + A Levels?



I’m open to all kinds of advice and DMs—whether it’s about alternate pathways, specific universities, or anything else that might help me out of this loop.

Would really appreciate guidance from those who’ve been in a similar boat or understand the system well.

Thanks in advance!",HexaChad,2,1.0,2,1746209431,2025-05-02 18:10:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kd7qlr/20f_confused_indian_student_from_commerce/,5,2025

I have been in a slump of rejection.

1kd24z4,Change of career and at cross roads,"I have been in the public education as a staff accountant assistant for 2 years. I love my department and the people I work with. The job is not hard at all and I have taken the time to cross train in the different areas for this department. Safe to say I am literally the go to person whenever anyone around the whole campus has questions or needs help with something. I have also taken the time to learn somethings outside of my department and into other positions like administrative work and purchasing. Safe to say I am a solid employee with tons of knowledge and a well diverse asset. My problem is that of course one of the younger workers up and left so they moved the work into my position and someone else’s in the department. Refuse to increase the pay because of the “union” and how we can’t increase without reclassifying the position which they see no need to. The growth outlook in my department for a higher level management is about 7-10 years out since most of the people in these positions are aged 52 and up but won’t want to retire until they are at age (67) or damn near close to it for the pension. 

A position has opened up in a different department, it’s an assistant director position 15-20k pay difference. I have the backend knowledge for the position when it comes to the desk work and I am highly active in the school since I am an active advisor for a few clubs and a council member. All around the people hiring for the position were the ones who placed me in these other positions because they love how active and caring I am about the students and the community in general. I know I will be a shoe in for the position with no worries. My dilemma is that I would be leave the current job that I do love but will hold me back for a few years. Leaving me stuck that the 2-3% increase which it will take 10-12 years to reach the salary for this position while never guaranteeing that I will even be looked at for the other positions in the future. Even though my director now tells me that there is potential for growth and I will learn a lot here, I feel like they are guilt tripping me and leading me. 

I have a bachelors in business and am currently pursuing a MBA so education won’t be something to hinder me.

It was also a quick interview. My other interviews were around 30-40 minutes, but this one, we ended in 15.

1kcyr32,Blew an opportunity at a one-in-a-thousand job because I made a stupid mistake. How can I stop spiralling + dwelling on it?,"I saw a rare entry-level job at an extremely hard to get into industry that was specifically targeted at under-represented groups (of which I am a part). It was at a really good organistation and would've kick-started my career after nobody has wanted to hire me in 12 months (11 days from my 'anniversary') and in which I've largely given up hope of ever being successful.

It would've been so amazing. My anxiety was extremely bad so it took me all day (about 12 hours straight) to do and I was extremely dysregulated and anguished the whole time. I only just managed to do it by, like 10pm, but then I realised after that I'd attached the wrong cover letter! Because of that I got instantly rejected from this amazing, one-in-a-thousand job opportunity that I'd spent all day and all my mental energy and so much anguish and struggle for. It just epitomises everything that's wrong with me. Unable to do basic tasks -> spend all day doing things that would take normal people 30 minutes -> make a basic stupid mistake because my cognitive abilities are so poor -> have poor outcomes -> spiral further and validate my self-hatred which is, to me, backed up by the evidence.

As you may expect, I am now spiralling completely. I have managed to avoid hurting myself for now but it's really hard resisting the urge to tbh. I am dwelling on it massively. I can't take it. It's so overwhelming and uncontrollable. It's all I can think about no matter how hard I try to distract myself. It just cycles again and again and again in my mind no matter what I do.

What do I do? Have you ever made this stupid mistake on an amazing job and ruined a whole day's work (in which you exuded all the mental energy you had to offer) because of it? I can't take it anymore, I do these stupid mistakes so often no matter how much I try to be thorough.

What can I do and what would you do in the same situation? I am close to just giving up, I swear.

1kcx3yw,"Unemployed, Near Bankruptcy. Looking for Career Advice.","Hi everyone,

I’m hoping someone here might have some insight or encouragement. I was a Director of Sales in the healthcare with over 10 years of experience. I led international sales teams, improved performance metrics, restructured departments, and helped generate millions in revenue.

Despite all that, I was laid off during a round of restructuring. It’s been 6 months now, and I’m still unemployed. I’ve applied to hundreds of roles (remote and local), reworked my resume countless times, and tried consulting and freelancing. No solid leads. My savings are basically gone, and I’m close to bankruptcy.

I feel like I’m stuck in limbo — I know I have valuable experience, but the market is tough, and I don’t know how to pivot or get traction.

If anyone has been through something similar or has suggestions (even outside-the-box ideas), I’d be grateful. Should I consider a full career change? Are there platforms or job types that value leadership skills from healthcare? I’m open to remote work, contract gigs — anything.

Thanks for reading, and thank you in advance for any advice.

I always hated my university and it drained me in every aspect, emotionally, academically, and i just have nthn but negative feelings towards it, and have been trying to leave. Now that i have to repeat year 3 it opens up options for me to finally transfer and get that fresh breath of air away from this environment. But my parents put two options and two options only for me, A) i stay and just repeat the year in my current university.
B) i can transfer but it will be a university in my hometown and i will move back in w them and to not waste my time looking into other uni options because its not happening.
so let me breakdown those two and you tell me which is less worse.
A, i stay in a draining environment overlook humiliation and shame but i maintain freedom and autonomy 
B, i escape this environment and go back to living with my abusive parents in which im not allowed as much as to go to a grocery store without supervision. Zero autonomy, zero freedom, back to the cause of all my trauma and ptsd.

1kctp5o,Should I loop in HR in follow up email to supervisor about poor performance review with no justifiable reasons given?,"Some context: I just started a union job and my performance review has nothing to do with any future raises. Week 1 I was during orientation. Week 2 I was doing hands on training and shadowing. Weeks 3 and 4 I was on my own. My job requires me to learn the basics of 6 different machines to keep a food production line running when I relieve those machine operators for their breaks (we get 4 breaks a day).

I recently had my 30-day performance review and was shockingly poor. The scale was 1-5 and I was given mostly 1s and 2s. The issue I have with this poor performance review is that none of the reasons for the poor ratings seem justified.

For one category on safety I was given a 1. My supervisor admitted that since no one showed me how to do the lock out/ tag out on all the machines that it was a failure on the training but still felt giving me a 1 was justified because I didn’t know the procedures for all the machines.

There was another category that had to do with completing paperwork. Between the 6 machines there is a total of 14 different documents that need to be completed either 
Every 30, 45, or 60 minutes or when you change materials (ex add new box of caps to capping machine). When I relieve the operators it’s my responsibility to check to see if any paperwork needs to be completed while I am running the machine. So basically 14 documents at 4 different points throughout the shift with a total of checking paperwork 56 times a day. In 2 weeks I supposedly missed 1 document that needed to be completed and the operator had to complete it for me when he returned. Because of this I was given a 1 or 2.

I was then told that I’m not asking questions which indicates that I’m not interested in learning. I responded asking if I should just make up questions then so that I’m asking questions. I was told that I should be asking about how different things work and my supervisor gave me an example about some screen that can get clogged and needs to be cleaned. I responded that I didn’t know such a screen existed and how am I supposed to ask questions about stuff I don’t know exists. He gave me a 1 or 2 for whatever relevant category this was.

Another instance had to do with labels on the product and how that defective labels can cause the lines to get glue along the rails and I need to pay attention to that. I’m pretty good with catching this when I’m at this station and I’ve seen the regular operator let a bunch through and one guy who relieved me and the operator at this station when I was in training let the labels run out and a ton of product went through with no labels and got glue smeared all along the lines that we all had to clean up. I was given a 1 or 2 because I missed a few random defective labels.

 The whole review was so negative and I felt attacked for not being perfect in running these 6 different machines in the 2 weeks I was left on my own to do my job. Another new guy on my team experienced the same thing and was not happy about it either. 

I’m planning on sending my supervisor en email recapping what was discussed in the performance review and I’m wondering if I should add HR to the email. This is obviously such a bs review because no one is perfect at their job after 2 weeks of performing it and the issues that were brought up all happened in the first couple of days on my own.

1kctgh7,I get fired from every job…..Advice Please?,"Okay so, I’ve had a job since 16. I became intentional about my career path at 19 when I worked at an Organic Juice Bar and learned about entrepreneurship and I became very passionate about becoming an entrepreneur and owning my own business. I didn’t really have financial help from my parents (they had me as teenagers so they were very excited to have their independence when I turned 18) so I have worked jobs ever since and began building businesses on the side. Since I wanted to own my own business and be my own boss I didn’t really “work my way up” in companies but I would have jobs to pay my bills and meet my needs — (kind of, because these jobs usually don’t pay well). So the companies I’m working on are Holistic Beauty & Wellness as well as a Vintage Store. I really enjoy these things and I can see them becoming lucrative and successful if I don’t give up. The only problem is that along the way I’ve had many jobs, usually customer service, that kind of suck the energy out of me and are usually some sort of “toxic”. To be more specific, my jobs have been usually reception and sales for Boutique Fitness Studios and Spas, Flight Attending, and things like that. The “toxicity” is usually a culture fit thing, manipulation, gossip, coworkers having inappropriate convos, one place didn’t want to give me a raise but wanted to promote me and have me work over time and make overtime pay instead… at the juice bar a the owner tried to “do it” with me and I said no and got fired the next day, and today I got fired after getting cussed out twice in 1 day and telling my manager in a way the described as “emotionally charged and unprofessional” … but I had just gotten cussed out by a customer and a staff member…and just things like that. I will admit that at the point of getting fired I had already wanted to quit and I would usually pray to God to please help me because I try to appreciate having an income but these jobs always drain me and leave me miserable! 

I also feel like jobs can mirror our upbringing as well! Idk if it’s just me tho…But I grew up as the family scapegoat and I’m the youngest, I just see that it kind of mirrors being at the bottom of a food chain at work and being scapegoated and outcasted there.

A positive: I did make the most money in a day at my business I’m growing than I have ever the day before getting fired.
I just don’t know what to do for the time being building and scaling businesses with no savings to kind of like give me a cushion while I do that…. Is this just the risk I’m supposed to take?
I think I get fired from every job because I’m not meant to have a job.

1kcsw6t,"24, Jr Software Developer, Just laid off, what now?","Hi everyone. so I was just laid off my first ""real"" job. i've been a part-time jr software developer for  4 and a half years. I feel like I should be ready to apply for proper fulltime developer roles, but when I go look at these positions, I feel like I wouldnt be able to do over half of what they are asking for. I feel like my work at my previous company didnt prepare me for any other role. 99% of my work was bug fixing, with maybe 1 or 2 ""big"" projects every year (I would take some old project/software they had that didnt work, and re implement it in a new framework or make a project from scratch. still relatively small compared to other projects that had people working on though). I wasnt really happy in the job, but I was finishing my software development degree while I worked for them, and they kept promising to take me on as a full-time Software Developer 1 position. But of course, I graduate in a week,and they laid me off last week haha.  
Anyway, how can I brush up or learn skills i dont have but will need?  
What skills/technologies would be essential?

I did a lot of work with Vue.js, springboot, java ,javascript. gradle, etc ( front-end work + backend work + sql sometimes)  
but I never doing any strong ""software development"" tasks while i was there (I would have to write technical documents and like, requirements analysis and time estimates/schedules, etc while working on the bigger projects, but I only did a few big projects)  
I never had to make really important decisions, so I feel like im very unprepared to have to justify my code and design in the future.  
I dont know, sorry guys if im not making sense.  
What does software development/programming look like in your jobs? was my experience out of the norm?

1kcsv1m,"When the Life I Built Crumbled, My Career Identity Went With It","I used to think identity was something you built like a house. Brick by brick—education, job title, relationship status, salary. I thought I had constructed something solid: married, mid-level manager, benefits, annual raises. Safe. Stable. Expected.

Then the marriage ended.

And suddenly it felt like someone had taken a wrecking ball to the whole structure. The house I’d built wasn’t just missing a person—it was missing a purpose. And beneath the rubble, I realized I couldn’t tell where my personal identity ended and my professional one began.

I kept showing up to work. I hit deadlines. I answered emails. But inside? I was completely unmoored. I didn’t recognize the person in my Zoom reflection anymore. I wasn’t sure if I was doing this job because I *wanted* to, or because I just hadn’t stopped long enough to ask.

The worst part? I didn’t know who to talk to about it. Friends were kind but didn’t get it. My boss noticed I wasn’t “myself” but didn’t ask much. Honestly, I didn’t even know what I’d say if they did.

So I started talking to myself instead. Through journaling. Long walks. A lot of nights staring at the ceiling. I even found myself trying out tools I’d once rolled my eyes at—like a personalized astrology book from a platform called **Nordastro**. It didn’t fix anything. But strangely, it helped me ask different questions. Not “What job should I do?” but “What do I *need* in order to feel like myself again?” “What patterns am I stuck in?” “What strengths am I not using?”

It was less about cosmic answers and more about emotional honesty. A mirror I didn’t expect, but one I probably needed.

I’m still employed, still rebuilding. But now I’m allowing myself to reimagine what a career could feel like—not just what it should look like. Less house of bricks. More garden. Something alive. Something evolving.

If you’re in that liminal space—grieving one version of life while trying to shape the next—I just want you to know you’re not alone. Sometimes the best thing we can do is pause, ask better questions, and be honest enough to say: *I don’t know who I am right now… but I’m trying to find out.*

In my early 20s I had stressful private sector jobs where I’m in office, sales targets etc etc. with this job, I am able to take my kids to the park, give them lunch, have fun around the house and they really enjoy my time with them.

However, I’m not saving much as my wife works part time and does not make much. Essentially I’m living cheque to cheque, I feel like I know I need to make more money, and I feel like I’m kind of slacking on my career. I’ve been in this role for about 1.5 years. 

I guess my question is. Am I making a mistake not chasing a higher wage to enjoy working from home with my 4.5 year old and 2 year old while they are still young? My wife gives me grief saying that I need to look into increasing my income but she doesn’t realize how much I help around the house with meals and the kids (she’s also wfh) I feel like soon they will be in school full time and I just want to cherish my time with them while having a low stress fully remote role, but I don’t want to get too comfortable.

Anyways don’t want to rant, just curious if anybody has any insights on chasing money vs chasing low stress and stability. Thanks.

1kcrfy2,"Loverboy in the last term of his Bachelor's degree, looking for a new life path","I've been thinking a lot about my life path because I've been watching a youtuber called Elisha Long who talks about dropping everything and following your passions, and my mom says a similar thing, that I should get a job that I enjoy.

So I'm in my (hopefully) last term of computer science, and I have loved it at times for sure, I still enjoy some of the stuff now and try to be a student with a good attitude and everything, but I just feel like it hard for me to care about the intricacies of algorithms and math equations until I can apply them and solve a problem directly. A lot of the stuff in CS is very boring to me. My community college computer programming degree was more up my alley I feel like even though this degree is much more advanced. I was satisfied just working on basic website stuff. All of the noise around software stuff these days and AI has kind of soured my mood on it.

I originally chose CS because I have a stiff back which limited me from some things (it's better now but still hard for me to grab something on the ground), and the fact that it pays well, along with the fact that I was kind of a computer and math ""whiz"". I'm kind of stereotypically nerdy in some ways but after doing this degree I realized I'm not as nerdy as I thought I was, these nerds put me to shame lol. I just feel out of my element at this point and I'll be grateful to just get the degree and start a career.

Here's the dilemma, what I'm actually passionate about is sex and cuddling and romantic relationships in general, I'm a total loverboy as my girlfriend calls me. I also love gaming, original huh? Been gaming since I was a little kid. I love other things too like hiking in nature, travelling, basic stuff that most people like. I like a lot of things, I did a ton of extra curricular activities back in the day. It's hard to think of a job that incorporates my main interests though. I do want to contribute to society, and I feel like I'm pretty talented at some things, but I just wonder what other options are out there for ways to earn a living? I don't want to be a streamer. I honestly want to make porn but my gf is super private about sex so I can't do that. I like cooking, but I don't feel passionate enough about it to make being a chef the right move. I think I'm good at strategy and reading people, but I don't know where to apply those skills.

For awhile now I've thought it's childish to expect that I can just chase my passions, but that youtuber talked about denying your nature and I'm like man, is there a way I can find a path that better suits my nature?",Lord_Chadagon,0,0.5,0,1746156510,2025-05-02 03:28:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kcrfy2/loverboy_in_the_last_term_of_his_bachelors_degree/,5,2025

* Pay off **high-interest debt** before anything else.
* Use a **Health Savings Account (HSA)** if your job offers one—it’s triple tax-advantaged.
* If your salary is under $160K, start a **Roth IRA** now while you still qualify.
* Avoid lifestyle creep—don’t upgrade everything all at once just because you’re finally earning.

1kcoefq,Confused / anxious if I'm going into the right career path,"Good Evening People,

So i recently got offered a job for building maintenance essentially, this offer was given to me by the Chief.

I accepted it, the pay is a pretty big raise from what I currently earn. I Currently Work Security. Though i took like 2 days to make this decision I'm just feeling really anxious about it, and will try to do my best but I don't plan at the moment to stay doing maintenance for longer than 4 years. I'm just trying it out because I felt like I had no options left and the ones I did i rejected for this path or because pay wasn't good enough . One of the main motivators i have for it was Money and I was getting tired of Security even though I enjoy doing customer service and helping tenants. Also a little of my experience perhaps can take me somewhere. 

Over The Past two years I was taking a class on electrical and recently just finished last week. At First I was interested in it because of Money. ( You know Money Keeps everything going). Then over like the past year and a half I was losing interest in it and saw no future inside cause honestly I saw i wasn't going to like it. Though over these 2 years, I had essentially 3 job offers that were handed to me and one that I got an interview for but I overthinked it and didn't keep following up.

The first one was for a office position at an insurance company, at that moment I rejected it for school but kept my options open with the person who offered me. Essentially an HR representative offered it to me said her boss liked how I worked and they're offering the position just to apply and we'll help you out. 

Second one was last year in which I applied for a insurance position with the same company as the last paragraph, i applied and I gave a comment to the same hr person, if they can keep me in mind for this position again, she said yes and we went through the process again. It was back and forth, they canceled the 2nd interview and i never followed up for it so my fault cause I kept on overthinking it and not following through.  So i never got an answer to what happened to the second interview oh well. 

What sucks about the insurance one is from what I've seen they have a good culture and I see the coworkers I talk to look happy. I have been regretting not taking the first offer and constantly think about it.

Third was earlier this year for a real estate company given to me by the GM of the building where I work at. (Highrise Commercial Building) i was basically offered a property administrator position but saw I was going to get paid only about 3 more and the workload is very heavy and you'd just be stuck alone in a corner. Politely Rejected It But Asked If I can Be kept in consideration for something in a future? Which i found out perhaps helped with the building maintenance position which he has control of since he runs the building. 

With that I accepted buildng maintenance  position because I'm honestly just seeing the money and I felt like I had no options left. Also dont wanna let the chief down because he was great help. I'm just dreading starting this new career and I don't feel like I'll enjoy it but i gotta push through, i am really going to miss doing customer service in that role as Security even though i will interact with the same people. I should've said no,  was what I was thinking, but all my coworkers believed in me and said I should take it and I have the brains for it so that made me take the risk. The only advantage i have is i work in the building already; management and tenants like me and I know some concepts of how the building works and where equipment is at.

Am I doing it for me or for people to see I have it? I'm just  a nervous reck. ",RaspberrySome124,1,1.0,2,1746146819,2025-05-02 00:46:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kcoefq/confused_anxious_if_im_going_into_the_right/,5,2025
1kcnyhe,Golden Opportunity? Where to Go?,"Hi erveryone!

  
I will try to make this simple! 

I am currently working for a mid size company in the retail sector as the senior sales for our sales team, my background in this industry is sales, and I've no formal qualifications so I got here pretty much through hard work.

  
When I started at this company not to long ago, I did advise the board that based on their strategic plans their current software / backend would not be scalable for their business plans. Long story short, I ended leading the switchover of the system and pretty much taking over a sysadmin / project manager / HR person as well haha while also holding many of my sales duties (I've always been quite passionate about IT on a hobby level but never professionally). 

When I started here I was aiming to get a Sales Manager position on the short/mid term but the director has pretty much taken over that position since he's been steering the strategy to allow a more aggressive growth (heavily investing and expanding the business almost on the fly). Because of that I've been providing advise and consulting since he did not have previous experience in the industry until he bought the business. 

After some time I started to get uncomfortable with my internal pathway given the broadness of my role, and the lack of clarity of how I was going to grow internally both career and salary wise! So I spoke with the director to provide more insight or direction on how to get me back on track on a pathway where my performance can be measured and eventually get compensated accordingly as well.

The director pretty much has given me a ""wild card"" so I can tell him where I want to be ultimately both position and salary wise. Which I've been struggling to wrap my head around.

The sales team has matured to a point where I would be starting behind my colleagues since I do work on my accounts and sales on a ""casual basisis"" often delegating or handing over my stuff to other sales.

And technologically speaking we got a SaaS solution which eventually when the business growth stabilizes will pretty much remove the need for developments.

  
Preference wise I would love to stick to IT and potentially chase down a CTO position, but my fear is that we are not a software business so eventually this may disappear. I believe my knowledge of the business as a whole (processes, people, financial, sales, and operations). puts me on a position where I could easily take over a Operations Manager Position (the only caveat is that they're already coaching someone for that position).

I would love to hear some insight as I really want to grow, and I think opinions may help me wrap my mind about the pros and cons of the pathways I could take!",PinaColadasForever,3,1.0,1,1746145452,2025-05-02 00:24:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kcnyhe/golden_opportunity_where_to_go/,5,2025
1kcnu89,Need Advice About Choosing a Job,"I need a part-time day job to compliment my evening music venue job. The day job must work around my evening schedule.

I have been offered two jobs. The first is as a flower merchandiser (third party) at a local department store. I work by myself at my own pace. I can show up whenever I want as long as the job gets done. My boss is cool, and they don't care about marijuana usage outside of the workplace. I started the job this week. If I didn't get the other job offer, this would be a fine job to have.

The second is a cool job on a riverboat as a Deckhand, but it is more like a government-type job where they have strict policies and drug test (DOT). I would start the first week of May. Both jobs work around my evening schedule, are 20 hours a week, pay the same, are close to home, and are outdoors. The main difference is a lifestyle choice about marijuana. I passed the pre-employment drug test for the boat job, but they also randomly drug test, so I would have to stop using THC for good. To be clear, I enjoy pot but it doesn't rule my life or anything. It is just a way for me to relax. I don't even drink alcohol.

1kcnp9p,"So burnt out from school and work, and I don't know what to do.","Kinda of a long post 
I(28M) graduated from my bachelor's degree in computer science in 2020 (I was 23 at the time) during the pandemic. My first job after graduating was a janitor (yes im serious), I took this job bc during COVID while everyone was getting jobs, I was struggling a lot to find any job and I took this one by getting a reference from a friend. I was making $20 an hour and I was grateful. Then I decided to enrol into my masters full online part time in computer science but once I  started this program , I got my first tech job making 60k . So for the last 3 years my life has been studying part time while working full time. My work performance was great and now I am at 103k. 

Now im graduating in 2 days however I am so burnt out now that I am even looking forward to my graduation ceremony that I will be attending on Saturday and then my solo trip to Florida. 

My personal life has been more a joke, as I don't have many people in my life now. All of my friends are now getting engaged or married (same age range as me) and I moved out of my parents house bc we had our differences. In terms of dating, I struck 0 luck, as I was told Im too ugly to date or that I looked a predator. So I decided to quit dating because it was too much of a problem for me and it was my first time and I never landed a single date lol. The  only reason I am still here is because I have my therapist and ive been going the gym. 

Im so burnt out and I don't what to do, I don't want to leave my job since I have a decent income  but I want to just take a break from everything.

1kcnmjo,Struggling to get a job,"Please no sarcastic, rude remarks. I've already been struggling with a lot.

As the title says, I'm struggling to get a job. It's been two years since I've had a job because I took time off to live abroad and study to improve my skills and enhance my resume. I returned home to continue my education in 3D assets. I've learnt a lot, and while I wouldn't say I'm at a ""professional level"" yet, I definitely have enough of a foundation where I can keep practising and keep getting better. Unfortunately, money is tight. We've found that my computer is too old and not up to snuff to run the programs we've been running, but I don't have enough money to  both finish the last term or build a new computer with the required specs.

So, I've been applying anywhere I can in my small, rural village and surrounding towns and cities up to a couple hours away by public transit. I've also been applying to remote jobs (and making sure they're not ... scammy). I've also tried some ai jobs, but each of them say ""there are no jobs for your skillset,"" and it's been months.

I've gotten help with my resumes to make sure I'm hitting key words, and have been catering my resume and cover letter (if applicable) to each job listing. Yet, out of the good couple hundred of jobs I've applied to, only one has gotten back to me to say I wasn't a good candidate. The rest...? No word. Nothing. 

I have pretty basic skills, I think. I've been an admin assistant and a cashier so I have data entry, cash reconciliation, verbal and written communication, and other related skills. I also have creative skills like 2D art (traditional/digital), and 3D art (traditional/digital), and creative writing. Then of course, I have some basic knowledge around computers, the internet, basic HTML/CSS coding, and too many software programs under my belt.

In theory, I'm not unhirable. I have skill assets that can apply to different fields, yet I feel like I'm not hirable. My 16-year-old neighbour got a job at our local Walmart, whereas I can't even get an interview with them (or anyone for that matter).

* **Environmental Risk Consultant** (this one is the most intriguing to me right now, i love env sci and stats!!!)

To give you more context:  
I’m really passionate about math and stats, and I’m decent at physics and coding. I’d love to work in a field where I can make **good money** ($100k+ by 30 would be ideal), but also maintain a **good work-life balance**. I want a job that’s **intellectually satisfying**, **not too repetitive or boring**, and **doesn’t require me to constantly stress about work outside of office hours.**

I’ve heard **Environmental Risk Management** can be a bit niche. can you get a good job in this field, or is it too specialized? Also, how do Actuary, Applied Math, and Data Analytics compare when it comes to work-life balance, pay, and job satisfaction?

Would love to hear any thoughts or advice from people already working in these fields or familiar with them.

1kciuwl,Should I take the new position I was offered even when my current job is offering a 50% pay raise?,"So I currently work with a commercial real estate group as an exec assistant and marketing person (for a year now). They're a small group so really I'm the only one who does all their marketing/branding/design. Even tho it's a great work culture and I have a lot of freedom to travel when I'd like, and they just expanded to NY with plans for me to be involved and travel there - I have for a long time been feeling unfulfilled. Since I'm surrounded by brokers always talking real estate, and I'm the only marketing person things tend to feel either stagnant like I'm not learning much or like I'm just bored and sometimes even annoyed because I have 0 interest in commercial real estate. 

I have been moving more towards a creative role for the past 2 yrs but keep getting stuck in this admin role due to my work background. I went to UX design bootcamp and I'm always networking and working on things to get my foot in the door. It has grown more difficult with my current job and feel burnt out and limited on the creative side. My bf even notices how depressed I become as soon as the week begins again. 

I recently got in touch with a friend of a friends (who I met at a baby shower once) and after speaking with him he was in the middle of a hiring process for a project coordinator role at his marketing company. He let me jump in even tho applications were closed - and he and the director of accounts were impressed by me and decided to offer me the role. It's super exciting and just last week I told my bosses about the news to which they were extremely sad about and keep begging me to stay while also understanding and wishing me the best to chase my dreams. They were about to offer me a raise apparently..so I'm going to list some of the things about these two jobs and I just REALLLYY need some second opinions.

  
NEW ROLE: $52K salary, fully remote, paid health insurance, (15 days PTO), they also offer bonus incentives, the owner is a mutual connection, laid back culture, offers quick growth and advancement in marketing skills (creative and logistics). Works with some pretty cool and different brands. 

CURRENT ROLE: $50K salary but they offered me a 50% increase at $75K + bonuses, just offered me 2 days remote, work culture that I fit in with already and am used to and opportunity to travel and be involved with the NY expansion.

1kcii01,"I am lost, directionless","Hey everyone. I am here with a big rent of my life. Also, I don't have someone to talk about, so it feels heavy.  people think I am much better, and they can't get me crying on life, career, because it has always been my domain to give life and career advice, though now I am failing in both. I am a 24M from India. I am a content writer with 3+ years, but I don't think it's my field. I joined this career because of its pronounced hype during Covid, but I feel so annoying writing content. I also worked in a digital marketing agency, where I realised corporate isn't my thing. I can't best fit in it, especially due to my introverted nature. I am a thinking man who spend most his time alone. Even in the office, I spent 1.5 years living quite by my table, yet I couldn't succeed. Company issued me 3 warnings, 1 for my rude and reactive behaviour, 2 for my poor understanding of work. My editors always complained about my content quality.

 However, now I can write better content than I did in the agency. Just after company terminated me, my father was tested for cancer, and there I had to spent my savings. Now I am broke. During his treatment, I found some freelance work, and I am still freelancing. I don't think I am a business mind, because I have zero negotiation skills, zero relationship skills, no interest in leading people. 

Let me tell you why I landed up in a content writing career, even when I had gut feelings it isn't for me. 

Just after graduation in Physical Science from a renowned university in India, I started tutoring physics at home. I was pretty good at it. My students loved my teachings style and skills.

 Along with this I was preparing for masters in physics from a good university. But, I lost interest. One of the reasons behind losing interest is i foolishly entered a relationship with a 26 years old who wanted to marry me in 2 years. That time I was only 20. How could I even think to marry her. But childish me agreed, and lost interest in masters preparation thinking it is a long hustle, and I won't be able to marry in 2 years. So I left along the way, and jumped to content writer career following the hype. 

I don't know what should I do. Also, I feel a barrier when I think to start anything other than the content, maybe due to its habit. Please pave a path for me, and guide me based on my nature and personality type. I am so much interested in reading, thinking, analysing, figiring out creative patterns. I think I lean more towards the intellectual side.

1kci0la,"How to feel secure taking on a part-time job, while already working full time?","I have a full time remote job that I've been at for almost a decade. I am paid decently, but I want to help save up for my childs college fund. I took on a part time gig, that's also remote, 10 hours a week, scheduled at different working hours than my full time job. It is within the handbook to be able to have a part time job as long as it doesn't impact the work. It is a terminable offense to have another full time job. This should clear me but, considering they're both remote, I wonder if they'd still view it unfavorably, even if it's within line to do. Or if prior performance issues were brought up at the full time job, it could not look great to me taking on this part-time job. I wanted to tell my boss about it, but I'm just not sure if it's in my best interests and don't really know what to do.

As I'm going through this process of getting onboarded, filing a W-2 and whatnot for this part time gig, I'm getting increasingly more anxious about it, and honestly feel even weird posting about it online. I know there are people over at [r/overemployed](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/) who work like 4 full time jobs at once, and that's exactly what I don't want it to look like.

1kchkc3,May be fired but here’s the catch.,"So I’ve been at this job as a manager for 6 years. I’ve done and amazing job, many pay raises and much praise from corporate and I’ve brought so many customers to this job when this place was a ghost town before me. 
I had a fall with mental health and it really took a toll on me. I was showing up 5-10 minutes late no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t get myself out the door without forcing myself to. 
Even had a seizure up here due to stress.
All this depression stuff lasted about a month and they basically threatened to fire me if I didn’t get my act together and said “we don’t want to, this place can’t be ran without you.”
I replied “over the 6 years I’ve been here and never had an issue, the one month I have mental health issues yall want to threaten to fire me??”
They basically said yes. 

Now here’s the catch!!!!
I was sexually harassed majorly at work, an older man was taking photos of my butt when I was infront of him walking, and he told me to my face he did, he also told me he was going to follow me home from work to “make sure I got there safe” and I told him he doesn’t need to do that and I’m uncomfortable with it. He followed anyway and now knows where I live. 
I have many texts from him losing it on me because I refused to hang out with him. 

He even called me 10 times in a row and left a manic voice mail telling me:

“you don’t need to lie and say your sick just say you don’t wanna hang out (mind you I did already) the thing I can’t stand the most is liars and you’re LYING to me. Have I ever lied to you??? How is that fair? This breaks my heart….. really does.” 

It was slurred and he ended the voice mail. 

He also would hang out at my area for hours and  intimidate other customers to get them to leave.
He even stole my phone at one point and went through my camera roll saying:

“I wonder if I scroll far enough if I’ll find naughty little pictures”

I had witnesses and people also came forward and this man was never fired. He wasn’t even moved stores he got a slap on the wrist because he cried and told them “she’s lying I would never ever do that to her, she’s like a granddaughter to me.”
Then I got a call from my GM asking how true my story is. With all the witnesses and my coworker came forward as well. He was only written up which literally just a slap on the wrist. 

But if I am fired over tardiness can I retaliate and go way above my GM who by the way never reported this to corporate and I know he didn’t. If he did he would be gone…. But if I did retaliate and make this a bigger issue can I possibly get out of being fired? I’d have to threaten them right there and then. But I’m not sure if it would go my way….

1kcgj5o,Surprise roommate in company housing— am I overreacting if I quit?,"I’ve been working for an international company since October. I was hired to cover a new territory, and part of the offer was 1 year of staff housing. At the time of hiring I was advised that the staff house has two rooms, and that the second room, would occasionally be occupied by employees from other offices for a few days at a time. Until now, this has generally been true, and I usually get 1-2 months notice beforehand.

A few days ago, I returned early from a week off and at 10pm my doorbell rings and its another employee there with his suitcases, my boss following behind. I wsas surprised to say the least.

We had some difficulty getting a straight answer, but I found out that they plan to stay “indefinitely”. He later clarified this would be “about a month” but he has no return ticket. Its not a work related stay, either. He essentially just wanted to come here for some time away (won't go into too much detail here)

I am pretty upset about this. I feel completely disrespected and deceived, plus my living situation has been disrupted. Overall, I feel like I was misled about the housing arrangements. Stays have been 1-2 weeks, and this is the since October. Secondly, I feel like it is common decency to send someone a message ahead of time at the very least. Especially given this has come to be the norm for other stays, and given the hour.

This seems to be a larger pattern of poor communication and lack of formal policies that has already caused me problems. I'd say my boss is pretty receptive to feedback which is nice, but I feel annoyed having to always call out/correct behaviour that I would consider quite out of line. He has also booked travel for me without telling me, withholds travel itineraries, and was booking us into shared AirBnBs until I asked him to stop (he is a 50 year old man and I am a 34 year old woman).

This is a business with 3 offices and about 50 employees. We don't have an HR department and we don't have any policies on these issues, which is probably a red flag in and of itself

These behaviours don't give me much confidence in the business, his leadership, or the way he treats me.  It has kind of put me off the job altogether and since I don't really need the job desperately, I've only been here a short time so my former network is still coming to me with offers. My old apartment is still vacant. I'm tempted to just quit. I don't feel that discussing it would worth the effort and almost certainly wouldn't resolve the situation at hand. 

That said, it may be unfair to make decisions before discussing it with him. I am also unlikely to run into this exact issue after I leave the staff housing. I am also concerned that finding a new job right now isn't guaranteed to be much better (there are some objectively good aspects to this job).

What would you do, and why?

1kcfyyf,"Stick or quit, how to get the promotion I deserve","Looking for advice on how to further my career.

I have been working at my current company for 16 years, I was an apprentice and then went into further study and college and university.

As time went on it became apparent that there was little chance of progressing within my department as it is a small department, but part of much larger company which is primarily based elsewhere - we are a satellite office. I have gradually gathered skills and experience in the very niche products that we are working with that would make my very difficult to replace, but I think they consider me a low flight risk because I've been there a long time and have good relationship with my bosses.
My supervisor was approaching retirement age and it became a bit of a carrot to dangle that when he retired I would step up to fill his shoes. He was recently made redundant close to retirement and got a big payout, however since he left a couple of months ago is been radio silence on the promotion front despite the fact I have had to pick up some aspects of his job. I am reluctant to accept further responsibility etc from his position because I feel like if I do then it will never be awknowleged.

My current sallery is just over 40K, my supervisor was on around 55K before redundancy. My pay has been pretty stagnant for the last few years as our company has found 101 excuses not to give more than one small cost of living increase.

I have become frustrated and put together my CV and for the first time in years and years I've started being offered interviews for jobs at the same level or slightly higher. Id like to be able to increase my sallery by 10k in the next couple of years but I'm not sure if the best path is:
A) stay where I am and push for promo
B) jump ship and loose all the good will and reputation I've built up and start fresh somewhere else
C) try to get an offer from another job and leverage it for a better package where I am.

1kcfk50,Creative problem-solver who’s done a bit of everything — how do I shift into product management?,"I’ve worked in creative roles most of my career — design (print, web, digital), video production, and more recently UI/UX and motion/interaction design. I held a formal UI/UX title for a couple of years, but had been doing UX-adjacent work through web design for years prior.

What I’ve realized over time is that I’m most energized when I get to solve problems, improve systems, and think strategically. Not just *how* something looks — but *why* something works (or doesn’t), and how to make it better across teams or products.

In almost every role, I’ve ended up doing more than expected: helping organize launches, coordinating across departments, creating workflows, and pointing out inefficiencies. It’s always been informal — I’ve never had a title like project manager or product manager — but the work has definitely overlapped.

Recently, I had a job call for a creative role, and the person interviewing me said, “Honestly, the questions you’re asking feel more like product strategy or business development.” And that stuck with me.

So now I’m wondering: should I be leaning into product management or strategy? I love problem-solving, organization, providing results that matter and connecting the dots across teams — and I pick things up fast. But I’ve never had formal training, and I’m unsure how to frame my background or make that transition.

**Would love advice on:**

* How do I *successfully position* a broad, creative background when breaking into product roles? What actually works when applying?
* Is it worth pursuing certifications (like Scrum or PMI), or is it better to lead with case studies and transferable outcomes?
* For those who shifted from design or creative into product — what was your *first role* that made the leap real? How did you sell yourself?
* How do you explain being the ""figure-it-out"" person across roles without sounding scattered or unfocused?

1kcf02a,"Promotion doubts, fair or not?","I'm currently serving as an interim lead. In January, my manager (the Vice President) told me I would be promoted to Director later this year.

In March, I was asked to design my future organization, which I did. During the presentation, my VP referred to my role as “Director of \[XXX\],” and the structure was shared with all peer directors, local HR, and relevant corporate functions. Everyone agreed.

Next week, we—including myself—will present the proposed setup to the CEO and global HR for final approval.

As the meeting approaches, I’ve started to feel a bit anxious. I keep imagining potential roadblocks, even though they’re unlikely—for example, corporate HR objecting to a two-level promotion, despite no formal policy against it and clear precedents of others receiving similar promotions. Or some other unexpected objection.

Realistically, the risk of the CEO disapproving is very low.

# My reflections are:

Reality:

1: Strong signals of support: My VP has consistently backed my promotion, named the role publicly, and involved the right stakeholders early.

2: Endorsement from key players: Peer directors, local HR, and involved corporate functions are all aligned. 

3: Next step is formal approval.

On my doubts:

1: My mind is doing its job: Im just anticipating all possible outcomes, which is also part of being strategic I guess

2: The ""2-level jump"" worry: I’ve already evidence that it's possible (precedent + no written rule). 

3: “BS pushback”: If anything like that surfaces, my VP will likely be my shield and sponsor. Also, well-prepared org charts, a clear scope, and my track record all speak louder than a hypothetical HR objection I hope

4: Global HR is more or less downgraded recently because of lack of quality

 

How would you approach this situation? Do you see any real risks here, or am I simply overthinking things?  
(And please don’t say, “You can’t be a director if you worry about this”—we’re all human, and self-doubt happens from time to time.)

I graduated last year with a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology (I also have another BA in Theatre that I got before that one), and my goal so far is to move from retail to something more clinical? I don’t mean clinical psychology/therapy, obviously, I mean something like Administrative Assistant, Receptionist in a medical setting, or something that can help me get some sort of experience that will be good enough for me to get into grad school to get my Master’s Degree in Counseling. However, I’ve been rejected to every single job I’ve applied to so far… idk what to do, or how to successfully transition to a different career path.

1kce8ul,Uncompetitive Data Science grad looking for help to figure out all my options,"Hello everyone,

I graduated from a good UC school with a B.S. in Data Science with unfortunately no internship experience and a sub-3.0 GPA (but really close to it). I'm basically as uncompetitive as it gets and just below the usual 3.0/4.0 GPA cutoff for most fellowship/grad school requirements. I've been applying and tailoring my resume/cover letters for almost the past two months for anything related to data science/data analysts with no luck so far and have been weighing my future options.

I'd love to aim for a career that can provide something meaningful to others (i.e federal/state jobs, UN positions, non-profits, etc.) but at this point I understand I could probably have a better chance with more work experience of any kind under my belt. I've also been looking at the Air/Space Force as another option but from what I've seen online and researched commissioning as an Officer would also be quite competitive but I feel like I might have a better chance there assuming I can score well on the ASVAB and the AFOQT.

Other things I'd like some clarifications on if possible would be:

Is community college an option to bring my cumulative GPA up over a 3.0? If so, what kind of classes would I be retaking or will they be completely new courses?

If not, are graduate courses my only opportunity to bring my GPA up? Whether it be through a post-bacc or some other kind of program other than an entire M.S.? I'm not opposed to a bit more schooling if absolutely necessary but I'd like to avoid more debt if possible.

What kind of other jobs should I be looking for that are less competitive for a less qualified applicant like myself? Ideally, I don't want to pivot careers entirely and would still like to utilize my degree in some shape or form, but I definitely want to get a start somewhere and not spend more time sending applications into the void.

Are there any kind of certificates that I should pursue that would strengthen my resume for future applications? 

Thank you in advance to everyone for your perspective and advice.",Prudent_Praline8568,1,1.0,6,1746119978,2025-05-01 17:19:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kce8ul/uncompetitive_data_science_grad_looking_for_help/,5,2025

Now for the link to my calendar to book the next “training call” I was going to attach a meme, like very safe for work “hire me” kind of meme. Thoughts? In all of my interviews so far I’ve made it a point to make them laugh and I’ve been asking some funny questions which have been well received (obviously since I’m at the final round) so I’m hoping to get one last laugh in before they make a decision.

1kcdirc,How do I break out of Customer Support?,"In short, I'm 36 years old and I've been working at startups in customer support roles for the past 10 years. Every time I try to break out or take on more responsibility I end up back where I started.  
  
In 2015 I started my first tech job by working in customer support at a startup. I worked on their support team fielding 40+ calls a day for about two years, before I was prompted to the Billing & Payments team, which was less customer-facing, where I handled much more interesting and difficult payments related tasks. I was starting to learn more about fraud prevention and looking at another promotion before I (along with half the company) was laid off in March of 2020.

Since that first layoff I have been working a series of other customer support roles, where about every two years or so I am again laid off. Starting fresh at a new company always feels like a setback. I did have a brief stint as a CSM for 7 months, as a contractor, but was laid off from that as well.   
  
Back when I started, I was confident that I could work my way up from the bottom, but now after years of interviewing I'm starting to become very depressed.

After my last layoff in 2023, I took a year off focus on a UX Design bootcamp. I worked on several projects and built a portfolio. I applied to hundreds of junior level UX Design roles and internships but never have gotten one interview. I have tried looking within my network as well. I attend networking events. The word is, the market is so oversaturated that it's even more difficult to break into this field.

Needing income, in autumn of 2024 I was hired for another customer support role. This is a small startup that is struggling to stay afloat. They're paying me even less than what I was making when I started in support 10 years ago. THIS MAKES ME VERY SAD.

Morale at this company is pretty bad. Since I started, I expressed interest in sitting in with their design team, but now they're down to only one designer and he's too stressed and busy to want to meet with me. Even my boss is struggling on a low salary, and there do not seem to be any opportunities for growth here.

Recently I have pivoted my focus back to fraud and Trust & Safety related roles. I read about it in my spare time and watch YouTube videos about how to use relevant software. I have interviewed with two different companies with this type of role in the past month, which felt promising. This last company sat through 3 rounds of interviews with me, and I was feeling very good about things. The salary for this role would be DOUBLE my current salary, and overall a big career jump.   
  
I made sure I sounded passionate and knowledgeable in those interviews and got nothing but good feedback. Unfortunately they went with another candidate, and they told I got very close, but they just went with someone who had more experience. The recruiter then said, ""If we are ever hiring for a customer support role, please apply to that, that's what you're more qualified for."" I know she meant well, but it was like a knife to my heart. My mental health has been spiraling downward since that rejection.

I am great at my current job, and I receive nothing but positive feedback. I can handle high volume of customer calls/emails/etc. I know how to start side projects to improve our processes, internal documents, training new hires. This type of role just isn't challenging enough nor does it pay enough. It's crushing to still live only paycheck to paycheck. I'm even thinking about selling my car to get by.

I am going to keep applying for other roles, but I am feeling quite hopeless at the moment. 

Is there anyone who successfully moved up from a customer support role, and how did you do it?

TL;DR: 10 years of experience in customer support experience, broke, losing hope.

1kcdap7,Told there was no budget for raises… but coworker given one.,"Me and my coworker are both approaching our first year at the company. We were hired on at the same level but I have pushed ahead, and received a title change, labelling me as more senior.

I am also able to track our contribution to the company by percentage.

I contribute over 40% of our team’s output. I have pursued ‘bigger picture’ projects, and generally considered by most other members of staff to add a lot more value to the company.

My coworker contributes 7% of our team’s output. They are also my boss’ drinking buddy.

Last month my coworker told me they were given a (coincidentally) 7% raise, and I waited for my boss to have a similar conversation with me, but it never happened. 

Yesterday I asked for a raise and my boss outright told me “sorry the accounts team have told me there is no budget for anyone to have a raise” lying right to my face.

1kccq6r,is mental health leave terrible idea?,"I've been at my company almost 21 years.  The last year has been awful- I was demoted (not for performance, a re-org) and ended up managing a team including a person who was also demoted and previously was the director.

I broke down in tears in front of my boss when we went over a plan to give a review to a person who dislikes me and will likely complain to hr.

I started this office job earlier this year, and since then, I’ve hardly had any real work to do. Most days, I just sit at my desk with nothing much going on, while the people around me all seem really busy.

When I was new, I did ask to help with extra admin work, hoping it would give me something to do. But that turned out to be more trouble than it was worth. It was stressful and not really what I expected.

So now I’m kind of stuck. I don’t have much to do, but I also don’t want to ask for more and end up with a mess again. I don’t really mind the quiet days, but I’m starting to feel like people might notice that I don’t do much — if they haven’t already.

To their credit, they leveraged my fast learner ability to plug me into whatever role they needed.  As a results though, I am left with a 20-year career without a focus - I've run very small departments, managed direct report, I've run ""projects"" (not with methodology, just winging it but I did get a PMP), I'm comfortable with budgets and managing people, know my way around marketing, I have an MBA and Communicaitons bachelors, etc.  I have a 20-year career, but I don't have 20 years of experience as any one thing.

I've come to the conclusion that I would best fit in a smaller company, rather than a large company.  My thinking is that smaller companies would likely be looking for someone who can do a bit of everything, whereas my experience with large companies is they tend to pigeonhole you into a role. 

My problem is that I can't seem to find job opportunities for smaller companies through the usual channels - Indeed, LinkedIn, my network of people who mostly work at large companies.

I think I’m not built for the corporate world, and I’m slowly trying to accept that.

Don’t get me wrong. I’ve worked for big, well-known companies over the years. I think they saw potential in me. I think they believed I could bring something to the table. And I do my job. I meet expectations. I’m not perfect, but I try, and I think I do fairly well. I'm not ungrateful, in fact I cherish every opportunity and generosity given to me by all these companies.

But despite all that, I constantly feel drained. I lack motivation. Everything feels like a burden. My brain is always in fight-or-flight mode, and I dread Sundays because I know Monday’s coming. I live for the weekend, and that doesn’t feel right.

Yes, my current boss is horrible and that makes things worse, but even in my previous job where things were chill and I had a good boss and decent coworkers, I still felt unfulfilled. I hated how unchallenged I was. I felt like I wasn’t growing or living up to what I’m capable of.

So now I’m wondering: is it me? Am I just not passionate? Lazy? Burnt out? Or maybe… I’m just not meant for this kind of life.

* I’m **fairly decent in DSA** \- did almost 150 problems in leetcode and can pick up things quickly.

**Main Issue** : I know a **little bit of a lot** but lack deep specialization.

other than that i always thought about wanting to open up my own bakery but that seems a little out there. i also don’t want to have to attend college for 4 years, i’d much more prefer to get a certificate. i honestly just don’t know what i’m interested in or would be good at. 

i love math, solving puzzles and problems, i don’t mind working with my hands as long as it isn’t a health risk, and i wouldn’t mind an office job. so if anyone has any ideas i’d truly appreciate them. 😔",St-Trina-,1,1.0,4,1746108898,2025-05-01 14:14:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kc9scw/no_clue_what_to_do_with_my_life/,5,2025
1kc9l32,To stay (keep pension) or go (potentially make way more),"# Background info

I am going through an interview process currently for another company. This new position is still in tech but has a bit of a sales, demo, architecting side to it. I have great interpersonal skills so being in front of customers is not an issue for me. My current company I have been at for over six years. I am somewhat wanting to leave because the promotion game is slow and getting into leadership is even slower - by design.

Below is some info about the choice I will have to make.

## Current Job
- Makes 110,000
- Bonus every year (7-13k)
- I have a gigantic PTO bank and has a massive cap
- Pension that I believe pays out 85% of average of best 3 years and also provides some health insurance thing if I stay over 20 years
- Everyone likes me
- Job is pretty chill
- I am essentially WFH (boss does not care if I ever come into office)
- Currently en route to a promotion to be a lead, though...no clue when that will be (I predict within a year)
- Great company culture

## Potential Job
- Will make around 300,000k
- Bonuses are quarterly and those are part of what makes up my salary (base would be around 189k)
- PTO has some roll over but super fair
- No pension
- I know nobody, this was a refferal from a friend's friend who I've chatted with several times
- Job, once you get going, seems chill. Friend's friend has never once brought up any struggle with the job or massive downsides. Good work/life balance.
- WFH, plus ""some"" travel
- Company culture seems really good and supportive

I am approaching my late 30s. I am thinking about retirement. With my current job I know I will be in leadership by that time and my pension will be awesome, my investments will be solid, and there will be a lot of security. 

With this new position there are far more unknowns, but the salary could possibly mean early retirement. I do not spend a lot of money and have very, very little debt. I budget fairly well and dont have strong consumer urge.

I am unsure of what to ask myself. I grew up around the poverty line and worked super hard and with a lot of luck I am now here. I want to make sure 65 year old me is ok. None of this is to show off or be flashy or make anyone feel bad. 

What should I be asking myself? What are your opinions?

Thank you in advance!! ",FOD17,2,1.0,1,1746108374,2025-05-01 14:06:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kc9l32/to_stay_keep_pension_or_go_potentially_make_way/,5,2025

1kc8mg7,I'm completely lost. What should I do?,"I’m 23 (turning 24 this month), from Hungary, about to finish my BSc in Business Administration at the country’s top business school. My GPA is low (~3.5/5) because of extreme dissociation due to non-existent mental health, and I couldn’t get into any master's abroad (my high school GPA and exit exams were all the highest grade so I'm sure I'm intellectually capable). I have no real work experience — just a short, perfume sales promoter job I took to fulfill my internship requirement after dozens of rejections from corporations.

Right now I feel like I have no skills, no direction, and no clarity. What I want most is financial independence and to eventually relocate. I’m committed to make it right. — I’ve already started to upskill in programming on the side and I’m ready to work hard now — but I don’t know what decision will actually lead somewhere.

The two local education options I applied for (I can choose either until July, or none at all) are a 3-year BSc in Computer Science (most likely directly followed by a good MSc abroad, because of academic excellence this time) or doing a 2-year MSc in Business Informatics at the same school I'm attending, with options for semester(s) abroad. Both have pros and cons, but I’m not confident either is the right choice. And I'm not confident in the markets I'm aiming for either, and I'm afraid of being stuck on lower levels my whole career due to ageism, or being chained to my country forever. I’m stuck and afraid of making another mistake.

1kc6r83,Need advice! Oracle Associate Technical Support Engineer or SAP Concur Consultant?,"Hello everyone, I would really appreciate your advice on my ongoing job applications with these two companies. For a bit of context, I've recently graduated with a degree in accounting and I've decided that I want to pursue ERP functional consulting as a career. That being said, I'm torn between these two companies/ERP software. I've listed pros and cons for both, and I would love to know what you think I should go for, should I receive offers from both of them. I do realize that I'm posting this to a SAP subreddit, but I mainly want to take my chances if some of you here have had experience with both. I'll also post this in other subreddits in a while as well.

  
**Option 1: Oracle NetSuite**

Role: Associate Technical Support Engineer

Job Description:

* Provide technical support to Oracle global customers
* Deliver resolution through inbound and outbound phone calls and emails
* Perform highly complex troubleshooting and analysis
* Actively work with Quality Assurance and Development teams to report design, reliability and maintenance problems or bugs
* In this role, you will be our customers’ first point of contact, responsible for delivering world-class customer support experience to maximize their use of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software.
* Continue to practice, train your expertise in accounting, and acquire new skills in performing it in an IT Industry.
* As a primary point of contact for customers, you are responsible for facilitating customer relationships with Support and providing advice and assistance to internal Oracle employees on diverse customer situations and escalated issues

Pros:

* More competitive starting salary than the SAP role, around 50% more.
* 2 days in the office, 3 days working from home
* Some modules that I can choose to specialize in are directly related with accounting.
* Bootcamp training provided.

Cons:

* The biggest dealbreaker for me: this is a customer support role, rather than a consulting one.
* Majority of my shifts would be answering calls and providing technical support (which doesn't interest me as much)
* Night shift, from 10 PM to 7 AM.
* Not much salary increases/promotions afterwards (Glassdoor)



**Option 2: SAP Concur**

Role: SAP Concur: Care Services Consultant

Job Description:

* Onboard new customer or partner projects: facilitate data gathering for the implementation project.
* Validate and define expectations and scope of work
* Serve as ongoing point of contact for an assigned portfolio of customers in relation to Post-Implementation Services
* Escalation management: coordination and documentation of customer escalations
* Triage: review and route client queries and service requests to appropriate teams
* Manage the project transition processes between Services and Support
* Assist with the onboarding activities for new members (training and knowledge transfer)
* Service Request / Case work, as assigned per training, knowledge and experience
* Customer Project work, as assigned per training, knowledge and experience 
* Any other similar task or responsibility as may be reasonably required

Pros:

* Matches exactly what I am looking for in an ERP consulting role.
* SAP is the global ERP software leader
* Free SAP certifications and training provided 
* Mid-shift, 1 PM to 10 PM (which works really well for me)

Cons:

* From what I've researched, SAP Concur is one of their lesser interesting products, with a lot of negative feedback online (Reddit)
* I wanted to specialize in SAP FICO instead given my background and the market demand, but there are no openings for this (well, at least for a fresh graduate also)
* Lower starting salary, but annual promotions and increases (Glassdoor)



**TLDR: Do I opt for the Associate Technical Support Engineer role in NetSuite, and transition to being a NetSuite functional consultant, or do I go for the SAP Concur Consultant role, and transition to a different module of my interest? Which is more feasible to do? Which ERP software pays off better in the long run?**

1kc6kjj,Need a career change,"I am feeling very lost and need a career change. I’ve never really felt like I had a proper career path—more like a series of missteps—and I’m at the point where I can’t keep job-hopping and need to figure things out for real.

I studied footwear design at uni (yeah, I know super niche lol),  but I was 18 and liked shoes. I worked in the industry for 3 years, and honestly, I found I had little / no passion for it. Progression looks slow, the pay wasn't great, and the hours were long.  I eventually left and moved into administrative work, which I’m doing now. But admin work just feels boring and not challenging enough for me.

Lately, I’ve been thinking more seriously about science and sustainability. I enjoyed the research and sustainability side of design? I recently completed some short courses and I loved science back in school—I actually did Forensic Science at A-level. I’m really interested in the intersection of science, data, (research) and sustainability. I feel so stuck career wise, that I am strong considering doing a Data Science Master’s just to get back into a field that feels more meaningful.

However, I have a footwear design degree and I'm afraid that if I apply universities will take one look at my degree laugh and reject me for data science or other science-related paths.

I’m just trying to figure out if there’s a career that combines sustainability, science, research, and doesn’t require me to retrain for years.

If anyone has been in a similar situation or has a suggestions for career paths or master’s options I Would love to hear your thoughts.

I've been working in the PR industry for the last 3 years. I worked at my first company for 2 years, then another agency for 3.5 months. Now, I have just completed 3.5 months at my current workplace but this job is gruelling, toxic, demotivating, and makes me feel helpless. Anyone who's in PR will tell you that it's a team job but here I'm expected to do everything alone. Not getting into too many details but I've had more anxiety attacks and breakdowns in this job than I have ever had in my whole life.

I want to quit but don't have another job lined up. Due to some health issues, I'm limiting myself to remote job opportunities but haven't been able to land a single interview. My current job is remote and that's the only reason I've stayed so far, but now I just can't take it anymore and don't want to inflict further mental damage upon myself by staying in this organisation.

I know it's not advisable to quit a job without backup but is there anything else I can do? Are there any job portals aside from LinkedIn, indeed, naukri etc where I can find remote jobs.

I need your wisdom to escape my banking nightmare and pivot into a meaningful, growth-driven career. If you’ve ever felt stuck, please hear me out—I desperately need fresh perspectives!

**Quick Career Background:**

* **Federal Bank** *(4 yrs 7 mos)* — Managed branch operations and gold-loan portfolios. Learned solid ops and customer service—but no meaningful growth.
* **BetterStudio (Startup)** *(1 yr)* — Ran end-to-end Sales & Finance. Loved startup chaos and gained hands-on entrepreneurial experience.
* **HDFC Bank** *(3 months only, thankfully)* — Relationship Manager role.→ **Red Flags:**
   * **Micromanagement nightmare** – constant location check-ins (felt like surveillance!)
   * **Toxic sales culture** – pushing credit cards & third-party products under the guise of “service”
   * **Dead-end HR system** – grievances vanish, no action, zero empathy from managementQuit ASAP—realized quickly it was career poison.
   * **Current Situation:**
* **CTC:** ₹13 LPA (I’m okay stepping down temporarily if it sets me up for a more meaningful career.)
* I genuinely want a career, not just another toxic job.
* No more branch banking—absolutely done with sales-driven targets.
* **Where I’m aiming:**
* **Consulting**, **Customer Success**, **IT**, **FinTech**, or anything similar. I’m curious, adaptable, and ready to dive deep to learn new skills.

**What I really need your advice on:**

* **Skill recommendations:** Which specific, high-impact skills should I quickly acquire to make myself attractive outside banking?
* **Certifications or short courses:** Ones that truly move the needle and help break into consulting, tech, or CSM?
* **Entry routes or job roles:** Realistic titles or functions that ex-bankers commonly shift into successfully?
* **Mistakes or pitfalls:** Stuff I must absolutely avoid when pivoting from banking to consulting or tech?

If you’ve made a similar jump, seen others do it successfully, or even failed and learned something valuable, please drop a comment. I appreciate blunt honesty—no sugarcoating needed!

**Thanks a ton for reading!**

Ex-banker (Federal & HDFC, 5 yrs total), escaped toxic micromanagement at HDFC (constant location check-ins, dead HR, credit-card obsession). Want to pivot into Consulting, CSM, or IT.

1kc3lxu,I think I’m about to be dismissed,"So I started this job at a corner store a while back, I specified that I was disabled but did not specify what it was as is my right. 
(It is currently under investigation by my Doctor, I don’t know whats wrong with me, but I know it does effect my daily life) 

So I have had two sickness absences, two. One was because I had a ruptured gum and had to go to A&E, and the other because my health had gotten so bad. Both absences lasted one shift. 

Two days ago my boss pulled me into the office and told me I was being investigated because two absences was “ridiculous” and that it wasn’t fair on the team to cover my shifts. He said they had to close the shop early and that the area manager told him off because of that and because my Boss hadnt filled in my return to work forms. But… that isn’t my fault right? I burst into tears and told him that I didn’t know what to tell him, and that I didn’t know what to do. I couldnt help crying because of how baffled and helpless I felt, and my manager was being so cruel as well. 

So the next day, I come in and start my shift, I end up being in so much pain that I am doubled over in tears, and end up having to go to the hospital. My boss later sends me the following text which ill copy paste: 

“Was at football training with son. Only just finished and seen all the missed calls and messages. U really need to think about wat u need to do going forward as this cannot continue anymore. It’s not fair on the rest of the team to pick up the pieces. Enough is enough now.”

And, I don’t know if this is an okay thing to say???? while I was literally in the hospital???? Through this whole thing I feel like my rights as somebody who is disabled are being infringed on. I feel like I have had no 
support. 

So now this morning my boss texted me and asked if I could call him when I was free, and I really do not want to. 

What do I do? Do I speak to a union rep? My work doesn’t have its own HR department that I know of but its parent company does. I’m only 20 and I’ve never been taught how all this works. Do I answer my boss or do I refuse to speak until I speak to a union rep, how do I even do that? I just feel so lost all while I’m going through a medical crisis.

I'm on my 3rd year of a 5 year master's degree. I always wanted to immigrate out of Tunisia since I was a teenager due to the horrible economy and mediocre life conditions. I'm thinking of going to Canada/Europe/Australia by getting a computer science related job there.

I've been a military enthusiast since I was a kid and always wanted to have some military experience. But I don't want to spend multiple years of my life in the military because I want to spend my youth pursuing other passions and the military limits that.

I've been contemplating the idea of volunteering for a year of military service in the Tunisian army. It is a good opportunity to get some military experience that doesn't take too much time from my youth. It also presents an opportunity for a job I'm passionate about. Maybe I'll work on some computer science projects during my free time to beef up my CV. Then once I'm done I'll find a job abroad and immigrate.

Otherwise once I graduate I will have finished a half year long internship that's apart of the curriculum, then I'd find a job and apply to foreign jobs until I get a job offer. This is if I don't volunteer for a year of military service.

I'm wondering if anyone here has served in any army or any any branch of any military, or knows a relative that is serving/has served. Or has general knowledge of mandatory military service.

1kc33xf,Should I change units (police work)?,"Hey, new account for some reasons.

I serve in a sort of ""special unit"" in the police force in my country, not really sure how to describe it other than ""major crimes"" that I saw on tv a few times.

Long story short I feel like moving units, the new unit I'm considering is a whole lot different. The new unit has a lot of upsides, better pay, kinda close to home like the old unit (maybe even more) etc. The main upside that made me consider is a better designation, meaning the old unit has kinda lost its ways even though it's a ""special unit"", and the new one is pretty much a pretty basic unit, but adding the location and the mission it turns out to be much more interesting, and more of ""giving to my country"" and contributing.

What stops me is pretty simple. I'm currently in my unit for a few good years, I've built my name and reputation, got to know a lot of people, and the main upside is a good work-home balance. My hours are pretty okayish, off days and everything is pretty flexible, while in the new unit I might give up these luxuries, and I start all over (with building my name).

1kc28dp,My manager told me to figure it out after I had asked what to do,"So, I received an email regarding a task and on the body of the email, my manager said that he was waiting on the plan to resolve the task.

He just sent me the email saying this was the the documentation and after reading the email, I assumed that since the email said he was waiting for the plan to resolve it from who he was talking with in the email that I was waiting as well.

Now, when the task was coming to its deadline, I asked my manager what his advise was. He just told me that he forwarded it to me in the beginning so I could take a stab at it and figure it out myself and thats why he sent me that email. He said that it was the second time it happened and I should be able to figure it out but I don’t recall even doing it. To me, the instructions weren’t clear and re-reading the email, I assumed that based on what he said that he was waiting on someone to resolve it. He didn’t let me know about it before nor did he talk about it with me— so i didnt even know that it was my task to solve it.

I know that he wants me to show initiative and he made me feel bad saying that I should’ve know thats what his intent was but I cant help feel dumb.

The problem itself wasnt hard. I just asked the other manager how he resolved it before and he showed me what he did prior two years ago.

Am I not showing initiative enough? How do I avoid this again?

1kc1zsd,"How do I explain leaving a law firm after working there for six months, and applying to another law firm without saying too much?","I worked at a law firm I will refer to as Law Firm A, for 6 months. I was a case manager. I hated my job but I was decent enough to be eligible for re-hire when I quit. I was a personal injury case manager.

The real reason I quit was because I was committed to a psychiatric facility for over a month. I was a danger to myself. I have zero regrets leaving, it was for the best. 

Anyway, at law firm B, I have an interview for an intake specialist position. They do personal injury law, but also worker's compensation like the last firm. Inevitably, they will ask me why I left the previous job, what I've been doing the last 6 months, and now why I want to work for a different firm. Maybe I'm overthinking this but:

*I wanted to switch roles into the intake specialist position, however there was no available position. I had thus decided to tend to family matters.* 

I don't want to go back to Law Firm A.

1kc1xfv,Manager trying to sabotage me ?,"Hi all
Wanted to get some advice.

I've been in this company for a few months. My manager joined two weeks before me. Ever since I have started he seems very threatened by me (overall I have much more extensive experience).

He has consistently come to me to ask me for my ideas and then takes them to senior leadership as his own without ever mentioning me or giving me credit. He has purposely kept me out of many meetings where senior leadership are present despite the fact that the meetings fully pertain to my domain. He has kept me out of internal trainings and overall has succeeded in preventing me from being visible with his manager and senior management. 

I of course feel deflated but don't know how to approach the situation strategically. It seems like he is trying to sabotage me.

What would be the best course of action? Because the job is new and I have moved abroad for it with my family I would not want to quite but it is a very disappointing situation as it seems he is succeeding.",Flat_Reference_2372,3,1.0,3,1746080160,2025-05-01 06:16:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kc1xfv/manager_trying_to_sabotage_me/,5,2025
1kc1vbx,A newbie with 9 to 5 job,"Hello, I am a 20 F who just started working 9 to 5. Its been a week. I completed my graduation and started working after a month itself. Right now I'm in the training phase where they train us how to work around and how to do stuff. However I have to sit in the office from 9 to 5 or at times 7 just to observe how my seniors work. I am tired even before it has started. It seems like such a sedentary lifestyle and I hate the timings because I can't get much done after I go home. I am so mentally exhausted that I just can't get myself to do anything. I hated these timings in uni itself. There are multiple positives and negatives but right now my mind is clouded with the negatives only.i really want to see some positives in this. I'll tell some.
Positives:
It's a bit close to my house - 30 to 40 mins commute.
I know one of the seniors closely.
The office is very chill and they are not strict.
It's not toxic currently.
Negatives:
It's Monday to Friday but for six months I have Saturday Sunday full day classes as well.
The timingssss!!! 9 to 7 at times
Biggest negative:
NO HOLIDAY POLICY It's like a mutual feeling in the office that the employees do not take a day off!! I love vacations. I feel they restore my soul and rejuvenate it. But in this office people are not allowing a single holiday!!!! Even if you're sick you have to attend for atleast 9 to 1. Like how???? You can't  go out of town because you can't take a holiday this is bugging me the most.


Please please help me see the positives in this situation. I'm just entering my twenties and I see myself getting stuck with this job. 

I desperately want to see the positives of this job. Because in this world regression problem  people are not getting jobs and getting a job is a privilege itself.

Also tell if it's a good idea to continue this job for a expected  long term. I won't be paid for the first 6 months. That is according to them - their training period.

My idea:
A browser extension that works while you browse job listings. Here's what it does:

Instantly analyzes your resume against the job description you're viewing.

Highlights missing skills/keywords.

Suggests edits to better match the role (using AI).

Gives a fit score (like how well your resume aligns).

Lets you apply with a tailored version in one click.


Optional extras: ATS check, version tracking (which resume got you callbacks), and LinkedIn/Notion integration to organize your job hunt.

My ask:
Would a tool like this actually be useful for you?
What features would you want or not care about?
Would you pay for something like this (or use it if free)?

1kbzxiz,Help! Less than 5 years experience but a Senior Manager,"I (25M) currently work at Amazon in Operations. I joined after college as an L4 University Hire making $49,500/yr or $63,000 TC. 4 long nonstop grinding years later of 65-80 hours a week I am now a L7 Senior Operations Manager. I got promoted to this role in the fall of ‘24. I’ve worked my butt off to get to this position and I am the youngest L7 in my network by about 10 years.  My current base is $135,000 and my TC is closer to $220,000. 

I still work around 65-70 hours a week and am never truly not on call. I graduated college with a Business Management degree and do not have an MBA. 

I am looking to break into the PM field for another FAANG company but am not wanting to sacrifice for a lower base or TC. Every job I look at that is comparable in scope to my current states that I would need 8-10 years+ experience. I am quickly getting burnt out at Amazon and want a change. I would like a more corporate facing job as working in distribution centers was never my ideal career or path I wanted to take - just the first and only job I got out of college. I am unable to transfer within Amazon because I have to stay for a year at my building. It’s also incredibly competitive to switch from operations to corporate at Amazon at the L7 level which means I’d have to down level. I’m also not in love with Amazons culture anymore nor where it’s trending which is why I’m looking for a change. I’m open to other non-FAANG companies as well. I also am not entirely sure what job my skills would be valuable in. I thoroughly enjoy setting and achieving goals, teaching and developing others, have strong inter-personal skills, love math and making quantifiable decisions. This leads me to believe from what I’ve read that PM would be a good fit for me but I’m open to other ideas/thoughts. 

What advice do you have for roles that are similar in scope/TC that I would be able to at least get an interview for even with my ‘baby’ years of experience?

So, I was wondering, since I do want to spend my first year shadowing and exploring medicine/becoming a doctor as a potential option and I don't want to change my college as of now (I can think about transferring later, but I'm currently an OOS student at the college I'll be starting in the fall and I have a pretty nice scholarship. There's one in-state school I have that's even half decent and it would be a bit more expensive, if not around the same price. So I don't even want to think about shifting places until I'm settled), what are my other options with this degree?

I would most likely want to apply to a master's program unless there are jobs that pay well with just a biomed undergrad BS. I doubt there are. What kind of jobs pay well? I am very interested in getting into medical *research* (I would prefer clinical because I know academia doesn't have a track record of paying well), I'm also open to exploring biotech and pharma. I just don't know what the salaries look like for that and what kind of jobs pay well.

I'm also thinking I could potentially go for a master's in biomedical engineering? However my undergrad degree won't be in engineering so I would probably have to change that beforehand. Which would be a whole new hassle, but it's just a backseat thought.

I am very lost as to what kind of direction I'm thinking I want to pursue. Any guidance would be appreciated. I am only 18 so there is no pressure, but some general advice would be helpful.

I even told her I can still be there it’ll just be a few hours late.

1kbxlz5,How foolish would it be to drop my teaching scholarship/internship and pay back $5000? (20F),"Hi,

I am currently studying to be a high school history teacher. The education program at my school is painfully political, and it makes me genuinely want to drop the program. Some days, the idea of teaching sounds like what I was meant to do. Other days, like today, the idea sounds dreadful. The education system here in the US is broken and desperately needs to be revamped, and everything is far too political and polarizing.

I also tutor elementary school and high school students and I for sure do not want to do elementary ed LOL. However, some days with the high schoolers I am more positive it's what I want to do with my life. And other days it sounds like the last thing I want.

Not only that, I find my history classes uninspiring. I have already tried to switch my major to biology education, but I would not have been able to graduate in time. I have had only one history professor that sparked my love for the subject. I do not like doing the readings or writing, and I do not want to do research.

I think teaching is one of the most important professions. I just sometimes get in my head and worry that it is not enough -- that I won't have as big of an impact as I would like to. Part of me feels like I picked this major because it was the easy choice for me -- I've always loved school, my teachers, and learning. However since going to college, all of those things for me became the opposite. I am not the best student, I don't love school anymore, and I am not sure what peaks my interests.

I do not know what I would do if I switched from teaching. My school is also HUGE (35,000+ people) and I KNOW I picked the wrong school. I wish I picked a smaller school. I have looked into transferring, but it did not work out. I also feel like I picked this school and major because my parents love this school and have a deep respect for teachers. My sisters are also going to school for teaching. I have always aimed to please them and make them happy (we have a complicated relationship).

I currently have a teaching scholarship/internship that lasts through all of my years in college, plus five years after I graduate. Each school year I get about $2,500 in scholarship money. Over the summer, I work/teach/observe at a summer school to build up my 'teacher toolkit.' During this time, I also receive a $2,000 living stipend. I live in a nearby college dorm, and I have no expenses during that time besides my own basic necessities. However, I must reside in the state this scholarship was granted in, and teach in that state for five years after I graduate. During that time I receive a veteran teacher mentor, and various supports to help me within those first years.

As of now, all of the money received from this organization is refunded to my account, as my family qualifies for Pell Grants and various other state grants (which I had to pay a majority back of for taxes RIP). I have the money to pay the scholarships back at once with no interest. I am just wondering if this would be considered a poor choice on my behalf.

A more minute reason for this contemplation is that I am in a very serious LDR. If I stayed in this internship, we are looking at 7 years MINIMUM of LDR. I absolutely positively do not want to do that. I am not built for that long of LDR. My partner is graduating in Spring '26, and plans to go to a specific school across the country. Engineering jobs aren't plentiful where I am located so they probably won't move to where I am at.

This sounds so naive, but I feel more than certain that this is my person, and I know if I stick with teaching that I could find a teaching job nearly anywhere. I want to experience the world and be with them, and not be stuck in this state. And some districts provide mentors for your first few years of teaching.

I feel like I am being negative. But I genuinely feel so lost and am worried that I will not be happy if I stay locked in for five years.  Part of me is saying 'it's only five years.' In the grand scheme of things, that's no time at all. How poor of an idea would it be to drop it? Should I just take the risk?

Thank you for reading!!

Edit : TLDR; I am feeling very on/off feelings about wanting to be a teacher, my school, and major. If I drop my internship,I’d have to pay back $5000, and would lose out on opportunities provided by the organization Edit - clarification: I will stay in school and pursue the education degree, just not the internship/scholarship",Ok_Tourist_8912,4,1.0,2,1746064765,2025-05-01 01:59:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kbxlz5/how_foolish_would_it_be_to_drop_my_teaching/,5,2025

I am currently in a cybersecurity class, and I love doing it. However, I'd struggle a bit but it wouldn't be anything to where I'd feel like I wouldn't be able to do it. But I am passing with an A.

As for psychology, I am taking a psychology class, and I love learning about disorders and whatnot. 

I enjoy both of them, but I can't decide what I want to do. I want to have a stable living and everything, but I am also not a big math person.

1kbwurm,"I admitted I’d seen the question before, then got rejected","I just received a rejection letter for a Data Scientist role at CVS, the one I interviewed for three weeks ago. I remember the interview started off smoothly; I even started imagining my future workdays 😅. Everything was going well until the turning point: The interviewer asked me something I had definitely seen online before. I answered and then they paused and asked, ""Have you seen this question before? Your answer sounds very prepared."" I didn’t think too much and replied honestly, “Yeah, I made my cheatsheet from questions I found online.”   
The interviewer’s expression changed instantly, like summer weather, and they didn’t say much after that. Then today, I got the rejection letter.  
  
Now I’m sitting here wondering is it wrong to prepare with real questions that are already floating around on public blogs? Isn’t that just smart prep?

1kbwu0y,Help! My coworker who’s 20+ years older than me has a crush on me!,"For context I (21f) started at my municipal job 8 months ago. I was 20 then and just turned 21 two weeks ago. I of course had to meet with IT to set up computers and everything and noticed he was a fan of “The Office” me being the dumb naive young woman that I am I thought ‘Hey, thats cool. I like that show too!’ I never thought anything of it. We talked about that one tv show and work.

I would help with IT problems when he was out of office as the Marketing manager for our municipality. I would have to give him missed call slips and things like that making me go to his office. Apparently somewhere along the way I gave out mixed signals?

I mostly started noticing it last week when I sent out an email at work saying “Hey, I just turned 21. We’re going out for drinks after work. Everyone is welcome to come.” He was the only male that showed up.  My other coworker added him to a text group chat we had going for those of us that were going. That’s how he got my number. Since then it’s been non stop texting and I was off put by it. I would respond with one word replies or a thumbs up. I would also not respond to the messages which to anyone else would indicate someone no longer wanted to communicate. I wasn’t trying to give out any indication that the feeling was mutual.

He is a very awkward guy. He has no social cues really and doesn’t have any family in our area. He has no friends and I kind of felt bad for him because he said the girl who had my job before me would just drop off the slips and not even say a word to him. That made me feel sad. I’m a very bubbly outgoing person and I want to try and make everyone feel included. I’m assuming he mistook my kindness as being interested.

Fast forward to yesterday I’m in his office giving him the while you were out slips and he said. “I heard you want to see a movie that’s coming out, want to go see it with me?” And I was kind of taken aback. First of all I didn’t know what the hell he was talking about. Then I said.  “I’m gonna go see that with my mom.” You know cause I’m 21 just graduated college and STILL LIVE WITH MY MOM!

Then I immediately texted my mom being like WTF do I do??? My mom said I kinda figured he was creep.

Today, I asked 3 of my very trusted coworkers who I get along with great and we tell each other a lot of personal things what they had thought.

I was not ready for their thoughts! Basically all three had said “well I thought there was something going on there.” My reply was. “Why didn’t you say anything? or give me a clue?” They all basically said well we didn’t know how you felt.

And now I’m kinda freaking out. What do I say to him? How do I handle this? My mom said “Say I was showing my mom the pictures of everyone when we got drinks for my birthday. She asked how old you are and then get his response and be like. OMG YOUR OLD ENOUGH TO BE MY DAD. And hopefully he’d get the hint.”

I do plan on stopping entering his office ever again even if it is for work. His office in the back corner where no one can see you and frankly I just don’t feel comfortable around him anymore. I will email him and include my supervisor for all future work needs.

What do I do to keep this professional? How can I keep this strictly work!?

Anyway, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, so much for reading my rant.",vntrvstwxrthy_,22,0.5899999737739563,172,1746062376,2025-05-01 01:19:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kbwu0y/help_my_coworker_whos_20_years_older_than_me_has/,5,2025
1kbwnm6,Need advice on returning to work with terrible resume,"For context, I was diagnosed with a serious illness at 20. Still graduated from a top 30 undergrad w/ an econ degree. Worked temp jobs for a couple months, couldn't really hack it due to illness. Went the CPA route, another year of online cc classes, worked at a small public accounting firm for a year, took a year off to study for exams. Illness was still badly affecting me all the while. After that I worked at 2 top 25 firms, but only for 3 months each. Another year absence after this, got a job at a medium sized non-profit for 6 months. Still couldn't really hack it with the condition affecting me. So, my resume just has these really short stints on it, and long absences.

Recently, a sort of miracle occurred, and we happened upon an off-label use for a commonly prescribed medication that has kind of breathed life into me again. I can work for like 12-14 hours a day max though.

How do I re-enter the workforce now? Do i leave the short stints off my resume, but then it will be very short? Do I have to just start my own business doing bookkeeping/taxes (not too confident in my tax knowledge)? Change careers? Any tips?

1kbvlch,"What’s worse when trying to land a new competitive job in biotech: your current company having a half-assed website or not being listed under the company page on their sleeker, upgraded website?","Until just recently I was a business consultant (contractor) for a small biotech startup. I had started to feel that I was being underutilized (I have an MBA and prior to that spent several years as a FTE in Big Tech), but had not been expecting to essentially be let go, especially as it had been the CEO who recruited me. I had previously pushed to take on more responsibility, but between my boss/CEO struggling to cede control and cash flow issues due to lack of revenue, it did not happen.

I was sold on their platform's value proposition, but one of the things I had insisted on from the get-go was improving the website, which had looked like it was straight out of 1998 when I joined. I was then allowed to make some very minor Improvements in my first few weeks, but it was being hosted on Weebly (IYKYK) and my boss was so reluctant to spend money for a professional that it stayed that way for months after.

It wasn’t until we started to see some success with social media posting (which I pushed) that he finally agreed to revisit the topic of the website again. He was still budget-conscious, so we met in the middle and hired a web developer on Upwork. For the most part the developer put the site together in the technical sense and I asked for some input from my boss, but I was the primary driver of the project and its vision. When the developer went on vacation for 2 weeks (annoying), I was the one going in and learning Wordpress to make the changes my boss kept requesting. I finally got the site to the point where it was ready to be migrated to the new host and launched but just needed the final licensing purchases to be completed from my boss’ end. Unfortunately, that’s around when my boss informed me that he didn’t believe they could justify keeping me on.

Anyways, it’s been a couple weeks since my last day on that job and I’m still looking for a new one. I had made it to the final rounds of 2 companies, including a company I was really stoked about and had prepared a ton for. Sadly, I did not get offers from either. I understand that while it’s not as bad as 2023, it’s still a tough market out there, and competition is fierce. And I can’t help but wonder if the unprofessionalism of my company’s recent website is reflecting poorly on me.

So here’s the kicker: this company has still not removed me from their Slack channel so I can see that they’re starting to talk about the website again. Before I left, I made sure to hold an uncomplicated training/handoff session for the couple people who were to take on my responsibilities, but they still seem to be struggling. Which has me thinking whether it might be prudent to reach back out to my former boss and see if he wants me to help them finish it. It’d be a bit embarrassing to admit that I still don’t have a new job, but the possible silver lining would be that he might even be amenable to me being listed on the new site (my bio is already on the waiting draft), at least until I find a new job. The risk is that he could also say no and I would effectively have to help them launch the new shiny website but with me **removed** from it, thereby making it harder for me to pass off like I am still employed.

There’s more context and details I can add, but for the sake of length I left it at that for now.

Any guidance is very much appreciated!

1kbvjnm,Are you supposed to enjoy your career?,"I recently graduated college and have been working my first job for the past 1.5 years. It is a finance leadership development program. Decent pay, $73k+$10k starting bonus. It is very demanding, and during busy seasons it’s not unusual to work 60+ hour weeks. I haven’t been good at the job either probably due to my approach to the work, my inexperience, and a “terrible manager” according to my peers. 

While my friends pursued IB and bragged about their 100+ hour weeks ultimately to bail after 2 years, I kind of envisioned a chill 9-5 out of college with good WLB. However, that isn’t exactly realistic all of the time. I’m also still living at home to save on rent since my parents are close to work. 

During a work happy hour my coworker asked me my happiness on a scale from 1-10 and I said 4. I haven’t really done any travel (I don’t even have my passport). I’m also looking at other jobs but I have no idea what I want to look for. Senior analyst title sure, but I probably won’t get it. I’m applying to everything I can. 

I always knew I had an interest in sales or law but I saw those fields as oversaturated, and I want to actually provide for my family so finance and accounting was the way to go. However, I don’t know if I will ever be happy in my career.

1kbvczh,"Is this a comms failure, a leadership miss… or did I (22M) mess something up?","TL;DR:
Multiple teams accused mine of missing a delivery. I checked with the actual owner of the dependency and confirmed it wasn’t even ready. Despite this, leadership kept saying communication was clear. So why were teams building and blaming off the wrong timeline? What failed here—and how do you navigate this when you’re not senior but you’re the one catching the disconnects?

I’m a junior-ish product person in a large, complex cross-functional program. A situation recently unfolded that’s left me trying to unpack where things really went wrong—and whether I’m the only one seeing it.

One of the teams I support was being repeatedly asked why something hadn’t been done—why a dependency hadn’t been acted on. Several teams flagged it as a blocker and assumed it had already been delivered. But I checked directly with the person who owns the input, and it turns out the dependency wasn’t ready at all—it hadn’t even completed earlier prep work. So no, it wasn’t on my team to have done anything yet.

The confusing part is:
	•	Leadership keeps saying communication was clear and timelines were known
	•	But downstream teams built work assuming things were ready in March/April
	•	And I was repeatedly asked where things were, even though I wasn’t responsible for procurement or readiness

I kept going back to the one person who does own procurement. And every single time, he’d confirm:
I was right, the others were wrong, and the asset wasn’t ready.
And still, some parts of leadership would go back to their teams and push completely different narratives—telling them it was ready or that we’d dropped the ball, even though that was never relayed to me and was objectively false.

I’ve raised this calmly, built out documentation and tracking tools, and tried to clarify where the gaps were—but no one has acknowledged the confusion or taken any real accountability. No apologies. No reflection. Just the sense that maybe I am the one who misunderstood something. But the person responsible continues to confirm I didn’t.

So here’s my question:
What actually failed here? Was this poor communication? A leadership gap? Normal chaos in big orgs? Or did I miss something critical and just not realize it?

Would love thoughts on how others handle this kind of thing—especially when you’re early in your career but find yourself caught in the middle of decisions and assumptions no one else is questioning.",Any_Intern1858,1,1.0,2,1746057912,2025-05-01 00:05:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kbvczh/is_this_a_comms_failure_a_leadership_miss_or_did/,5,2025
