1ggsh78,How to push back on the terms of a job offer? ,"So a bit of context, I recently just got offered a role at one of my dream companies to work for. The role requires 24 hour coverage from the team so from the get go it was advertised as requiring some unorthodox scheduling. Originally when applying for the job and interviewing for it, I was told the schedule would involve a Sunday - Thursday or Tuesday - Saturday work week and may involve night shifts at some times. Since finding out I was successful in the role, they have since told me my schedule would be Saturday - Wednesday and an afternoon / evening shift. 

When I first received the offer, I asked them about the original work week which was advertised and they told me the team had to “reassess coverage needs” and they might be able to rotate me in future so I won’t work the entire weekend (this is not listed in the contract though). 

Is it fair for me to push back on this given I was never advised of the possibility of working the entire weekend? Also how can I do so in a professional way which could prompt them to reconsider? 

I am relatively flexible with shifts and am more than happy to work one day of the weekend + the evenings as they have requested. But the entire weekend would mean I never have a single day off to spend with my partner or family and I don’t know if I want to sign up for that.

1ggseyw,Feeling Overlooked at Work – Seeking Advice on How to Move Forward,"Hi everyone,

I’m in a tough spot at work and would appreciate any advice or shared experiences. Here’s the gist:

I’ve been leading the first product my company ever built, which I helped develop from scratch based on my idea. It’s been years of hard work and significant growth, reaching an impressive **≈**$3 million ARR. We started with 1 developer and we've grown to a team of 20 people with me initiating this effort.  
  
For the past two years, I was promised equity in the company as recognition for my contributions. Recently, leadership changed, and I was informed that no one would receive equity. To my surprise, the new hire that has become my new manager was given a significant percentage of the company, including ownership in the product I built. Without actually doing anything yet to prove worth.

This situation has left me feeling undervalued and unsure of my next steps. If anyone has been through a similar experience or has advice on handling this kind of situation, I’d really appreciate your insights. How did you cope with the emotional impact and decide what to do next?

Thanks in advance for any advice or support you can share.",Weak_Pop_8293,4,0.7599999904632568,2,1730418287,2024-10-31 23:44:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ggseyw/feeling_overlooked_at_work_seeking_advice_on_how/,10,2024
1ggs23j,Im doing way more work outside of my job description for the exact same pay with the promise of “more will come”,"I want to keep this short and sweet. I’m looking for advice on what I should do (if anything) and what should I say or talk to about being disgruntled.

I work on the dock for a warehouse where my primary duties are receiving and auditing incoming shipments while putting the inventory away accurately and updating our software on the computer to reflect inventory changes.

I would describe myself as someone who has a “good head on their shoulders”. I have a college degree and multiple IT certifications and I have the mindset of “Measure twice, cut once”. I do good work and I do it right, the first time. My bosses have noticed this and would describe me as someone who they can depend on and as they like to say “Our go to guy”. 

Because I am the “go to guy” my bosses have added additional work to my plate such as inventory procurement, internal inventory auditor, outsource inventory auditor, trainer. I even have a weekly meeting with the top 3 people in the company to go over our inventory and to describe any weird spikes or discrepancy’s. 

My boss has told me that the company is making a new position for me with higher pay and that I would even be getting back pay all while I continue to do this extra work. This “promise” was made 6 months ago and when I ask for an update there is always an excuse such as “we don’t have the budget rn” or “the paperwork has been filed and we’re just waiting on HR” or “I’ll see what I can do” all while I CONTINUE TO DO ALL THIS EXTRA WORK.

The thing that really irritates me is that our company has an internal inventory Manager who SHOULD be auditing the inventory

The company has a outsourced inventory manager who SHOULD be auditing the outsourced inventory inventory

The company has a procurement manager who SHOULD be fixing any procurement issues

The company has a dock manager who SHOULD be training the new guys

The company has 1st shift building managers who SHOULD be in the weekly meeting with the top bosses


The company has people to do all this extra work that I do but because they’re too busy or that I do it better they expect me to do it. It started as a favor for each department when people would take vacation time but since then has boiled over to my daily responsibilities all while I maintain the same pay.


I want to quit but I don’t want to quit unless I can land a job in IT because during my downtime my company doesn’t mind if I study to earn more IT certifications which is my real passion. I just tell myself to deal with it, earn these IT certifications and get a new job. However, these certifications take time and the job market sucks rn so it’s not as easy as getting another job in my field. 

I’ve reached the point at this company where I either want to be compensated fairly or keep my current pay and stop doing all this extra work.

How do I go about bringing this up to my boss?


TLDR; I’m doing extra work outside of my primary responsibilities. I want to be compensated fairly and continue the work I’m currently doing or keep my current pay and stop doing the extra work. How do I bring this up to my boss and what do I say?",Questillionair,1,0.6700000166893005,5,1730417261,2024-10-31 23:27:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ggs23j/im_doing_way_more_work_outside_of_my_job/,10,2024

1ggopdj,The Next Big Arenas of Competition,"
McKinsey has identified 18 potential arenas of the future that could reshape the global economy, generating $29 trillion to $48 trillion in revenues by 2040. These arenas range from AI software and services to cybersecurity, from future air mobility to drugs for obesity and related conditions, and from robotics to nonmedical biotechnology. These future arenas could generate $2 trillion to $6 trillion in profit by 2040. Their collective share of global GDP could increase from 4 percent today to 10 to 16 percent by 2040.

I thought that this community might want to take the report into account while planning their career.

1ggoezh,How to negotiate in this situation?,"Hello everyone,

Recently got laid off. Got approached by an employer on the same day. I didn’t tell them that I got laid off as it was around the same time and I’m still getting my dues from my ex employer. I was a Sr. PM in my last role. This new employer had two openings PM and Sr. PM. In the first telephone interview with the HR I think I lowballed myself by saying a lower salary range (still $40k better than my last). How I know it, I did my research after that interview and found that a Sr. PM should be getting more. I did mention to the HR that I’m still new to the job market (worked for 13 yrs for the last employer) and do not know what salary range is going right now. We never discussed salary after that. Went through the interviews and now HR is preparing an offer for me and said I am being hired as a PM not a Sr. PM and that the salary range will fall exactly within what I initially asked for. They are not giving me the Sr. title as well as the higher pay even though my last role was a Sr. What are my best options here to negotiate and get the best out of them?",JTorontoJ87,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1730406988,2024-10-31 20:36:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ggoezh/how_to_negotiate_in_this_situation/,10,2024
1ggnqzn,"Change job or not? From 125k USD (current salary, 87% WFH-13% office) to 160k USD (offer, 80% office-20% WFH)?","Here is a little information about each dimension: 

Age and expected retirement age: I am almost 39 and anticipate retiring at 58.

Family: My mother (67) still lives in my home country, I have a brother and sister, but they don't really care about her. She is currently healthy and lives with her husband (70), who is not very financially responsible with his expenses. I care a lot about my mother and like to be as close as possible when I can.

Current financial situation: I have 355k USD in SP500/retirement investments, a car and a motorcycle (no house yet). I spend 30k USD per month to support the household (girlfriend + me, no children planned or wanted). I can save/invest 80-90k USD per year. My current salary is around 125 000 USD. 

Current job and career opportunities: I have been with this company for 5 years. I started working in Germany, but was able to move to my home country (a Central American country) during the pandemic and stayed here. The job requires me to travel for long periods of time to GER 1x per year x 1-2 months to execute some projects, the rest of my work is done WFH, this results in 87% WFH and 13% office distribution (with a total of 2 hours of travel). If I am in GER I am 100% office. The company is a Fortune500 Biotech and provides very good job security, as people have been great. The processes are slow and change is very hard to come by. They respect me professionally but I have no accountability or authority in any process. I work on Data Science and PPP development projects (mix of project manager/ideation and developer). Since I am in my home country, I cannot be promoted to have people in charge (German law), plus the company culture is not conducive to change. The managers have a reputation for doing things the way they are and not stressing out, without changing anything effectively. I estimate that I can stay there until retirement, given the job security. Currently paying 125k USD.

Job offer: A utility company in my country offered me a managerial position in supply chain and other areas. I already worked in a very similar company in the same position many years ago. My boss would be the general manager and the structure of the company is quite flat compared to my current job. They mentioned that, given my experience, an IT manager position could be a possibility in the future. They expect change and I get the feeling they need it. The job is hybrid, 80% office - 20% WFH with a total commute of 2 hours, I would be in charge of 55 people (within a given structure). They are offering 160k USD.

1ggmmpk,What is the best way to deal with a coworker who does not like you?,"At my job I have been put in a sort of “helper ” position. Long story short I work at a factory that makes car parts and I have been there long enough to know how to do run most machines. 

The main thing I do is help break our “operators” . since most machines will have to have someone on then while it is running, me and a couple of other people will cover the operators while they take their breaks.

During the entire 8 hour shift Everybody gets two 5 minute breaks and a 20 minute lunch in between(the factory is big, so I factor in walking time). When we have 10-20 people to break, the first breaks are easy to handle but lunches and the last breaks are always hectic.

The issue I’m having is that there is this one guy who always gives me trouble when I try to send him on break. When I come by, he does not want to take his break because it’s “too early” or something like that. 

Now I can understand if I was sending him on his breaks 30 minutes into the shift or something like that, but I don’t start first breaks until an hour and half in, and I do not always start with him, sometimes I will have given breaks to 4-5 people before I get to him and it’s still “too early”. 

I am just so tired of dealing with this that it is just mentally draining. he always comes back late so I am forced to leave the machine before he comes back which causes a mess, and he will randomly ask for a “bathroom break” which will last around 10-15 minutes. 

How should I approach this situation, it isn’t fair to the other operators if I skip him in the break line because most other operators don’t like “early breaks” either. They just understand for the most part that you just have to go when  you’re told. However I am so tired of dealing with this dudes BS ,and whining and crying. I spent 2 hours typing this up because It’s stressing me out and I want to be able to deal with it. 

I Lost all general respect for him after seeing how he works, I don’t care that he doesn’t like me But he is taller and bigger than me and I am sure that he does not see me in any sort of respective light despite the fact that I treat him the same as everybody else.

Tomorrow, if I get to his machine before someone else , I am going to hold my ground and just send him, if he pushes back I will try explaining that he does not get to pick and choose his break time.

i(M24) have thought of a couple things that I would do

A cheesy one liner - “i know a good therapist if you want to cry about it” (shower argument, not a good ideal)

Or

“Your break time starts now, you can either go or you can keep working, but I’ll be here for X minutes and once I leave, you’ve had your break. “ 

But I do not know how effective it will be or how angry he will get, I will try explaining to him that it is not personal if I send him on break early but In case that does not work Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this kind of coworker? How do I interact with this person in a way that is mature and respectful and not a cheesy one liner lol",EffectLive97,2,0.7599999904632568,2,1730402385,2024-10-31 19:19:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ggmmpk/what_is_the_best_way_to_deal_with_a_coworker_who/,10,2024

1ggmhva,"suddenly let go from my job, a total blindside","im not sure where else to turn because i'm downright confused and upset over what just happened, so here i am. i have been working for this company for the past six months, it was the best job i've ever had and a huge stepping stone in my professional career. the pay was the highest i've ever been paid and up until this point, everything has been great. when i was first hired, i was constantly told by my supervisors how great the work i've been doing, how happy they were that they had someone around now that they had been needing to help run their office, coworkers had mentioned how much better it had been since i begun and i had good relationships across the board. there was a sudden shift one day in my ceo's behavior towards me, he went from being super chatty and interested in my personal interests, even messaging me on slack to say he would much rather talk to me about non work things than have to go do all these meetings, then he suddenly wouldn't even say hello or address me. i figured he was busy, as all ceos get and was also told by coworkers that this is just how he gets, one moment he's friendly and the next he won't talk to you for weeks. so i didn't take it personally and kept continuing my job duties, reaching out for more projects, etc. mind you, i never had any one on one check ins except a 30 day check in which went fine. i was never told i wasn't doing a good job, if anything i only got positive feedback.

fast forward to now, last week the ceo went out of town and messaged me on slack saying ""hey, so sorry i missed you, i wanted to say goodbye and i'm going out of town for a month."" i messaged him back and apologized for missing him at work today and that i hope that he travels safely, that i would hold down the fort, and that it wasn't a goodbye it was a see you later. boy was i wrong, and his phrasing was intentional. yesterday, i get asked if i can hop on a quick call with my boss (i worked for two people), and was basically told that ""we are restructuring the company and with that comes our need to end your employment with us."" i was completely caught off guard, it was out of the blue and when i asked what happened i was told i can meet with this boss in person tomorrow (today) because he feels like i deserve more than a google meet talk about it and that he really wasn't happy about having to do this. meaning, it was the ceos decision more or less.

i've had coworkers find me on instagram and say they are upset and concerned and confused as well as to what happened here as well. i got my paperwork to sign, and under reasoning it says ""discharged"" which means i was more than likely fired for my performance? but, as i stated above, i was never informed i was lacking in my performance and it was the opposite. they also did this while i have been struggling with my health (still working every day and haven't taken a day off), as well as having to buy a new car about four weeks ago do to my other car breaking down and i needed a way to get into our office as it is not near any public transit. my last day was the day they termed me, i was instantly kicked off slack, my email, and other accounts as soon as the call ended. i'm supposed to meet with my boss in the next hour or so, i'm just so confused as to what happened and screwed because they fired me during holiday season which is difficult to get hired. reflecting back, there were multiple red flags as far as behavior and talking about women (we had a super low percentage of women on our team, like 12 percent, and my ceo always would bring it up and say we need to recruit more women/involve more women yet...i was fired?) just looking for any advice or guidance as i'm heartbroken and scared now.",hdeezyx,2,0.5699999928474426,22,1730402030,2024-10-31 19:13:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ggmhva/suddenly_let_go_from_my_job_a_total_blindside/,10,2024

1ggm86q,Which would you choose? Better Pay (& location) or Better Experience? ,"I just started a job as a Process Engineer this week at a multi-billion dollar company that specializes in nonwoven materials. This is only my second engineering job since graduating with my degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2022. My last role was a process engineer at a start-up, and I loved it. Unfortunately, after a year of working there, the company was acquired and all the staff was let go. That was 7 months ago. I applied to over 100 jobs, went through ~10-15 interview processes, and this job is the only one that landed. I am so thankful to have gotten this job because they gave me the pay I asked for (plus relocation assistance) and I think this will be a great opportunity to gain more manufacturing engineering experience, but the job is 1.5 hours from home and I’m reluctant to leave the city I love and have called home for the past 6 years. 
Right before I accepted this job, I heard back from one of the jobs I had interviewed for three months prior and thought I was going to get, but they ultimately went with someone who has more experience. They told me that they’re expecting to have need for another process engineer in January and that I’m their top pick and they would love for me to join the team. This second job (let’s call it job B) is only 10 minutes from my apartment, but it’s a multi-million dollar company and is nowhere near as advanced as the company I work for currently; however, Glassdoor estimates that job B pays approximately $10k more than where I’m at right now. I’ve also enjoyed working at a less-established facility before, and when I went through the interview process with them before I really liked everyone I met there. 
My original plan was to make the long commute & work at job A until January, but now that I actually see how advanced job A is, I’m not sure if it’s the best career-move. 
If anyone has been in a similar situation, I’d love to know what direction you went and your reasons!

1gglvpp,I graduated 6 months ago but never took job hunting seriously…,"Back in May, I graduated with a degree in electrical engineering, and I started job hunting after graduating. I know it’s late, but I was dumb for not taking it seriously. Now it’s november(almost) and I still don’t have a job yet. I do have an offer 3 hours way from where my bf and I currently live. We would need to move there and my bf would need to drive 3 hours a few times a month to work. It’s not ideal at all.

I could wait until the beginning of the year to find more jobs since that’s when people start hiring, but I’m afraid that the new jobs will only hire upcoming graduates.

Is it possible to pull this off without burning the bridge entirely? I actually wouldn’t mind coming back to this company in the future.

1gglm74,"To get recruiters’ attention, stop listing your experience in keywords and instead focus on storytelling","Recruiters are getting flooded with resumes from people with all the same degrees, skills, and qualifications. The only way to differentiate yourself is to tell a compelling story on your resume (and in the interview) that paints a vivid picture in the screener’s mind about who you are – and how you can help. 

The way to do this is to craft a narrative about yourself, and use this repeatedly throughout your interview and resume. You can still list out qualifications in bullets, but they have to all connect in common themes, and repeat that theme over and over again so that the recruiter clearly understands what it is in her 30 second review. 

The trick is that this is not easy to communicate, like “I’m an experienced programmer”. The most effective themes are those that are difficult to get into bullets, but are instead pasted together by your careful placement of factoids which lead to the reader's conclusion of your theme. 

  


For example:

That deep-thinking analyst who quietly learns on his own, is an expert in XYZ industry, and solves ABC problems



The enthusiastic logistics manager who rallies people together in times of crisis



The intelligent salesman who has become an expert in XYZ technologies, and uses that knowledge to close deals 



To apply storytelling on your resume, this could be helpful:

1gglj26,I hate my job [M25],"I absolutely hate my job. It is so draining. I am an area manager at an Amazon facility, working overnight shifts, and it’s killing me. I hate it and don’t feel engaged or like I’m getting closer to my goals. I graduated last year with a degree in IT, and when a recruiter reached out to me, the offer sounded pretty good. I didn’t have anything else lined up, so I thought, why not accept the role?

The recruiter told me I’d likely be working the day shift and that it would be easy to transition to a corporate role once I got my foot in the door. I’ve been with the company for about six months now, and I’ve been asking my manager monthly about moving to the day shift. He’s been pretty clear that it’s not going to happen for at least two years. I’ve also done some research about transitioning from working in a warehouse to a corporate role, and it’s extremely difficult. Sure, it helps to have experience at Amazon, but it doesn’t make it any easier to get a corporate-level job.

My passion is in product, marketing, and sales. Prior to accepting this role at Amazon, I was working in sales at an Apple store, which I enjoyed a lot, but it was nearly impossible to move up. They kind of want to keep everyone at the bottom. So now I’m stuck. I don’t know what I should do.

Finding the priorities and core functions is frustrating as hell. I’ve had multiple meetings, I’ve worked on these activities on my own, I’ve called out discrepancies and gaps missing in the documentation, which is kind of how I ended up here.

Prior to that, I was building business plans and in a hyper-focused way, improving and iterating on them. I documented them but I also was only focusing on one plan or SOP at a time. 

I am incredibly frustrated and unable to break past so many barriers when it comes to compiling everything and reformatting it. It’s just not my thing or something I’m good at. So much of this is nuanced and already understood by the people that have been doing it for years, but I’ve only just learned it. I ask a question about something and it’s answered, but then when looking at the whole picture it’s hard to see how that fits in. It seems like these activities are done simultaneously and don’t follow a time-based-structure other than one or two things that have hard daily deadlines. However, everything is currently documented based on an hourly schedule.

I have no idea what I’m doing. I’ve mentioned it to my manager a couple of times and they mention that it’s good I’m doing it *because* I don’t have experience, but it seems like they don’t really know what’s going on either.

Important to note that this is not a typical venture capital job where I'm making $200k/year and working 14 hours a day. My salary is relatively low and I live in a HCOL area. The job is stressful – high stakes, demanding founders, a small, overworked team, and a salary that has me constantly strapped for cash. I've been the sole point of contact for all our investment applicants for the past seven months after we lost the 2 other members of our team, which has been incredibly draining.

Six weeks ago, my dad was diagnosed with stage IV bladder cancer and passed away last week. This, coupled with the existing burnout, has made it clear that I need a change. I'm looking to move closer to my mom to support her, focus on a side gig my partner and I have built, and meanwhile will be looking to pivot my career into something more hands-on and less office-based. This side gig will more than cover our needs as we will be living rent-free at my dad's old house in a cheaper city.

My question is, how do I quit gracefully? My boss is great, but we're finally fully staffed after months of me being the only one handling investments. She's also going on maternity leave soon. I want to give her ample notice, but I'm past my breaking point. Any advice on how to approach this conversation?

She has been VERY enthusiastic about me leaving because the stress of my job has made my mood unstable, I have less time to help around the house, etc. Safe to say she is all on board with this plan.

1ggi1zf,Career Crossroads - Almost Too Good to be True? Perspectives Desired.,"Hi everyone, I'll try to keep this brief, but there is a lot to it. 

First of all, I'm in Digital Marketing and I make a bit over 6 figures. I'll get back to this.

Over the last two years I had been taking care of a terminally ill parent in another state, requiring significant time away from my home and wife. Fortunately I am able to work remotely but I eneded up doing it more than my employer wanted which caused some friction.

I ended up going on FMLA during my parent's last few months of life, moving in with them full time to provide as much round-the-clock-care as needed. It was physically, emotionally, mentally, socially, and everything-else taxing. The parent died in April and I went back to work.

Unfortunately I also oversee the family trust which this parent's home is in. It is my responsibility to get it ready for sale and then sell it. As I mentioned, I'm in another state, but I have two siblings who live minutes away from this house. I have asked nicely, I've begged, I've pleaded for help. They won't do anything. I've exploded and screamed that this is going to end up hurting them in the long-run, doesn't matter, they don't have any motivation or work ethic. 

Now I'm in a situation where I have to travel to this other state and clean the house myself. Trying to get rid of trash and get ready for an estate sale. Between the terminal illness and now this BS, I have been burning out for so long that I finally reached that point. I decided to quit my job this fall with nothing lined up, just so I could go take care of the house with all of my time and be rid of it. Take a 'sabbatical' and get back to work in the spring. 

Well that's where things get interesting. While I've been thinking of just quitting and walking away from my job, it was announced a month ago that my company has been acquired and they're laying nearly everyone off. After some panic, I realized, this is perfect. They're giving me 90 days of transition to help them out, then I'm out the door in January with 10 weeks of severance pay and I'll be able to collect unemployment. 

Could this have gone any better for me? I get the time off I desperately need and some money to soften the landing. I'd say I can get by 4-6 months without falling behind, but at 6 months I'd be getting nervous if I didn't land a job. I was aiming to land one in May, so just over 4 months. 

Well after this first month, everyone I work with in this new company apparently loves me, and they've been singing my praises up the chain to senior leadership. I just found out yesterday that they want to do whatever they can to retain me, even though I already signed the severance agreeement and had well-thought-out plans for the first 4-5 months of the new year. 

Obviously I'm elated and flattered to get such glowing feedback, but now I'm facing some major pros and cons.  Pros being, the anxiety of not having employement in my future is gone. Financial security, healthcare, all of the things that make me nervous wouldn't be an issue.

But the cons, I won't get the 'sabbatical' I was looking forward to. I need it. I'm burnt out, badly. You don't get these chances in life very often, and the timing was looking great. 

I know this isn't the full story but I am looking for some opinions on a few questions that I'm asking myself, such as: 

1. Has anyone been in a situation like this before? What happens to the severance agreement? I'm guessing I'd forfeit it.

2. If I did agree to stay on, I feel I would have to negotiate a higher salary. I currently make about $115k + benefits. My outgoing boss told me that they couldn't pay me more because we were a small company, but I should be aiming for $140-150k in my next role if I join a larger organization. Is that shooting too high?

Frankly I'm unsure but I'm leaning towards staying on if I can work out some significant flexiblity to work on selling the house that's in the family trust. This is going to require a LOT more work and I have to be physically in another state to do it. No problem, the work is remote, but I was counting on doing the house stuff during work hours, it's hard to work all day then work on the house during evenings and weekends. It will contribute to even higher levels of burnout I think. 

So right now being laid off and taking the severance was Plan A.

I'm thinking switching to Plan A of saying yes I'll stay but for a salary of $145k and please give me some scheduling flexibility including some extra time off to balance my job and this house stuff. 

If that falls through, then my former Plan A/new Plan B, just bumped back up to my Plan A.

What would you do in this situation? Take the nearly once-in-a-lifetime sabbatical and try to land a good higher paying job after a few months off, or stick it out with the new company that really likes me and seems desperate to not let me walk away?

For the record I do like this new company and the people I work with, the culture seems good. I was just blindsided by the fact that they decided they wanted to keep me.",PNWoutdoors,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1730390569,2024-10-31 16:02:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ggi1zf/career_crossroads_almost_too_good_to_be_true/,10,2024

I recently graduated with a Bachelor’s in Applied Commerce (Accounting) from TAFE NSW. I’m currently working casual hospitality but want a stable, career-focused role. My only relevant experience is a 7-month internship at a small public accounting firm focused on tax services. I also have certifications in Xero and QuickBooks, but I haven’t had a chance to practice using them, as my internship focused on admin tasks and lodging tax returns using assistant software.

I chose accounting because I liked math in high school, but I don’t feel passionate about it. I’m introverted, so I thought accounting might suit me. I’d prefer not to stay in the hospitality or retail industry permanently and want to explore better career options, though I’m also unsure about committing to a 9-to-5 corporate job. While I’ve been looking at graduate roles, most require 1-2 years of experience, which is tough as a fresh grad.

I’m also unsure which area of accounting to focus on, since it’s a broad field. I have basic Excel skills and found management accounting easier than financial, audit, or tax accounting.

For context, I enjoy staying in to read webtoons, watch anime, and explore skincare, makeup, and fashion. I’m also into fitness and going to the gym. I’m interested in investing but haven’t started yet, as I feel overwhelmed by all the information and different financial gurus online. UGC also interests me, though I’m not confident enough to speak on camera. Ideally, I’d like a stable job with potential side hustles to support myself and live comfortably in the long run.

TL;DR: Accounting grad with limited experience and basic Excel skills, unsure about career direction. Looking for career advice in accounting or similar fields and side hustle ideas that fit my interests.

1gggv5n,Update: The person I Hate Most Got Hired At My Company,"Hey everyone, thanks for the support on my last post. I really appreciate the advice and empathy you all shared regarding my childhood bully getting hired at my job. It’s been a rough few days, but I’ve been trying to think proactively about how to handle this situation.

After my last post, I started to feel a bit more empowered. I remembered that I had downloaded Reclip not just for fun moments but also to save conversations that could be significant. I decided to use it to my advantage. So, during a team meeting last week, I discreetly saved a couple of clips where my bully (let’s call her “Rachel”) made some incredibly nasty comments toward me. At first, they seemed like casual jabs, but upon listening back, I realized they were far more malicious than I initially thought.

For example, during a discussion about project deadlines, Rachel said, “I don’t want to see you fail again; it’s so entertaining when you trip over your own incompetence.” That line hit me hard. It was a classic manipulation tactic I remembered from school—making it seem like she was concerned while actually trying to undermine my confidence.

In another clip, while we were discussing team roles, she added, “Honestly, I thought they’d hire someone better suited for this position. Good luck keeping up; I doubt you’ll last long here.” Listening to those comments made my blood run cold. It was like a punch to the gut, and it reminded me of all the torment I endured growing up.

I also recorded a moment when she was chatting with some colleagues, and she said, “I can’t wait to see how much of a mess they’ll make with this project. I mean, watching them fail is like a front-row seat to a train wreck.”

Having those recordings gave me a sense of validation. I realized I needed to protect myself; her behavior could easily escalate, and I wouldn’t be surprised if she tried to create a hostile work environment.

Now I’m in a dilemma: I want to bring this evidence to HR, but I’m not sure if it’s enough to take action against her before she even starts. I don’t want to come off as overly sensitive or paranoid, but I feel like I need to safeguard my mental health. The idea of her manipulating situations to paint me in a bad light again is terrifying.

I’m considering scheduling a meeting with HR to discuss my concerns, but I’m unsure how to frame it. I want to express that while I’m committed to my role and the company, I have past experiences with Rachel that leave me feeling anxious about her presence. Should I share the audio clips during this conversation? Would that help strengthen my case, or could it backfire?

Has anyone dealt with something like this at work? How did you navigate it? I really want to make sure I’m protected without coming across as unprofessional or holding onto grudges. Any advice on how to approach HR with this evidence would be greatly appreciated! Thanks again for being such a supportive community.",More-Ant6529,33,0.7300000190734863,38,1730387529,2024-10-31 15:12:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gggv5n/update_the_person_i_hate_most_got_hired_at_my/,10,2024

So I work at an Albertsons and this is my second week of working. I have been doing mostly 8 hour shifts and my coworkers around me seem to tell me I am catching on quick which is good. I actually do enjoy this job too which it has been a while since I have enjoyed one.

Also thought to mention I have been having a hand issue too recently and have to wear a splint.

So this week (second week) I was supposed to work Monday-Friday (I called out on Monday due to feeling a bit ill then I thought on Tuesday I was good so I worked then I woke up in the morning of and felt terrible again) so with this in mind I also called out Wednesday and now finally Thursday, but now this is where I am worried.

During the call with my store manager he said some things like “calling out on your second week is alarming and it isn’t looking good on you.” And I thought to myself what? The call quickly ended after that and not only that call but the day before it was implied from another manager that “from a company point of view this is a bad reputation and performance.” I am just confused cause everyday I have worked so far I have been a great employee and had no problems till I called out for my illness.

1ggel1l,Better pay vs better pension,"Hey everyone, I'm unfortunately not the most financially literate person (but I'm learning), so I thought I'd try to ask for some advice here. I currently work two part-time positions in healthcare. 

One pays $42 an hour, has HOOPP which is the pension plan for healthcare workers in Ontario, and adds an addition 14% in lieu of benefits. The other pays $38, has really nothing else, but offers a flexible schedule. Together, these hours usually add up to full-time with the occasional overtime. 

I've been offered a position that pays $100,000 as a base salary with a potential $10,000 bonus based on performance. They offer a company vehicle, laptop, phone, etc. They offer a registered Pension Plan. The plan provides for an automatic Company contribution of 1% of earnings and a Company matching contribution (50% match to a maximum of 4% — I'm not quite sure what this means). Benefits are included with 3 weeks of paid vacation, neither of which I currently have. 

The latter option is new and exciting and seems to offer a more stable lifestyle, but a coworker at the hospital said I'd be making a huge mistake by leaving HOOPP (I'd probably still work casual at the position that provides HOOPP), despite of all the perks thar are included. Am I setting myself up for a worse position than I'm currently in?

1ggee5d,Looking for some outside perspectives ,"Hello,
I’m looking for some advice and perspectives about the scenario I am in. I have been with my company for a couple months shy of 2 years now. Our company was bought out by another early in the year. Our annual/ merit raises used to be in the summer and now under the new company are being transitioned to January. It was my understanding that this year’s raise was to be split in two portions. Half (2%)to come over the summer which we already got and the other half (2%) in January of 2025. I was just offered and accepted a promotion which amounted to just under a 7% increase. I was somewhat hesitant to accept because I didn’t feel the increase was all that worthwhile when weighing it against potential increases to the workload. But I have been generally happy here and want the opportunity to grow. I have since been advised that this promotion will preclude me from receiving the additional 2% I was expecting in January and also that this 2% did not in fact represent a second half of this years annual raise, but will be the only raise employees receive in 2025. 

I feel deceived by this whole process. It has been stated to be “policy” that accepting a promotion will make an employee ineligible for their next merit increase. I have asked my HR team to provide documentation of this policy but they have refused, even though they are holding firm on the stance that I still am ineligible for the 2% I had expected in January. I find their unwillingness/ inability to provide documentation to be highly disturbing and feel they are continuing to just hide behind the fact they were bought out as an excuse to not do right by employees. It also raises concerns to me about what other unwritten rules we may all be subjected to. However, in my research I have found that it is somewhat common for employers to have policies that would preclude someone who accepted a promotion from receiving another scheduled raise. Additionally, it does appear from my bit of research so far that policies can still be enforced regardless of them being unavailable in writing when requested. 

If I had known all of this before accepting my promotion, I am not certain I would make the same choices. All of the fighting and advocating I have done for myself so far has really felt like a losing battle. It has really soured a time for me where I feel I should be feeling a lot better about myself for having my potential recognized and being given new opportunities. Am I out of line in this thinking? Is there any recourse I might have?

I'm a 27-year-old Business Intelligence Analyst with 5 years of experience, mainly focused on automation, architecture, and AI. My title doesn’t really match what I do since I work in a digital transformation team but we come under business intelligence department. We get requests from various teams, mostly to cut costs. My job involves attending meetings, listening to pain points, and creating presentations that lay out solutions, architecture, and resource needs. The tech I use includes PowerPlatform, Python, Azure, UI Path, and AI services. I also handle things like RFPs and enterprise approvals.

When I started, I did a lot of coding and hands-on work, but now it's mostly code reviews and meetings. I enjoy what I do, but I feel like my technical skills are deteriorating. I don't feel ready for a technical interview especially since I lack foundational skills like Git, DSA, and development speed, which are expected at this level. I’ve gotten by on intuition, but it’s a struggle to clear interviews.

I’ve also tried management roles, and I hate them. It feels like it’s all about manipulation, sweet-talking, and overpromising. I'm not good at networking or pretending to understand areas I'm unfamiliar with. It’s frustrating because, in management, it's hard to get people to reveal processes or do things the right way unless you’re willing to fight for it. I got feedback from Amazon/PwC that while I'm technically solid, I struggle with presenting well to business teams.

1ggdztz,Career Advice - Should I Switch Firms,"Hi. I need advice on whether to take an offer with an alternate firm. I currently work for a firm that l've been with for three and a half years. My practice is half land use (which I like) and half litigation (which I hate). About a year ago they approached me and said my writing needed to improve or I would be fired (somewhat like a PIP). After some time, they told me that they were keeping me on but did not give me an annual raise for the first time. During that time, I began looking for other positions.

I was headhunted by a recruiter for another firm. I met with their entire board and they offered me a position with a 25% base pay raise. I would be doing some land use and commercial real estate which would take me out of litigation almost entirely.

The catch is the new firm is almost an hour away from my house, while my current firm is only 20 minutes. I have a 4 month old baby which I would see less than I already do now if I take the position.

Plus, besides the prior mishap I really have great flexibility with my current firm. They allow me to take time when needed and I know the personalities so well that there is no fear of the unknown.

1ggcxmd,Lost in my career,"Hi! I’m F25 and last year was a very hard moment because i couldn’t job-until i got my first (contract) job in February this year, after took a bunch of internships.

It’s so hard to find a job, atleast in my country because of inflation and lots of company are freeze hiring. So instead my uncle offered me a job under his division (data analyst division), i know… being a nepobaby….. i hesistant at first because i want to find my own career path, but my family is at financial risk, so i took the job and resign from my marketing intern. (Disclaimer i have internship as marketing and BD, while my major is IR)

I thought it was an administrative work, because my uncle mentioned that i just need to be skilled in excel. Okay i got it, at first i tried to understand as a newbie, but then months being there, its more tougher. 

1. All my coworkers did well because they mastered in software app like SQL and they did the job more faster than i am, so they have high expectations on me
2. I work very slow, because i have to learn so much about their flow, and everything. But the more i know, the slowest i could get
3. One of my supervisors (i have 2) told my uncle that i dont perform well and afraid that my contract might be end in december, so there is a family drama going on, my family keep pushing me to improve myself and show them that i can (Being a nepobaby is not easy)

Because of that, i got so much things in my head, until one of my friend notice how stressed i was. I even talk to my family about it, but they dont understand how stressful it was while in work i am a public enemy and in my household they keep pushing me to improve my skills. 

At this point,  part of me dont want to continue because i always feeling guilty coming to work and not feeling welcomed that well because i know it’s my fault that i’m a slow worker. But in other hand, if i quit the job it’s really difficult to get a new job.

My uncle wants me to continue and he actually make me stay there, but i dont want to be like that. I dont want others to be burdened by my presence, so i let the others excluding my uncle to decide if i continue or not.

It’s been very tough lately, sometimes i cried for no reason and couldn’t tell anyone about it, but if i told my family about it they will only say “you need to be grateful that you got a job”",Specialist-Box-1054,1,0.6000000238418579,1,1730376549,2024-10-31 12:09:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ggcxmd/lost_in_my_career/,10,2024
1ggcmkg,How should I navigate the waters after being shafted from getting a promotion?,"

Throwaway account because ppl I know are on it.

I'm looking for a different perspective and ideas on how to play this out.

My department launched a new business initiative, and I was initially in line for a promotion  due to my seniority and expected involvement (along with people in other regions).

However, when the program rolled out, I was passed over—allegedly due to ""optics"" concerns raised by the local manager and sales lead, despite my manager affirming my capability.

The frustration lies in seeing less experienced colleagues in other regions get promoted, likely due to local politics and headcount priorities. Meanwhile, I’m already doing the promoted role’s tasks, managing key corporate accounts that generate the most revenue in the region, with consistently positive client feedback.

Though I’ve tried to take this setback constructively, it’s demotivating. I’ve succeeded and progressed in other areas of my life, making this situation feel especially frustrating, given that the work isn’t challenging or new to me.

To make things worse, the sales team has marketed the initiative to clients, and now I’m expected to perform the same duties as the promoted role without the title or pay increase (which is only 2-3% more). I’m willing to continue, but only if there's recognition—either through promotion or a pay bump, as titles alone no longer matter to me.

The whole ordeal has left such a foul taste in my mouth, I'm questioning my ability (and the rational of management) that I am no longer interested in the role. It doesn't pay that much more either.

I also don't want them to go off and hire another pleb to do the work  to which I have to train them anyway.
The first headcount they hired already doesn't have the technical capability.  It takes 12 months to get skilled up on the platform to do the job effectively.

I've been working long enough to know anything I assert needs to come with a threat of resignation for it to hold any weight.

While I prefer not to resign, I know it's the only leverage I have, and I’m financially secure enough to make that choice if needed. It's easy enough but just takes time to find the right job.

TLDR: Got shafted for a promotion and not longer interested, now management wants me to do the work in that role with no promotion or recognition due vested interests and politics.

1ggbtn1,"Should I Leave My Stressful Startup Job for a More Stable University Role, Even If It Means Financial Uncertainty?","Hey everyone, hope you’re having a good day!

I’ll try to keep it short. I’m 24 and currently doing my master’s in Germany. Coming from a developing country, adjusting here—both in terms of career and daily life—has been a journey.

A year ago, I landed two jobs: a student assistant role at my university (lower pay, fewer hours) and a marketing working student position at a startup. At first, the balance was perfect, and I even moved to a nicer place with higher rent because I could afford it.

But a few months back, a full-time colleague joined the startup, and working with her has become a huge source of stress. There’s constant pressure, despite me only being part-time. I have talked with her and my manager, they were both so open and positive, however, it is all same. I don't like working there anymore, literally, I don't enjoy it, and it kinda frustrates me everyday. I know I can try to work on it... Also, the pay there isn’t any higher per hour than my uni job, but I just can’t get enough hours at the uni to match that income.

Recently, the uni offered me more hours, which sounds great—if I quit my stressful job. But still, the uni hours are pretty low in the end, and the uni salary will only cover rent, and I’ll have to find ways to make extra money, like freelancing, which is a pretty uncertain path.

1ggaen1,What job role to transition to in IT ?,"Hey everyone,

I was layed off this year at the end of May, and I was happy about since I wanted to leave anyway. I found another job in smaller company and started working few weeks ago, the same role as before software developer.

I feel as I am an average dev, I excell mostly in debugging and problem solving as that is why I went into IT as I always liked puzzle solving. When developing new features I think I am really slow when compared to other devs and could do better, but honestly I don't like developing that much to work on it to be much better.

Now question I have is what other roles in IT I could transition to that have some perspective for future and I could possibly get some credible education/certificates ?

I want to stay at my current job for at least two years, if they don't fire me or lay me off, and use this time to learn something else as I feel due to AI average devs do not have very bright future ahead of them.

1gg9krv,Decision for a new job in transportation service,"Current job, my first real job ever and going on 2 years now, is a business associate / assistant manager type position. It involves customer success, sales (including writing proposals for public agency contracts), playing with SQL, administering the company's enterprise resource software, and vehicle fleet operations. I'm the customer success and reporting specialist for some multimillion dollar contracts. It's a $20M revenue company and the owning family doesn't trust employees like me to exercise much direct authority, but I get close exposure and experience with many important activities of sales, purchasing, contracting, and operations. I can call myself a manager, though it's only half true.

The potential new job is a transit dispatch role focused on vehicle fleet operations, including: tracking vehicle location and maintenance, optimizing routes and assignments, coordinating staff coverage, and ensuring smooth daily operations through monitoring and quick problem-solving. It's less administrative and intellectual, much more about maintenance and operations. I don't believe I'll even have my own desk computer. Like my current job, it's something of a supportive rule rather than exercising direct authority. It's a significantly bigger company than my current job.

There is a lot to consider in terms of happiness, location, and comp. But speaking from a cold career perspective. Does the second job seem like a step backwards? I'm worried that it's not going to teach me professional cognitive skills and it's not going to look great on a resume. I know it will look fine if I pursue a career in that type of operations work, but what if I want to pursue functional corporate roles or consulting?

I've had four different six month internships in college, and worked at a large public accounting firm for a year and a half out of college, so I would say that I have a decent amount of professional work experience considering my age. My current job is a completely remote tax analyst position.

The tax department is only a couple years old and it's a very small team. I work pretty closely with a senior who I also receive work from, and my ""boss"" is the director who also assigns me work. Now, the director is who I have an issue with. I consider myself a very good worker and I think that I can thank public accounting for that. I get all my work done when it is needed and it's good quality as well. That is exactly what I have done here, have not heard a single thing about doing work incorrectly.

With that being said, my boss is literally on my ass every single day. Sending me multiple teams messages about what exactly am I working on and why I'm in certain files and why I'm not prioritizing so and so. It's honestly slowly becoming unbearable and I don't know whether or not I should say something. I know it may sound like I'm sensitive, but I've had plenty of strict managers in other jobs, just nothing ever close to this.

  I see this as an extremely temporary position and am applying to jobs every day, but I would still like some advice on what is best to do in this situation.

1gg5ffl,Need advice deciding on my next software developer move,"Hi all!

Sorry ahead of time for my formatting as I’m typing this on my phone.

I currently work as a software developer making around 60k annually pre tax. I work for a large corporation and recently applied for a job in the same company but with a different team. My current team is just me and my boss managing an in-house app that we built. Surprisingly I received a request for an interview with the other department and it would offer a 2x pay bump to around 110-120k annually. My dilemma is I absolutely love what I do now. I like the people I work with, the tech we get to use, the work place culture, etc. but surviving on 60k a year is just really difficult in this economy. I have 7 years of development experience in a wide variety of languages but my knowledge on each of them isn’t too deep. I’m terrified I will hate the new position and the people I work with or not perform well due to my lack of knowledge. Prior to my current job I had a horrible experience with another company where drugs and bullying were rampant so I may be a little gun-shy from that. I know my experience is worth more and honestly if I could get a sizable pay bump in my current position I might stay for life but after talking with my boss it just doesn’t seem doable now or in the future. If anyone has experienced anything like this I would love to hear some advice or anecdotes from people in similar positions.

1gg495c,How much should I blame myself for the terrible experience I had at my first job as a college grad?,"

29F and my first job was as an academic advisor/that was my 1st job in higher education. I just remember feeling like I wasn’t a good fit with the job tasks and super shy where I couldn’t express myself with co-workers. Seemed like I was one of the few to get corrected the most, I feel like my first boss at that job was a bit more accommodating with my anxiety but the boss that came after was kind of a dick. By the time he came, they transitioned to remote b/c of covid but my time was still miserable. I feel like he intentionally came across as “caring” towards us, by asking questions but I was a victim of it biting me in the ass down the line so I think there were ulterior motives. If I’m giving you one worded answers & don’t sound comfortable while you keep asking, that’s just prying. 

There were times where we’d be in meetings & coworkers would say things towards me that threw me off and he didn’t defend me. But when I finally clapped back at one of them, he gets firm & I get a slap on the wrist. I just feel like when I got better at something, he looked for a reason to just tell me why I wasn’t doing good in something else. I know I wasn’t perfect, hell the job clearly wasn’t for me but there was even one time where he chose to give me a verbal warning for something that seemed kind of trivial. Or when I accrued a lot of PTO/gave advanced notice when taking time off & he found a reason to have an issue. It was just never enough & I finally quit after 2+ years. 

My mom told me the other day that bosses usually aren’t intentionally dicks, if you’re having a hard time with one, it likely stems from the kind of job you’re doing. I’m still in higher education but in financial aid, it’s been over 2 years in this kind of role. The last job seemed to like me (based on mgmt’s feedback) and I’m new at my current job. Again I’m still very new but the positive feedback I’ve gotten here so far is maybe more than what I got at that first gig & was there obv a lot longer. They say if it smells like shit everywhere you go check the bottom of your shoe…so what gives?

1gg3ule,Need Data Job Advice!!,"First time posting on Reddit, wanting to get some opinions/advice on my data job experiences so far, given it’s my first data job. 

I’ve been working this job less than a year and I am mentally drained. I would quit right now if I didn’t desperately need the benefits; at this point I’m just trying to get by for a few more months without getting fired. 

The expectations put on me are drowning. I’m expected to run so much code/analyses despite constant external issues out of my control (data quality, computer issues, etc). I have voiced these problems and my concerns many times just to be shrugged off and told to pretty much deal with it. I have begun to feel like a failure when these problems arise and I am met with a line of questioning regarding my thought process and code just to get to the conclusion that it was an issue out of my control (or an issue I’ve brought up weeks before that has gone ignored and has now bit us in the ass). 

For the entirety of my time in this job, I’ve dealt with every issue that has come my way and have produced SO much, but it just feels like my boss wants things NOW NOW NOW regardless of occasional issues that disrupt the analysis process, or the fact that it takes time to analyze the millions and millions of rows of data we have. Not to mention, I am the only data analyst on the team; there is no one to go to for help or for splitting tasks. Additionally, I am the first person in this position, meaning no one has trained me, no one has shown me the ropes, there was no documentation for me to refer to, etc. I have literally built up everything from the ground up.

It is to the point where this job is affecting my marriage, my happiness, my weekends, my sleep. The reason I mention trying not to get fired in the beginning of this post is because it seems like my boss does not care what issues arise, even if they are out of my control (a lot of these issues are his responsibility to have dealt with before my onboarding btw), and to him it is a bad reflection on me regardless.

Has anyone gone through something similar in a data/tech/AI job? Is there a way I can approach my thoughts to my boss for the sake of my mental?

I am a 24 year old Female who graduated from a University in May of 2023. It has been about a year and a half post-graduation and I have never felt so confused on where my life is taking a turn. Living with my parents I guess isn't necessarily my biggest issue, but it definitely does add that pressure to figure out what to do. I graduated with the intentions to take a gap year and take the LSAT. I took the LSAT three times and did not get the results that I needed based off the GPA I received in college. (about a 3.2) I kinda gave up on myself because if I am being honest I didn't believe I was smart enough to do it and that deciding factor basically ended that path for me. Now I feel like I am wasting the degree I am paying thousands of dollars in student loans for 2 part time jobs. I am currently a guest teacher and I work part-time for a family friend's law firm. I feel very stuck. I look into different career paths and you need ""x"" amount of experience for an entry level position and then feel useless because I don't fit any qualifications. Sometimes I regret the degree path I chose, but there isn't much I can do about it now. I just don't know where to start and I am starting to feel extremely depressed.

1gg3c7c,I really need help deciding...,"I (20F) started working as a custodian at a school 2 months ago. I have been offered a chance to work somewhere else, it would be a big step down but I think that I would be happier.

The school I work is one i also when to as a kid and they pay $17 and hour with paid holidays off as well as PTO and sick days and they are a 5 minute drive away (2:30 pm to 11pm with a 30 min unpaid break monday through Friday) However being back in this building puts me back in a depressive place. When I go to clean certain rooms I associate them with not so good events that happened while I attended here. It's also very isolating as I am entirely alone for 7/8.5 hours im here. Also it is a very male job and I can't really connect with the 2 other people I work with not only because they are 15 years older and male but also because they are just a little bit inadvertently exist. During the summer I will be moved over to an early morning shift which would mean I could never see my second shift working husband. It's very boring and Dull and lonely and I am unhappy here but I COULD stick it out.

They new job would be 4pm-12 am with a 20 minute drive. The pay would be $15 an hour with a 30 min paid break they're a 24/7 store.  Theres not a 100% guarantee I would work a consistent 5 day schedule. The 20 minute drive would add up in gas and wear and tear. We are also going into winter and drive in winter can be a pain. I would be working with people my age who I can relate to (both men and women) and working in an interesting retail store. I think I'd feel more co.mfortable and I'd also be able to express myself. There's opportunities to learn about new products as well as interact with customers. The person who referred me said that she really likes it there and everyone is pretty nice.

Money is not an issue for my husband and I. We live in a cheap apartment with no debt and we both work. The school job is probably one of the best jobs around where i live, everything else that pays well sucks or is a decent drive away and everything within convenient driving distance does NOT pay well. If I stay at this job and we save money like we have been we could afford to get a house by this time next year. If I go to the new job chances are that we would be pushed back another 6 months to buy a house which would push us into renewing our lease.

There are pros and cons to each but it all boils down to more money less happy or less money more happy. What should I do?",Salty-Dimension981,2,1.0,5,1730338813,2024-10-31 01:40:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gg3c7c/i_really_need_help_deciding/,10,2024
1gg35to,Should I look for another new job after just 7.5 weeks?,"I’ve been in my current career for 21 years. I don’t “job hop.” The shortest time with a company during my career was 2.5 years, and I was at the other two companies for nearly 10 years. 

Due to circumstances beyond my control, my job security was suddenly in question, so I looked for a new job. I gained a decent pay bump and a shorter commute when I accepted my current position. 

At my other jobs I’ve been able to quickly catch on to their point-of-sale and electronic-medical-records systems. My initial training (at a different location) experience was very positive, as was the first week at my assigned location. They utilize these systems differently than I was trained.

Now I feel like I’m constantly having to ask for help, and I’m supposed to be a supervisor. I also seem to always run into complex transactions when there is no one to help. Today, with no one to tell me how to fix a potential mistake I made, I decided to take action that I thought would help, and may have made matters worse. I just can’t seem to understand their systems. 

Some of the people around me are understanding, but some seem frustrated, and I’m not looking forward to tomorrow. 

I’m still in my 90 day probationary period. They probably won’t fire me because my license is in demand, but that’s not guaranteed. Mostly I’m reaching the point that I’m tired of feeling incompetent. I feel like this will get worse, not better.

1gg2rvu,Company going out of their way to keep me. Do I stay or leave?,"Hi everyone,  
I would sincerely appreciate any insight or advice.

TLDR:  
My current job does not suit me. However, it is a well-established blue-chip company and the bosses have noticed me despite having worked here for less than a year.

Should I leave, wait a bit or just stay?

\---

I am a fresh graduate with almost a year of work experience. I studied for an industry (arts-related) that is considered to be new and upcoming in my country.

Despite being hired for the role I wanted, my team falls under an entirely different department. Thus, my workload is often out of scope. Given the nature of my job, I am considered to be the best in what I do despite only having fresh grad skills. I have no senior to teach me and have been mentoring two juniors.

A week ago, I decided to bring up my resignation verbally before providing a formal notice (cultural expectation to not just up and leave)

Despite being a massive company, relationships are tight-knit. Things quickly went from my manager to their boss, and they called me in for a 1 on 1 to convince me to stay. Then it got even further when I had to meet their boss (so my boss' boss' boss). They admitted that this was not something they did often - for a higher-up to meet a junior to ask them to stay. They even requested, upfront, that I stay with them for the time being until I can find a new job. (I wish to take a small break before job searching as I am financially stable enough to do so)

Many people are telling me to stay because it is considered lucky to get noticed in such a big company. And while they did mention plans and promises, nothing concrete was offered. All their dreams are either far into the future or are still very out of scope from what I want.

Option 1: I remain adamant and leave. I lose the recognition I have now, become the small fish in a big pond in my future career and risk losing the stability of this blue-chip company.  
Option 2: I stay on for a bit. Take on their suggestion of finding that new job first. This will mess up my planned timeline and it will mean joining my new job in the middle of the year (we have a 2-month notice) I also lose the break that I need due to overworking here.  
Option 3: I stay with them for the long run and hope that their attention on me will translate to a comfortable career in my future. Despite knowing full well that this job won't align with my passion.",Levira2019,2,0.7599999904632568,7,1730337152,2024-10-31 01:12:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gg2rvu/company_going_out_of_their_way_to_keep_me_do_i/,10,2024
1gg2pu0,Stuck in a rut. Advice?,"
Hello.



I'm 25. I am currently a pre-nursing major at a CC where I have a 3.8 GPA. I am a lab technician for animal research, but our program is ending very shortly and I will soon be out of a job. I am at the point where I need to make decisions about where I want to go and find my path in life. Hence, this post.



Some important background info about me: I am a parent of multiple kids and married to my on-and-off-again disabled spouse. We are just above the poverty line. Prior to adulthood, my education was horrific. My parents withdrew me and my siblings from school due to CPS's involvement in our lives. They were neglectful in every way possible and tried to hide the neglect via ""homeschooling"". The ""education"" was nothing; like, we just stopped receiving any type of education at all and would just play on our devices all day, every day. My education stopped in the 4th grade. I tried once to do a GED program, but I was so far removed from my math skills that I couldn't complete the class and left.



I am currently attending a CC and have found my luck there. I am a very strong writer and am good with science. My entire life, I have wanted to work for CPS and have spent years dreaming of it. Unfortunately, life turned around and shat on that dream. I cannot afford to work for CPS and social work jobs, while prolific in abundance, are very low paying. I simply cannot afford to be a social worker and support my family. especially since I am currently the main breadwinner. I stopped working towards being a social worker last winter.



I am currently in school for nursing. I am still doing my prereqs. I have done 1 English Comp class, 2 history classes, a handful of social work classes, a ridiculous amount of humanities classes, multiple Psychology classes, basic health classes (medical terminology), Spanish 1, and a single Foundations of Math class where I scored a B+. I am taking Human Anatomy (A), English Com 2 (B+), Developmental Psychology (A), and Algebraic Literacy (F) this semester. Unfortunately, I am greatly struggling with the Algebraic Literacy class to the point where I am failing. There is no possible way for me to improve my score to pass; I am passed the point of return. I have reached out for tutoring with no luck; I cannot handle the amount of steps needed for most steps in solving problems and I deeply struggle to keep them in line. I'll do 40 questions in a row right when I use my book to help me solve problems, but the second I don't have my book, I cannot remember ANY steps. I have to pass this class to take Chemistry, which is required. Next semester I am retaking this class, Introduction to Clinical Microbiology, Pickleball (fun class, I need the credit hours), and Understanding Child Abuse and Neglect (fun class). Besides those, I just have Introduction to Chemistry and Human Physiology left, and then I'll be able to apply to the nursing program.



This is where I feel so defeated. I don't know if I'll be able to pass this class, even trying again. I simply don't think that I am smart enough to pass. I don't know if nursing will be a possibility for me due to my poor math skills. So, I need backup ideas in case I fail again.



I've thought long and hard about my other options. I would really love to work in the medical field, despite my setbacks. I enjoy the routine, the stability, and the mental challenges that come with it.

Previously, I've been a CNA, dog trainer apprentice, line cook, and even a lice technician. I've heavily considered careers like Occupational Therapy, but it requires a strong math background. I've looked at Occupational Therapy Assistant, Physical Therapy Assistant, and Speech-Language Pathologist Assistant; my only issue is that I am already making 18 an hour and these careers pay on par or just slightly above what I make now. Is it even worth it to get a degree for just a couple of dollars more?



Any advice is appreciated.

1gg2fmc,Company is calling for volunteers for layoffs ahead of deeper cuts…,"So this year was rough financially for the company and 2025 is looking worse. 

We got the news that volunteers are needed to stem the flow of future layoffs, but it was not told to us how deep these involuntary layoffs will be. 

**If we volunteer,** we get a maximum of six months paid starting the date we’re let go. 

**If we don’t volunteer,** we go about our jobs as usual and see who is let go. The severance here is not great. I believe it’s one year worked = one month paid. 

Now there is a chance I could survive the layoffs entirely by doing nothing. 

My logic: volunteer, start applying for new jobs, work through Dec 31st, and get six months pay. Take the first job offer and double dip paychecks until the severance runs out in June. 

But my wife is **F’ING FURIOUS** that I would consider volunteering and calls it a lazy person’s exit. She seems to think I should ignore the call for volunteers, take the risk, keep working, and only leave when I get the new job.

1gg1vlq,How to cope with the exit interview? ,"I’ve been in a toxic team now since January and I can’t take it any longer. I found another job and will start In January 2025 and am giving the notice in on Monday, 8 weeks before the new job. My team was good to start with but then turned very toxic after a new colleague joined in January. I have told my boss multiple times that I am unhappy with her changing all my work, passing my work off as her own, him excluding me from meetings and giving her all the growth/ visibility opportunities, the unrealistic deadlines. It’s like she could say literally anything and he would agree with her. Today I was almost crying in the call saying I don’t want to have to redo the work I’ve spent two weeks doing (as she was too incompetent to tell me the correct requirements) and the whole time I was saying this he just stayed on mute.

What should I do? Tell him again all these problems or just say I am leaving because of relocation and because I am unhappy here in general? I am scared if I say too much it will be used against me in the future but I know he is going to ask me for the WHY. And I do not want to tell him my future job or location, incase he tries to write them with a bad reference or incase my other extremely nosey colleagues find out.

1gg1dpe,Resignation and Interview ,"I recently was given the opportunity to resign in lieu of termination due to a false allegation that I was leaving work early. When in fact I was using my personal vehicle to go to job sites because the vehicle I was given broke down often and the brakes needed full repair. I asked numerous times for assistance but fell on deaf ears. 

I own the the mistake that I didn’t make my boss aware of it but after I was confronted with a formal meeting and within seconds of beginning I heard him say 2 days off paid and I will consider termination my heart sunk. As I left I didn’t even want to return to prove my story with documentation as I knew I would hate going to work every day. I was also angry that this could’ve been avoided in a brief sit down in his office rather than a formal hearing. 

Two days later my union rep (I was still on probation) told me they would accept a resignation and not dispute unemployment. 

I have an interview tomorrow and I had listed this position on my resume. I’m nervous that the question of why did you leave come up. How do I answer this question? It wasn’t a good fit that utilized my skills and abilities?
I know that this new employer knows my past employer and I’m nervous he won’t go through the proper channels and speak with hr and I’ll be screwed.

I’ve been a physical therapist for 16 years, currently working 10 AM to 7 PM on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with the occasional half day on Tuesday or Thursday. It’s a super relaxed schedule, and I’ve really come to enjoy the balance—especially having weekends off.

1gg0duv,Salary Negotiation,"Here’s the situation: During initial salary discussions, the company had a budget they wanted to stick to, but the role itself was still “undefined.” Through the interview process, it became clear that while they had an idea of what they wanted, my skills aligned well with what they truly needed. As we talked, it was clear the role’s scope went from a standard Analyst to a hybrid Sr. Data Engineer / Sr. Data Analytics position.

I felt like a good fit and was excited to add real value in this expanded role. However, given the increased scope, I also expected the compensation to reflect this. They extended an offer below even the lower end of what we initially discussed, likely assuming I’d negotiate for a modest bump. Instead, I countered with a detailed write-up, outlining the role’s expanded scope, market research on similar positions, and a new proposed title and salary—about $40K above their offer. I also emphasized my strong interest in joining.

We’re scheduled for a call tomorrow, likely to discuss if we can reach a compromise. While I’m excited about the role, I’m ready to walk away if they can’t meet a reasonable investment in the scope of work. Which really sucks because I think both parties feel we are going to be walking away losing something of value if a deal can’t be reached.

1gfzhfh,I lost the plot so majorly,"I'm spiralling about what to do.
Just turned 22, studying philisophy with psychology at a top 10 UK university. This wasn’t actually the plan for my life. I wanted to go into Machine Learning but home life went wrong, etc etc...anyway so I decided that my plan was to transition from this current degree to computer science masters to a PhD in machine learning by just...getting really good at coding and doing impressive CS projects and getting good grades.

Currently in my final (3rd) year of university and...yeah no impressive projects. Throughout university I ended up becoming more and more interested in neuroscience actually, and thought ""ok, maybe we can transition from this degree to neuro to ML with a neuro twist [like computational neuroscience, or using BCIs, but more AI...]"". I actually realised my degree is very heavy and did basically no coding projects but met a PhD student who proposed that we should become research partners, in which case I'd have several ML-adjacent publications as an undergrad (lots of coding!), which would be sufficient. He terminated our BCI project 2 years in with no publication. My only published paper is in something irrelevant now. 

Got a high grade in 1st year, had to take a year out because I got ill + admin issues, which tanked my second year grades since I had to do exams without university(!!), which means I likely will end up with a high 2:1 instead of a 1:1. I thought I'd just try to apply to a masters in neuroscience and transition that way. Oxford deadline due 3rd dec but will probably have to take a year out since my academic transcript is still messy from last year...

Right now I'm sitting here thinking ""okay but do you want this?"" I decided to become a machine learning researcher when I was maybe 13 and right now I have no good reason why. When I decided to make it interdisciplinary with neuroscience I still had no good reason why. When I say ""good reason"" I mean my main actual reason is just that I find it beautiful. 

That's it. That's all. I think it's all really gorgeous. It doesn't mean I'm competent. It just means I'm passionate about something that the more I learn about, the less I know about. 

But now what? I wanted to apply to Deepmind, but looking at it, I feel like it's too late for me to get good enough at coding etc to get in with a neuro/comp neuro PhD (not directly machine learning). If I wanted to do machine learning-based PhD, I would have to already be doing some sort of CS-adjacent degree or at least have some good experience in it. Even if I had done everything right, it's a very competitive company. Plan B was to become an ML researcher and plan C was to become a neuro researcher. But now that I'm writing masters applications...I have no idea what specifically I want to actually research. 

I also feel like computational neuroscientists now won't end up working for FANG ML (especially deepmind) given there are much more qualified people. Also, working at research company = need to be extremely competent. I don't just want to be an employee, I want to actually do research. That's why the other plans are all ""be a researcher"" in some mysterious topic I don't know about yet. 

I just don't know what to do. In the masters applications for Oxford it asks for a research direction and I have no idea. I probably have to take a year out because my transcript wont be updated with my improved grades until I graduate...I feel like everything is derail and I'm getting older with no stable plan.",throwaway294i39,2,0.6700000166893005,0,1730328025,2024-10-30 22:40:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gfzhfh/i_lost_the_plot_so_majorly/,10,2024
1gfzdxy,Internal transfer or stay in supervisor role? ,"Hello, I'm on mobile so excuse my formatting. 
I currently have to make a decision on whether I should stay in my current role as a supervisor of a call center or move back to my old department. 
For some context, I started as a call center agent and then transferred to a different department working with those that are experiencing homelessness. I stayed in that role for about a year and a half and then I was approached by the COO and asked if I was interested in moving back to the call center as a supervisor for the second shift team. 
Although I was content in my role helping homeless individuals, I felt honored that I was thought of and decided to give it a shot. I've been a supervisor for about a year and 5 months now and it's been more challenging than I could've expected. The pay is nice but I hate working second shift.  
Recently, a role back on my old team opened up. The role is not what I was doing previously, but similar, and it comes with a pay cut from what I currently make. 

The only reason I'm torn between leaving or staying is the pay cut. My question is how important should money be in making the types of decisions? I'm currently trying to buy a house so I don't want to end up shooting myself in the foot. Should I interview for the role and learn more about it? Would you stay in a role if you were not happy?

 Okay, so my kid's birthday and holiday/s are fast approaching and I was hoping for extra work hours. I emailed Manager B if I can have more work hours because aside from it'll help me financially, our office became busier too and we need to do tons of pending workload. However, days passed but I got no reply so I messaged/chat her directly on Teams --- but still, no reply. I want to message Manager A instead to ask for extra hours but my friend told me that I can do that BUT it'll undermine Manager B. SHOULD I STILL ASK MANAGER 'A' FOR HELP? HOW CAN I ASK FOR IT WITHOUT SOUNDING THAT I'M UNDERMINING MY BOSS, MANAGER B? 

Help me, please?

1gfwa6b,How to continue working but I’m burnt out? ,"Hello all,

I’m( mid 20s -F) an engineer, working at this company the past 2 years and this is my first corporate job out of college.

Currently I’m managing 3 projects and was occasionally pulled into help troubleshooting issues on site ( since I guess it’s unofficially part of my role to help with this even though other people on my team could help). I’ve burnt out at least 3 times this year and I’m tired. My body can’t do much more. 

I have talked about my manager about prioritizing my work and how to juggle each project. I’ve been trying to do my best but I really don’t have much left for me to give. I am so exhausted mentally and emotionally. I have been very careful to try to keep boundaries with my work and life, and leave at a decent time. With all that I have to do it would require me to give more and I don’t want to get to a unhealthy place ( I already took a medical leave ealier this year because my physical health was getting affected along with life events contributing to my state).

I’ve been trying to also apply for jobs but still struggling to find something. 

I have lost a lot of motivation and I am exhausted. But I need to deliver on these projects and I don’t want to drop the ball. I don’t want to overwork myself and I’m tryigg bc to delegate what I can, but I’m leading one of these projects and have a vital supporting role in the other two. 

How best can I handle this because I’m really struggling. Is this workload normal? I’m not too sure what the workload of my other colleagues are.

1gfutfn,Do I stick out my current job til I'm ready to start my own business if it's making me miserable?,"I work a corporate-ish sales job in a sector I don't give a fudge about. I took the job as my last company folded during covid and I needed something ASAP. That was almost 3 years ago, and whilst the pay is decent, I've learned a lot and I like the people I work with, I am pretty miserable.

Because of cost of living and other factors, the amount of money in the sector is dwindling and clients are spending less and less with us. Several huge deals have been pulled at the last minute - cue lots of grief from bosses, who are understandably panicking and throwing more and more new products at us to go out and sell when they aren't truly ready to go to market or it's the wrong time of year. This is causing huge pressure on us as the sales team, plus our team has shrunk by 4 people due to reundancies a few years ago so our workloads are pretty huge.

The reason I haven't left yet is that I am planning my exit from the corporate world altogether. I have been in Sales for 7 years and I'm pretty exhausted. I have been honing a creative skill for a while and am hoping to start turning it into a business in the next 12 months. I have already been approached by a stockist who recently found my work on Instagram. I would work part time to supplement this for as long as I needed to.

I don't particularly want to move to another comany in a similar role, all the stress of interviewing and onboarding, learning a new company culture, product portfolio etc etc etc when I don't plan to be around for that long anyway and it isn't what I want to do, so I'm trying to just grin and bear what I've got - I know how to do the job, I'm valued by my managers, I've built relationships with my clients, and I work 3 days from home so I have a decent amount of autonomy in how I structure my days, meaning I have been able to carve out pockets of time to work on my craft with work being none the wiser. I don't want to risk losing that, yet I find myself scouring job sites almost daily at this point. I'm unhappy, and suspect that the ship might really be sinking anyway.

Do I stick it out and try to emotionally detach from the stress of it all despite the mounting pressure from all sides, or do I cut and run now and risk losing the flexibility and the money that is affording me to pursue my side gig?",Hob_Boskins,0,0.5,0,1730315990,2024-10-30 19:19:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gfutfn/do_i_stick_out_my_current_job_til_im_ready_to/,10,2024
1gfujss,should i quit my job?,"things at my company have consistently been getting worse since the summer; people in the leadership leaving, company losing client contracts, etc. i had several conversations with my manager + other leadership and they reassured me that a) everyone’s salaries are budgeted for till end of this year, b) my role will be safe as long as the company is. these conversations happened in September. since September, 70% of my larger department has quit, everyone in my team has quit (leaving only me), and at this rate it is seeming extremely unlikely that the company will want to keep my team. to make everything worse, i just learned that most of the recent resignations in my team were actually the people being poached by a client we had been working for…so, loser me I guess. 

meanwhile, i don’t have an offer at the moment. i have been applying for roles but nothing has panned out successfully. at the same time, the situation at work is taking a ridiculous toll on my mental and physical health, which is impacting my motivation to look for better roles too. 

i have an okay amount of savings, plus would be comfortable depending on my partner for a bit until I have an offer. what i’m having an extremely difficult time doing though is just waiting to be let go + feeling like a failure at this point. my long term plan is to go for a masters anyway because i’m looking to switch careers.

1gfuitu,"I’m halfway through my remote, 6-month, contract-to-hire assignment and I’m unsure what’s expected of me. I’d like to understand the scope of my role’s future responsibilities so I can know if the position is right for me. How do I figure this out without coming across as lazy?","Tl;dr: I’ve been working remotely for 3 months on contract under a project manager and I enjoy the work I do. The goal is to officially onboard with the company at the end of the contract. I’m not sure if the company’s goal is for me to train to be a PM or continue doing the work I do long-term, and I’m not sure how to find out without it reflecting poorly on me. 

I’m an electrical engineer and I work in utilities. I applied to a remote Power Transmission Engineering role that I’m qualified for, but the company decided my skill set more closely matched another position they were hiring for. The reason I mention this is because I’ve never seen a written copy of the job description for the role I actually have. I just knew they expected me to work more in Protection & Controls and I was to learn from and work closely with a Project Manager. 

The salary is generous, and I really like the work I’ve been doing. If they expect me to continue doing this same work, I would like to sign on with the company at the end of the contract. However, I would absolutely not be willing to take on the responsibilities of the Project Manager. My PM frequently works 70hr weeks including weekends. He often works into the night and attends online meetings in timezones all over the world. I’m not sure if the purpose of me working so closely with the PM is because they want me to take on his responsibilities. If it is, I would like to start looking for a different job. There has been very little communication from my boss on my performance and expectations, but it seems more and more like my boss is expecting me to take on PM responsibilities. 

How do I figure out what’s expected of me without seeming like I’m unwilling to help out where the company needs me? Will it reflect poorly on me if I ask for a copy of my job description? Any advice?

-In meetings will either add unnecessary details or repeat what I said concisely but in a long about manner 
-Having a black and white approach where their way of doing things is good and ours is bad
-Trying to procide constructive criticism in front of clients as opposed to privately 
-Not listening to my concerns because I am a junior

I know it's not personal because they are responsible for ensuring all the items/tasks are completed as our clients are very needy.

1gfsr1o,Stay in my current remote position with lower pay or jump to higher paying in person job? (65k+ increase),"I have been working as a controller for a data management company since getting laid off from my last job six months ago. I make okay money ($100k base + bonus) and work remotely. The previous six months have been a slog. I am a glorified bookkeeper and work 10-20 hours monthly. It is a fine job, gives me a lot of time for recreational interests, and has let me just coast. I am not reaching my potential, though. I enjoyed my last job as the Treasury Manager for a SaaS company. I enjoyed getting involved in the finance side of the business instead of doing accounting, which is what I studied and done my whole career. 

  
Before I got laid off, a local company reached out about working as their Treasury Manager (PE Vet Office Roll-Up), and the interview went well. Unfortunately, they offered the job to someone before I interviewed and I didn't get the position. The person they hired just left after a year working there, which is a red flag, and they have reached back out to me about taking the job. I told them I make $150k and they would need to exceed that for me to be interested, and after some back and forth, they have agreed to $165k plus bonus. 

  
Usually, I would jump at this opportunity without looking back for that kind of increase. However, the CEO of my current company called me unsolicited to tell me about some leadership changes coming down the pipe and how I will be getting more responsibilities. He mentioned he is looking to groom me to be the company's CFO, but there was no hard talk about timeline, comp, etc. Increased responsibility and leadership at the company are what I have been wanting. My outgoing manager was getting in the way of those opportunities, and with him going, I will have ample opportunity to prove myself. 

So my dilemma is what to do with this job offer from the other company. Do I try to parlay it into a raise? Do I leave it alone, focus on the opportunity ahead of me, and not poison the well? Do I accept the job offer from the other company because it is a bird in the hand with a guaranteed significant raise at the cost of losing remote work?

1gfqijj,Career maze ,"Sorry for the long text but please give me your opinion

Hi i have a bog problem I think, first of all I graduated from computer science a 9 months ago and i got 2 internship and a 2 weeks ago i got a cyber security internship but all my focus in university and even after graduation ( the 2 internships ) was on web development but after graduation i got a course about cyber security ( a very general course ) that’s why I got this internship and i was very happy cause i was thinking that i liked the cyber security industry more suitable for me than the web development one but after 2 weeks in the internship I found myself in a very bad situation cause they wants me to learn a looot of things in order to be in the road of a cyber security employee.

The problem is if you didn’t understand it that, i spend times on learning web development technologies and now in this internship they wants me to learn more and more and many stuff and tools that i know nothing about it in order to offer me a full time position ( they said it’s maybe will take 1 or 2 months)

Idk if I want to learn even more stuff and throw all what I learned about web development and to be honest cyber security seems very hard cause i need to learn about everything even about programming languages, linux, network and the list goes on.

So my question is do you recommend to start searching again about web development positions while i’m in this internship or to forget about web development and start my journey in cyber security.

Note that i liked both now after i tried cyber security, so isn’t web development has more job opportunities and pay more and has a bigger career or what do you think?

Side note : the company I’m doing my internship with now is still building the software to be sold after so all the team looks like they’re lost and no one knows what’s going on, that’s why I think they wants me “as an intern “ to do and learn big stuff",Ok_Tackle_9809,1,1.0,0,1730305254,2024-10-30 16:20:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gfqijj/career_maze/,10,2024
1gfqd3g,Should I take the severance or the job?,"Asking for a friend...

MY company is going through an acquisition and I have been given options on the future of my employment. I have the opprotunity to take a severage package that would amount to appx 2 years worth of total compensation or I could take on a new role at the purchasing company that would be a lower level for 10% to 20% less money than I'm currently making.  But,  I would have job security for guaranteed 2 years. 

The severance is a great option but the thought of having to eventually look for and obtain a new job makes me nervous at this point in my career.  I love the idea of stability but this amount of money now would make a huge difference to my family.  My husband wants me to take the severance, take the time off I want and then when ready, get my resume prepared and, reach out to recruiters and look for a new position. I really would just rather keep working and not skip a beat. My husband says this is my option but he believes the best option for the family is to take the severance. 

What do you guys think is the best option? I really have not heard of many people every being offered 2 years+ of severance.

I learned a lot at the office but hated my dentist/ boss, he was extremely rude and moody which made working for uncomfortable. I liked it there because I was able to learn so much and liked my coworkers. He got mad at everyone a lot and he did get mad at me often and I think that resulted in him saying I was fired. He basically said him and I don’t mesh good or whatever and he let me go. I don’t know why I’m so bad at this job, I feel super unmotivated and like a failure right now. I took assisting to be a stepping stone to get into dental hygiene but if I can’t even be a good assistant how in the world can I do hygiene? It’s so upsetting because right as I was getting ready to take the hygiene exam (for private school) is when I got fired and now all motivation is lost.

1gfq9o3,Should I stay or should I go now? Director to analyst?,"Excuse The Clash reference but I do need some advice here. I've been at my currently company for 4 years, started as an IC, moved into management last year, and due to some exits from leadership above me I got promoted into a director role a few months ago. It is a SaaS company and I'm doing customer success type work-- my IC work was highly technical in the software, but my client skills and expertise moved me up. I have a great reputation at my company, get to speak at events, etc. The problem I'm running into is 1) we are owned by private equity and are likely getting sold to another PE firm this year which has growth implications and has led to problem 2) many people who I've loved working with have exited the business and I no longer have a mentor. I'm really early in my career (around 6 years experience at the moment), so not having a mentor has been tough. 

There is a client of mine who has been in the industry for 20+ years, really pleasant to work with, and is hiring an analyst contract role for her team at a very large FAANG company. It is a 12 month contract, would be around the same pay, and IMO would get me experience that would help in possibly landing a full time role at a FAANG (my ultimate goal). She is excited about me being interested in the role so I think I have a real shot at getting an offer. 

  
Financially, it would be about the same pay, being on a contract with minimal benefits isn't an issue because my husband has our health insurance taken care of, but I guess I'm wondering if I'm a total idiot and making a mistake? I know it is a risky move, but I don't have kids, don't have a mortgage payment, and if I end up unemployed after the contract ends my hope is I will have made enough connections to keep my time unemployed to a minimum. So, stay in a leadership role at a smaller SaaS company (big fish, small pond), or move to be an analyst at a FAANG (small fish, big pond)?

I’ve been an hourly worker for about 5 years, just recently got a salaried job at the same company. I work better when I’m on the clock and I’m motivated to stay working longer hours. 

As a salaried employee, I feel my performance has plummeted because I don’t have hourly constraints. The freedom in my work hours is too freeing… Of course for many people this is the appeal, but not so much for me. Of course I’m not going out of my way to ask for hours to be tracked by management, but I’m thinking to take the reign into my own hands and start tracking my hours (punching in and out) on a separate timesheet if that’s what I need to become disciplined.

Came here to ask if anybody else with a similar situation has struggled in a similar way. If you’ve settled into the hourly to salary transition, what aided that transition for you?

1gfnmcn,Resigning at a Critical Time,"I have been at my current company for 3-4 years; it is a small team (I manage 4 and do the full workload of an IC as well), and extremely short staffed at the moment. We are actively hiring but due to health/stress reasons I have decided to depart, and my departure is non negotiable although I am flexible with my end date. I’m fine giving extended notice through the end of the year. Earlier this year I took 5 weeks of unpaid leave following a surgery to try to get my health back on track (after attempting to resign but being convinced to try an extended break), but as soon as I returned the issues started up again. 

My dilemma is this: 

My boss has unveiled an ambitious restructure for our department for Q1 of next year and he is placing a lot of the planning on me, plus factoring me into the org structure. I want to let him know asap that I will not be around for this new org, and he needs to start planning for that. I like my boss and he tries his best. I planned to quit in person yesterday or today but both days he did not show to the office because his daughter has been in and out of hospital with high fevers and other issues. I already felt really horrible quitting when we are in a short staffed transition phase, but now I am wondering if I should hold off until his kid gets better since he is sleep deprived and worried about that? If I wait, I would feel really crappy in all of these strategy meetings knowing I am pretending to be there when really I am out of here.

However, I haven't had much sales this year. Most of our closed deals come from our networks and have 0 deals from our outreach efforts. I know our bottleneck is our marketing which their is really no effort put into it, and we cant really afford to hire one right now.

1gfn209,How should I write my resume with ALOT of seasonal jobs that are 3-6 months long?,"* Job 1 (3 Months): Insurance Customer Service
* Job 2 (6 Months): Front Desk, Payroll, and HR
* Job 3: (6 Months): Dispatch, Billing, Accounts Payable 
* Job 4 (4 Months): Call Center Customer Service
* Job 5 (3 Months): Accounts Receivable
* Job 6 (3 Months - Current): Billing

These were temp for a variety of reasons: covering for a full-time worker who is out on maternity leave, hiring for the busy season, or manager didn't get approval to list this as a full-time job. All jobs but 2 of them hired by different staffing agencies or was a direct hire. Only 2 of them were hires by the same staffing agency so I can't group all of them by staffing agency.

My only full-time experience is that for 4 years, I worked as an underwriter, but was laid off due to crappy state of the mortgage industry. I got a seasonal temp job now because it was an immediate hire. 

My questions are:

I. Should I list these jobs individually or group them together?

II. If I group them together, should I list them together under a generic job title (ex: admin support specialist) and list the employer as ""freelance"" (or something else id anyone has another idea)?

Example:
Admintrative Support Specialist, Freelance (1/2018- Current)
* Company 1: Sentence. 
* Company 2: Sentence.
* Company 3: Sentence. Etc.

Underwriter, Company (1/2020 - 8/2024)
* Bullet 1
* Bullet 2
* Bullet 3, Etc.

III. If yes to question 2, if grouped together, should I list the company name in each bullet or just list a job description from each job?

IV. If I list them individually, how do I it without gaps? I don't really have any extra volunteer work or additional training or education. My long gaps are a few months apart. I know I can put (temp) next to the job, but I feel like can get over looked by a recruiter at times.

V. If I list them individual, is it possible to list 7 jobs (6 seasonal/temp + 1 full time) on a single page?

VI. Would anyone recommend a functional resume? I heard a lot of bad things about them, so I've avoided them, but I could use a second opinion. 

Of course, if there is some other advice that I didn't think to ask for, please feel free let me know. I'm open to anything. Thank you in advance!

1gfl1w0,At a crossroads between money and happiness & freedom,"I hope this is okay to post this here. I’m just a bit stuck with a decision I need to make career wise. I’ll give you a bit of background. I am a 30 year old and currently in a role where I am doing extremely well and have a good career ahead of me. The only thing is, I really am not interested in the job that I am doing. It is a sales job and there is a lot of pressure, despite the fact I am doing well. I feel like even on anual leave and days off I cannot switch off because I am worrying about things I need to do. I sort of just fell into this role when I wanted to earn a bit of money and then progressed within the role. 

So here’s my dilemma. I recently got a job to be cabin crew, which means obviously travelling the world and once you get off the plane no worries to think about on your days off. It is also such an amazing lifestyle with lots of days off and just no stress at all. I worked as cabin crew for a few years before an I loved it so much, but like I said I left because I wanted to earn more money.

So anyway, I handed in my notice and my current job have offered me a pay increase, so my basic salary will be £39k with an ote of £15-£20k in commission on top. My friends who are cabin crew are currently on a £38k average salary per year. So a big pay cut. 

So now I’m stuck on what to do. My head is saying money but my heart is saying cabin crew. My sister died last year as well, which is what has made me rethink life and make me want to do something I enjoy. I am also in a fortunate (well unfortunate but you know what I mean) position where I will inherit her estate, which I  will be able to use towards a hefty house deposit. I think I already know what to do, but some advice would be welcomed. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I’m weighing options between Rutgers’ part-time MBA through Newark/New Brunswick (both have online options) and the fully online Camden program. I know both lead to a Rutgers MBA, but I’m wondering if there’s any real difference in reputation, job placement, or prestige between the two.

Some specific questions:

	•	Does the Newark/New Brunswick option have a stronger reputation or better industry connections, especially since it’s closer to NYC?
	•	Do employers care if it’s Camden vs. Newark/New Brunswick? I know Camden’s program is 100% online, while Newark/New Brunswick offers more in-person options.
	•	Job Placement: Are there any major differences in job placement or career support between these campuses?

1gfkies,How long should I stay at my boring engineering subcontractor job?,"
I’m an industrial design engineer from southern Spain, and as expected, salaries here aren’t great. I started in a small firm doing POS and trade marketing items, working two years after an internship—first as a production engineer, then as a designer. I earned 18k gross per year, and senior designers weren’t paid much more, so I moved on to a refrigeration company as a design engineer for 28k gross, working on the American market. This required me to commute two hours each way, which got tiring.

After eight months, I accepted a job as a manufacturing engineer at an aerospace subcontractor in my hometown, despite the pay drop to 23k. I was hoping the better work-life balance and no rent costs would offset the lower salary, but I now hate my job. It’s not creative, challenging, or rewarding. I do the work for 8 hours, there’s no stress or micromanagement, and my bosses are fine but I get so bored every day.

The company is known for being a bad place to work, and I’m not interested in pursuing a career here. Given that I’ve changed jobs three times in three years and am working on a master’s in manufacturing in the afternoons, how long should I stay in this role to avoid looking like a job-hopper on my resume? I was thinking two years, but I’m not sure I can last that long.

The thought of going into the school is now making me physically sick. I work for an outside organization and am contracted to be in the schools, as a support person for students struggling. I do not work for the school. They are not my employer. I try to help as much as I can. I want to be a team player but have had to set boundaries, because they have tried to hand me responsibilties that do not fit my role. The last person in my role did everything they asked and more so that has not been easy for me. I do not think they liked those boundaries, and I can feel their dislike for me. I mean sometimes people just ignore me so that is an odd feeling. It didnt even help when I brought treats in for everyone... still ignored. Since I am in the school alone, and not with my team because they are in other schools, it makes it so much harder. I left the corporate world to do this and try to make a difference but this is not it. 

Im not good at setting boundaries either so doing so was a big step for me, but it just has come with backlash. 

Bless the person who can do this job and thrive, but it is not me. I'd rather go back to corporate and just volunteer my time elsewhere. With that said I feel so guilty because my team and my boss are lovely. We get along well, and they are just solid people. I am by myself in the schools 95% of the time and rarely work with my team. I just have anxiety about disappointing them when I do leave. It would take time to find a replacement and I do not want to screw anyone over by putting more work on them.

1gfjd1a,Considering to leave ,"Hi all,

I’m quite new to posting on Reddit especially about career stuff but I’m at a bit of a crossroads and looking for some help.

Context: Finished university and have 1.5 going up to 2 years experience in sales/sales support. I love aspects of the role such as the communication skills it needs and others I’m simply ok with such as cold calling (don’t love it but I feel like I’ve kinda got used to it at this point)

Problem: I’m currently working an SDR job at a very highly regarded company but haven’t been consistently hitting my quant metrics, my quality is really good and has led to great pipeline progression and several deals being closed but there’s challenges with my territory and the manager I book the meetings for is extremely picky with who I book. I’ve expressed my challenges to my manager but the company culture is very much there’s always a way you can be doing more rather than investigating it. 

This has led me to being put on a plan and me looking at alternatives outside my company as I don’t want to be let go (especially in this market). 

I did an interview a couple of weeks ago and received an offer however from looking at glassdoor I have some concerns about the workplace however the role brings me more align with what I like and also has a bump in pay. I understand glasdoor doesn’t paint the full picture as the company I’m currently at reads really well on the website but internally has many problems. 

I’m looking for advice on what to do next, currently right now I don’t have an exact title or role I want to be in the future I’m more narrowing down what I like and don’t like in my job and I feel like I’m getting close. However, I don’t want to jump ship from a place that has amazing people and great perks to end up to in a tougher spot.

1gfityi,How do I handle a difficult job share?,"Context 
I started a role earlier this year job sharing with a mature lady who on the face of it was lovely. The company is very nice and a great group of people.

6 months in I got suspicious of my job share. She would criticise/find things wrong but not directly address them with me. 

FYI there are no written guides, I had to make my own notes and I come from a different industry. I order things along side doing the booking keeping and management accounting. 

The ordering side we share and invoicing. The accounting’s just me.

My review came around and I was already wound like a coiled spring. I had been jabbed at for mistakes that I wasn’t even aware I had made a few times and the tension was getting worse as the job share was speaking to me rather sharply which I didn’t appreciate. 

At the review the company owner had a sheet of issue my job share had complained about, none of which had been brought up prior. For the first 6 months I thought everything was swimming. A lot of which could be explained by lack of information given and lack of structure. But I owned my mess ups and aimed to do better. The accounting I do independently I got the highest praise for as it’s the best it has ever been. 

Things have gotten better. I have been spoken to better. Just occasionally my job share throwing me under the bus instead of coming to me directly and dealing with things. 

I snapped a few weeks ago over one which made me feel completely infuriated as the thing in question I had gone to my job share directly. Then followed it through and then was publicly told I was wrong. I knew no different. So I lost the will. 

The directors are nice and have taken my upset on board. But have asked to chat on Friday about it. Instant panic set in.

I’m worried. I’m exhausted with now feeling stressed about coming in as I don’t know what I have done wrong. It’s got to a point I am paranoid and end up noting everything I do down so I can back it up.

This person put a lot of pressure on me as a young person eager to do whatever it takes to get the work done, offered no support, and blamed it on my character when I was struggling. It was a toxic work relationship, and I've done so much work to get over being treated so badly.

1gfh38o,To quit or to not quit ?,"I'm 23yo and am currently the Duty Manager at one of the leading luxury hotels in India. The reason for my growth being fastracked was due to the company choosing me as a Management Trainee, so for the company, I;m actually prized manpower. Its been five months in my current role and I'm considering quiting my job in the next couple of months. 

The reasons I wanted to leave the job were: 

1. No growth: I'm stuck doing the same tasks through every single day, and most of it, in my opinion is clerical. And same is the case for my boss too, and his boss, both who have been in the same role for years
2. No balance: There no balance between my personal life and work. On days I'm working, I barely have the time for anything else and the days I'm off, I'm so tired I'm only recuperating. When I'm home and away from work, there's ALWAYS someone reaching out for something. 
3. Erratic schedules: The unpredictable schedules, long work hours with little to value for the work done end up in me being demotivated 
4. Limited use of skillset; While I want to and am eager to do more than what my job role defines, the framework of the organization limits me to do that. 
5. Further Education: having just a BSc in Hospitality Management, I feel I need to upskill myself further moreso because hotels isn't something I want to do forever. The timeline I've currently set for myself is 2025 mid to start my masters, to complete when I'm around 26yo.  
6. Deteriorating Health: ever since I began my job, my health both mental and physical have gotten neglected. I eat just one and a half meal a day, barely drink fluids while at work. Have minimal to niil constructive physical activity and am always stressed about/at work. 

While I was always bent on leaving the job, I've lately begun to feel I should probably stick around and heres my dilemma:

1. All jobs have a struggle initially, don't they ? What's the surety that my next job won't be as bad. Might as well stick around for a couple years till i make it. (But again, my boss and his boss have been doing the same thing for years and things haven't changed for them even with the succession in roles)
2. Am I getting used to the the struggle which is why I don't want to leave anymore ? (its like the walrus/mermaid effect from How I met Your Mother)
3. Am I just getting lazy to do what should be done at my age ? All jobs are initially tough, what makes me so special that I shouldn't stick around and quit ?

1gffkcp,Medical Leave - Next Move? ,"Hi all - apologies for the long post I wanted to give good background. I'm located in Ontario if that helps in regards to medical leave laws. 

Just wanted some feedback on my situation and how I should go about this. 

I started with a company about 1.5 years ago in an administration/front desk role. In September I had some family stuff happen as well as feeling like the role I was in was unsustainable with the level of work I was putting in as I was constantly in overtime and running at over 100% capacity. My anxiety ended up not becoming managed anymore and I took a medical leave for mental health. 

Prior to this I had discussions with my boss about moving into a more operations/HR based role in the future. She was on board with that. 

I worked with my doctor and got my meds settled again and returned to a more stable place. I was ready to return to work November 4th and my doctor signed off on it. Then my mom was hospitalized and they now believe she may have liver failure and we are in the process of getting tests and everything done. Obviously this is a lot of stress and my anxiety has become symptomatic again. My doctor believes I should extend my leave to deal with this stressful time in my life and continue treatment for my mental health. 

I had a meet up with my bosses today and they expressed that they are concerned I haven't taken enough time off to truly heal. They made comments that the adminstration/front desk role will still be stressful when I return and that the business continues to grow and it will just be more stressful. They want me to take more time off to really heal 100% and they suggested thinking about what I really want out of life and if this role is making me happy. They mentioned that they will support whatever decision I make and if that means I don't want this role they will reach out to their network and see if they can find a less stressful role for me. 

This feels a little weird to me. If my doctor signs off on my return I feel that should be enough. I also feel the comments about me being able to handle the role and it still being stressful were hints that they believe I can't handle the role anymore. I enjoy the company and the culture and would like to stay there but I would like to switch out to another role on my return if possible. 

How do I word it so it's not ""I don't like this front desk role, I would like to do something else in the company. But if that's not possible I will take my old role back"" (obviously for some income while I start job hunting again. The job market is tough so I don't want to leave without a signed offer in hand) Legally they only have to hold my role for me after medical leave, they are not required to offer me a new role. Given the job market I don't want to give up my legally protected role but still want to see if there is any room to work out a new role for my return without taking my legally protected role off the table and screwing myself.

1gffh1d,Lost my dream job,"I am a very unmotivated individual with usually zero goals or aspirations in life. I’m 22 years old and finally came across a job that ticked all the right boxes for me and that I immediately felt passionate about. I got through multiple stages and drove 4.5 hours away to be assessed for the job. I knew I did poorly but I’ve never preformed well in a testing environment. I had all the necessary requirements and experience. I worked in a VERY similar environment so I knew I had the emotional capacity and ability to preform the job. The more I heard about this job the more excited I got. I felt like I finally found a job I would love. Statistically, most people change careers a few times in their lives so I knew if this didn’t pan out for the rest of my life it would still leave me with such an advantage to secure other jobs with the experience and skills I would gain. OF course I understand the importance of passing the assessments as in their opinion they may not see me fit for the job.

Anyways just got the email today I didn’t make it through. I feel like I’m in a weird grieving process. I’ve just sulked about it all day - not super productive. I know they were hiring a large group of people so it stings even more to know I wasn’t good enough when they were mass hiring. 

ANYWAYS not looking to drum up empathy but felt good to have a little whinge. I really don’t know where to go from here. I can’t imagine working any job but that. Im currently stuck in the retail job I’ve worked for 7 years and I’m miserable.

Has anyone lost their dream job and it’s actually worked out positively? I feel like this is a dead end.

For the most part, they're handled with a lot of calmness and grace, but I work with a lot of domineering types who have a lot of power so I have to. You really wouldnt even think Im having issues with them if you were watching us interact. I've had a few disputes that ended very very badly before and I learned to recognize one of those types of people before engage in the power struggle. This post is involving one of those people that I think do a lot of damage. 

T 32? Idk how old he is actually. But hes working at a site that's not busy, so he gets paid to wfh almost the entire month. He's an underperformer and I was unfortunately added to all his projects and they've been going well no thanks to him. But he's irresponsible and has thrown me under the bus while I was helping support him on HIS projects so he could evade responsibility for his own negligence and was caught lying because I keep receipts. 

Now I've become really resentful, and after he asked us to do a task for the third time (it failed the first two times and thats 5 hours each time to do) i asked him if he had fixed anything otherwise I don't think we should expect a different result and was getting frustrated. He tried to tell me it was user error. Like, no way in hell that's possible. Myself and my other team member helping w this task are the two highest performers on the team and 90% dont fail due to user error, so that's bull shit. 

I booked a meeting with the tech when I told him I had an idea of what might be causing it and he tried to throw a fit and protest the meeting. He kept asking me why I wanted to talk to him, why cant he know? I just told him I didnt have the bandwidth to go back and forth with him and all questions will be answered at the meeting, plus I already told him. It turned out there was problem that had been fixed after the last time, despite that he said nothing was fixed and it was what I told him was why I wanted to book the meeting. 
Huge waste of everyones time, just no communication, apparently he did fix something. Why not just tell us that? 

The next meeting was later that day to have him hand me some documents because I manage all equipment nationwide, and he didn't accept the meeting, but then showed up 6 min late, then stayed on mute while we were asking him quesrions, and then we had to tell him to unmute his mic, didn't answer the question and would just stonewall and leave us in an awkward silence. 
My coworker was trying to ask him nicer and nicer to get him to respond and finally he did once she was practically in a subservient mode and asking him to make decisions for my project (they weren't well thought out and thats another one of his weaknesses). 
I told my coworker after that I didn't like that he was stonewalling us and my bad feeling behind how the meeting went. 


I got pulled into a meeting soon after where my supervisor said he has basically been stonewalling him as well for a long time. Leaves him talking to himself and keeps his mic muted and camera off in 1on1 meetings. My coworker said he's leaving us in an awkward silence and it's humiliating. I said its manipulative and abusive and he is trying to punish us for being frustrated with him, and instead of helping us hes acting frustrated in return and as if hes the victim. DARVO 101.

I actually view him as a huge threat, just acting like a victim when he's the aggressor, a liar, and now treating my whole team and our boss like were causing him distress and he wants us to know it. 

At this point, i really think this guy needs to go.  I find these types of people to be extremely dangerous because in a defensive state he may not act ethically and this will be an uphill battle, but I'm so sick of him. He also doesn't care about his reputation at the company, and just wants to keep getting paid nicely. I'm a pretty strategic thinker, so my thought process wouldn't just be going to HR. It would be getting multiple people to go at the same time and submit a group document showing a pattern of hostile and manipulative behavior . And then let my supervisor pull the trigger to let him go. 

I can only really do one of these sorts of fights per year, and I have saved it for a good occasion. Should I move forward?

1gfea3f,Job hopping?,"Hey all! I’m 23 years old, just started my first semester back at college. I’m kind of in a weird situation. I spent about 4 years at a job that I loved, but for reasons I decided to leave. After that I worked for their competitor for about 6 months. Then Amazon (2 months), and now I’m working at a gas station. I absolutely dread this job. All of my coworkers in the kitchen are so god damn boring. No one talks, there’s no fun. I’m just worried for when I graduate this coming year that my future employer will see a few jobs that I stayed at a month or two at. I feel like I have ADHD or something because when I find something I love it. But I honestly don’t know if I can do this job anymore. Does any of this matter? Am I overthinking all of this?

1gfd6ca,Alternative careers with a law degree?,"I deeply regret my Law degree. I love the law, I’m deeply passionate about it, but the path to qualification is just not worth it for me. I truly want nothing to do with a legal career any more. It kills me because it’s all I’ve wanted to do for most my early life and I worked so hard for the degree, but I feel I won’t be able to kickstart my life for way too long in search of a career that doesn’t want me. 

What alternatives are there for me that have absolutely nothing to do with law? I have a keen interest in journalism and business, two degrees I wish I had done, but am open to any suggestions that I can look into. I feel very lost on what to do.

1gfd3i1,Passed up for 2x promotion - still do extra work?,"Apologies if I'm a little vague and this is long. I have a senior position and well-paying job which I enjoy. I have no desire to leave. I lead a part of a team. About two years ago I was passed up for a promotion to lead the entire team. I thought I was the no-brainer choice for the position. In fact people on the team assumed I was getting the job, even joking that I knew I had it already but had to keep quiet. 

Well joke was on me, I didn't get it. The explanation was pathetic and I suspect politics played a role. I was devastated. I was told it was a ""tough decision"" and ""it went back and forth"". 

So now, one of my peers (who in my opinion was a worse choice) becomes my boss. But, like I said, I enjoy the job and I wasn't getting better pay with this work life balance anywhere else so I sucked it up. And honestly, while independently people approached me and told me I would have been a better choice, the person who got the job left me alone and was fine. I didn't think that job would ever open back up.  

Surprise! It opened back up. I thought at this point there wasn’t any competition. I literally thought they’d just hand me the job. Well no. Again “tough decision” but not for me. I’m flabbergasted, this person is not liked and a noted malcontent. I can’t imagine anyone promoting this person yet here we are. Aside from the disappointment, I have a terrible feeling this person is going to be much more in my business than their predecessor. 

Now fine maybe I’m just not as good as I think I am, or I did a bad job interviewing. I’m looking for advice on this: for more than two years I’ve been doing what I’ll call extra fairly higher profile projects. They have made me very visible in the department but they are not part of my job. It’s basically extra work for the good of the department. During the meeting where I was told I wasn’t getting the job this time, my boss said there’s been talk about developing what I do into a role with a title (still in addition to my normal job). Do I keep doing them? I feel like a moron doing extra work for nothing and then passed up two times when it matters.",RangersThrowaway88,3,1.0,8,1730257591,2024-10-30 03:06:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gfd3i1/passed_up_for_2x_promotion_still_do_extra_work/,10,2024

1gfb3wv,I’m lost in finding the career path to spend the rest of my life doing ,"I'm 18 and I'm lost, I don't know what to do with my life financially. Ever since I left high school I've become lost as high school was always a stable place for me and when I lost that stable place and became an adult I didn't know what to do. I want a stable, good-paying, and easy job. In other words, I want to be happy in my life but that's hard to find. Secondly, I have become lazy and unmotivated lately that I've reached the level where I have not worked a stable job or studied (because I took a break from university) for 1 whole year. The only thing I do in my day is watch social media, eat, sleep, pray and that's all. I am not proud of myself and I need to change because I see all these people becoming motivated and working lots of hours a week to achieve their dream of becoming financially free or getting their dream job and I am here just working at a fast food restaurant for 30 to 40 hours a week where they are paying me $18 an hour, with no future ahead of me. What I have realized about myself is that I'm scared to take risks and I am scared to waste money, time, and energy on something that is not going to give me the results I want fast. Whenever I see something new that is coming up like joining e-commerce, affiliate marketing, creating content, digital dropshipping, copywriting, etc, I do it for 2 hours then find something hard in my way of doing it and I give up. I am lost and I need someone to help me because I want to be successful in life and retire early (however, if I find the right job that can bring me happiness when I work there, I can work in that job until the day I die). I want to be able to live the life that I want and to be able to retire my parents. At this stage, I'm not going to have a good future ahead of me. I am seriously asking for advice from you guys, please tell me what I should do because I have no idea what to do right now. I'm going to read every single comment you guys make and seriously consider everything you suggest to me because I want to change, get a good career and stop being lazy. I will go one step further and tell you guys what I like and hate in life.


WHAT I HATE
1. The most important thing I hate at work is rude people who always complain.
2. People who always want the job done perfectly with no mistakes
3. I hate not getting enough hours and not having stability in my workplace.
4. To be honest, I hate communicating with people I don't feel comfortable with, so it will be much better for me if I do not communicate with anyone because that's why I will feel happier and have more concentration on work. This is because whenever I see a person that always complains I begin to get nervous and not work properly.
5. I hate working in an extremely busy place and I have to Rush my work all the time because when I start rushing my work I start making mistakes and then I will hate working completely.
6. One of the things I hate at work is when I wake up and then after one hour have to work a job I don't like. That's the worst feeling because firstly I begin to have headaches once I start working only 1 hour after I wake up. Secondly, I'd begin to hate my work because I am in a very bad mood when I just wake up.
7. The second thing I hate when I'm working is when I don't get enough sleep or eat food the night before. If I get less than six hours of sleep I begin to get very tired.
8. The other thing I hate is to do or try new things. In my life, I want to work a job that stays the same for a long period because I'm not comfortable with change.
9. The final thing that I hate in my life is causing problems, the dream that I have for my life is to have a peaceful and careless one where I don't need to worry about problems at work or in my free time. I hate arguing.

Things that I’m bad at:
I'm bad at writing, reading, spelling, memorizing content that I learn, getting motivated to do something, and having a bad attention span. I'm bad at math, science, and legal studies. I'm very good at business studies, but I'm still bad at the writing and reading aspects of it. I'm bad at controlling myself to do something that I don't feel like doing right now. I'm very bad and become nervous when I start working as a team. I'm also bad at finding what job or degree is most suitable for me as I'm completely lost in that aspect. What I mean by that is I know some of the characteristics of having a job that I like but I can't find that job that I like.

My plan in life:
My current plan in life is that I just want to work in a workplace that has a good environment, good pay, stability, and is simple. After I finish my work I would go to my room, lie down, watch YouTube, eat my fruits and vegetables, and sleep. The new reason I am working is to support myself to go to my room and watch YouTube on my laptop and its fruits and vegetables. In other words, by working I pay for the rental and for the prices of the fruits, vegetables, water, and electricity that I'm spending when I am watching YouTube. This means that if all of this only costs May 200 dollars then I would only want to work to get paid five hundred dollars. That's why I save $300 and have $200 to live in my room, buy fruits and vegetables, and pay for electricity and water. While doing all this my plan is also to consume religious content and become closer to god. Religion is an extremely important aspect for me because I know this world is just a test and I do not need to get an amazing degree because, at the end of the day, we will all go to Judgment Day and meet our creator without any degree or any money. That means my goal is to also be a religious guy and to get a lot of good things throughout my whole life.

1a. What interests me in my free time?
1. Watching TV YouTube and any form of entertainment
2. Making jokes
3. Eating fruits and vegetables
4. I would rather live in one room that allows me to watch entertainment shows and food and electricity are provided instead of living in a big house/
5. When I am watching YouTube I like to listen to reviews of movies, celebrity news, vlogs, Religious content, and Arabic drama.
6. I can stay for the whole day sitting in my room not talking to anyone as I like my own company in my free time and at work more than talking to people. 
7. The top influences I watch constantly are Mr Beast, Ryan Trahen, KSI, Nostalgia Critic, pitch meetings, cinematics, Dead Meat, and religious and Arabic content as well.
8. I would rather have a maximum of five clothes that I wear throughout my whole life instead of having multiple clothes that I wear each day.
9. In other words, I don't like to go out or spend too much money. The only thing I want is to have something to entertain me: food, water, and one room where I can sleep. That's all I need for my free time.
10. I like to count money and see how much a business, song, or movie made in comparison to the budget. In other words, I'm bad at math but I'm good at financial mathematics in particular.
11. I'm good at talking about anything that is related to celebrities like giving new movie or song reviews, talking about celebrity gossip and I can even ask celebrities questions because it interests me. 
12. If I feel comfortable with some people, I can talk a lot and make them by telling them jokes, asking them interesting questions, and more.
13. I'm very good at saving my money as I don't spend a lot of the money I have on buying stupid things.

1b. What interests me at work?
1. I like to work alone. To be honest that's pretty much it. The only thing I like to do is work alone without anyone being my boss 24/7. I have had many bad experiences where employees were rude to me or annoying me and that just made me hate going to work every day.
2. The most important thing to me about working is firstly the environment and secondly the pay. If those two things are good I would not care if I work for 50 hours a week because, at the end of the day, I'm doing what I like.
3. The third most important thing when it comes to working is stability. I do not like to work for 50 hours one way and the other week I work 20 hours. 
4. The fourth most important thing about working is that I do not like to communicate with other people. I would like to work alone in a place where I do not communicate with other people and people do not communicate with me. That's why people cannot be rude or annoying to me.
5. I like a workplace that gives me freedom when I'm working.
6. I like to sing at work because it is my way of allowing time to go faster. This can only be possible if I work alone.
7. One of the most important things in a workplace is that the work itself is simple and does not need someone to get stressed, nervous, or angry at all because the work itself does not require that much stress.

2. What are my current skills?
1. I'm good at using my imagination. I have realized that when I'm writing English stories in my hsc. I have written an amazing and exciting Story in my HSC exams about a person Who sees a statue on the streets, takes it home and begins to form a connection to the statue. This proved to me that when I'm put to the test I can produce great stories. However, this is a skill that I need to evolve on.  If I can evolve my reading, writing, and spelling skills, then I will not only be suitable to write imaginary books, but I can also be suitable for multiple high-paying jobs as a lot of the jobs involve a person being good at writing, reading, and spelling. Because I have great imaginary skills, I'm also able to come up with a product and sell it in my business. Having great imaginary skills is a valuable thing which not a lot of people have. Furthermore, because of this skill, I'm able to create books, TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram videos or even write TV shows.
2. Another skill that I have is acting,  because I grew up watching movies like Batman, Harry Potter, and more. I always had a passion for it and if I improve on it then I will be able to be successful. Because of this skill, I can act in TikTok, YouTube, Instagram videos, and TV shows/movies. 
3. The third thing that I'm passionate about is singing, the reason I know this is because every time I work and I am extremely sad, I begin to see and it motivates me to continue working and be happy.  I do get joy out of singing religious songs. This skill could make me a religious singer or get me involved in producing, directing, and making religious songs. The only downside of this is that my voice is bad,  however, I can improve my voice and expand on the skill if I want to.
4. I'm good at reacting to content from other people's videos. The reason I know this is because whenever I watch a viral video I always begin to comment and make jokes about the things that are happening in this video. I can truly make a career out of this like ishowspeed and KSI did.
5. At my current job, I am good at taking orders. 
6. Carrying slightly heavy things.
7. Collecting the plates and cups for my table and wiping that table 
8. I'm good at mopping and sweeping the floor, and being a cashier at a restaurant. 

3. What kind of personality do I have?
The personality that I have is that. 
1. I am more of a person who likes to be alone. In my life, I would rather watch YouTube videos, eat, work, and enjoy my life alone. 
2. With the person that I get comfortable with, I love to talk, sing, make jokes, act, and criticize other people with them. A clear example of this is me with my mother. 
3. When I was younger I used to have a very strong imagination to the point that every day I went to primary school, I would act like I was Bruce Wayne. When I finish school,  I would go walking home and as I was walking home I would act like I'm Batman and try to defeat a different villain every day like the Joker or the two-faced. This proved to me that  I have a strong imagination. 
4. I don't like to experience something new, because I hate change and I love stability. 

In other words guys, all the things I have written in this Reddit post are for you guys to tell me or give me advice on what career path I should get into as I'm lost. I don’t want to start a family, I just want to support myself and I would be more than thankful and grateful if as many of you guys give me advice:
1. About finding the perfect job for me
2. Give suggestions of what is the most suitable job for me. 
3. Give me advice on how to improve and change myself or who to go to if I want to improve myself.",imlostinlifee,9,0.800000011920929,13,1730251387,2024-10-30 01:23:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gfb3wv/im_lost_in_finding_the_career_path_to_spend_the/,10,2024

1gfat4k,When to quit a job?  Real advice please from those who have gone through it.,"I really hate my job, but I like the company.  I've been in a new role with a new boss for a few months and it's really not a fit.  I had a different boss and different role which I liked prior to this at the same company, but I'm struggling now - hating every day of work, overworking but not productive, crying regularly, and it's ruining my non work time as well.

I'm about to turn 28, and all I have is a HS Diploma. I have some college credits, but every time I've tried to go back to college it just wouldn't work. I'm not giving up yet, but I do feel like I'm running out of time. I'm not sure what career path to take.

I'm not opposed to it, but I also have other interests as well.

1gfaaxq,Leaving for competitor advice ,"Hello!! I received an offer from a competitor of the current company I’m at. Few things for background, my company has around 30 products so it’s hard not to go to a competitor with the breadth of things we cover. 

I am curious about a few things:

1) I have a very close relationship with our VP. She mentored me and recently was promoted to VP in January of this year. She’s always been my coach, friend, and I really want to put my notice in correctly so I don’t burn a bridge with her. My question is, who do I tell first? My direct manager? I don’t want her to hear it from him so I’m confused on how to go about it.

2) Do I need to tell them I’m going to a competitor? I have a feeling they’ll deactivate me same day and I don’t want to leave on a bad note but I’m not sure how this usually goes or how to leave on “good terms”.

The past decade plus was spent alternating between mania and depression.

I only was diagnosed in the last several years, and spent all the time since then living with my family (benefitting from their financial and emotional support) while trying to seek treatment that would help stabilize my condition. I don't want to get into the sob story, but it's been a tough road (bipolar, depression, panic disorder).

Although I'm incredibly fortunate to be able to say that my mental health has gotten much better, I also have very spotty work experience that doesn't really draw out a clear career path.

My job history consists of some entry level marketing analytics, delivery driver, uber driver, and currently, admin work for a small tech start up. I manage payroll, insurance, accounting, compliance, and other odds and ends. It's a non-technical role.

I'm essentially a contact or company rep for the CPA and insurance broker that we've contracted. I'll also handle some small problems that we've had with the IRS recently. On the whole, it's fair to say that it's not complex or challenging, but what it's given me is some confidence in handling a set of routine responsibilities and expectations. I have a boss, but I work remotely and have very little interaction with them since most of the operation I'm responsible for basically runs itself (the CPA and the broker do their work and report to me, and most of the time, things are straightforward). 

I'd say that I definitely have a chip on my shoulder. It's a mix of imposter syndrome and feelings of inadequacy stemming from a very real lack of work experience compared to my peers. There were many years I was unable to work as I was dealing with depression, mania, and chronic panic attacks.

I have created an alt for the purpose of this thread because i'm too ashamed to admit this on my main account. 

  
I work as an accountant for the federal governement of Canada. 

  
My performance at work in the past couple of months has been... pretty poor. I can tell my supervisor is loosing patience with me and I can't blame her. Honestly, if I worked in the private sector I'd already be fired.

  
I do too many mistakes I shouldn't do and I can't explain why. It's not even like i'm overworked or that my tasks are too complex. I just.. suck at my job,honestly. 

  
The most frustrating thing for me is I don't understand why I'm in this prolonged period of bad performance. I used to perform better.  I lack focus & motivation, which I used to have. 

  
I need to do some introspection to understand why I'm in this pathetic state but I don't know where to start. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

1gf7nsi,I'm on the brink of being fired. I really want to stay. Can I turn it around?,"I got a corporate job at my dream company earlier this year. My last job, while also prestigious and in corporate, was in a big firm where I got away with a lot. That plus Covid meant that no one blinked an eye over me coming in late, taking long lunch breaks, generally being away from my desk, as long as the work got done on time.

In my current role, I quickly got called up by my manager over things that were not issues in my last job - e.g. working from home without permission, coming in 10-15 mins past 9am, popping out during the working day for medical appointments. It sounds stupid but I genuinely didn't realise these were problems until they were pointed out.

Because of these issues, my six month probation got extended to nine months. I was told that I should focus on continuing the improvement I was already demonstrating in terms of punctuality and attitude and all would be well.

Fast forward about 2 months later, in which time I have not received further feedback from my manager. At my last check in with him two days ago, he says that he is on the brink of failing my probation because I have not demonstrated commitment or motivation in the role. I am shocked because this is the first time I'm hearing that it has gone this far. He said he is talking to HR and we will pick it up from there. He seemed very frustrated and disappointed more than anything, especially because he has expressed to me before how stellar my resume is and how great my interview was.

I have taken the time to reflect on what was said and have identified my shortcomings and mismatch in expectations when taking this role. I spoke to him the day after and reaffirmed my commitment to proving that I want to be here. I have also spoken to other members in my team for their direct feedback on how to improve, and have really made a concerted effort to turn things around for the last few days, all the while acting like nothing is wrong. However, I don't know how much time I really have if he is talking to HR. I'm worried that he has already given up and will fire me without much warning, even though my probation extension isn't due to end for another month. 

I'm going to work my ass off for as long as I have left, and I hope I can still turn things around. Has this been done before? Have people at rock bottom managed to stay and have long successful careers at a company? Will my relationship with my boss be irreparably damaged?

1gf7mkw,Would it be burning bridges if I leave a role after in it for one month after getting re-hired as a favor?,"I’ve been working at this company for two years.

This company also paid for my degree.

I took 8 months of unpaid leave. I call it leave but I was essentially volunteering removed from pay roll (they had to cancel my insurance and everything, but I was still ”associated” with the company in that I could log into our system and still had my work equipment) to care for a relative. My savings were low and the relative is under care of someone else now, so I asked for my job back a month ago and have been working since. I also requested the role, knowing that my heart was not fully in the career. It just isn’t stimulating at all but I can do it well.

I just received a better offer three days ago and now feel guilty. I don’t want to burn bridges with this company, they are actually pretty small-medium sized and it was nice that they gave me my job back in the first place and they technically filled my position while I was on leave, but still jumped through hoops to rehire me.

How do I maneuver this situation without looking like a flaky user (which is how I feel)? Do you see it as a big deal. I know re-hiring me and onboarding likely cost my current company money.

I can also stay with this company for a bit longer, but not sure it will make a difference. ",Gordodoes,3,0.6200000047683716,25,1730241526,2024-10-29 22:38:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gf7mkw/would_it_be_burning_bridges_if_i_leave_a_role/,10,2024
1gf7eg7,College major change?,"Hey all,

     I've never made a post like this so sorry if this is in the wrong place. I'm looking for some extra opinions on my school situation. 

     I've been in college studying computer science. I don't have much of a passion for it but I needed to choose something and it seemed like a worthwhile degree and something I could learn. So far I don't hate it but I don't love it either. It can be enjoyable to fix bugs or finally get your program to run, but I don't really feel very driven to learn about it besides the reason that I need to make money and have a career.

     I started an internship this past summer and as preparation I bought an Arduino kit as I was going to be working with robotics. Basically arduino is a programmable microcontroller that you can do all sorts of neat projects with. Anyway, while I learning about the arduino I was also taught about the fundamentals of electricity and how it flows through metal. I was immediately fascinated by this as I had never had it really explained to me before. It's so interesting and cool how people figured out how to do this. All the little electrical components are so cool and genius and I love the way the electricity flows around in a circuit. 

     I've found myself watching tutorials on electricity and circuit design (beginner stuff) in my free time solely because I'm curious and I find it really interesting. I get excited every time I have a component explained to me and when I can see how each little aspect fits into the bigger picture of a circuit. I sometimes find myself smiling because of how clever the designs are, or thinking ""no way!"" to myself.

     Anyway, my problem right now is I cannot decide whether I should finish my CS degree, or if I should switch to something that deals more with the physical aspect of electricity and circuits (like computer engineering). On the one hand, I find it way more interesting. On the other hand, I know it's way harder to learn and possibly has less job opportunities. I'm kinda stuck in between choosing the quicker and easier option, or the one I'm more interested in. I'm also worried that my interest in electricity will fade the further I get into studying it, and maybe I should just treat it like a hobby. 

     My brother got his CS degree and is telling me to just finish mine because computer engineering doesn't have good job opportunities, but I'm not sure how well he understands it. My brother in-law has his degree in engineering and told me that the most important thing is whether I have a passion for it or not, and that he thinks I should switch to computer engineering.

     Sorry for the long write up and I appreciate if you took the time to read all of this. Just wondering what other people think ab this. Thanks so much

1gf56l4,How can I improve my attention to detail and proactive focus?,"Hello,

I have worked for a UK university as a marketing coordinator for the last 8 months. I passed the 6 month probation period at the end of August, and one of my points for improvement was to improve my attention to detail and “thinking around a task”. 

I thought I had made good progress on these things, until I had a meeting with my head of team today. She wanted to have a catch-up as I usually meet with my manager twice a week, but she is currently on annual leave as it’s half term. She said that other people in a task have mentioned that these two areas of my work aren’t great. 

My team are aware of my dyspraxia, and I struggle mainly with processing instructions, which is likely why I complete tasks that are only within the instructions asked of me, as I don’t want to make mistakes or interpret things differently to what the team have asked.

They know that I need clear written instructions and have facilitated that need. So, when I was told today that I need to “think more around a task”, I was confused as to what she meant. When I asked her to clarify, she said she wanted me to think more about why I’m doing a task, what it will be used for, and what more I can do to add value and go “above and beyond”.

The thing I don’t understand is, why not just ask me for what they want from a task so I can give it to them? Often when I’ve tried to think around it, I end up wasting my time with extra things that the person doesn’t want. 

Also, my attention to detail isn’t great, as I try hard to do as much as I can to provide value due to my slower processing speed, which leads to me rushing around and missing mistakes. I always try to stay organised and write high quality content, but things get missed and I can tell that it sometimes frustrates my manager.

When I asked if there were specific concerns regarding my work and what she was talking about, she couldn’t give a specific answer.

She also mentioned that she wanted me to identify where my work is strongest and weakest - I understand why and I think it’s important to know where I can improve. But even with the things I’m not as confident with, I do my best to give it a go as much as I can. But she said that rather than “pretending” to be okay with doing certain areas of my job, I should be honest about what I like and don’t like. I disagree with this because I want to improve in all areas of my role and avoid being pigeonholed into doing only what I’m good at. However, I do understand that it’s important to identify my strengths and weaknesses to tailor my own career path.

I just want to do a good job, and progress in my career, but it seems like everything I do just isn’t working. So how can I get over these hurdles?

I was relatively new to the job, started two months ago. The first month was basically me watching other people work. 
I started working by myself a few weeks ago, so I was still learning. 
I never called in sick, was never late, everytime my boss asked me to do my collegues’ work, I would say yes (again, since I was new I was less busy then them).
The only issue is that there are a lot of procedements and things to learn so, since I was working alone already, I made a few mistakes. My boss called me out on them, so I wrote them in a note so I wouldn’t do it again.
I’ve had a few good feedback from the other team’s bosses. Everyone liked me and I was always in good mood at the office.
I feel a little betrayed because I was still learning, and making mistakes is a part of growth (also the mistakes were not serious, were just lack of practice).
These news hit me like a truck, since I was getting good feedback from other collegues, however my boss was always very rude to me while calling me out on my mistakes.

1gf3fqt,Dilemma between jobs ,"I live in the Netherlands. 
I love my job and my employer. 

My company is being sold to another company. The new company will lay off 50% of the work force. 50% can continue with their full time job as is.

The other 50% can look for work in our sister company or wait till laid off. The sister company can hire them, based on availability of work and a positive interview. Then they can continue with the same conditions as current conditions, i.e. permanent, same bonus, same salary etc.

At lay off in the summer, they'll receive a very good retention bonus and compensation (my retention bonus is €10000 and end compensation will be about €50000).

At the end of this year all employees will get to know which 50% club they belong to. 

Meanwhile, I've had a very successful interview with another big company. They want to hire me. The salary is about €400 per month higher. 
But the annual bonus is less (2% vs 10%). 
The distance is longer (50km vs 30km one way). 
The job is senior vs what I'm doing now as a junior. 

New job is hybrid, the same as my current job. 
Currently, I have a permanent role, but the new job starts with a 1 year contract. 

I know that finding a job later will not be difficult for me in the future. 

The new company wants to know my decision soon.

1gf37s8,My boss is a hypocrite and rascist what do I do?,"Hello reddit, I'm currently working at a financial insitution with about 50 employees. I don't want to give too much detail here, but for context I work as an IT professional on a two person team with one manager who kind of oversees us but isn't very technical. This person also runs another small departement as well.

For a while now I have noticed a lot of double standards and hypocritical behavior from my manager. For instance one of my co-workers was late but clearly communicated this to our manager and this employee recieved a scolding from this manager. This manager comes in late very often and will leave early VERY often for no reason other than, ""a personal matter has come up..."" Other examples of this exist but I'll spare the details as this list would get very long.

Here's my main concern. About a month ago I started a board game night with a co-worker of mine and some other co-workers have joined us. On the days we plan to have these nights after work I'll swing by on my way out and ask some of my co-workers if the need anything (my schedule usually has me leaving earlier than most of the staff). This conversation lasts no longer than a few minutes and I'm cautious not to linger and waste time on the clock. Now, my company does NOT have a strict policy on having personal conversations, I've looked for it to ensure I wouldn't get in trouble for things like this. Also to note my manager is seen galavanting around the office talking to whomever they please at ALL hours of the day.

Well this week when I walked in I was formally written up for, having personal conversations at work ion regards to grabbing snacks for game night, and the write up actually said the following, ""with the current state of IT every minute of the work day needs to be focused on IT task."" I understand that it's important to stay on task at work BUT SERIOUSLY. My manager is seen talking about the latest netflix show with her departements AND ME all the time. JUST today she's working from home and stepped away to talk to her fencing guy who's at the her house.... NOT EVEN DURING A BREAK!

Now, this is an incident that I REALLY NEED help on. My manager was talking to another employee about an old park that was insensitvely called ""n-word park"" about 40 years ago. (with the hard R) and while discussing this my manager and co-worker said the actual N WORD with the hard R 3 to 5 times.... They were just saying it and I turned white. I've been feeling guilty for not reporting this and other things that have gone on for far too long. I'm feeling frustrated because I feel and my co-workers agree that I do my job well and that we are not seen in a fair light and that our manager gets away with egregious things.

I want to report my manager but we only have one HR person and I believe they are friends. Help! What do I do!!! This has gone on too long!!",notyourdingus,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1730230216,2024-10-29 19:30:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gf37s8/my_boss_is_a_hypocrite_and_rascist_what_do_i_do/,10,2024

1gf2ykh,I received some recognition today from my boss' boss and my boss said...,"I'm a Quality Engineer in a large manufacturing plant (global leader in diesel engines) and I lead a cost reduction project to re-use components from our in-line rejects.

  
The activity that I lead projects a cost reduction/saving of £30k per year, so I feel like it's somewhat of a big deal for me, it's probably the most effective cost reduction project I've ever done and I'm hoping that it's opened a few doors for my career progression to Senior Level.

  
The Quality manager ( boss' boss ), invited us both to a meeting today to recognise both of our efforts and he gave me an amazon voucher for £100 and a thank you card, which went a long way to be honest as my actual boss does struggle to give positive feedback, but doesn't hesitate to criticise or give constructive feedback.

My boss was busy and didn't attend the recognition meeting, but afterwards I pinged him on teams saying it was nice to be recognised for the good work we did and he immediately called me.

The first thing he said to me was ""Don't go telling people that you've had this recognition"". At first I was like ""Why wouldn't I do that?"" and he basically went on a ramble about how everyone's really over worked, doing lots of good work, but not getting the recognition for it, so just try to see it from their point of view"".

  
I kind of ended the conversation there and spoke to a colleague about what my boss said, and they basically reassured me that the whole point of recognition is to be recognised, it's inherent to the word. My intentions were not to run around gloating about how good I am, but maybe just explain to other people what I had done and how they could maybe do the same thing in their areas to achieve the same recognition?

For the record, my boss is the Principle Engineer and I'm not exactly his most favourable person. I'm quite motivated and ambitious to progress at this company - and he recognises that, but I do feel like he tries to keep my at current level with no progression, for example he basically appointed me as manager to 3 people with no pay increase, and has tried to give me a 4th, but I had to put my foot down and say this isn't right, through several months of back and forth, he has begun discussions with HR to apparently get me upgraded to Senior level.

I also have a mentor from a completely different department that is several levels higher than me and has worked at the business for 20+ years and he has fed back to me that my current boss is notorious for not progressing anyone through my department and is well renowned for being a bit of a d\*ck.

  
What are you guys' opinion on the matter, should I flag this up or is it just simply not worth it to cause the drama?

  
tl;dr - Boss' boss recognised me for a large cost saving project that I did, actual boss told me to keep it to my self. Boss is an infamous prick at the company.",bisto-js,22,0.9200000166893005,12,1730229605,2024-10-29 19:20:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gf2ykh/i_received_some_recognition_today_from_my_boss/,10,2024

I am stuck working in car sales, have been for 5 years. The money is good but I hate my job. I have good qualifications but I can't seem to ever even get an interview for my chosen field which is actually Design and Marketing, and now after 5 years my portfolio is out dated, another problem.

But the dealership I work at is changing constantly, I now work from 7-6pm, sometimes 6 days in a row, it's exhausting and I genuinely hate my job. I like the management and colleagues, well mostly, but I just don't like the morals of car sales.

I left this dealership as well and went elsewhere, decided okay if this is my path in life, then I'll just keep climbing. So I left for a promotion but I hated it even more, so I just went back as ultimately, I liked the manufacturer way more. I've owned 12 Toyotas, it was hard selling Nissans...

So how do I get out? I'm in the UK, I go on indeed and the only jobs are Bus Driver, Care Work, etc, and I don't know how I get out and still earn, something decent, at least taking home just above £2k a month.

1gf2pgj,Seeking Purpose: Finding a Career That Actually Fulfills Me,"Hello everybody,

I’ve never posted here before, but I’m losing sleep over an internal conflict and thought this community might be able to offer some help. I'm turning 21 years-old in about two weeks and have no sense of direction despite having put myself in a relatively good position. I am the youngest sibling in my family, and my dad and two older siblings work in finance (Dad had 30+ years in banking, and both my older siblings are at hedge funds). Entering college, I just assumed that finance was the route I would be taking. Because of this, I spent no time looking at what else was out there (consulting, tech, the list goes on). Before I dive in deeper, here is a little background on where I am at and my interests:

**Resume-esque background:**

* Junior at a top 10 University in the United States (think Yale/Harvard/Princeton/etc)
* D1 Varsity Athlete
* 3.6+ GPA
* Summer intern experience at an investment fund
* No internship for my junior summer yet

**Personal interest background:**

* (1) Video games. I have been exposed to video games for a really long portion of my life, and as a result, I have fallen in love with a variety of games over the years. The most notable *‘addiction’* I had was Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO). This was 7th grade to 9th grade, and I would wake up every single morning obsessing about wanting to play, watch, research, and look at “skin” prices on Counter-Strike. I still have a strong interest in video games, and in all the games that I play, I tend to be objectively above average.
* (2) Gambling/Poker/Investing/Making $$. This sounds cliche, but for as long as I can remember, I’ve always found a lot of joy and excitement in making money. I started playing Texas Hold’Em when I was only about five years old, and that evolved into a love for poker, blackjack, and gambling (I play with an amount expecting to lose; I just enjoy the thrill of the game). Then, in high school, I began looking at endeavors that could make me money, which I did, although I will not share those with Reddit. This has kind of carried with me even into college, as I still play poker a lot and am pursuing a certificate in Entrepreneurship.
* (3) Golfing/Family/GF: These are pretty straightforward. I love golfing with my older siblings and father. I have a super close relationship with my family; they support me no matter what I pursue. I have a GF of one year who goes to college with me and that I love to be around.

Although my resume is relatively strong, I feel so stuck at the current moment. I’ve spent hundreds of hours researching different financial roles (IBD, Equity Research, S&T, PE, Hedge Funds, VC Investing, etc), but nothing piqued my interest except VC and PE secondaries. Even those I do not get the same excitement about as I did with CSGO or other video games, it is sad to admit. **I guess all of this goes to say, how do I find a career that gives me that same enjoyment/satisfaction/interest?** Yeah, I care about making money, but at the end of the day, I just want to be the best at what I do, no matter what it is. I know that is the only way that I’ll really feel like I am pursuing my purpose. Does anyone have any ideas based on the situation I shared (and based on my interests)? I feel like I am at rock bottom, it’s really been so long since I have had something productive in my life that I had that same *‘addiction’* to. If anyone can offer insights, I would greatly appreciate it.

1gf1kq7,24f Feeling Lost ,"Hello all! 
I’ve been making decisions in my career following my graduation from undergrad (5/2023). I started school on a pre-health science track. I hoped to either become an RN or physician assistant. I felt extremely unsure of my career choices and couldn’t figure out what to do. I was/am extremely passionate about patient care and science. However, my other passion is writing. It’s something I thoroughly enjoy and will continue regardless of my career path. That being said, halfway through college, I switched to a journalism major. I minored in Spanish as well, another skill I hope to integrate into my career. I love journalism in general, but the job prospects are slim and low paying. I ended up taking an entry level job in marketing. I’m now in a place where I’d like to make a decision as to set myself up for a successful career. I feel so torn…. I absolutely love to write, contribute to political commentary, and value cultural immersion. I see myself able to contribute greatly to the world of writing/politics. Perhaps I have an idea that as an RN or PA I’m confined to just that. I don’t know if I’m limiting my potential if I go one way or the other. I know I’m not enthused about the corporate world, ideally I’d like to move to a different environment. I always saw myself working/living abroad, being multilingual, etc. It feels that this isn’t a real possibility for American healthcare workers. Right now I’m thinking writing is something I’ll do on the side, but I’m not totally sure. How have you all navigated career from passion? I hear a different opinion from everyone. Is there an intersection of these two passions? In a perfect world, I want to be secure in my career and make a true difference. I’ve always known I want to be a career woman before anything else.

1gf10kn,Headhunters?,"First I want to say. I only have a GED and am an autistic savant with a rare form of synesthesia. Which allows me to learn complicated systems extremely quickly. I came from a very difficult childhood with a very, very sad origin story. Despite that, I overcame. 

I only say that to preface that even though I have an untraditional background, I've accomplished amazing things despite, the resources, family or support I didn't have. I was able to devise a way to create an equivalent educational parity (to a degree). By studying some of my favorite ivy league tech schools. I created a matrix of the timelines, and subjects covered over the lifetime of the curriculum(s). The specializations and accolades of the professors for the various subjects, and the text books used throughout the bachelor's in Computer Science. I then created an aggregated list to cover all (for some universities, and most for others). I worked on my own after purchasing all of the textbooks, and downloading what research papers I could online to accomplish the same level of understanding. I would ""most likely"" take away after graduating.

But I couldn't enter the skilled labor force of Software Engineering without experience, or a formal accredited education. So, I used the fact that I was an SME at a small company I worked for, and convinced the in-house development team to hire me on as a QA Analyst. Since I already knew the system so well as I designed it (i.e., a system that I created, which generated a million dollars net profit via un-detected automations). From here I used my knowledge in Software Engineering to convince the team to introduce SDET (QA Automation Tooling), after a few months of this. I used this experience to apply for an elite and reputable in-house engineering consultancy and became the companies expert SDET over all projects. Training the entire team on best practices and wasteful analysis. I used this skill to put a few years behind my belt moving from one company to another every 1.75 to 2 years each time receiving a 20%+ salary raise with title raises usually as well.

Within 7 years I was able to move from a entry level data entry position to a six figure career with only a GED and drive, disciple and the aid of my savant talent.

All this to say I now understand and can work fluently in over a dozen highly sought after programming languages. The languages most popular tooling and platform services and clients. I can work within any domain of the SDLC. From QA, Product, Project Planning, Client Interaction, Front-End, Back-End, CI/CD, DevOps, Cloud resource management (in AWS, Azure and GCP), Terraform, Performance Testing, for low level performance in C++, Rust and Golang. Microprocessor programming, IoT orchestration and embedded AI tooling. As well as idiomatic best practices in all as well. I'm extremely talented in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Agent/Fine-tuned Model orchestration for GenAI enhancements across business technology from 4 person startups to 8,000 person enterprises. And have worked in over 50+ projects in that time.

I now have over ten years experience in Software Engineering, Recently as my current startup is having financial troubles and I have two small children. I have started applying to outside positions JIC. I've dropped over 200+ tailored cover letters, and resumes at many jobs that I'm frankly over qualified for. I've received three interviews. All of them wen't very well, until the end. When my autistic tendencies, showed up, and I'm assuming may have been a component to possibly not succeeding as a ""culture fit"".

I say all of this because. Frankly I'm tired of applying to third tier jobs, where I get no response from in any case. Throughout my entire life I have been a driven, passionate, talented and skilled person. Never afraid to learn new skills, adapt and solve what many consider to be extremely difficult problems.

What I want is a talented head hunter. Someone who can craft a narrative and convince organizations that a person like me, can compete with educational pedigree and help me find an organization that would work directly with this person as an agent of sorts? I've attempted to look all over but these ""headhunters"" or ""agents"" are simply recruiting firms.

Has anyone here used, or know of such a thing? Any help would be appreciated.

1gezu13,What do I do when I’m expecting to fail orientation?,"
24f with two years experience as a CNA. At my last Hospital job I had no issues or write ups. I’ve been at this new place for a month and for the first three weeks I had flawless evaluations. 

Last Wednesday (the day my orientation was supposed to end) I got a performance evaluation and they extended my orientation. I had no prior warning. They told me to get better at vocera, memorize equipment, have more structure to my schedule, and finish my skill sheets. 

This past shift I answered every call light I could, printed out a company powerpoint of all the equipment on the unit and annotated it, made a list of all patient cares and checked them off as I went, and got 90% of my skill sheet done. All while my preceptor played on her iPad in the rounding room. 

When I met with my boss I found out I now have even more issues I wasn’t made aware of. 

- The way I talk about my work is apparently very different from how I do it. Even though I had weeks of perfect reviews I apparently now have tons of complaints. When I asked for specifics he couldn’t give me any. He heavily insinuated that I was lying to him about what I was doing. 
- I never rounded on a critically ill patient that was from the ICU as much as I should have. The nurse had my contact and saw me all the time and never asked me to round more on his patient. I got reprimanded for this by my boss but the nurse wasn’t even mad at me. 
- I entered some baths in later once I was done with vitals and I was written up for this too. I should have done it immediately even though I was rounding on everybody during a code. 
- My preceptor did two of my vitals when I was in a short meeting and reprimanded me for not telling her. Told me I was bad at communicating even though I didn’t ask her for a reason. 
- I asked my preceptor for advice like 8 times that day. My preceptor only told me I need to follow through on promises to patients like giving them water and stuff. Then during the meeting she told me I didn’t chart intake and output correctly, was disorganized and messy, and didn’t listen. After the meeting she just ran down the hall away from me and openly avoided me for the rest of the night. 
- Told me I missed call lights in the morning but couldn’t tell me specifics.  I searched through everything and couldn’t find any I missed. 

I feel screwed. No matter how hard I work there’s always going to be issues. Everything I do is held against me and they will find every reason to keep me on orientation until I fail out. 

I now fully expect to get fired. For my lunch break I was sobbing in the bathroom to my family because I was so confused and overwhelmed. I didn’t sleep a wink last night and threw up several times. 

What should I do?

I’m on a project right now where I don’t even know why they want it done this way. They want me to create something to store data in an old database system (which none of the team agrees with). But the problem with this system is that it doesn’t integrate with our overall company wide system. So it’s creating more steps than needed. Plus since the system is old, there’s really no good resources out there to learn it. Since I was new, I accepted the change but meeting with my boss is exhausting. I meet and they end up going in a million different directions. By the time we are done, I have no idea what the expectations are. Even when I ask them for clarification, I sometimes get a long winded answer instead of what I need. Also I feel they do things way more complicated than it needs to be. For example, in the database I recommended some changes because a lot of the processes are just done arbitrarily. I get told I need to do things their way instead and of course I get this long winded answer why. Interacting with my boss is just really exhausting. I will be starting a new job in January.

1gexpqz,"Offered a job with Charles Schwab, but unsure to take it.","I am currently a junior at college, and am working at a large company in my state. I was a software engineering intern over summer, and now a student software engineer. I have a return offer for next summer's internship with this company as well. I was offered a Site Reliability Engineer intern position at charles schwab, however it is based in chicago, whereas my current role and next summer's internships are all remote/hybrid. I have to pay for the apartment and every other living expense out of pocket. I am offered a stipend, however it doesn't even cover a months expense. Even though the pay is higher, i'd be losing money going to chicago, than if I stayed home and stayed with my current company. My dilemma is that I would be joining at a SRE, which is a much higher position and pays better, plus schwab is a reputable company that would make my resume much more interesting. Also, from what I have read, I am basically guaranteed a full time position after college.  So from a long term perspective, it would be a good idea, however there are some short term challenges which are enough to make me not want to join:

1. I have to take an in person summer class at my university, and if I don't I will be at around 21-22 credit hours next semester, which I don't want to do since i'd be a senior and don't want to risk failing any classes. 

2. I've seen the starting pay for both companies, and again, schwab is higher, but only because there's no remote option. I would have to commute 5 days a week in an expensive city. In the end I would make the same money living in a cheaper location with remote option as well.

3. I have seen reviews that the company has very strict policies, and uses outdated tech, which wouldn't help my career.

1gexap0,Considering Leaving IT for Healthcare to Pursue Chiropractic – Seeking Advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently six months into my first IT job, and while I’m grateful for the experience, I’m already feeling that IT may not be the best long-term fit for me because I want to start my own endeavor one day, and in IT I feel like I am always being blamed for things regardless of fault. Lately, I’ve been really drawn to healthcare, specifically to becoming a chiropractor. I find the idea of directly helping people with their physical health very appealing, and chiropractic care seems to align well with my interests in wellness and hands-on work. Plus, I've been thinking more and more about how meaningful it would be to make a tangible difference in people's lives every day.

However, I’m aware that switching to a healthcare career, especially one that requires years of education and a significant financial commitment, isn’t a light decision. My main concerns are:

1. **The Financial Investment**: Chiropractic school can be expensive, and I’d need to consider tuition costs and living expenses. I’m wondering if anyone has insights on how to navigate these financial hurdles or advice on scholarship or loan options for this path. I am considering Northeast College of Health Sciences as the school because of affordable housing.
2. **Living Situation**: I would need to relocate to New York for school, and I’d need to adjust my living situation. I’m currently somewhat tied to my location because of my job. Any tips on how to make a move smoother in this situation? I'm also wondering how people make money in school to sustain themselves.
3. **Career Transition**: Has anyone here moved from IT (or another unrelated field) to healthcare? If so, what were the biggest challenges you faced, and were there any skills that transferred well?
4. **Long-term Career Prospects**: I’d love to hear from any chiropractors or healthcare professionals on what the career looks like long-term. Is it as fulfilling as I imagine, and how does it compare to what you thought it would be when you started?

I know this is a big leap, and I want to make sure I’m fully informed before making any major moves. Thanks in advance for any advice, especially from anyone who’s made a similar career pivot!",Objective_Repair5365,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1730215555,2024-10-29 15:25:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gexap0/considering_leaving_it_for_healthcare_to_pursue/,10,2024
1gex6vk,Interesting roles with good work life,"Looking for advice/perspectives on different roles that are interesting and not monotonous.

Background: work in back office finance in investment ops and the work is boring and monotonous with head in computer all day. Have a bachelors in engineering and an MBA. The work is not very interesting, tedious, remote, all on computer, but the pay is decent enough to make people stay.

Advice: looking for roles (in finance or not) that are interesting and have some cool side perks (golfing with clients/client brand events/etc.) - something to liven up some days. The catch is also looking for something that pays decent, have found a few roles that are more entry to try to transition within finance but due to high cost area, slight lifestyle inflation, and other factors, it would be almost un-doable to make it work. Ex: an underwriting role seems more interesting (at least within finance/insurance) with interactions with clients and general day to day but most entry roles are starting at a drastic pay cut. On the flip side, many decent paying roles my job site algorithms show me that are actually interesting are in things like PE/VC, extremely tough to break into.

Appreciate any help/ideas/brainstorming, caught up in my job searches algorithms and Google is flooded with noise.

TL;DR: looking for interesting corporate role where the work is interesting and days are not monotonous that pay well.

1gew273,I really need advice on what to do,"
I’m currently on parental leave. I’m about to head back to my job in a few weeks. The issue is that I am dreading it so hard it’s hard to even describe that feeling.

A little background. I started earlier this year and this manager has been nothing but abusing. She is dismissive, even sometimes blame her own mistake on us, yells and just downright verbally abusive. To her mistakes don’t happen. If it happens you BETTER know why soon. There’s zero grace. I’ve had cases where she’ll be on a zoom call with higher ups and she’s like “okay I’ll have my team fix it this weekend” and even the directors above her are like “no no no it’s not that important. We can fix it Monday. No working on weekends”. 

Another time there was an email request sent and she asked me to join zoom to see why I haven’t tackled it yet and I’m like “that email was sent THIRTEEN MINUTES ago. THIRTEEN”

She’s so verbally harsh that she has had pretty high attrition rate. I’d say 30-40% of the people over the past 2 years have left under her. I’ve heard multiple people even considering taking her to HR. 

I’m a pretty strong and tough and muscular dude and I can tell you that she scares me. Not physically but mentally and emotionally. Like no other woman has ever chewed me out like that except my mother. 

The issue is that I made decent money here. We’re in a MCOL city. We have a mortgage and I’m a new dad and a husband now. My wife is a teacher and I make 2x what she does. 

I’ve been applying left and right for jobs and just yesterday after 4 great interviews and despite “good feedback” I got rejected. I felt devastated and the dread of going back to this boss just sucked my soul dry. 

While I was driving home from the grocery store, I want to smash into a telephone pole and have the pole go through my head and kill me. 

I just don’t know if I need to just suck it up and don’t be a wuss since that’s just life and everyone hates their job. I’m a dad and a husband and I have financial responsibility to my family. 

My wife is like “I don’t want to see you like this. You can even get a call center job”. I’m like I also want us to have a life and not just struggle by with having basic life necessities like paying our mortgage and food.” 

I have had multiple corporate jobs in my life and I have NEVER felt this way before. The job itself is not that bad and it’s tolerable. It’s the constant “living in fear” from my manager. Anything that goes wrong and she rains down hell on us.

With them stating that I slammed the door was me trying instil fear and start a coup WTF. Eventually it got bad enough I was hospitalised, and upon informing them I been signed off on sick they responded by terminating my contract. 

I have tried then since to secure employment but it been uphill battle, I have been unable to secure reference from previous employer and thought being back in office or work almost seem like a trigger. My confidence is in toilet and I lost my entire support system during my time at job. I did start engaging in work with local musician and that extended to working with a few orchestra and a few community projects, and few successes including a sold out charity concert which raised 80% more then targeted as well as taking series of talks that had been lowest performers and leading them to being most successful. I have set up business and website and rewrote my CV to reflect that however lot work was voluntary so it not at moment a viable career path financially. 

I don't know how proceed when apply for jobs I am either being told I am overqualified or underqualified, the previous job remains a thorn in my backside, if apply for different roles I lead with narrative that I wanted to explore new avenues, but if it similar roles I struggle, usually stating a lack of work life balance as cause. 

Any recommendations I thinking of just taking previous job off my CV although that mean certain roles with background checks I would not be able to apply for. Or do I just throw everything I have left in to this business and try and make it work. 



Any recommendations? ",Doesitmatter200592,1,1.0,0,1730203234,2024-10-29 12:00:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gesv15/trying_bounce_back_following_toxic_employer_and/,10,2024
1gesmn3,need advice on quitting my job,"
so I've been at this job for almost a year now, and I hate it. I used to really want to work here, but it’s nothing like I imagined. I really want to quit, but I feel guilty about it for a few reasons.

First, it’s a small business in a small village. I work at an arts and crafts store, and it’s just me, my boss, and her husband. When I started, there was another coworker, but she quit a few months ago, which meant I could start working full-time instead of part-time. If I leave, it’ll just be my boss and her husband left to run everything, and the business is already struggling. She even thought about closing it down. So, not saying they cant manage without me but I worry they’ll have a hard time replacing me

I'm defo part of their long-term plans. my boss told me she planned on keeping me around until she either closes or sells the store, which she thinks will happen in a few years. I even get the feeling she expects me to take over for her someday. she never asked me directly but her godchild always asks if I’ll take over the store, so I’m guessing my boss has talked about it to her. She also asked if I’d ever want to run my own business

She already put me down for some big projects next year, like store workshops and going to a fair (which she already booked us tickets for). But honestly, I don’t want to be here by then, and I’m trying to figure out how to quit asap without feeling so guilty.

The thing is, my boss and I talk a lot at work, and she says things that both make me feel like it's ok to leave and feel guilty about leaving. She told me she’s never been mad at anyone for quitting (though I’m not sure I believe her) and that it’s her responsibility to keep the business going, so no one should feel guilty for leaving. But then she talks badly about the last coworker who quit, even to customers.

She keeps telling me I have potential and that I should figure out what I want to do in life, that i should go study, (but only “when she’s not in the store anymore.”)

One of the reasons I hate it here is her mood swings. It’s making it hard to find the right moment to tell her, and I’m worried she’ll make my life hell once I do.

I’m also trying to finish a personal project, but I have no time or energy for it because I’m out of the house from 6 am to 8 pm with work and commuting. I have a long lunch break, but I use it to eat and rest because this job just drains me.

My plan is to tell her I’m moving next year, which is actually part of my plan if I quit. I’d offer to stay until the end of January out of goodwill. maybe the extra notice will make her less upset. On the other hand, I could give shorter notice to get out sooner, but that might annoy her. I also don’t want to just say I don’t like the job anymore because I’ve been pretending I do every time she asks cause I’m a people pleaser :D

And yeah, I want to leave on good terms because, like I said, it’s a small village, everyone knows each other, and people talk—especially my boss.

pls don't say i need to do whats best for me not for the store because i know this, and it's not making it any easier. also, i can do some time without a job so no i don't need to have one lined up in order to quit this one.

Any ideas on how to pull this off? advice? encouragement? anything? Social anxiety isn’t helping either",zukosbikini,2,1.0,4,1730202444,2024-10-29 11:47:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gesmn3/need_advice_on_quitting_my_job/,10,2024

1gero2z,Pass interview with no formal work experience,"I'm a 28 yo, have a MSc in mathematics and, currently, I'm trying to get in the field of data science and machine learning. I'm studying really hard everyday since I decided not to go for a PhD right now.

In the moment I'm unemployed, only working in personal projects.

The problem is, since I always thought to become an academic, I never bother to search for interns and this kind of stuff in my college days, I've always studied pure math convinced of the path college -> masters -> PhD -> work at some university as a teacher and researcher.

But, my thoughts about academia have drastically changed since last year, and I want to break into industry to find personal and profissional realization.

That said, one thing that really bothers me is that I have no formal work experience, and I'm worried that this could testify against me in interviews.

Apart of scientific research, I worked, in the pandemics, as a online math tutor in my friend's website, also doing some statistics and data analysis with Excel as well, but I don't think it really counts as a formal job I could put in my resume, and I fear this could be brought up in an interview.

What could I do in this situation? This is really worrying me.

1gern6p,"31 years old creative, tired of shitty jobs, please help!","Hei guys, 

I’m looking for a bit of guidance. I recently got laid off from my comfortable remote job. I hated the company but the job itself was really easy (very very low key data analytics), practical and OK paid. 

I left my home country to move to another one (english speaking in EU) more than a decade ago and never studied.

I had jobs in customer service (hated that), fraud (hated the company + not good at it), cafes and bars (exhausting + low pay). 

I’m 31 now, tired of living in house shares and doing shitty jobs. I’m also a creative, so I like to have time and peace to create and do my thing. 

I’d like to find a job that’s a minimum meaningful, pays enough so I can finally have my own space (let’s imagine €900 minimum for rent) and leaves me some mental and physical energy to create.

I’m good at organisation, communication with people, I care about people quite a bit. I’m creative, curious and culture driven. 

I’m bad at being around people for too long (introvert), mathematical type of logic, big corporations and money driven people. 

Any ideas which paths I could go into?

Some ideas I had:

\-librarian (dream job since I’m a kid, just have to go back studying for it now, don’t know if I can afford)

\-therapist of some sort (massage, speech, art)

\-trying to find work in a horticulture related shop (becoming a florist, or working in a small garden shop)

\-language teach (I speak French, just feels it could be exhausting and low paid?)

Lots of people told me they’d see me well doing my own thing, have my own business etc. But I don’t really have the guts to do it right now. Also the business aspect, finances, accounting etc terrifies me.

1gepkug,2 Job Offers - Which one do I take?,"Pretty straightforward, I've fortunately been offered 2 positions and I am stuck at which is the better option. Keeping in mind I'm 24F full time uni student in Australia.

  
Job number one is a secretarial position at a PE firm owned by a local high profile billionaire. The salary is entry level, however they have expressed that growth into a Executive Assistant role is there should I prove myself capable in the next 6-12 months etc. The recruiters have also expressed that they generally give generous bonuses at Christmas. Other than that not a lot of perks that I'm aware eg. no higher superannuation contribution or EAP. The hours are 8am-5pm. They have expressed that this role would take ""precedence"" over my uni commitments.

  
Job number two is an Administration position at my current university. The pay is 10k more than the other role, and they also offer 17% super and 25% off course fees. I'm unsure of what kind of opportunities this role could bring me in regards to promotions. This job I believe would be a lot more flexible in regards to university commitments, however considerably more boring (booking appointments essentially) 

  
I'm torn as to whether option one's long term/networking benefits would outweigh the perks of the other job. 

  
Thoughts?

After that, I had an online interview with the senior project manager which went quiet good on October 11. Since then, I’ve been waiting for updates and following up weekly. The only feedback I received is that HR is still working on opening the position in their system, when it is done, they will then send me a link to apply formally as i applied through Handshake.

1geouhp,Your career,"How to find a fit career for you?

If you want to really know which career is made for you, you need to understand what you want, what you are and what you need. 
Example 
I want study law, now first i need to understand what skills does that field require. If you want to become a judge you need years of advocacy, it is required. I want to a fullfilling package too, if I am doing it for passion and not for money i would choose litigation. If I do want money, i would choose corporate law.

Your skillset also determines your fit career. You can't just sing and reach the level of Lana del Rey, no, doesn't matter how rich your parents are, you need to win the hearts of the audience. I would suggest gaming should not be your first priority as a career, stability is important.

1geml78,Career bartender: what to do next?,"Hello,

I am a 36 year old cocktail bartender in Austin, but hail from the northeast and anticipate on returning to Philadelphia in the next year or so. I have done more or less everything in a restaurant from dive bartending in working class neighborhoods to working cocktail bars in Brooklyn to serving at French restaurants and working with Michelin level chefs. I make a decent living doing it, working four days a week and making enough to stay happy and put some money away, etc. I've managed, I've built bar programs from the ground up, I'm just as comfortable as a server in fine dining situations as I am popping bud lights for 25 year olds. Another thing: I am a recovering (well, recovered) alcoholic and cocaine addict who is four plus years clean, and I've also lost about 60 pounds in that time.

I've often likened this to being trapped in 'golden handcuffs,' meaning that I make a good amount of money for the amount of work I do and any career move I have thought about has either come with a steep pay cut or a tenuous tenability (think commission only sales, etc.) I've taken courses on data analysis and got far enough to realize that any of the coding bootcamp sort of things are never going to work for me. I pride myself on my people skills and hospitality, as well as deep and passionate exploration of topics that pertain to my work (for instance, for someone that can't taste alcohol, I sure know a lot about the parallels of terroir between French wines and agave spirits, and I still invent A+ drinks.)

I see that there is a ceiling here which I have reached, and that the physicality of the job is taking its wear on me (I type this wearing a brace on my left wrist as I agitated it shaking too many drinks this weekend.) The lack of benefits, the hours, they just aren't working out for me anymore. I take an enormous amount of pride in my work ethic and, to be quite honest, have a hard time seeing myself doing anything else because of the nature of my job: I get to absolutely be myself and help people have a good time. I have a deep passion for culture, cuisine, music and art as well.

So, for someone like me, where would you go next? I feel like a natural fit for sales or marketing, and would certainly like to get into sales being that it can be very lucrative. The natural bridge tends to be toward liquor or wine rep, but being that I can't taste I feel that is out. I see a number of SAaS options, but I've found that business development and sales in that tends to be a lot of 'smiling and dialing' and cold calling people who really want nothing to do with you.

May I ask your advice?",kuhkoo,2,1.0,1,1730176684,2024-10-29 04:38:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1geml78/career_bartender_what_to_do_next/,10,2024
1gemj41,Time for a change?,"I’ve been with the same company for 15 years. Overall, they’ve treated me extremely well. I progressed through the ranks over time and worked my way into management. Covid was fairly hard on the business and my position was cut. But the company found a spot in another division and transferred me as opposed to laying me off like they unfortunately had to do to many, many others. 

Unfortunately, this transfer was a “demotion” back into the field as opposed to the office. (I am an engineer). I’ve been making due, but the constant travel is becoming exhausting. And the time away from my family is getting to me as I have an 18 month old. This is also placing a huge burden on my wife as this role required a ton of travel to consult with clients. 

Recently, I was contracted by a recruiter about a role with another company. My experience is an exact match for what they are looking for and they are coming after me hard as my expertise is rare in my area. They are offering me more money, more home time and a hybrid schedule when I’m not visiting clients. We haven’t nailed out exact figures yet but we’re hopefully looking at $20-30k more per year with travel being 25% as opposed to 75%. 

The overall benefits package won’t be quite as good as I currently have as I would be moving from an international corporation to a local family owned business. The company culture where I am is absolutely fantastic. I seriously could not ask for better. The new company would be an entirely unknown. Honestly, the benefits of my currently company are too large to list. It’s an incredibly amazing package. But the new company is guaranteeing a minimum of a 5% raise per year and 95% in the office managing role within 2 years which I will never get in my current role. 

My wife and I are stuck with what to do. Do I stay where the benefits are amazing and the pay is great, but the ability to move up any longer, at least within this division, is practically zero. Or do I take a chance on the unknown for a questionable culture and benefits but guaranteed raises, bonuses and advancement?

1gemacu,How to deal with a manager that nitpicks like crazy? ,"
Hello! I work in an ad agency on the media side of things. I’ve been working toward a promotion, ever since that the dynamic with my manager has changed. She nitpicks every single thing I do. She never actually corrects any data or insights she just will move things around and change the littlest things so it sounds like her more than me. It often times feels like when I am a clone of her, all goes well. I’m a sensitive person so I take my work home with me and it stresses me out so much. I’m trying to be better with that but not sure how to lol. I work from home for context!

Funny as it is, this post isn’t even all about her - I’ve learned to do things the way she likes and things have improved. Shes going on maternity leave next week, my old manager will be taking over for her. I didn’t have a huge issue with her, but I will say she was very passive aggressive & if my status went offline she would message me right away asking if I was okay. Anyway, I realized today after she’s started giving me feedback that she is just as much of a micromanager as my manager. I wrote a talk track and she edited every single word choice, moving things around (saying the same things I said but just rearranging everything I had). 

I’ve been miserable enough with my original manager now I’m going to have to deal with another type of micromanaging. It’s weighing on me and I’m just so stressed. Any advice on how to navigate this?

I’m currently getting my associates in business administration at a community college. In the middle of high-school I’ve always dreamed of becoming a hairstylist… and over time I’ve done hair on myself or my mom and I’ve gained lots of skills without being in school for it and just being a dumb teenager messing around. I’m currently on my second year of my associates and my plan was to go to cosmetology school after but recently I’ve been interested into sonography the schooling for both is about the same 1 1/2-2 years. Idk what pulled me in but I know both careers have their pros and cons and right now this is what I’m thinking:

Hair Stylist
Pros: Flexible Schedule (my own hours), my own boss, making people happy with their looks (most the time)

Cons: Might not make a lot, hard industry to grow (must work hard to build a good clientele), hours can vary based on what I’m doing, no guaranteed stability, no PTO

Sonography/Ultrasound Tech (OBGYN)
Pros: Benefits like health insurance and etc stuff like that, working with women and making them happy, pay would be great, PTO, stability, can work from anywhere (travel wise), job will be achievable for me to easily get

Cons: Schooling will be a lot and tough but I know I can make it through… idk I don’t really have much cons for this lol I just know anatomy will KICK MY ASS. But I’m a very studious person and I don’t get my grades go past a 90.

Sorry if any of you have read this far but I know for a fact from either career I like to make people happy I like to see them smile… it’s heartwarming knowing I’m doing something that they will remember.

1gekwh9,Lost: Jack of All Trades; Found: New Job Hopefully? ,"Hello all, seeking advice, insights or suggestions in this career soup I find myself in, especially for seniors/managers/over-employed.

I’m currently director of IT at a small/mid size finance firm looking to switch jobs/careers but no clue what to do next/how to focus my search. What I do know is I’d prefer hybrid or remote and a non-entry level role (for autonomy, responsibility, impact, and $ reasons). Currently working on a portfolio site to compile my work in

Despite the job title I don’t have a CompSci degree or any formal education in IT and worry about my competitive chances in the market as well as competency skills on the job itself should I get in. 

Competency is a key focus for me as I really want to have an impact no matter what role I’m in. I’ve done my best to combat any experiential/knowledge gaps by throwing myself into 3 years of learning on the job as well as through my own self-guided learning and certs. So far I have: CAPM, DASM, CIP (Certified Information Professional), UXD, and with CRISC, A+, Net, cloud, security and MS AZ-900 and others lined up next.

In addition, have a very diverse background (studied philosophy: can think; customer service, project mgmt experience etc.) and I am very proud of it and champion it as what makes me unique, however I too often hear how I should focus on a discipline/industry/area. I really enjoy being a generalist though and learning in general but when I’m faced with the job search site’s blank search box I have no idea what role to type in. 

Then I wonder if I’m not setting myself up for perpetual stress of being a team of 1 as I am now.  Despite my neuroticism, I do know I’m not nearly as useless as I feel like I am as I’m often told by co workers and 3rd parties that I do amazing work and go above and beyond but the experiential and educational gaps haunt me.

Is this title inflation? Am I unqualified? Entry-level? 

Is this the fake it till you make it level or am I too short to ride this ride? Advice much appreciated ",TheFemaleEnigmaa,1,1.0,0,1730170946,2024-10-29 03:02:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gekwh9/lost_jack_of_all_trades_found_new_job_hopefully/,10,2024
1gekr1a,Is there an ethical way to switch jobs while actively employed?,"Hi all, I was wondering if it's ethically allowed for me to do this.

I currently work a part time (that used to be full-time) job. I only had this job when the hours were cut. 

I've been looking for a full-time job since then, and assuming I do get one, how does one stop working at the part-time job when the hours are set for the month in this existing job (hours are different each month), and start working full-time hours at a new job? Do I have to wait until the end of the month?

 If the pay is better at the full-time one, should I put in my two weeks? I won't have any more time to work the part time one if I get an 8-5 M-F job.

I want to do this potentially to make connections with people at the company to better land that job, or really this is just one of the “everything’s I can try to do.” I want to meet with recruiters in person and make that personal encounter and connection so that it has a positive effect when I submit my application online. Moreover, I want to have an opportunity to make connections when I cannot do so on LinkedIn, when I need to know some people over working at some companies before submitting a job application. Sometime the people I find on LinkedIn will not respond or don’t go on LinkedIn. Sure this isn’t the only way in landing a job, but I want to give this method a shot. School career fairs or as such may not be an option (the company of interest might not take part in a career fair).

In general, what is the procedure to request meeting in person with people from a company of interest (assuming one you don’t know anyone there or have no connections)? How should I request to meet up with an employee or a recruiter or manager of interest?

1gejyfn,Girlfriend Wants To Leave Job A Day Early After Giving 2 Weeks,"My (27m) girlfriend (23f) works at a vet clinic (in Quebec, Canada) as a receptionist. She put in her two weeks' notice a few weeks ago and her last day was technically supposed to be tomorrow. The reason given was that she's moving to come live with me (I live in another province).

But the problem is that she feels extremely disrespected by this place and today was the final straw. As an example, 2 months prior to giving her notice, she had already given them an ultimatum that she needed Saturdays off for school. They denied this request, so even before she decided to move she had already begun searching for a new job. The kicker is that now that they know she is leaving, suddenly they instantly found someone to take her Saturday shifts. 

Further, she's always scheduled to finish at 7:30 but they consistently have her leaving up to an hour late because her coworkers leave her to tend to their  unfinished tasks at the last minute. This is part of a continued pattern of disrespect for her time. Despite consistently staying late and the fact that all of her coworkers often arrive late in the mornings, they singled her out when she had to come in late one time due to a car maintenance appointment.

Her shift tomorrow right before moving ends at 7:30 (which realistically means she will actually probably be home by 9 for the reasons outlined above). She asked multiple times if it would be possible to switch this shift, but the response given by HR was that the schedule had already been made with her specific last day in mind. This is despite the fact that the schedule was made before she even gave notice in the first place and they are already overstaffed on that day to begin with.

Tl;Dr So needless to say she is pretty done with this place and told me she essentially wants to just leave a day early. My concern is that this could potentially leave a bad mark on her record with future employers. (She has an interview lined up for a vet clinic in my city later this week). She says she doesn't need the reference but I feel like it might look weird, especially since this current place is already on her résumé.

So the question is: do you feel like she's justified in wanting to leave a day early? And if so, what would be the best way to go about minimizing potential reputational damage with future employers?

1gej6iw,Career decisions,"Hi all, long time lurker, first time poster.

So, I'm after abit of career advice/guidance. I am 33 years old, have been at a well known car manufacturer since I was 21. I completed an apprenticeship before I started there in a specialist field, which I then went to work in. But it was just production line stuff and all the other people I worked with didn't have any previous experience, they were somewhat pulled off the street. At that age I was happy as it paid really well and I got a comfortable lifestyle from it (I was single, bought my own house, car, motorbike etc). Last year, my time in that particular role was coming to an end, due to changes within the company. That meant I would be displaced elsewhere. So instead of a job being chosen for me, I decided to apply for another position, same company, different site. It was also a completely different field, as I convinced myself a change would be good and it was something I was somewhat interested in. However, I only lasted 6 months there. It wasn't a production line but rather testing etc. There was very little work, I felt like a spare part and the feeling was very clique'y. I ended up putting on weight, got very depressed and practically had to fight management to get another job I was so unhappy. 

Fast forward to now, Im doing a very similar job to what I used to, at another site, production line etc. But I can't see myself here for 10+ years like I used to. I feel like my apprenticeship and all my skills are wasted. I have tried to apply for other positions that would suit my speciality  but I keep getting turned down and they don't give reasons why. Just thanks, but no thanks. I feel like I'm too experienced to be doing this kind of work now, but not experienced enough to go any higher. The ladder would be group leader, supervisor etc but i would be stepping away from being hands on in those roles and I still want to be involved in my skill set. Not just a pen pusher.

1geicbb,Stay comfortable and slightly miserable or embrace a new role somewhere else?,"Hi, not really sure if anyone will see this. But I’m currently really struggling with making a decision on an offer I have received. A month ago I was approached by a recruiter, I usually take the call as I never like to turn down at least the opportunity they may be offering. But after speaking to the recruiter I realised that this could be a really tidy opportunity for me personally and professionally. For a bit of context my position has changed where I currently work and they’ve employed a bumbling idiot to manage the team. I can’t deal with their management style or their approach to asking me things they should really know. I’ve been at my current workplace for 9 years and my manager 6 years. He is asking really basic questions and passing on a lot of responsibility over to me that simply I’m not paid to do. 
I’m currently debating with myself about whether I take this offer in fear of not making the probation period and being ‘useless’ to my potential new colleagues and then being let go if I don’t impress. Has anyone ever had the same feeling? Is it easier to just stay where I am and be constantly miserable and annoyed because I have a useless manager? The offer I’m currently debating could potentially give me and my family a new lease of life because the money is substantially better, but I guess I’m second guessing my ability and it’s a scary leap of faith.

1gegryr,Help needed with next step after getting laid off,"TLDR question: How terrible would it be for me to take a job that I know doesn't really interest me, while continuing to look for a job that does? The company is looking for someone long term, and they would be investing in training me. If I did this and then found a better job, they would have to start their search all over for a new candidate.

Longer context:

I'm a mechanical engineer (and as of recently, PMP), currently working at a certain large aerospace company that has a large round of layoffs coming up. Unfortunately (and not performance based), I have strong reason to believe that I'll be one of the ones receiving layoff notice a couple weeks from now. I'm a bit stressed navigating this, and appreciate any discussion/feedback on my situation. Since the first day that news of the coming layoffs was announced, I have been sending out job applications for as many local and remote positions as possible that fit my skill set, regardless of how interested I am in any of these positions. If I am laid off, I'm currently halfway through the period I would have to prepare for my next step (the news broke \~2 weeks ago, notice will be delivered in \~2 weeks). I know that job searching isn't an immediate process, but I'm a bit panicked with not having my next step locked down yet.

Most applications I've heard nothing back on which could either mean pending or no interest, and a couple positions I've been given a quick rejection notice. One position, however, has moved along quite quickly - I've spoke with the recruiter a couple times and have an interview lined up with the hiring manager tomorrow. They're looking for someone to join the team mid/long term, especially in my case since they would be training me for the role. I feel like I would be lying to them if I took this role and then found a better job shortly thereafter. The salary range being offered is a little below what I'd be hoping for with my next step, but acceptable.

This position (HVAC sales) does not line up with my career focus so far (manufacturing/automation/project management), and if I wasn't in a panic due to layoffs, this is not a position I would have any interest in. I've never been in a position like this before where I'm potentially out of work and don't have a secure plan. If I am laid off, I know there would be a severance package, but I don't know what it would be yet. A few questions:

1. If I'm offered the role quickly, would I look stupid to explain the layoff context, and ask if I can give them an answer in a couple weeks? If I'm not layed off from my current role, I would not accept this role. If I am layed off in 2 weeks, then I might.
2. Would it be terrible for me to accept the offer, if it came quickly, and then come back two weeks later and tell them that I've changed my mind and am no longer interested because I've found a better opportunity (before starting that role)?
3. Would it be terrible for me to accept the role, start the role if I am layed off, and continue looking for a better job as I start this position, which I know is temporary and short term to me?

I feel like I'm violating the integrity of engineering if I lie to them about my intentions with this job, but I'm pretty stressed right now and don't know what's best.

1gefc3p,End of year reviews,"Long story short we are doing end of year reviews. Overall we need feedback from 8-10 people. 6 of the people who responded with feedback came back positive and helpful with some areas of growth and improvement. 

2 of the people who I trusted and thought would give me high praise for some reason have given me pretty critical feedback that is almost hurtful. It is past constructive to the point that I genuinely am really hurt.

I don’t know how I could have read these people so wrong, but they are the type of folks to get off on their own voices and want to seem like they are helping when in reality they are very much hurting. They could have stated things way nicer and would have aligned more with the other feedback I got. It also doesn’t help that these folks are the lap dogs and favorites of the company, so anything they say, leadership eats up. 

Now it is my turn to evaluate myself and incorporate their feedback into my review. I am tempted to say screw it and not really take their feedback seriously or for that matter even the self evaluation seriously either. 

Or do I go full metal and dissect / refute every single point with evidence? 

I honestly just want to leave and switch places of employment now. I feel like I am damned it I fight back because they are the favorites and I am damned if I just passively take it and say, “whatever” no big deal and move on. Either way I end up looking bad. Which would be fine if everyone else was saying that, but these two are just mean I feel like. Advice would be appreciated.

1gef8ie,Don't know what my next steps are..,"I 24M have been working as a software engineer and tester in the defense industry for the past 2 years. I've hopped through three jobs at this point (all same type of jobs, different companies) hoping that it would be different and I would like it better elsewhere. This is not the case, and I told myself three strikes and I'm out, so I'm done after my current position I'm in.

I got a BS in computer science, and I'm stuck on where I want to go from here. I'm currently making a bit over 100k, so it's hard to rationalize leaving, so I'm kind of just milking it at this point, but I'm thinking January might be a hard stop for me, as I've already invested 2 years into this, and it's preventing me from trying new things. 

The issue is I don't really know what to do next. In the past I've tried to apply for jobs outside my field, but I keep getting boxed in to the same type of job, hence the reason I've had three similar jobs.  I've applied to jobs in other fields, but I either apply for entry level positions, and get beat by people who actually majored in a relevant field, or I lack the experience in the jobs with a little experience that I think I might have a chance at. 

I've thought about going back to school, and even applied to a few grad programs. I got into one program and decided not to go because I wasn't sure I would like that and just end up where I am now, and just waste a lot of time, money, and energy on it. 

I've taken a million career and personality tests, I even reached out to my university for career help and they weren't very helpful besides letting me take a few pricey career tests I got for free through them.

I think about going back to school a lot and getting another Bachelors or even a program at community college so there's less at stake. I just worry because I thought I knew myself enough to originally choose computer science as a major, so I worry I'll make the same mistake again.

I've listed things I like/don't like in the jobs I've had, and I think there's is definitely a lot I learned of what I don't like in a job. The biggest one being an office environment, as I get so bored and it just feels depressing to me. I also have been having doubts about computer science as I didn't fully know what it was when I first started since my sophomore year of college, but just kept sticking with it, because of lack of a better idea, so I think I also lack interest in this field. 

I've thought about careers that I might be better suited for like something in the medical field, as it's a bit more fast paced and not in an office, but again I run into not knowing if I'll just end up not liking it and being exactly where I am now, but maybe even worse. I also thought about doing something that I might more interest in, like go back to school for astronomy or biology/genetics, but again I think I would like those things, but I'm worried I might make the same mistake again.

I go to this job everyday and I'm just miserable, I feel like I'm wasting my life away behind a computer. The money is the only positive, and I've gotten to the point that I don't care about the money anymore. I don't live an expensive lifestyle, and I've realized money only buys happiness to a point. I would much rather make 1/2 my salary and not be miserable for 40 hours of my week, then stash up money I don't need. I 'm just worried I'll take a job that pays a lot less and be equally unhappy. 

So like I said I'm stuck, should I take the leap and quit my job now? Wait until I find something else? Go back to school? Apply for unrelated jobs? I'm just so confused at this point, I feel like if I don't have a deadline for myself to quit, I'll keep milking it out and rot behind my computer for the rest of my days. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks

I started my first job as a developer after graduating from college in 2020. That lasted for just under a year as the contract I was hired to work on ended. Soon after, I landed a new job through a recruiter a coworker referred me to. It was remote, and I took the opportunity to go live abroad pretty much as soon as I started. I left after a year because they were calling us back into the office. A questionable move, but I had saved over 60% of my wages and had made some lucky investments by that point. I was in no hurry to go back home.

After quitting that job, I stayed abroad for over a year and a half. I got married while I was there and went home a few weeks after the honeymoon as I had just a few thousand dollars to my name at that point. I needed to find work ASAP, and I would have been getting paid like ~$10 an hour for software work there.

After several months of fruitlessly applying to jobs online, I finally got into a consulting company this last August. They didn't have a project for me when they hired me, so I was immediately placed on the bench. I was naive and figured the hard part was done, I would surely get staffed in no time at all.

Today, almost three months from my start date, they gave me notice that I can leave with 14 weeks severance or I can stick it out and get fired at the end of the 14 weeks if I don't find anything. You can check my recent post history for the full context. That's not really the point of this thread, and I'm shooting ideas around with friends, family, and coworkers, but if anyone has advice I'll take it.

**tl;dr (Background):** 

* Graduated with a master's in cybersecurity in 2020
* Started working as a software developer, first job was ok but got cut short due to contract ending
* Started new remote job, went to live abroad, quit a year in as they were returning to the office
* Stayed abroad while unemployed, got married, moved back home earlier this year
* Started in a consulting company in August, but I've been on the bench this whole time
* Company told me I have 14 weeks to get staffed or I'm done (or I can quit now or at any time before then and receive a payout)

**Dilemma**

Ultimately I'm not really satisfied with the way my career turned out. I understand that my choices have played a huge part in putting me in this position. I was a bright student, and I worked hard to get a master's degree in just a year and a half. I went into my first job with very little knowledge and survived a baptism by fire. I thrived against all odds and received praise from my colleagues and superiors.

I just feel that the fire has been gone since my second programming job. I didn't like the more corporate vibe at this much bigger company. I also felt like my skills were being underutilized as I was pushed into working on a very niche technology. I still enjoy programming when it's a personal project, I don't really have any problem with the technical aspect (although I am rusty). I'm also passionate about music and cooking. I wouldn't say I'm depressed, although that used to be a struggle in the past.

**tl;dr (Dilemma):** 

* I feel like I sabotaged my own career and I'm not even sure if I'm cut out to be a software developer despite having some great accomplishments in my first job.
* With the red flags in my resume (short stints, long sabbatical early into my career), I feel like I'd have to settle for working at a sweatshop for a few years to rebuild my confidence and reputation. 
* I'm starting to wonder if I should find a different path and start from a clean slate.

**Goals**

I want to get my wife up here as we're currently long distance awaiting her visa. We had planned to stay here for a few years to save up as much money as possible. We want to go back to her country once we have enough money to build a house and start a business. I think we can achieve this in the next 5-7 years as we are both frugal and the COL is very low where she is from. That being said, I need steady employment. If I change careers, I'll also need to be able to reach at least $30 an hour within the first couple of years (I'm currently at $42 hourly). I'm in a fairly low COL area comparatively. 

My wife is pretty business savvy so I figure we'll be ok once we're back there, so long as we bring enough starting capital. Unless I manage to land another remote job by then that doesn't restrict me to the US, I probably won't be doing much related to my field. I'll be working to keep our business running. 

I'm just not so sure what to do in the meantime. I'm working on my resume right now, and I'm definitely going to keep applying for software developer jobs, both inside my company and elsewhere. I just feel like I don't have much purpose right now professionally. Sometimes I think I should have just gone to trade school or something",Equivalent_Golf_4275,1,1.0,1,1730154381,2024-10-28 22:26:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gef3g3/late_20s_software_developer_facing_a_layoff_and/,10,2024

I've been out of college for about 4 years and graduated with a BS in dietetics ( decided I didn't want to become a RD after graduating and don't have the required internship and masters to practice nutrition). I've been working in field marketing in the run specialty and cycling industry for almost two years but growth there feels pretty stagnant (making> 50k/year).

1geeqsk,Does this seem positive? Or should I just forget about it?,"Hey Guys,

So last Monday, I had a technical interview for an engineering role. I thought it went OK (not perfect but not bad), and then HR (unexpectedly) called me on Friday saying apparently it went quite well and that the technical interviewers loved my passion, enthusiasm and they think I would fit in the team very well etc. They also said I did well in the technical questions.

However he said I have to wait 2-3 weeks as they are still interviewing, and are hiring for 4 positions.

What do you guys think? Good or bad?

He also asked me if I had any other applications going on in parallel, to which I stupidly replied „no“ (don’t ask me why, I was just really excited about the positive feedback he gave me).

Also one of my friends told me last week that he has an interview with the company either this week or next week - so it seems they are still interviewing?",Diamondhands4dagainz,1,1.0,0,1730153471,2024-10-28 22:11:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1geeqsk/does_this_seem_positive_or_should_i_just_forget/,10,2024
1gedd34,"I feel like I was tricked into taking a bad job and got no introduction, now i don't know what to do","I’m a licensed medical practitioner and I work in a European country. I’m living in a big city that’s highly competitive when it comes to getting a residency. It’s not uncommon to work somewhere before getting the title “resident”. 



So today was my first day at this new job. I got home from work today and I cried. It really, really sucked. When I was offered the position I thought it sounded really good, or at least my boss made it sound like it was.



First off, I didn’t get any info beforehand about where to go on my first day or what time to arrive. I called one week ago and they said they would get back to me but they never did. I ended up texting my boss yesterday and he called me and told me he’d meet me. I wasn’t given a proper introduction at all. No desk/designated area to work, just told to “find a place where it looks like nobody’s sitting”. I didn’t have access to the schedule or the IT systems.  I basically have no colleagues that are in a similar position as me. When I asked my boss if I would have a mentor (normal for this type of job in my field), he basically said I should look for someone myself and ask them. In the interview with my boss he made it sound like I could get a ”residency” sometime in the near future but when talking to the other people at work, and reading between the lines during our conversation, I realized I’m probably not going to. By the end of the day, I felt like people were pitying me for taking this position. 



Without getting into too much detail on what I do, the worst thing about this is that my position at this job feels like a “made up” position that the hospital has made up to please the university.



I feel so stupid and gullible for not having realized what a shit job this was. I feel embarrassed to admit to my friends/previous colleagues how much I hated it. But mostly I just feel dumb. I’m leaning towards resigning by the end of the week. I just feel so tired and defeated knowing that I would have to go through this whole process of getting a new job again. I just don’t know what to do next and I feel like I’m back on square one. ",gomilina,0,0.5,0,1730149986,2024-10-28 21:13:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gedd34/i_feel_like_i_was_tricked_into_taking_a_bad_job/,10,2024

1gecteq,On PIP and getting fired soon,"Hello, 
I’m on a Pip and getting fired soon. 
I know that in the termination process an HR rep and your supervisor are typically present. 
I want to negotiate for more severance and want to ask if they can extend my benefits, but I don’t want the supervisor in the room while I negotiate because there will be snickering and eye rolling from this person’s end. I also am not comfortable with supervisir escorting me out the door. 
Would it be appropriate to say before I start negotiating to politely  ask the HR rep if  my supervisor can please leave the room  because I have several confidential questions to ask? I would also say “I know you need a witness, and if you could please get someone else?’

Pls let me know your thoughts?

1gecram,From WFH to fully in-office  - how’d it go?,"Been with my current company for a few years now and work remotely from a big city. I dislike my company and am searching for new roles. 

I understand that remote roles can be very difficult to land in the current market, and I’m accepting that my next job will either be hybrid or fully in-office. While hybrid would be ideal, I’m interviewing for a few roles that I’m very interested in but are fully on-site. I’m just curious how the shift went for anyone else who went from fully remote to fully in-office?

Depending on what area of the metroplex I (hopefully) land a job, my commute could be anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour +. My goal would obviously be something semi-close to my house, but I’m early on in my job search so I can’t say for sure.

1gecevx,“I see that you got sued for racial harassment; what’s that about?”: how to respond?,"In my company, we are paid based on customer revenues that we originate.  Most people are friendly and supportive and will help each other win clients, but some aren't.

I was at a business development event with people from another office within the company.  They aren't nice; they are aggressive.

I was engaging in small talk with some prospective customers, and a person from the other office came up to me and said, ""I see that you got sued for racial harassment.  What's that about?""

I was shocked and horrified and after a few moments, responded, ""I think you must be mistaken.""  She responded, ""No, you got sued for racial harassment.  What happened?""  I replied, ""No, I have a common name"" and walked away.

I went home, looked up cases against people with my name, and found the case.  Same city as me and same name,  but someone else; I have a very common name.

I am absolutely livid that someone would say this, particularly at a business development event.

I am planning to meet with my firm's CEO and ask them to fire the person who did that to me.  I also plan to have a discussion with the client prospects who heard it, and show the case paperwork to them.

Any other approaches to take?  

Thanks.

1gecbbb,boss talk,"Hello,
I'm in a situation I'm unsure how to proceed.

tldr: I feel like I'm treated unfairly by my boss, have a meeting on thursday and am unsure of how to talk in ""work-speech"" or throw others under the bus.
Maybe I'm not suited for the job?

I (28,f) started my apprenticeship three years ago, finished my finals earlier this year.

My bosses (male) biggest concern always was my tempo. We work in industrial upholstery but we don't have piecework - yet our work is highly time stamped on the products we make. For every product we have a certain amount of minutes in our system. 
I'm very detail oriented and exact and did take a longer time to finish in the beginning, however my work was always spotless, which meant that it didn't need extra time for correction afterward - unlike from some other coworkers. I always pushed myself to fulfill the times, compared my times to my coworkers and also timed my work speed to become faster. 

After my finals, I signed the perpetual work contract with our head of production (HoP, female), who told me she was happy I stayed. 
A few days later - meeting with HoP and boss - I got a lot of unexpected and also imo unreasonable critisim from him and ""the team"" (his wording), which was never mentioned to me in any way before as well as him pressing on another check-in after the ""three month retention period for finished apprentices"" which isn't mentioned in my contract in any way. I left the meeting with a sour taste in my mouth, I sadly let this get to me for the next weeks.
HoP has talked to me a few times since then letting me know he's basically on her watch list and she knows his bullshit, but I honestly doubt anything will change as he's been in the company for 20 yrs. 

I also feel like he's breathing down my neck constantly and sometimes barking from behind my back at me regarding current work, which then scrambles me and is an absolute no-go in our craft. There are a lot of communication issues, he's bullying a certain coworker, doesn't know some every day stuff from others area of responsability or other very obvious stuff.

However he is very skilled in talking and thinks very, very highly of himself.

I feel like I have a bit of delayed processing and seem to not be able to think about smart answers or work - language in the situation. 

I've also talked to others about certain topics and feel like I'm treated unfairly, but I have no idea of how to tell him in ""legalese"" so to speak. 

Any tips are welcome.

1geajep,Should I stay or should I leave? ,"
I need some advice on if I should quit my current job or stick it out. Sorry in advance as this will be a long post.

Some context: I graduated college in May 2023 with a bachelor of science in psychology and a minor in business administration and Spanish. At the time of graduation, I had no idea what I wanted to do career wise (I still don’t). At the time, I thought that maybe I wanted to be a psychologist (which would involve getting a PhD in clinical psychology eventually,) but I wasn’t completely sure, so I decided to take a job in which I could get more research experience that may help with PhD applications in the future. I took a job at a very prestigious institution (that I will not name) and have been trying to get involved in research, although most of my job is actually administrative work. 

I have been working here now since July 2023, so about a year and 4 months. I work 40 hours a week, and am on-call some weeks as well. This means, some weeks I work more than 40 hours. The pay is very low. I commute an hour to the office every day and an hour home sitting in traffic (no remote work). I like the people I work with, but I don’t really like the work. 

A year into my job, my boss asked me if I wanted to be promoted to project manager. She said it would come with a lot more work, but I’d get paid more. She told me that the company would even be willing to pay for my MBA in the future if I wanted that. I accepted because I thought it’s a great opportunity and why throw away a free education. This was 4 months ago. I have been doing the job, but my promotion has not gotten put into effect yet. Finally, HR reached out to me and offered me a salary for the promotion. It was honestly laughable. They offered me about $3,000 a year more than what I currently make. I went to my boss and said that I was dissapointed with the offer. My boss then talked to HR, and HR came back to me with an updated offer (still only $5,000 a year more than I make now.) I negotiated with HR and asked for a higher salary, but they just came back and basically said “no we can’t raise it because we need the salary to be fair and equitable.”

Now this is where I get angry. I live in Boston and the average project manager salary is wayyyy higher than what I was offered. The project manager before me was making close to $20,000 more than what I was offered, and she was only about 2 years older than me. I know that I don’t have much experience, but I am an internal candidate that knows this company very well and I’m very aware of what this job is asking of me and how I should be compensated for it. If I turned down this role, they would need to hire someone externally (probably pay them alot more) and train them for 2+ years to get them on the level of knowledge about this specific company that I am at.

Here is another layer to things: there are 2 women I work with and we were all the same position before I was promoted. These women were both doctors in another country, but have immigrated to the US and don’t have their medical degree here. I have been at this company longer than both of them. I was recently working on the budget (a project manager duty that I am still not being compensated for might I add), and saw that they both currently make around $15,000 more a year than I was even offered for my promotion. This angered me because I don’t believe it is “fair” or “equitable” as HR said, for people who I am supposed to be the manager of, to be making that much more than me. 

I am struggling with what to do because I don’t think it’s worth it for me to stay here if I am making still very little and I have to spend 2 hours a day commuting and can’t work remotely at all. I see other friends of mine making double what I make with a much better work life balance. I have to work holidays, and give up my weekends sometimes (which would be worth it to me if I was getting paid well).

I’m having a meeting with my boss this week and want to bring up to her that I am upset about the salary HR provided. 

I don’t know if I should think about quitting (because honestly I’m not really happy here. I have no free time after work really and it’s just getting to be a lot for such little pay). And im kindof insulted at HRs offer. This new promotion is ALOT of work and I need to be compensated fairly. But at the same time, this is a very prestigious organization and I work with many doctors who will be able to write me good reccomendation  if I do decide I want to go to grad school, so I don’t want to burn any bridges. Also, they offered to pay for an MBA which I don’t want to just turn down. The thing is, I don’t even know if I want to go to grad school cuz I still don’t know what I want to do with my life. 

If I’m being honest, I kindof want to quit and move to Spain for a year to teach English. I know it sounds crazy but I’m so young and I’ve been dreaming about that for 2 years now and can’t stop thinking about it.

Of course, I wouldn’t just quit out of the blue. I would either find another job, or figure out a plan for Spain etc. I would also not quit right now, but I need to kick off this convo with my boss and let her know that I’m very unhappy with this salary. 

I just need advice. Am I crazy for wanting to quit? Idk If I’m being stupid and Should just stick it out.

Please let me know your thoughts, thank you!!",Particular_Log8745,1,1.0,0,1730142973,2024-10-28 19:16:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1geajep/should_i_stay_or_should_i_leave/,10,2024
1geafed,Training Issues,"About a year ago I was laid off from a job in a small industry due to interest rates. I was in a senior position and training others for 4.5 years. In August, after working in another field for 8 months, I was hired at a competitor of my original company for the same senior role I was doing before. 

I was also just asked to come back by the company that laid me off and my bosses were incredibly supportive, so my layoff was not a performance issue.

My issue is that the person who is training me at my new company is treating me like an assistant rather than training me like a colleague. I remind her daily to keep me included on emails so I know what's happening on projects. I've talked to our boss and he seems to be on the same page as me, but I haven't seen much of a change in the week since I spoke with him. 

I try to be as proactive as I've been in the past and I'm told in so many words that I'm over stepping. She doesn't want me working on ""live"" projects. I can tell I'm bothering her. My boss encouraged me to keep pushing, but it's getting awkward and she flat out tells me ""no"".

There have been a few really good opportunities that my boss suggested to get me up to speed again and she is not looping me in.

I'm supposed to have my own projects starting in January. I'm not feeling prepared because she's not allowing me to do the work that I need to feel comfortable getting back into the role. I'm starting to feel exhausted rather than excited about being back in an industry I loved. 

Do you have any advice for dealing with the next month or so? I want to wring what I can out of her and get out from under her supervision ASAP.",Birdlet4619,1,1.0,0,1730142706,2024-10-28 19:11:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1geafed/training_issues/,10,2024
1ge9xsf,Boss is asking me to essentially cover a coworker’s role and come in full-time with no pay increase,"I work on a very small team and I am the most junior member of the team. Recently our second-most junior team member quit and I have, naturally, taken on most of her responsibilities in the interim (and by the way- hiring at this place takes *forever*, so the interim is going to be at minimum a few months).

I’ve been alright with that, but now my boss just told me he wants me to come into the office 5 days a week (everyone at the company works a 4/1 schedule) because it’s too busy in the office for me to be remote one day. Essentially, I am now being expected to take over my coworker’s job (who made about $30K more than me), and lose the company-wide benefit of a remote work day… out of the goodness of my heart, I guess?? WTF. Do I have any options here? I seriously don’t get how my boss is asking me to do this. Do I have any ground to push back at all?

1ge9k1v,Need advice navigating resigning after parental leave,"Hi all, hoping to get some additional perspectives on my situation. My wife gave birth in August, and my parental leave is actually coming to a close in a few days. Prior to going on leave, I had been pretty actively job searching as I have been in my current role for two years now and felt that my opportunities to grow with this company were pretty limited. Additionally the company had gone through several rounds of layoffs, so I was trying to get ahead of the curve a bit. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I had really not been searching for a new opportunity while on leave, but a recruiter reached out to me and I decided to go through the process as the opportunity seemed really great (better company, a huge pay increase, a promotion in job title, better benefits, etc.)

I was officially offered the job last week and accepted with a start date two weeks out from today, I’d feel crazy turning down such a good opportunity. My question is, how the heck do I go about leaving my current role? I can call HR and give notice now, or I can wait until I’m officially back from leave and drop the news to my boss then. I’m not sure if skipping the two weeks notice is a popular opinion here, but the thought crossed my mind there as well. I really don’t have any work to transition to anyone as I have been on leave for three months and they have had people filling in for me anyways, so part of me thinks they’ll just have me resign on the spot if I give them notice.

Does anyone have any thoughts or advice as to how I should go about ",DrewVanDice,2,1.0,1,1730140580,2024-10-28 18:36:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ge9k1v/need_advice_navigating_resigning_after_parental/,10,2024

1ge9ho5,Strategy for career development as a career changer,"I am a career shifter (28M) who completed a BSSc (Social Science) in Psychology in 2019, then went into tech by finishing a 2-year diploma in Computer System at a reputable local college. After graduating from the diploma program in 2023, I got a job as a Junior Developer in the investment entity of a large bank in Canada. However I am not satisfied with my current job because I feel like it does not expose me enough variety of technologies/frameworks. There is also no mentoring nor any collaboration with other developers.

A bit of background of my current job. My team is like a dev shop for the business teams - each developer is assigned to work with a business team to help them build ETL pipelines and web applications. Only 1-2 developers are assigned to the same business team and developers assigned different business teams normally do not collaborate, at least not meaningfully. Since my business team (risk reporting for portfolios/funds) is smaller, I am the only developer assigned to that team. We are currently rebuilding the database because the old one is too messy and hard to maintain - it is interesting how they throw a junior developer to build the whole ETL pipeline. People on my business, despite being proficient in Python (they write python scripts making risk models/calculations and run them locally), they only provide business logic but not actual development support. But anyways we have Apache Airflow jobs to do daily batch loads and a small python Dash web app for some data dashboarding - all build by myself and no peer review on my code.

Although my coworkers are really nice, the work feels really isolating. And I feel like I'm not getting enough exposure to tools/frameworks that could be of asset for my next job search. So I am quite stressed about being unemployable after a couple years in my current role. I don't mind going either the route of data engineer or software engineer in the future but I feel like the scale of what I do right now is just not big enough to be considered an asset for future job hunt, seeing how other companies list things like ""experience working on large scale, distributed application"" in their job descriptions. Currently, in terms of data engineering, we only have daily batch jobs (no kafka or other real time stuff coz we are only doing back office reporting); in terms of software, at most 10 people in my business team would use the app I am working on.

I am considering the following options and I hope I could get some advice from you guys.

1. Keep looking for a job that could potentially offer higher exposure to different tools/technologies/frameworks in a larger scale
2. Work on person projects that could demonstrate my skills to future employers
3. Pursue a higher degree in computer science (or even professional certifications like AWS, Azure etc.) like the OMSCS from GTech which does not necessarily require a bachelors in CS.

Actually I have been sporadically sending job applications but there is no luck at all. Even for junior positions, I would get automatically rejected most of the time. I suspected this is due to my lacking of a bachelor's degree in CS, hence the thought to get a higher degree in CS. And sometimes I tried to do all 3 items above and quickly got overwhelmed by the amount of work that I need to do. I feel like I am already behind as a career changer, and now I think I got anxiety symptoms whenever I hear things that remotely relate to career like leetcoding, job hunting and stuff. Any advice is appreciated.

1ge9e45,"""Mentor"" not "" Mentoring""","I work for a fairly large public company. 

I enjoy my job, the workload is manageable, the pay is decent as well ( I would definitely like to make more money, but who wouldnt) 

The people I report to do not micromanage and basically give me free reign to do my own thing. (Which is another plus) 

I have been here for a year now. I have a unique position and I work directly for an employee who is one of the top people at the firm and handles the largest accounts in our firm( not to mention 90% of the presidents of the firm accounts are managed by this individual as well.)  It's definitely a great learning experience which I am grateful for. So  in addition to reporting to this individual, he was assigned when I was first hired to be a mentor for me as I came to the firm with experience, but not with massive accounts that I work with now. 

Just like any other job they promise you the world and once in a lifetime opportunity, blah blah blah. I feel we clicked super well right off the bat and worked  well together  and I was basically his go to guy and always included me in large projects so I can learn. We setup a schedule to meet at 9AM every morning to discuss any open items and assign projects for the week to get done and if I needed any assistance  or had any questions. 

Fast forward this individual was recently promoted to the sr. director level (well deserved) but this is where things started to change, and they are now assigned to oversee the team of Sr.acct execs (so now 8 people report to him). 3 months ago, He had told me he knows he hasn't been taking the time with me as he should but him receiving this promotion would be ultimately good for the both of us and he has big plans in store for me and to just give him time as he is very busy adjusting to his new role and we were gonna setup a one on one sit down in the next couple of weeks. 

Fair enough, I understood and sat back and let him adjust. About one month ago, we never had the sit down so I talked to him about it ans reminded him ""Hey I know you're super busy and all but just want to see if you had some time to sit down so we can go over these ""big plans"" you have for me.

 He said oh yeah thanks for reminding me, I'm putting something together let's discuss next week. Next week rolls by and nothing, I'm trying to be patient & understanding bc I know a big position change on top of your duties is alot so I'm not trying to constantly be a pest about it. ( I should not have to though bc  a person should do what they say they are going to do, and if it was of any importance to them, they would find some time to set aside. 


The past month or so I go to his office every morning at our assigned meeting time. He's never there anymore so I will text him to check in and see If anything is needed to be taken off his plate and he never responds. ( he used to be very communicative and responsive. On Fridays we work remote and we had  setup a 9AM call to check in every Friday morning. Everytime I call now I get sent to voicemail and never get a response anymore. I feel its time to have a sit down and figure out what the hell is going on. At this point I feel like I'm being annoying and am being a huge bother. 

 It's really made me start to rethink everything and I am sort of in a career limbo at this firm. I was basically hired to be his protege and I'm not sure if this is a tactic to push me out or what. I've been patient, understanding, communicative, always excel on all projects i have been given, I've received rave reviews from him and every colleague I've ever worked with. He has bragged to everyone about me and the great work I do and I have kept a log of all the excellent feedback I've received. The feedback I've received from team leads is they say he is very pleased with my work and couldn't be happier. I even received a bonus within the first 4 months of being hired when I shouldn't have qualified  until having been with the company for atleast a year. That is why I am even more confused.  At this point I feel my time is not valued and am thinking of dusting the ol resume off to start sending out. 

I'm writing this to sort of vent and rant, and also seeing if anyone has been in a similar position before and how they handled it ? Or what was the outcome?

1ge9c6p,"Working in Risk Modelling, feeling stuck with growth and salary","Hi everyone, 

I work for one of the large international bank in a Risk Modelling role as a manager here in India. My role involves bit of coding and understanding of lots for regulatory measures. I have total 5.5 yrs of work experience and now I feel stuck with the kind of increment and promotions I see in my company or in general role.

I am a IIT+IIM graduate and had to take a pay cut to join the bank since it was a big brand name and I liked the role. But now when I apply for roles outside I clear all the rounds but get rejected because of my salary being too high for the role. 

Before anyone starts accusing me of demanding too much given my experience and colleges I ask for around 40 lpa fix + var which in my pov all my peers are earning way way more than my ask, so please understand where I come from and accordingly think before accusing. (Technically it's been 7+ yrs i graduated IIT and students graduating as freshers are being offered this salary in my college).

What wrong did I do? Did I choose a wrong profile to stay in? I was among the top 10% of my batch when I graduated idk what went wrong that my progress is stuck. Should I switch my profile or probably it's just India which is why I am being paid low in this role.

P.S. I was just told today post all my rounds of interview by a folk in big four that you current package is something we pay to 9 years experience and that's why they are from non IIM.",deadlykiller_bakxa,1,1.0,0,1730140055,2024-10-28 18:27:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ge9c6p/working_in_risk_modelling_feeling_stuck_with/,10,2024
1ge98sx,"I hate working, what do I do???","I am 25F and the thought of working my entire life just SUCKS to me, and I can’t even think of something I’d wanna do for the rest of my life. I want a job that has a good work/life balance and that I enjoy, problem is idk what I’d enjoy that can actually make enough money to survive. 

 I have never liked school. I tried college 3 times and couldn’t get through the boring AA classes. They feel so useless and a waste of money😭 So I am already at the disadvantage with no degree. 

Most of my experience is in childcare at daycares and schools, which I did enjoy doing but there no way to move up without a degree and they don’t pay enough. I also want to have kids eventually and don’t think working with kids and coming home to kids would be very good for me. I have also worked in a bank and currently at a dermatologist office and I hate it, I just tell people they have skin cancer all day and I sit in fluorescent lights at a desk. So my experience is very limited and I live in a place that has a job shortage right now. 

I have thought of opening my own business but don’t have space or startup money yet.

1ge8pfu,Fired for my “mental wellbeing”.,"I was fired for no real reason. I asked for it in writing and she said they did not have to give me a reason. I have been with that company for about 3 years. I have concrete proof throughout conversations with my manager, she would say stuff like, “we know you’re bipolar. Are you taking your meds?” On multiple occasions. And one thing in writing, which says: “On a personal note, I have always been the biggest supporter and advocate for (my name). I struggle with anxiety and depression and have always felt a strong connection to her. And have always wanted to support her in ways I'd wish someone would me. (My name) is a strong (my job title) and I wish she knew just how much I really do care. Unfortunately, it is my caring that is or has enabled her to continue mistreating me and our team and management. I strongly feel currently that (my name) needs to discontinue her employment at (place of employment )to allow us to better our team and for her to find the time and care she needs to improve her wellbeing. Mentally and physically.” The manger who wrote this (that led to my termination) had just got written up a few weeks prior. This was due to her telling another colleague that she would hire her in our department if she would kick a woman that the other girl worked with, whom she didn’t like. 
I have never had any disciplinary write ups, and in fact, I have concrete proof of my manager stating that I was one of the hardest workers in that field they have ever had. She claimed that the owner of the company has acknowledged how fast and efficient I was. And that I had virtually zero errors. And to even further that, the public I worked with on countless occasions would call to praise me and told them they only wanted to work directly with me. And to top it off, the computer randomly took out 30 min of pay for about three weeks. When I brought this up to my manager, she said it was my duty to fix it and then turn it back in and they would reimburse me. Well, this all happened close to the time that I got fired, so when I mentioned to her that I would be coming back for that paycheck that they owed me, she said they we’re not gonna give it to me now. Again, I have proof of all this. There is so much more to it, but I can’t really speak about it or you’ll know the professional that I am in, but this is the bulk. Is this dancing on being illegal grounds for termination? Some advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

EXPERIENCE

Self-employed Dog Walker
2023-present
My role is to book meet and greets with potential clients, to prioritise pet safety on walks, to organise my schedule and to manage social media accounts in order to attract new clients. 
I have maintained 5 star reviews due to my attention to detail.
Brand Ambassador
2018-2023
This is casual agency work. I have worked for Agencies such as N2O, Envisage Promotions, Supreme and Eventeem. I have worked on behalf of brands such as Tesco Finest, COOP and The MacMillan Mighty Hike.
My role involves understanding a product's key selling points, going to events to promote this as a team or independently and meeting engagement targets to drive sales.
Key achievements in this role have been meeting targets by engaging with 400 customers a day and co-ordinating a distribution team which successfully circulated leaflets to increase footfall to an event.  Additionally, our small team had the highest number of sign-ups in a COOP membership campaign.

Testing Specialist- Bluecrest Health Screening
2021-2022
Within this role, I contacted participants of the Covid Infection Survey to arrange visits to collect survey data and samples. This role displays my strong organisational and administrative skills in managing my own schedule throughout the week. I demonstrated my ability to exceed targets whilst ensuring a high standard and excellent personal service.
For example, I successfully collected and entered data, ensuring guidelines were adhered to. I consistently transmitted samples in a timely manner to notify participants of positive test results. Due to changing restrictions, I was adaptive and flexible to new procedures. I achieved the highest completion rate in the region, above the company target.

Merchandiser- In store / JYL
2018-2020
My role was to merchandise and audit magazines throughout Lidl and Aldi stores. It was imperative to demonstrate excellent organisational skills, an eye for detail and presentation when organising the stand and making note of stock numbers.
I worked independently in order to meet deadlines, particularly as the role required me to work across multiple sites and I successfully maximised magazine sales.

Volunteering
I have volunteered with The Mix, a mental health charity. I utilised my communication skills to write concise notes and when communicating with my team. I was also consistently reflective in order to improve my communication style with service users. 
I took part in The Rotary Youth Leadership Award to develop my leadership and team working skills. This culminated in the successful coordination of promotional materials for a charity car wash (flyers and local radio announcement).
Lastly, as a peer mentor I worked one on one with students to boost their reading skills. This involved careful listening, patience and instilling confidence in their ability. These skills demonstrate my ability to be a valuable member in any supportive team.

1ge7uko,Job offer much lower than previous employer: How much room do I have to negotiate when I am currently unemployed? ,"I have been unemployed since June (a restructuring casualty) and I just received a job offer from a company that I knew in advance would never pay me as much as my former employer. The salary was not mentioned anywhere in the job ad btw. Immediately after the first interview, they sent me an email asking me about my salary expectations. I told them what my last salary was and that I would not wish to go below a 20% cut, but that I am willing to negotiate. After this, they immediately invited me to a second interview. 

The second interview went well and they told me I would hear from them in 7-10 days because they had two more candidates still to interview. Less than 3 working days after my interview, I received a job offer. They are proposing a salary that is 35% lower than my previous one.

This is my first time having to negotiate a salary offer and doing it while being unemployed makes it particularly stressful. I don't have any other offers at the moment, but I still think I should try to negotiate and get them to agree to a 25% cut instead of a 35% one. 

I have a financial cushion to lean on at the moment and I am set to receive unemployment benefits that will be almost as high as the salary for this job. If the negotiation fails, I am mostly worried about having too big of a gap in my CV and the uncertainty of not knowing if/when I will get another opportunity considering the state of the market at the moment. 

I also found it interesting when during my interview they said they had yet to schedule interviews with the other candidates but then 2-3 working days later, they already sent me the job offer. I know it is rarely the case, but it makes me wonder if I am the only candidate they're considering, mostly because of my immediate availability to start in this role. I know for a fact that they are urgently looking for someone to start as quickly as possible before the departure of the person who currently holds the job. Could this be a bargaining chip for me?

Any advice on how to handle this would be very appreciated!",folique,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1730136440,2024-10-28 17:27:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ge7uko/job_offer_much_lower_than_previous_employer_how/,10,2024

1ge7r2m,need advice ,so i’m like 8 months into my first post grad job. i struggled for so long to get a job after graduating in may 2023 and finally secured this one in march of 2024 after to applying to hundreds if not thousands and i also got lucky in the sense that it’s a great job compared to all my friends first post grad jobs. doesn’t pay much but i love my coworkers and what i do and i don’t want to lose it. yes i know i am replaceable but i still would like to stay here. anyways my point of this post is i have been struggling with lots of personal shit that makes it hard to be in office the 3 required days a week and i feel so stupid for not being able to handle it and the hour commute there and hour commute back. to top it all off i got rear ended last week after leaving work but anyways. how does taking a medical leave work at a job u have been with for less than a year? if i go to a mental hospital will they let me take a leave or do i have to just quit and lose my job. i don’t want to lose this job bc i worked hard to get here and i love it and trust me i wish i was stronger bc its so frustrating not being able to be normal and just handle these things im dealt with in my personal life. my other idea was asking to be fully remote for some time to just try to take off that added stress the commute and being in the busy office all day does to me. im scared they will say no though even tho this is a job we can do from home. tbh we all come in sit in our cubicles next to eachother and get on zoom and talk on there so i know my job would be possible remote but im not sure if that would still be allowed. idk im just asking for advice bc i need help and i need to help myself feel less trapped but i also can see how lucky i am to be where i am and i don’t want to lose it. working is one of the only times i feel slightly normal and somewhat useful but its hard when all i want to do is cry until i pass out and die. sorry for the long post but hopefully someone has some insight. thank you!,Some_Entertainment70,1,1.0,1,1730136201,2024-10-28 17:23:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ge7r2m/need_advice/,10,2024

I had left my previous job for many reasons (they made promises that they did not keep to). It was my first full time job after school and I was there for 1.5 years. This new job is higher pay by around 20k after bonus. It is a cost analyst job (previous job was aswell).

  
However.. ive been at this job for almost 2 months and I hate this job. The company is growing and there is so much work to do. The manager is overworked and can barely handle it all. The training has been awful, I have to literally ask my colleagues (all mostly under 1 year at the company) for training. The work is extremely heavy (atleast 50 hours) and I get little support as a new analyst at the company. Also the software is sooo old.

1ge73u6,I believe I told my boss I am overallocated then I realized I might not be and now I am worried and want to circle back. extreme anxiety over being fired now,"I’m currently managing four projects. One project used to take about 15 hours a week, but with new client management in place, it might decrease to around 6-8 hours. I’ve communicated that possibility, but I also noted that the workload is still high at the moment. Another client project took about 10 hours last week, but I expect it could reduce to around 6 due to the kickoff phase.

Since we’re still adjusting to the new client management, things are a bit uncertain. Last week, a few meetings were removed from my calendar, though they’re considering adding a new one-hour meeting and asking us to update a separate tracker. If these adjustments go through, my workload may stay around 10 hours per week, but if they don’t, it might drop closer to 6.

My question is: if by the end of the week, the workload doesn’t increase, should I update my boss to let her know that I may no longer be overallocated? Or could this look suspicious, even though I’m being transparent? Would it be better to offer to help with a new project, depending on how things settle?

  
what  I said to her last: last week the client reduced my meetings, so if my hours stay stable , I'd put myself at 10 hours a week. I can let you know by the end of the week if (new manager name) decides to add the additional meetings and shared tracker she spoke of adding. if my hours stay at 10 I am happy to contribute",Even_Outcome9678,1,1.0,2,1730134644,2024-10-28 16:57:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ge73u6/i_believe_i_told_my_boss_i_am_overallocated_then/,10,2024

I’m graduating soon from a good CS program and starting a SWE job in August. Down the road, I’m considering going for a top MBA program if I can get in, which seems like it could open up a lot of doors.

But I’ve also had a long-standing FOMO about med school. I have the option to start a post-bacc and go down that route instead.

I’m curious, for those who’ve been on either path (or both):

* Would a SWE + top MBA make for a robust, fulfilling career with good work-life balance, salary, and reasonable stress levels?
* Or does med school offer a different kind of long-term satisfaction, despite the tougher grind early on/more certainty once in?

They're not fine.
They keep scheduling me only on the days that I work my other job. I'm willing to work Friday through Sunday and take all the shifts no one wants to work for this new job but they keep scheduling my training during M-W, the days where I work the other. If they were just honest  with me and said, no, you can't have any other obligations other than us, I wouldn't have chose to move forward. I'm so frustrated. 
They also dont know when I'm going to complete a day of training until the day before so I have very little notice to give my other job (which I like) since theyre incredibly disorganized.

But now that I realize it. I’m not even passionate for a job. I would say I can tolerate things, but I don’t have a specific passion for a career. I just want job stability. I don’t think I’m passionate enough for computer science to be grinding out hundreds of leetcode questions and sending out hundreds of internship applications to get an internship on top of that, there are people who probably deserve those more than me.

1ge28qa,Am I too late to find a job in my field? (Computer Science),"Hello everyone, I just wanted to vaguely talk about my situation and see if you guys had some opinions or maybe even provide some guidance.

  
I graduated this **June 2024** and was already looking for a job beforehand, but something personal came up. My sister (who lives far away from home so I had to move in pretty much) was having some serious medical and mental health issues and I came to the decision to pause any job searching and stay with her until she got better. My thought process behind pausing the search was that, even if they called me back (some did thankfully which was nice), I'm not really able to move back right now, at least not until I feel like the situation is more stable, so I use that free time to study and keep my fundamentals in-check for when I eventually return.



She's getting surgery soon next month, and after her recovery I think she should be able to be fine on her own again. I am extremely happy that she will (hopefully) be well again, but that means its time to return job searching soon. I have no regrets about pausing my career for a few months if it saved my sister's life, but at the same time I feel like being gone for so long might come off as a red flag or something for recruiters.

  
Do you think I still have the chance of landing something?

I am not sure of the time horizon.  Minimal info shared. I’m kind of freaking out with so many unknowns. What are the chances I’m retained? Should I start looking for a new job outside of the company now? Let it play out and if get let go draw unemployment?   What about trying for a higher position at the current company, is it worth it? 

 I’m a single dad, 45 , in very competitive IT, pretty good WFH job for 10 years.  I’ve always been a top performer with glowing reviews.  But I’ve got no fallback if I were to lose my job.

1ge1uty,"Is targeting a ""niche"" or specialised job/position early a good strategy?","Hi, i am 21 years old, currently in my 3rd year of university studying BIT (business information technology) and working part time as an operations officer at a organisation that deals with software. Don't wanna dox myself further.

Right now, I'm at a bit of a crossroads when it comes to my career goals, as well as the next few years of my career. I'm kind of stuck between 3 different options I've been ruminating over for the last year or so:

A) graduate and get this bachelors degree, apply for jobs either in operations or BIT related stuff, climb the ladder (I've done an internship as a ""business analyst"" and hated it, so this wouldn't be ideal.)

B) pursue a masters in finance, which will also give me enough time to start working on my CFA and fully committ to that direction, and then try to land a job at a big finance or consulting firm, then climb the ladder (enjoyed my recent internship at an asset management firm)

C) do a lot of research to find niche jobs/specialisations involving knowledge that few people have/extremely new industries, set my eyes on that role/niche, pursue a relevant masters degree and any necessary certifications, start working in said field/independently consulting once I have the experience

The main reason I'm asking this is because I get a lot of conflicting advice regarding this. I've been able to make some amazing connections over the past few months with veeery successful people and I ask for a LOT of advice. When I ask about my direction/goals etc I generally encounter 2 philosophies:

A) if you target a specific job role/corner of an industry you'll wound up disappointed. No one really works in the field they study. Real life work is a fuckfest, just work and do well at work and you'll be okay. Masters is probably a waste of time. You think too much. Enjoy your early 20s then think about work when you're employed.

B) I regret not doing x. I regret not doing y. I regret not pursuing z. It's good that you think things through this much. Find something specific you enjoy and then hammer that and pursue it directly. No matter what that thing is you'll do well and be happier.

Obviously I've received answers somewhere in the middle but this is a good summary. I'd appreciate some input from ANYONE older than me who's been working for a while.

1ge15ge,My manager refuses to reprimand my incompetent coworker,"I know the title sounds a little harsh, but the job I have is super easy and at this point i think it really is incompetence that is causing all these issues. Usually the people who work here are still in college and just trying to make some money for food and stuff. I myself am in college and I can excell at my job while taking 12hrs of class(i work part time and go to school part time), I should also mention that I am in a supervisor role and so is this coworker. We have had countless problems with this coworker for almost a year now. At first we chalked it up to just being new to the role and a slow learner. But now that he has taken up more responsibility without improving on the basic skills to do the job, it has started to impact all the other supervisor's shifts.

If you would like detailed examples of issues we have had with him I can provide those but here is raw list of issues.
-Doesn't put in inventory
-Puts unentered inventory onto shelled inventory
-Doesn't do any tasks
-Rarely delegates tasks
-When he does delegate tasks he over works people
-No communication skills
-when given feedback by a peer lashes out
-when given feedback by a manager blames everything on ""work anxiety""

This brings me to my issue with my manager, love the guy he is a really good guy. But to put it lightly he is extremely soft. We had a similar issue with a coworker (but they were just burnt out rather than incompetent). When he finally had the conversation with him where he had to fire him. He froze up mid-sentence and couldn't finish the process, our GM had to step in and fire the guy.

Me and my coworkers (supervisors and front desk staff) have submitted multiple forms complaining about his lack of work ethic. With our manager occasionally having a ""talk"" with the guy everything is fine for a couple days but thr next week something happens again.

1ge14tn,Should I get HR involved or should I keep my head down,"Hey Reddit,

Start off I am 23f and I have been a manager at this store for about a year.

I’m looking for some advice on how to handle an uncomfortable situation at work. I’ve been with my company for a while and have always enjoyed working here. But lately, I’ve been feeling increasingly devalued by my manager, Tom, he is new, hiring more managers, most of which don't know what theyre doing, and all of them really, just awful to work with and I’m not sure what to do next.

A week ago, Tom asked me to take over the department at another store along with my current store I'm  running.  He initially told me the starting salary would be $70K with no retention bonus, which would mean a $1,000 loss for me each month, but I could handle that as long as I still kept my pay plan, including bonuses from the stores I currently manage.

However, after a meeting yesterday, Tom asked me to come to his office again and explained that I would lose all of my bonuses. This shocked me, as it would result in over a $45K loss for taking on even more work. When I asked him if my performance was lacking or if there was a reason for this, he said something that floored me: “It’s not that you’re not valuable; it’s that you’re overvalued for your market.”

I was honestly hurt. I’ve worked hard to improve retention rates, and my team has ranked among the top in our district. I asked if this was related to my leadership abilities, and his response was even more dismissive. He said, “A lady of your demeanor isn’t quite ready for a full leadership position.” This felt incredibly condescending, especially after all the effort I’ve put into leading my team to success.

On top of that, I’ve had to handle onboarding for new hires without the proper paperwork being completed. Tom basically brought these new employees to my office and told them, “She’ll get you sorted,” even though he had told me days earlier that I needed to be more focused on my team and leading by example. When I tried to raise concerns about giving certain employees high-level access that I didn’t think was safe, Tom snapped back with, “If you can’t do it, I’ll find someone who can. I don’t have time for people to tell me no.”

I’ve taken previous pay cuts without complaining, but now I feel like I’m being disrespected and undervalued, especially after these comments. Should I consider going to HR about this? I don’t want to make things worse, but I’m struggling with how to move forward in this situation.

He also hugs me, which feels very uncomfortable considering he does it out of the blue.

Any advice would be appreciated I'm at my wits end.

1ge0r3z,I messed up and need some advice,"I’m a very non confrontational person, and it is the reason for my mess up. It is my mistake but I need to vent and I could use some advice.

2.5 months ago I took a vacation for 2 weeks but stayed away from my job for a couple weeks more than that. I got a message in the first week but felt too overwhelmed to reply. Same thing the next week etc. Then my boss messaged and called me (no surprise). I gave an excuse why I stayed away but in reality I think I experienced autistic burnout. I am not diagnosed, i’m still waiting for a test, but it is the only explanation. I just don’t want to be perceived or seen anymore. I hardly go outside (only to walk my dog or go to the office once a week). 

I don’t go outside because I have chronic urticaria combined with eczema. I’ve just been gaining weight very slowly over the past 7 years because exercise hurts me. This gets my self confidence and self worth lower overtime, and it always makes me feel the worst i’ve ever felt compared to in the past.

I also experience PMDD symptoms, and have been taking hormones for these past 2.5 months. It’s going a bit better and i’m ready to ask for therapy soon since my mental state is more stable now. This is to work through some SA trauma from 1.5 years ago (and prior to that).

All of this just wants to make me curl up all day and just stay away from everything and everyone, but I still have responsibilities and my job to maintain at the end of the day. I just don’t understand why I can’t pull myself out of this spiral and just get to work and do stuff I see everyone else doing. Everyone has something going on in their life, and my medical issues and mental issues shouldn’t hold me back because I see that’s not the issue for others.

Here is the biggest concern I have. I’ve been doing some work again and now my boss wants to talk to me IRL, I’m honestly terrified. What if I get fired? What if he asks too many questions that I don’t have a good answer for? What if he’s genuinely concerned and it will just make me feel even more guilty for the way I have been acting?

I just don’t know what to do or expect and I’m insanely nervous for this conversation. I just feel like a bad person and a big failure.

1gdzg1r,Help me ,"Hi, 
I want to ask advice on how I should deal with my parents in my situation. 

My parents play a massive role in my life and i hugely respect them and their opinions. my parents have always put a large emphasis on education. I am currently doing a degree because they wanted me to do it, I was never really had any interest in the degree or what I am studying. But my parents thought this was a good career and they pushed me towards it. Because of a lack of interest I am doing not so great in uni. My degree has been pushed back to finish in 2027 - instead of 2026. 

i am more interested in business and finance and want to pursue that - I have started a business online and did 5K in revenue last month. And i see a really good future in this for the future and want to continue this - my parents support this business of mine and see it doing well as well.

However, they do not want me to compromise my education due to this business (they do not know that my education is already compromised due to a lack of interest).  

what should i do? My plan is to make my business so successful and when Im making more money then them, then i tell them. 

i feel so low whenever they talk about their expectations about me regarding the future and education. I feel that i am cheating them and their dreams they have had for me. Ive told them about my passion for business and they do support me and my business - but they always want me to prioritise study before anything - ive never had the guts to tell them and break their dream",bank-roller,1,1.0,0,1730114042,2024-10-28 11:14:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gdzg1r/help_me/,10,2024

1gdystu,I make 150k-200k a year in a job I absolutely HATE…was offered a job for 70k in a really healthy environment…not sure what to do ,"I work a job that I’ve worked for 10 years and I absolutely HATE it but because it pays pretty well…I just kept doing it.

After 10 years, I don’t feel like I’m growing, I’m exhausted, and my managers are controlling. They have slandered my name to other jobs I have applied to just so that they could keep me for them (I’m a top person in sales) I feel stuck.

They pretty much told them I’m crazy and difficult to work with and have a bad attitude. I am none of those things. They made me sound like the worst person yet they want me on their team. I am a hard worker and I show up with a positive attitude 

I know I go to work to provide my livelihood but it’s also hard working for people who have said the absolute worst things about me to others. It feels like it’s 10 years down the drain :/ I won’t get promoted here now and it just feels like a dead end. What a waste :( but the truth is too, I’m tired, exhausted working a job that is constantly about hitting numbers all the time. After 10 years I’m bored of the job, hate the job, hate management, who talks down to me all the time and doesn’t appreciate me (I am number one in the company) and they say things to me like “we don’t need you” 


I know I’m there to get my check and go home and that but working for people who have slandered me….it feels yucky going to work. 

I was offered a job in management at a different company but the job only pays 70k

Sometimes I think, I should take it, I know the people there, it’s a very positive environment and everyone is so sweet. I feel happy when I’m there 


I also feel like, yes it pays less, but this is better for my mental health, and I wouldn’t have to deal with the toxicity of my job and having my managers say hurtful things to me 

The management position that pays 70k, I feel like it would be good to start in that field where people don’t have access to slander me anymore- I know the grass isn’t always greener on the other side, but the people who are offering me the job have known me for years we’ve worked side by side 

I don’t want to be impulsive so I want to think it over, doing the same job for 10 years…it’s repetitive, exhausting, boring, I feel like I’m just not growing


Or do I just suck it up and stick with the better pay? I am married and we are a two income household so maybe 

It is a big pay difference though

The interview was going well, the HR asked me basics questions about myself, the company, etc. then he asked me basics of my coursework, about my past internship at a really great company and to explain certain topics. Then he asked me to write a pseudocode to print a 2's table. Simple right? I was so happy to hear that he asked me such a basic question. I have great coding experience and projectsz this question seemed nothing. I wrote a 4 line pseudocode. He asked me to explain each line, I explained. He cross questioned, i realised I messed up a variable and wrote something else. after this, my brain froze, and he told me to write it again. I did, then he said ""i doubt if you even did an internship at ____ company"". My brain froze more. What was i doing wrong? I was so dizzy. 

Then he told me that the code was right but I wasn't able to explain it and it was a shame.

I couldn't say anything. Then he said ""I've spent the most time interviewing you out of all the candidates"". Idk what to make out of that, and ended the interview with ""it's ok, it's a common mistake, you have a nice profile"".

It shattered me to say atleast. It was a legit HR interview and I didn't know he would ask me to write a pseudocode (it was the most easy one, I messed up, ik, i hate myself for it.)

1gdxx24,No exit interview. What to do?,"Hey guys. I haven’t posted a lot so I am still a little new at this. Please forgive errors. 

I have been with my job for over 10 years. For about 3-4 years I was bugging my boss about advancement, training to prepare for promotions, basically telling him I wasn’t happy where I was and wanted at least a direction for career development beyond the not entry level, but only barely, position I was in.  Every time I brought it up his responses usually started out as “why would you want that? Your territory doesn’t need a level 3 and the knowledge you’d need to get there” or “ you are fine where you are” implying I wouldn’t be able to do the job of the level 3.  To these I tried to give responses of wanting to be more valuable to the company, as only 3 of us on a 12 person team were under 55 I wanted to be able to help out when people retired and space to move up was made. Sooner or later the talk of money and how the inflation from Covid and after was putting a financial squeeze on my family. Additionally this company offers a pension that pays benefits according to your top 3 highest earning years and I wanted to be in a good position to take advantage of that benefit when it came my turn to retire. ( in 30 years, but that means looking to the future now, right?) well he heard that and went off about how it’s not the companies problem if I am having financial difficulties and that I am just trying to get a promotion for the pay. 

After about a year of this we actually got somewhere, so I thought and wrote out an action plan that would take about 6-9 months for me to get trained, trail the senior guys, be trailed by them, take a few classes and by August 2023 I would be ready for that promotion if I did well…. 

As you may have guessed by now that didn’t happen. I send him our email chain a few times a year asking when I can take this class or that or when I can travel to trail this person or that, but he will not respond to me till we are in person and the previous conversations will happen again. “ why do you want that, you don’t need that, you just want the promotion for money, that’s not my problem…” 

These conversations went mostly the same for about 3 years, me explaining that this job wasn’t giving me a lot of opportunity for advancement if he wasn’t going to give me a direction ( the term “dead end” was used at least once) and that I wasn’t asking for a promotion tomorrow, but to train. 

Even I have to admit the resentment was getting to the point my coworkers knew I was downright mad each time we got together. 

Last week I handed in my resignation letter and I haven’t been offered an exit interview nor have I gotten anything beyond a phone call asking if I was going to a competitor, in which case if I was I’d be asked for my computer and cards immediately vs letting me finish out my 3 weeks notice. 

I guess I am asking if it’s worth it to get the exit interview. Who I should talk to and when.   For the record I am a female in an engineer field.

1gdwglp,How to unFck my life,"I’m 24M and live in Slovakia. I graduated from a technical high school with a specialization in electronics, and later completed a university degree in applied informatics and mathematics (Master's).

I speak three languages: Hungarian (native), English (C1 or above), and Slovak (I understand everything that’s said, but struggle with speaking and conjugation). I hold almost all driving licenses: for motorcycles up to small trucks and tractors, including AM (for scooters), A1, A2, B1 (light cars), B (standard cars), C1 (medium trucks), C (heavy trucks), BE (cars with trailers), C1E (medium trucks with trailers), CE (heavy trucks with trailers), and T (tractors).

We have a small family business where I work as a delivery driver and do general tasks (earning €5 per hour).

Recently, my life has taken a pretty bad turn. I started getting involved with worse things like smoking and weed. I’ve also lost €700 in gambling and could feel the addiction and rush from it. If this keeps up I think my life is going to end sooner than later. 

How should I change and avoid ruining my life? ",Barab22,3,1.0,4,1730100943,2024-10-28 07:35:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gdwglp/how_to_unfck_my_life/,10,2024

I liked all courses (except Machines) which I did in my undergrad. CSE and ML courses were fun.

1gdudxn,Quitting my first job as a freshgraduate,"I am a fresh graduate of one year, I graduated out of college last year and got accepted into the company who hired me as an intern when I was in my last semester of college.

I work as an operational staff for a travel company, I found the job is easy to handle, like all jobs, mine has a lot of difficulties but I always found a way to handle them.

Though, the environment is what makes me want to quit. There's a gap between my department and other departments, at a lot of times people from other departments treat me very shitty up to the point I have anxiety every morning I'm about to go to work, the job also has affected both my mental and physical health. I discovered I suffered from GERD and hormonal psoriasis resulted from high level of stress.

I also have witnessed how shitty my other seniors colleagues got treated by our boss, even my own manager have blurted her intention to resign after being treated so poorly.

I am currently in the middle of job-seeking, I understand finding a job is twice harder these days, but I don't want to stall and not quit my job, I want to seek for new opportunities while also quitting my job.

I guess I just need a push to quit my job because I don't think I can handle any of the bullshit that exist in my office anymore.

1gdsp0d,Advice for landing your first professional job with a Masters?,"I am graduating with my master's in neuroscience this December, and have been upskilling to transition into a research data analyst/data analyst role ASAP. I have the long term goal of getting a second masters degree, this time in applied statistics, and have taken 6 statistics classes already for my current masters.

 I have been having a really hard time finding anyone who will bite at my resume, which I assume is due to the high demand for data-science adjacent roles right now, combined with the fact that I am not located in an area with a large demand for my skillset (cannot leave the area for at least a few years due to my spouse's career). 

Does anyone have advice to help a new grad land a remote or unicorn data analyst role? My long term goal is to work in pharma or for the FDA when we can move out of our current area.

1gdsb11,Left my resignation letter (effective immediately) on my nightmare boss’s desk. Do I take her calls tomorrow? ,"I left my resignation letter on my boss’s desk for her to find in the morning when she gets to work and I do not come in for my shift. I did not give two weeks notice for numerous reasons but one of them being, she is awful to me and I don’t think deserves the satisfaction of having time to find a replacement. 

After speaking with many of my co-workers, they believe I have a harassment case to take up with our union. They say I was bullied out of my job and harassed to the point of having to resign, which seems like it might have been my boss’s goal. 

I have gone above my boss to try and rectify these issues, but our administration is more interested in protecting their own asses and justifying every thing their management team does rather than doing what’s right for their employees. 

I plan on calling my union tomorrow and explaining the situation. 

Until then, do I accept the inevitable phone calls from my boss and/or admin? I don’t want these calls to be used against me in any way. I also don’t want to miss an opportunity to potentially rectify things if I ignore their calls (though I’m extremely doubtful this will happen). 

I apologize for being intentionally vague.

1gdoxih,Every career I’m interested in is too competitive to get into,"Hi, I’m about to graduate high school. Naturally, I’ve been trying to figure out which degree I want to pursue in college, and it has been more difficult and disheartening than I would’ve thought. 

For a while now I’ve wanted to become a voice actor, but damn it’s an incredibly competitive landscape that, even if you measure up to, offers a minuscule shot at stability. Okay, that’s disappointingly out the window, how about directing. No? It’s literally the same thing as voice acting? Is there *anything* in the film industry that would be worth the devotion that is college? Apparently not.

So, I pivoted. Author, paleontologist, LIBRARIAN OF ALL THINGS, and everything that I am remotely interested in pursuing is competitive as hell. Look, I can do competitive (I was a pretty good member of a marching band for nearly a decade for crying out loud!), but what I’ve learned from all of my research is that even if you *excel* at any of the careers I’ve listed and more, you’re probably gonna end up with the other 90% and find no success in them. It just isn’t realistic to even attempt becoming one of these.

So, I would like some advice on where to go from here. I have exhausted my potential interests, so any ideas that maybe relate to something I’ve listed that I might like to do, or just a nice, uncompetitive career choice that offers stability, would be greatly appreciated! :)",elbatcarter,0,0.5,0,1730073506,2024-10-27 23:58:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gdoxih/every_career_im_interested_in_is_too_competitive/,10,2024

1gdm2er,"What career change would suit skill set, experience, and work life balance?","
I currently manage a franchise. I manage a sales team and field techs. The business was purchased from an owner who was clearly burnt out. We’ve grown each year in revenue at a significant amount, and we continue to grow. I enjoy the problem solving and creative freedom, but it’s demanding on my time. The plan is to sell in 2.5 years, and at that point I’ll need a new direction to follow. Anything can happen between now and then. I’d like to be prepared for the next opportunity, and what to look for that would suit my skill set. 

Prior to this, I managed my family’s construction company which also did well after I implemented policies and procedures for operations. I covered all admin duties, and whatever I didn’t know how to do I made calls and researched to figure it out. Eventually branched into manufacturing. I had to leave due to divorce. 

I worked in a high school for three years with credit retrieval students. I enjoyed this job the most because of youth outreach aspect. Took the grad rate from high 70s to low 90s. 

I also worked in insurance as a service assistant for a couple agents. I was licensed, high task completion rate, and customer service development. I would not go back to this line of work, but it aided in professional development. 

 The crossroad im at:

I’m not sure I want to continue working with people, or if I want to work independently. I love people, I can have a conversation with anyone, and I love to talk, but it takes my focus off work and puts me behind. I like to complete my tasks and reach goals before deadline. 

I also want flexibility in my schedule. I don’t want to be obligated to a M-F work week 8-5p. I miss hobbies and having time to do the things I want on a personal level. I’ve been so work oriented. 

I have my associates in science with a focus on business math/accounting. 

I’m open to completing a degree if necessary, and ideally that’s what I’d work on in the next two years. ",almost-practical-404,2,1.0,3,1730065334,2024-10-27 21:42:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gdm2er/what_career_change_would_suit_skill_set/,10,2024

1gdk3ro,First Time experiencing being managed out and PIP ; How can I continue to think positively and what steps can I take to not burn any bridges? ,"Been at a company for 3 years and I've been promoted once. Overall, got a new big boss in our department, department is going through a restructuring, I was presented with a growth plan, my growth plan was related to moving into a different department (while I was obtaining my masters), the growth plan did not work due to the other department going through restructuring and no open positions, and now it is being used against me to leave the company. 

I am 25 years old and this has been the most toxic and mentally draining order of events I've been apart of in my short career & life. I am looking for advice as I went from being confident in my work and wearing multiple hats to underestimating my own intelligence & constantly questioning my own perception. 

All my projects have been taken out of my hands and their excuse was so I don't continue my professional relationship with my stakeholders and to start looking elsewhere for a department I would enjoy working in. I've been constantly told that they can tell I am unhappy (which I never really was) and they can tell the work I am doing is not making me happy (FFS its a job, I come in and go home).  They have not let me go, but they are letting me apply elsewhere and are putting me on PIP in January. They've even mentioned that I should take a pay cut else where and have forced me to tell them places I have been interviewing and applying to. 

In reality, that is why they took the projects off my hands, so they can say I am not doing anything ""productive"" to give them a reason for PIP. 

I feel like a complete idiot since I know I did it to myself. I even considered creating the growth plan to reflect growth inside my own department so something like this wouldn't happened. LESSON LEARNED. I've been isolated, humiliated and even yelled at. I don't want to quit because I need to collect a check, but they are making it hard for me to stay due to the toxicity, but I don't want to give them that power by me leaving. I go in, keep my head down and do the task I have to do. 

I've been applying and interviewing constantly but still no job offers. Tough market, but I am keeping a positive mindset and hope to find one soon. 

How can I work on keeping a positive mindset and not burn any bridges? (This is a medium size firm and very well known the area I live & throughout the country).

1gdis4z,"Deciding Between Two Job Offers – which one should I choose?
","Hi everyone,

I'm in a bit of a dilemma between two job offers, and I'd love to get some outside opinions. I have no work experience yet, returning after a long break I took after finishing my studies.

For me, it's important to work in my specialty and field, earn a decent salary, and have opportunities for growth.

Here's what each offer looks like:

First Company

1. They want me specifically for my specialty, reached out within two days after interview, and sent over an offer.
2. It’s a graduate-level role (a little beyond that), and they’ve made it clear they don’t expect too much from me initially. They emphasized that I’ll get support as I need it and that they’re very open to helping me along.
3. The job is office-based with flexible hours—I can come and go as long as I get my work done. No weekends or anything like that.
4. There’s a high workload with multitasking involved. I’d be handling around two or three projects at once.
5. The director mentioned he could help with finding housing through a recommendation he has.
6. There's no onboarding or training and they expect me to dive into tasks from the start with guidance from a more experienced colleague but no formal “acclimation period.”
7. The company is small, with most employees focused in one area. In my field, there’s only one other, more senior employee.
8. Salary is a bit above entry-level.
9. The location is in a very accessible area of the city.

Second Company

1. A good friend recommended me for this job at a small company, but they want me to do a variety of tasks outside my field, including field work so it's both an office and field job.
2. The salary is about the same as in the first offer.
3. The workload is heavy, with a strict 8-hour schedule, but they expect me to stay late and be available on weekends when needed.
4. The office is in a tough-to-reach area on the city’s outskirts.
5. No support for finding accommodation.
6. They don’t offer formal training, so I’d be learning from others along the way.
7. I know some people there, most people are about the same age as me and the team environment is really positive according to my friend.

Do you see any red flags in either offer? And if you were in my position, which one would you go for?",Advanced_Bird7521,2,1.0,1,1730056529,2024-10-27 19:15:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gdis4z/deciding_between_two_job_offers_which_one_should/,10,2024

1gdg7yk,"Has anyone successfully avoided obligatory holiday gift giving (white elephant, etc.)","I am traveling for work to attend an in-person team meeting in December. We have been told there will be a gift exchange game, white elephant, where everyone brings one gift. Since I’m traveling to attend the meeting (and the game), I can’t just “stay home.” If I pretended to be sick, I would probably then need to skip or appear ill for the remainder of the meeting, which seems extreme.

I am trying hard to save/tightly control my money right now and hugely resent that I would ever be asked to spend even $20 of my salary on work related tasks, let alone some meaningless present that I have no idea who will end up with it. I find this completely inappropriate, and obviously am a curmudgeon. My family and I stopped doing Christmas presents a few years ago and instead spend time with each other because of needing to save money and that purchasing many presents gets in the way of enjoyment of the holiday for me. Even if I ended up with my own gift, I totally resent the requirement to spend money on it instead of me spending it the way I want on my personal time.

I wish there were a socially acceptable way to back out of this. More broadly I wish this were widely seen as inappropriate, because it is.

1gdf9xr,What to do when the going is good?,"I've had a long stressful completely absorbing career in advertising for over 18 years. My whole life revolved around work. I loved it, but I would burn out at an agency, move to another agency do the whole thing all over again. Despite being really stressful, I did really like it and at the risk of sounding immodest, I was pretty good it. I had a good reputation and I did well. But I was really really tired of having an all consuming job. 4 years ago i moved to a corporate job. I do some version of what I did in advertising but my role is more managerial and I'm not really involved in truly creative work.  My work life is pretty great now. I have a very good work life balance and it does tip more in favour of my life. The money is good . The work is boring but not terrible , I work with mostly decent people. Given its a corporate where I am  just one of the lakhs of people they employ, I'm not special at work ( like I used to be advertising)  so the threat of retrenchment exists but it's not immediate. 
But every now and then I'm plagued with guilt about not loving what I do for work. I never slack off at work but working here takes 30% of my capabilities. The most tiresome part of this job are the many meetings everyday but honestly those aren't that difficult either because it happens 99% of the time within working hours. It's a hybrid work model so I also get to work largely from home. Is this guilt normal?

I have been working at my current job in healthcare IT for about a year and I really enjoy it.

Although i live the job and the role as i really wanted to be in hr, the company im with right now is not doing well. For the record, their hq is in another province they have a site in the city. In the city location, there's literally only 3 of us working there, me and 2 agents. And now, im having doubts with the company. Although they're only 4 months since operating in the city, they weren't able to retain any agents, they don't have campaigns, and very low salary compared to big bpo companies in the city. Now before that, i was interviewed to be an assistant manager to a newly built korean restaurant with a salary that's just slightly higher. Although it is not hr, i would love to experience the admin and management role of that new job where I believe that i'd gain transferable skills in the futute when i decided to shift into corporate and hr again. 2nd week into my hr job, i received a call that they're offering me the assistant manager role.

But other than that, the reason why i'm torn is that i wanted to leave my current city because of personal and mental health reasons. And as ive said, even if the restau job is different, i'd be gaining a new skill set which would be valuable if i transition back to hr. But then, would i really be able to go back to hr if i do that?

And i stay in my current job, id be having practical hands on experience with hr but the nigh shift isn't for me. And the lack of improvement on the company's current processes in hiring and expanding is showi ng to be a little bit futile.

So any advice if i should take that restau job or stay in hr?",Diligent_Sea_1143,1,1.0,3,1730045392,2024-10-27 16:09:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gdeg5q/shoud_i_stay_with_my_job_or_go_with_the_new_offer/,10,2024
1gdefy9,"Help Your Girlie Out, Career-Leap Advice","I could use some perspective here 🥹. I’m currently an Operations Support Associate, and I genuinely enjoy my role. From the team to the daily tasks, everything’s great. Recently, my boss suggested I go for a lateral move to Product Support Expert (PSE). He believe I’d be a good fit because I’ve been handling complex support tickets and have even created scripts using Playwright. I also understand our company’s product (solar tech) and how our software functions, especially on the calculation side.

The new role is definitely a step up, with more technical responsibilities like advanced troubleshooting now involving codebase compared to surface level approach, working with Software Engineers. It sounds like a solid career move since the PSE role is more specialized, which could offer better long-term security compared to my current position. Not that the roles are shaky just making some points here,

Here’s the catch: my experience with complex support tickets is more surface level. The new role would involve troubleshooting on a codebase level, which I haven’t done before. While I’m comfortable with scripting (using Playwright), I don’t have experience with APIs or reading through code directly. I keep worrying, “What if I fail? What if I go from excelling in my current role to struggling in a more technical one?”

At the same time, my boss is confident in my potential, which is encouraging. So I’m torn—should I go for the more technical role with its challenges and risks, or stick with the role I’m comfortable in?

Any advice from people who’ve made similar transitions or who work in product support would be greatly appreciated!

1gde823,"I have a feeling like I could be up for a big promotion, but others are older and much more experienced…","So I currently work at a bank that I’ve been at for 4.5 years and have aggressively been promoted within the company over my short tenure and I feel like another move could be coming, but I’m not sure as there are others in my role that have much more experience than I (20-30+ years each compared to my 4.5 years) and I’m young… I’m only 29 and others are 40-62 years old.  But here’s a little background:

Started 4.5 years ago as a part time teller while going to college (pursuing my degree in chemistry) as this was just supposed to be a summer job.  Spent about 2 years in that role, then was promoted once I graduated with my chemistry degree to be a head teller and loan officer.  After working in that role for 2 months, I was promoted to a Personal Banking Representative I where I held that role for 2 more months until I was promoted to be a Personal Banking Representative II at an other branch (same bank, different branch).  While I was in that role, I put up MASSIVE production numbers, like unheard of numbers, and was promoted to be the Assistant Manager at another branch.  As an Assistant Manager, I once again excelled and put up massive numbers while getting licensed for investment sales and got crazy production for Annuity sales as well as consumer loan production numbers.

I was an assistant manager and licensed investment banker at that branch for 10 months until I was promoted from within again to be a the Branch Manager of a different branch (same branch I was as the Personal Banking Rep II) after that manager quit.  I still hold that same role as the branch manager and licensed banker for the past 1.5 years.  I, and my team of 1 assistant manager and 4 tellers, are performing phenomenally.  We are number 1 in our market of 11 branches in consumer loan production and we are also the smallest branch.  Additionally, I run the only branch in the market where the Tellers and assistant manager are operating like the company wants… I coach everyone constantly on how to have the “sales” conversations and be a successful producing branch.

My boss (Market Manager) constantly tells me how proud of me she is and that I am her “success story” and she constantly brings my name up to the executive stating that I am essentially a godsend.

My boss, as the market manager, oversees 11 branches and has 11 branch managers who directly report to her. Her job isn’t to actually get production numbers herself, but to run our regional market and make sure each branch is doing their jobs and producing, coaching every branch manager, assistant manager, and teller.  Very high stress job and a lot is on her plate.

Additionally, my market manager is the one who actually hired me on as a part time teller 4 years ago and has helped me move up.  well she just turned 67 and I know retirement has been on her mind for the past couple years, but no one who’s when she will retire because she loves her job and the competition aspect of it.

well last week when I was talking to her on the phone, she told me that on a date 2 weeks away, she and her boss, our regional banking executive, are visiting my branch to see me and they are going to take me out to lunch so she told me to think of where I want to go but said to make sure it’s a nice and fancier restaurant.  She said the reason for this visit and lunch. Is because I’m doing so well and mI have my team operating just how the company ideally wants a branch to operate and she told our director of consumer banking that everyone and other branches need to be more like me.  ALSO. My regional banking executive who is also joining us for lunch, is coming from an hour away just for this.

So my thoughts are that I could possibly be up for a promotion to get my bosses market manager position… giving that her bday was 2 weeks ago and she’s now 67.

But I have the least amount of experience than all of the other Branch Managers who would want to apply for that position when she retires.  I am the youngest at 29 and have only been in banking for 4.5 years, consumer lending for 2.5 years, business lender and branch manager for 1.5 years.  Every other manager in my market is between 40 and 62 years old and has 10-30+ years of banking experience.

Sorry for the long novel, but what are your thoughts on this?

TL;DR I have a feeling I could be up for a promotion due to my success in my roles and history of being promoted at an unheard of rate. But I am not sure because I’m the youngest by 10 to 30+ years and everyone else has many more years of experience than I.

1gddaaw,[Advice Needed] How do i decide between STEM and Accounting?,"I'm currently a high school senior and I start applying to some universities and up until recently, I had no idea what I was going to do. For context, I have taken a math class in every semester of high school (i'm in Canada, so that's everything up to calculus 12/30 and I'm taking ap calc this year) and I really like math so far. I've also taken every science because I was pretty sure I was going to go into STEM (bio, lower level comp sci class, chem, physics next semester). However, after realizing that I didn't have good enough motivations for medicine and didn't want to do a very general pure science degree and not have a career path to go into without doing grad school right after, I decided to do actuarial science. I figured it was the best career since i liked math, there's  job security and the pay is pretty good from what i've seen. But over the last two weeks, I've been spiralling because I started looking into other things like Accounting as a slightly less time consuming option with a bit more money and more demand with the general feel of an office job (which i like. I did some admin work as a summer job and I loved it). However, this is really far from my stem roots and I'm worried that I'm only picking it because it's an easy option. I've now recently started to consider engineering (even though I don't know what type of engineering I want to go into) because I feel like I wouldn't be challenged as an accountant/actuary. If I stuck with the math in STEM, I could possibly do data science or data analytics but when I did my low-level computer science class I did not do as well as I did all my other stem classes. I'm not bad at coding, I just wouldn't choose it as a full on career path. (I know these days it would be anecessary skill to have for a lot of careers, so i would be okay doing it but I would try to avoid it as much as possible). I could also pursue the interest i currently have in Chemistry but I don't know what career I would do for that. A motivation for me is the pay as well so I would be willing to work quite a bit if it does end up getting me very comfortable. My option now is to go into engineering and figure it out from there and if I end up, not liking it, I could get a master And become a CPA within a few years or with accounting And minor in math or something else that would help give me an edge to pivot (because I've seen a lot of people say that you can move from fields fairly easily)


TL;DR: High school senior with a strong background in math and science, considering options for university. I love math and STEM but recently ruled out medicine and pure sciences due to unclear career paths. Leaning towards actuarial science for job security and decent pay but also considering accounting for work-life balance and demand, although I’m worried it might be too “easy” or far from STEM. Engineering is appealing for challenge, but I don’t know which field and worry about coding-heavy roles. Open to ideas for math/chemistry-focused careers with solid pay and career growth. Trying to decide between engineering, accounting, actuarial science, maybe data science/analysis with minimal coding. Any suggestions for careers that are similar with good pay, job flexibility and security would be great as well.

1gdbwzu,"My small company supports a larger company, and I'm having to travel... issues with communication between the two... I'm stuck... what should I do?","My company is pretty relaxed, and we support a larger company that I work under. The larger company gives me most of my guidance such as training, hours, location of job, etc, but as for payment and management stuff, I go through my smaller company. My problem so far is that my small company has lax rules and is very casual, but is TERRIBLE at communication. The large company I support wants me to travel, but I cannot get an answer on how to go about getting paid to do so... I'm not sure what to do, this trip is going to cost at least $3,000 without factoring in a rental, gas, and food costs. I'm afraid to start booking things, and come to find out I won't get reimbursed because it wasn't approved, but the trip is fast approaching... rooms are being booked up, flights are filling fast. I need to book SOMETHING if I am to go.



I am being asked to travel to tag along with some experienced coworkers to gain experience, and that I may travel in the future quarterly at the least. They said I don't HAVE to, but the opportunity to travel is there if I want to be gone 100% of the time, and that my coworkers will ""pick up the slack"" if the regulars can't go. So I'm feeling sort of pressured to go. I agree that it's a great training opportunity. I am eager to learn. Should I just hold up on booking everything until I get the OK from my actual company?

  
Also looking for any advice on a company like mine. I like that they're so lax. They encourage PTO, the CEO is fantastic and really cares. My management team (when I can catch them) are really awesome. But that's the thing - everyone is hard to get a hold of. Even in person where I know their desks, they're always gone. I'm new here so I'm a bit lost in the sauce. I got lost in the building my first day because nobody was there to greet me. Someone from the ""big"" company found me and had to show me around/where to actually go.

1gdb2f5,How real is agesim? How do I get recruiters/ hiring managers to see past my age?,"I'm in the NY in the US looking for remote work. I'd love opinions from HR professionals on how much ageism is factoring in to hiring decisions.

I'm 55 and need to return to the stability and security of an in-house role after being self-employed from 2009-present. 

From 2009-2013, I was recovering from cancer and couldn’t work full-time. So I was a freelance journalist and published 100+ articles. I also launched a successful blog.

In 2014, I incorporated and did well, but covid devastated my biz because my clients were doctors (offices closed) and restaurants. 

I sometimes think companies are interviewing me to say they've interviewed older candidates, but with no real intention to hire me because I've been on so many final round(s), but haven't gotten an offer. 

Though I have 25 years of experience, I'm applying at the manager/director level. I don't want the responsibility of an executive role because I'm a caretaker.

**How real is ageism in hiring? Are your companies hiring mid-level career professionals in their 50s?**

**Or is there a real bias against older candidates competing with younger ones for the same roles?**

I'm so frustrated by what I perceive to be ageism that I tacked it head-first in the cover letter I wrote for this role, which is below.

I've got great experience, qualifications, certifications, references, etc....

**I'd be so grateful for advice on how to get a job I'm more than qualified for if the hiring manager or company is already biased against me due to my age?**

**Should I be tackling it directly like I do in the cover letter below? Or should I not mention it at all?**

My resume only goes back to 2001, but that means I had to cut out some of my best experiences at Fortune 500 companies.

My age is evident when I show up on the Zoom, so what can I do? I look good for my age, but you know what?

I'm proud to be the age that I am and I'm tired of feeling like I have to hide it!!!

Thanks in advance.

1gdakry,Jobs keep ending again & again (b2b saas / tech) ,"My work history has been so chaotic since the last couple of years since I moved to tech.

 I was so happy to get my first tech job in 2021, which 
-Ended in 10 months.
Then 6 months of nothing
Then got another role that lasted just 6 months
Then got nothing for 4 months
Then got 2 freelance roles that lasted 7 and 8 months respectively.

I know it is not unique. Many people are going through the same thing.
But it is just sucks.
Have you found a way to have some stability?

I don't think it is my skillset. I am actually really good at what I do (if I can say so myself). I also continuously upskill & fully updated in the best practices in my field.

I don't want to take on roles that pay less though.

It looks like the only places that won't let you go & easily hire you is where they are paying you peanuts and getting tons in return. Don't want that kind of stability :/

Any advice, rant, experience appreciated. Thanks.

1gdai20,Advice on Saving for a Master’s in the UK with Dual Citizenship and an Italian Engineering Degree?,"Hey everyone,

I recently graduated in Mechanical Engineering from an Italian university (I live in Italy and hold both British and Italian citizenship). I'm considering relocating to the UK, specifically to an area near London, to work for a year. The plan is to save as much as possible by living just outside London (given the high rent in the city) and use these savings toward a Master’s in Computer Science the following year.

I’m looking for advice on whether this is achievable. Is it feasible to save enough within a year to cover both tuition and living costs in London? 

Additionally, any insights into the starting salary I might expect as a British citizen with a Mechanical Engineering bachelor’s from Italy and no prior work experience would be incredibly helpful.
 Thanks in advance!

1gdadgw,[Advice Needed] Graduating in Finance Soon - Which Career Path Should I Choose for Long-Term Growth?,"Hi everyone,I’m reaching out here because I'm in serious need of guidance on choosing a career path in finance, and I would be incredibly grateful for any advice from industry experts, seniors, or anyone who has navigated this journey!

I’ll be graduating soon with a degree in finance and am ready to work hard to build a strong foundation for my career. My primary goals are to enter a field with promising future demand and to see myself in a much better position in the next 5–10 years. I want to make informed choices that will help me achieve these goals.  
**1 - Is pursuing the CFA Level 1 a good choice after my undergraduate degree?** I know it’s a challenging credential but I’m willing to put in the effort if it will help in the long run  
**2-What specific skills should I focus on?** Are there technical skills, certifications, or even soft skills that are essential or will help me stand out?  
**3-Which areas of finance have long-term growth potential?** I’d love to know about any specific fields (like investment banking, asset management, corporate finance, or other areas like from accouting) that might offer stability and opportunities for advancement.

Any personal experiences, insights into industry trends, or advice on how to structure my early career would mean a lot to me. I’m open to hearing all perspectives, and I’m excited to learn from those who have been where I am now!

1gd9bln,Feel like I am stuck and need a change but nothing excites me anymore when it comes to careers,"So as a preface i want to say this will sound very ranty; its not meant to be - i just feel so stuck and need some advice on how to actually get into a role i want to do.

Before covid, I ran my own web design agency, i wasn’t at the top of my game by any means but i was earning enough to survive through word of mouth and was happier and healthier.

since then the market has changed significantly and i feel freelancing doesn’t pay enough or at least the routes to finding customers is so vastly different to what I am used to I am not sure if i can go back to it.

I have a masters degree in business, an undergraduate in media production and combined experience across office roles, my own business and now retail sales.

I made a post recently asking for legal advice, because ultimately I am in a job I like working for a boss I don’t like (because he breaks the law)

Ultimately I need to get into a role where my time and knowledge is valued, the only thing that looks like it will be worth my energy or time currently is sales; basically I have stopped caring about building a “career” because every time i tried something in the industry changes and I cant keep up, its too stressful and i never had good work life balance since the day i started working.

I have lots of transferable skills, lots of things i know I am good at, but selling myself? i struggle. I suck at writing cover letters and my cv is mediocre at best in my opinion (i would question all the experience and then the fact i ended up in retail slavery)

I tried working with some career coaches but honestly i just dont have the funds to be paying someone £100 a session to help me get out of this situation. I need help to get to where I know i can be, not just in a stuck position for yet another year. its affecting my mental health, my physical health, my ability to keep relationships…all i need is something that allows me to have the time to invest in myself again to go back and up my game in web design or build other businesses i have ideas for. I currently work 52.5 hours a week, not including the 2 hours a day i spend getting to and from work each day, 5 days a week, sometimes 6 just to make ends meet.

I know im capable but i just feel like something on my CV or something on my linkedin profile just isn’t working for me; and I need to fix that. I always excel at any role i take; my problem is i get bored very quickly when people disrespect me; a lot of people would say “maybe your the problem” but being paid significantly lower than minimum wage whilst basically running a store as a manager and making enough income for my boss that he bought a new phone, car and macbook PLUS went on a holiday feels pretty disrespectful to me when I ask for a pay rise in line with inflation so i can actually survive.

where do i go from here? i cant afford to build my own portfolio website at the moment, im both time and money poor…so it just feels like im stuck",igotnolifelemons,1,1.0,0,1730030245,2024-10-27 11:57:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gd9bln/feel_like_i_am_stuck_and_need_a_change_but/,10,2024

At the moment I hate nursing, but I’m pushing through it. I started in the hospital and moved to GP nursing and just hate the abuse, hate the work, hate it all. 

When I was a teen deciding what career to study, I had no idea and kept getting told I needed to go to university and I needed to do a career that makes money not just a fun career, so I rushed into nursing and I absolutely regret it. 

I absolutely love animals. I love the outdoors. I have always wanted to be a zookeeper or work closely with animals or as a parks ranger etc. 

I am contemplating going back to uni to study a bachelor of zoology and animal sciences. However, is it worth it? What jobs could I pursue? What jobs are on offer that pay ok within something along the description I’m looking for?

I am a 28M Data/Business Intelligence Analyst in the healthcare domain. I started my career as a Big4 consultant in the same domain that allowed me to work with huge clients and pick up necessary technical and soft skills much early on. This allowed me to switch jobs within the industry and get promotions quite early on. 

I have hit a dead-end with my current role and been looking for a switch. I am currently having 2 offers and need your advice in what is a better choice for someone who is still early on in the career ladder. 

1. With the largest Healthcare Company of the region (who is also a competitor to my current org). This role will no longer be technical but more business oriented. This means I have to lean more on my soft skills and acquire new business related skills. I will typically be working with C suits and executives advising on data strategy and leveraging data to create business proposals/POCs. The role is in a metro city does not have any hybrid working benefits. I will be looking at a longer commute and higher living expenses in general. I will also have to move to the new city. 

2. Move to a different team within my org reporting directly to the Chief Data Officer (who knows me personally and who I have an established working relationship with). The company is not as mature and established yet and I would be working closely with the CDO to establish the data systems so this is more technical and aligned with my current skills. It is a hybrid working model in the same city as I currently am. The commute is barely 15 mins from home. The cost of living is less compared to a metro city and it’s quite peaceful living in this city. 

Both the roles offer the exact same salary and similar title along with other benefits. 

Please help me seeing any long term benefits in choosing to move to a new city and starting a more challenging new role with a much bigger org over a more comfortable role in my current org.

1gd56fa,How can I approach this?,"Hi all,

I started a part-time unpaid internship in April with a small nonprofit organization. It has been rather informal in that the role was essentially created for me and we have not discussed an end date. It was an alignment with my major and personal interests, but I have since pivoted into a different career path. After graduating, I have been working part time in my desired field, and I don’t make enough to support myself. I can’t really afford to dedicate a lot of my time to unpaid work, and I have found I really do not enjoy the work I have to do.

In the time I have been doing this role I have:
-Redesigned their website.
-Created, grew, and maintained a social media presence including creating visuals and writing copy. 
-Almost finished creating a two minute long animated (infographic style) video explaining what we do.

Initially I was told once we got everything up and running it would be fairly independent, but the only thing I can do without approval is like posts on social media. I feel like it would be easier for my boss to just do what I am doing now, since they have a very specific vision that usually can’t be changed. I am dreading all of the complicated editing I have to do tonight and tomorrow before my Monday meeting.

1gd43f4,Seeking advice for high-earning career paths,"
Hi everyone,

I’m seeking some advice on which career paths would be the most financially rewarding given my educational background. I have a BA in Psychology, a BA in Political Science, and an MA in Communication (graduating this spring), all from a fairly decent midwestern university. 

Initially, I thought I wanted to pursue a career in academia. However, with little passion for the field, very low income while in school (4 more years), and a highly competitive job market, I’ve decided to leave academia upon graduation this spring. 

The problem is: I have no idea what do to next. I’ve never really applied for a “real” job, and I don’t know what I’m qualified for. More than anything, however, I don’t know which jobs I could make the most money, given my qualifications. 

Which is why I decided to post this here: I’d love to hear your thoughts on which industries or roles could offer the best earning potential with my credentials. Any insights on salary growth, career stability, or high-demand fields would be greatly appreciated! My main goal is to find a career path that is financially fruitful and will make me at least somewhat happy. 

Thanks in advance for your advice!

1gd3jml,"I need advice here, will you please help?","I'm currently studying my diploma in web development and I've recently realised over the past couple of months that I truly hate it, not a dislike, not from boredom for the most part, but just knowing that I have to do the most tedious and utterly mind numbing crap that really seems harder than it needs to be(I'm fine with things being difficult when they have to be, but my teachers just keep going on and on about how powerful it is to do everything bespoke from very scratch and how important it is to know a million different stacks amalgamated from 4+ disgustingly documented libraries/frameworks/guidelines and how the web development space is always evolving so quickly so you always need to keep learning the newest and most popular frameworks which always change heavily at a rapid pace and blah blah I mean fucking hell how many types of navigation bars, buttons, footers, cards, carousels, etc, etc do we need? Why does CSS need to be so fucking finicky and full of ridiculous minutia and terminologies and lack so many abstractions or built in preprocessing by now? Why do we need so many templating libraries/frameworks? Why is everything so God damned inconsistent and decoupled with a difficulty to bridge? I just sit here seething as you can probably tell.)

I want to get into game development, not because I think it will have any less difficulties, not because I think I'll be successful, not because I think it will amount to anything, and not because I think it will be less tedious in areas, but simply because I don't think I can honestly handle continuing to do web development, and I know that game development will be something I can gain some enjoyment from; I love programming, I love making and altering systems, I love the idea of making world's and stories and experiences, I know that some parts of game development are a bit tedious and boring but at least I would be emotionally and mentally incentivised to abstract those processes so I can get back to the fun part quicker.

My problem now is that I have to choose between a safe option that I legitimately hate, that has far better prospects as far as employment and self employment go, a job that will never go out of style, but will as far as I can see always stay this weird inconsistent, verbose, and unnecessarily difficult space that will always require constant reeducation based off of thorough research/analysis of internal mechanisms and connections due to bad documentation and a general lack of resources for anything that doesn't have thousands of stars on GitHub or whatever, or to do something that's practically a stupid gamble that most likely won't amount to very much because at least I won't be miserable and legitimately be disgusted every time I open my ide. Just pretty much on a whim and a hope that at least this won't make me want to procrastinate to death.

I honestly don't have much to lose here, I won't be getting the certificate due to my pulling out of the subject that has the core facilitate and maintain a team unit as well as other related units due to my inability to work with others in a decent fashion due to my borderline personality disorder making me very volatile as well as some other mental health crap, and I get welfare in my country so even if my games/assets don't sell in a desirable time frame or ever then I still have money to survive off of, I'm just considering finishing the cert in order to get the units I need on my unique student identifier as a back up for employment just in case of failure with my self employment plans, as well as if I ever want to finish that subject I can get the finished units carried over, and to finish the course simply for the education aspect irregardless of formal success, but as I stated, I legitimately hate what I'm doing and would rather be a failed toy maker that had a bearable work life.

I don't know whether to play it safe and with disdain, or to go to the track and gamble on a roughy knowing I'll most likely lose out. Any advice would be good.

I have 3 assessments due in 2 weeks without an extension, 2 are full stack applications 1 being estore the other being with a bespoke graphql API, the other assessment being questions and answers, I can Jerry rig successes for the full stack apps that meet rubric and are not very flash within a month from the ground up, using all of the resources I have so far and merging directories and then heavily editing I can get basic rubric done within 2.5 to 3 weeks, give or take.

Should I ask for an extension and just finish this disdainful course and just take the hit of a career that disgusts me, or should I just gamble because at least that's decent if not too respectable or responsible?

1gd3hea,Medically retired from the Army and lost as hell,"Trying to end a vicious cycle 

I'm only 29 and trying to figure out what my next steps are in life. My bills are paid, though there's not much money left over each money afterwards. I'm not trying to be the next Elon but I'd like to be fairly comfortable. I have guaranteed income for the rest of my life.

I am plagued with debilitating back problems and mental health issues (MDD & GAD). I also have a habit of putting everyone else's expectations of me ahead of my own personal wishes. 

I have the option to go to college (which I'm currently doing and hating) totally paid for 100%. I also have the option of going to a trade school and having that totally paid for. As I stated before, my bills are completely covered. 

I HATE COLLEGE. 

I hate the professors. I hate the collective IQ of my classmates. The politics, the division, the Gen Z lingo, I hate it all. 

If I had it my way, I'd go back to the Army but that's unfortunately not on the table. 

I am, at minimum, intrigued with medicine though I hate the for-profit nature of the US Healthcare system and how politicized it has become. 

I am hugely passionate about music. I've been playing music since 2006. Guitar has been my primary instrument since 2009. I've been recording since 2011, though, I've been limited in my abilities due to poor acoustics at home.

I have the option to pursue a Bachelors in either Exercise Science or Biology before continuing onto Physical Therapy school. This became an idea because I am intrigued by the musculoskeletal system and my MIL and a few of my wife's family's friends are all physical therapists. The ""but"" is that my son will be born next Spring during mid-terms. I also don't want to miss out on milestones because I'm busy studying just to give me something to do. It'll take 6 years to become a Physical Therapist and the course load is intense.

On the other hand...

I also have the option to pursue audio engineering. I am hugely passionate about recording and mixing. I record quite literally daily and have for most of the last 13 years. I would love to learn more so I can improve my mixes and then use that skill to mix local bands in the area and be able to give back to the music scene that has saved me in more ways than one. 

I'm torn because I know what's expected of me by my family, who admittedly I have limited contact with. I also have been battling imposter syndrome when it comes to pursuing music. My peers always applaud my skills and talent but I don't feel like I'm anywhere near good enough to hold a candle to the pros (though I must admit, I'm not horrible.) I also have to consider child care, though, that shouldn't be too much of an issue. We have started looking into daycare and will have my son on a wait list in 2 weeks.

Any advice is greatly appreciated because I really need to figure this out for my own sanity. Again, money is not really a factor. This next ""career"" is more or less just to give me something to do during week days aside from sitting around the house watching gear reviews and playing guitar all day.

I know a month is a short time but i'm sure that this field is not for me and i want to make a career change. I actually felt this way when i was in college but i sticked with it because i thought real life would be different from school and things might get better, but i was so wrong.

For the career switch, i'm interested in web development. I discovered it when i was in college and i like it a lot. It's hard but it didn't make me wanted to drop dead like studying medicine was (and it pays well too). But i'm also scared, I made a mistake for chosing medicine without knowing how hard it was, only thought about the high pay and title, ended up wasting my youth and money, what if the same mistake happen with web dev?

So yesterday I received an offer letter for a company I interviewed for in the past 2 weeks. Everything looks fine except….for this non-compete.

It states that if I were to leave the company then I can’t work for any competitor for 2 years. The company is starting me out as a contractor for at least 90 days and then depending on how we fit together I can be transitioned into being a full-time employee with benefits. As a contractor I get no benefits and I’m a 1099 instead of a W-2. This company and position are also fully remote.

My biggest concern is if it’s worth it. The pay is fairly decent and my position is in zoning/construction/government-type work. I’m wondering if the benefits outweigh the risk. I’ve never worked in this kind of industry before and my background is in data analysis and accounts payable/receivable/accounting.

Thoughts? Advice?

1gcx9p3,How long do you give a new job before you decide it’s not working out?,"I was in my last job for almost 10 years and I honestly thought it would be easier to let go and move on but I’ve been having a hard time adjusting to my new job. The only thing I really like about it is the location. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty disappointed with the way things are going so far, mostly with training. I’m being told I need to drive my own training essentially and it seems really backward from past experiences. In my last job, I started during a transitional period so training was a bit disorganized but my manager took the lead to make sure I had the resources to know what I was doing. There was a good bit of learning on the job as with my new job, but unlike with this job I didn’t feel like I was being hung out on a limb. I’ve been in this new role for close to a month now and miss how accessible and organized our training department had grown and made learning/education post-Covid. I feel like this new company learned nothing from the pandemic and I don’t feel interested in having to claw my way through the learning process when I know it could be so much better. I can’t get my old job back at this point but have written up an email draft to my old manager (who I had a good relationship with and was open/positive about the possibility of me coming back when I left) expressing interest in returning for a new opportunity within their division of the company when one is available. I’m just trying to decide how long to give this new job. I don’t want to be hasty and impatient, but I also feel like maybe my intuition is trying to tell me this change may not be right for me. I felt so sure about it in the beginning but the process is not turning out how I envisioned and I don’t want to waste their, or my, time if my gut truly is telling me it’s not a good fit. In another week, it will have been a full month so I’ve considered waiting until then to decide if I want to send this email to my former manager.

But I’ve found the best way to deal with nervousness in interviews is to understand it and prepare for it. Understanding the psychology behind interview nerves can help individuals better manage their stress and present their best selves. This includes our fear of evaluation, self-doubt and imposter syndrome, the high stakes associated with the job search, and social anxiety. I’ve definitely suffered from the last myself. 



The way I got around it is with preparation, and various coping strategies. This article discusses the psychology around this phenomenon, and some steps to get around it.

The salaries and benefits are comparable for both, so I’m focusing on the actual role, career progression opportunities, and the manager/team I would be working with. Let me know your opinions or other factors I haven’t considered! 

For some background, I am 26F with a bachelors in chemical engineering, working on a masters in industrial and systems engineering. I’m looking for an in-person manufacturing role that focuses on process improvement.

-Company A-
Pros:
- Super flexible working environment
- Small team, friendly people in office
- Shorter commute 
- Opportunity to make a bigger impact on the plant
- Opportunity to chart your own career path
- Would work with multiple types of processes and products 

Cons: 
- Role of process engineer is new to the plant
- Only one other process engineer there who was hired 1 month ago (possible lack of peer review/mentorship)
- Uptight manager with high expectations
- Loosely defined role but still expected to deliver tangible results
- Career growth/progression not clearly defined 
- Rapid organizational change imminent
- Manager expressed that I was giving too long/detailed of answers in interview (I was using STAR method)
- several more intangible red flags over a total of 7.5 hours of interviewing


-Company B-

Pros:
- Large team of engineers as peers 
- More defined engineering role that already exists at the plant 
- More defined career progression through management or technical path
- More mentorship opportunities from senior engineers 
- Approachable boss that was easy to talk to
- Direct supervisor manages only engineers and is familiar with their work
- Appears to be a good culture of giving and receiving feedback

Cons:
- Steeper learning curve of processes and industry jargon
- Would be siloed to working on a single type of process within the larger faculty
- Longer commute 
- Possibly more anonymous in the herd of many engineers
- Working in a clean room environment ~50% of the time could be inconvenient but not a dealbreaker

Hi all,

I’m struggling to decide if I should take the offer from a bigger company (lets called it company B). The role will be more aligned with my background, better leadership track. Everything is good except for worse benefits (vacation, remote work policy, etc).

For reference: current company B is S&P 300, company B is S&P 25 by market cap. On the brand name, the new company is better, more well-known. The position is more interesting and aligned better with my study. My thought is I’ll definitely work more for less benefit, but will also learn more and have a better resume material.

The competitor offered the job to me, but I turned it down.

Now whenever I go to a business development event, the interviewer is there.  He even comes up to me when I'm speaking with someone and will disparage me.

Question: how to respond to someone like this?

So far I have ignored him.

But he's a mediocre employee; I declined the offer because he and his company are mediocre.

Should I:

Say very loudly, to others, ""I turned down an offer to work with him"" and explain why?

Approach his clients (who could be better served by other competitors of mine) and steer them to his competitors?

1gcs46u,Feeling strung along and not sure how to proceed,"Hi all, I (33M) work in data and analytics for a large global organization. I joined this role under someone I looked up to as a mentor and have worked for before, but they’ve become increasingly unavailable. Both my direct manager and this mentor figure have been telling me I’m on track for a promotion—for a year and a half now. Recently, there were organizational changes, and I got a new manager. I was hoping this shift would finally make the promotion happen, but in my first meeting with my new manager, I found out that’s not the case.

A bit about my background: I’m skilled in data science, visualization, and have an intermediate level of data engineering experience. My work mainly focuses on the supply chain, finance, and retail industries. Despite being vastly understaffed, I’ve managed to lead successful projects, continuously earning positive feedback.

To add some context, I was originally informed when I started I be building team of at least 4-5 analysts. Now, almost two years later, I’m still working with just one (and job reqs for the others not even approved to post for yet). Earlier this year, I was brought into a big initiative within our department. I was excited to contribute, especially since I was consulting with senior leaders and even executives, well above my role. But a few months in, I was suddenly cut out of the meetings and lost visibility into the project altogether. I still see some of my ideas being implemented, so I know I was contributing something worthwhile.

It doesn’t feel like a performance issue, as my reviews have been consistently positive and my projects successful, again, despite being significantly understaffed. Yet, they keep piling on responsibilities without any compensation adjustment or additional team members. On top of that, basic resources for my work—like getting a SQL database set up—are blocked by bureaucratic red tape. These delays make the work unnecessarily exhausting.

Honestly, I’m feeling frustrated and burnt out. It feels like this “promotion” talk is just to string me along. I’ve lost a lot of trust in leadership and am torn between sticking it out or looking elsewhere. I genuinely enjoy the work itself, but the lack of support and constant hurdles are making it hard to stay motivated. Financially, it’s tough to risk being without income for too long (I have three kids), so I’m feeling stuck. Looking for advice on how to handle this situation.

TL;DR: Promised a promotion for 1.5 years that hasn’t materialized. Skilled in data science, visualization, and data engineering with a focus on supply chain, finance, and retail.

1gcrh11,How to respond to unjust raises due to favoritism and racism? ,"I started a job at the same time as two other people. We are all equally educated- Person A and myself had far more experience in a relevant field than Person B. Person B meets certain demographics that are rewarded in our workplace, whereas Person A and myself do not (she is an immigrant, I'm multiracial). 

Person B is a corporate brown-noser, and literally lives in between our boss's buttcheeks. They have a bizarre and unhealthy relationship wherein our boss is constantly buying her small gifts and snacks, texting her on a personal level, and covering up for all of her mistakes and doing her work for her or putting her work onto the rest of the team. My boss strongly dislikes me because I have gone to management about this dynamic multiple times and I'm highly aware of it and have actively been trying to stop it. 

Long story short, our salaries are public, and I just found out that Person B got the highest raise of everyone in our office and now makes more than not only Person A and myself, but also more than another colleague (a Mexican woman) who has been working there for 3 years longer than all of us. 

I am angry and feel powerless. I don't plan to stay with this place any longer, but I have to stay until I can find another job. I carry my team- my boss has me do everything- I do so much extra work, I work through lunches, I represent our team to the public. I'm overworked to the point I feel I'm getting stomach ulcers and have to call out sick frequently due to that and in addition to having a chronic illness. Please help me- I need to do something that makes me feel less powerless but that won't get me fired, because I'm at the point of direct confrontation with my boss, and I will probably end up telling her she knows she's wrong for this and she will have to answer to God for it lol.

1gcrgq9,Should I leave the USA & pursue a dream? Or should I stay & get into corporate soul-sucking work?,"\*\*(This is long, but it would mean the world if you all read it)\*\*

I'll give a quick rundown of ""me"" before I explain my crossroads:

I am 21 years old & a senior in college, therefore about to graduate. I major in finance and have applied to about 5-8 internships for this upcoming summer as an equity analyst intern. I have about 5-6 years of trading experience - the first 2-4 years were fairly rough, but I've been picking up on my profitability over the last year or so and am starting to really become consistent at it. My ultimate dream is to become a writer and have that be my sole money-funnel, not as a means to make money, but to write about the things which I am deeply passionate about (the self, zen, finding peace, getting over neuroticism, western conditioning, & stuff related to Douglas Hofstadter & Alan Watts & Krishnamurti). I also have a great camera and am deeply passionate about videography/photography and would also love making videos on peace, travel, happiness in different places, and getting over western conditioning through my eyes as I travel the world. I have also been developing a newfound passion for science and am deeply interested in integrating science & ""spriitualitY"" (however muddied that word has become) into my social identity. I don't need a huge house, a fancy car, and the american dream, but the only thing I desire to do in my life is to inspire others and uplift this world to something more rationally optimistic, to help people see the futility in extremist individualism, and to make an impact as Krishnamurti did (& perhaps to lecture about to self in ivy league schools like Hofstadter, haha). Lastly, my mom is a flight attendant for delta and I am able to fly for 100% free anywhere in the world until I die & her job provides wonderful insurance for the whole family due to her being an employee for over 20 years.

Now, my crossroads:

I am about to graduate college and have been studying to get into the finance industry as an equity analyst over the last 4 years of my life, but the corporate world is starting to disgust me more and more - the social heirarchy, the incentives, the stepping-on-heads, the titles, etc. Because of my ability to travel for totally free, and my competence with solo travel (as I've already traveled all over the world), I am genuinely thinking about taking a few years off after school (& possibly the rest of my life) trying to trade to make money, work on my writing, and develop my photography career, as I've have travel benefits that put me ahead of most people. One of my friends who trades for a living moved to Thailand last year. He lives in a skyrise condo with INSANE amenities (pool, workout facility, coffeeshop, etc.), yet his rent is only $300 USD a month .\_.  I'm not saying that I want to live like a king, but that there are many places where living is incredibly cheap & I could comfortably afford it while working on my crreative career. To me, if I am able to consistently make my month's rent in a matter of a 1-3 days from trading, then why would I not take the risk of trying to develop my writing & photography career overseas? 

Should I take this risk? I can fly for totally free, I can knowingly live comfortably with the money I make online, I can also travel all over & do it cheaply while i'm in hostels, I can develop my writing and make WONDERFUL content from my travels, and I can really set myself up for developing the life I want to have - to live comfortably in beautiful places, to make an impact, to learn new things, and to cultivate my creative aptitude.

1gcrgcy,"""Message to Hiring Manager"" Confusion on Internship Application","Hello! I am currently applying for internships and on the current application (won't name the company), there is one section titled ""Message to Hiring Manager: Let the company know about your interest working there"" and a question later that asks to describe ""why you are interested in and passionate about the role and area of AECOM you have applied to. Tell us about your passion, skills, knowledge, and work experience that make you suitable for the position."" 

These 2 questions are very similar; I really don't want to repeat myself and waste their time.

I have a cover letter that I'd prepared for the application before starting and reading these questions. I think it would best answer the second question. Should I add stuff (with some definite repetition) to the first question, or just keep it blank?

1gcqrwf,Transitions to new position. Team taking on my work is incompetent.,"My company has been bringing in new brands and expanding operations. I was apart of the latest acquisition. I brought my team and a few others in alignment which was the parent company was looking for (procedures/reporting). It was noticed by the CEO and CFO and they elevated me to their team. I have to transition out of my current role and distribute my responsibilities. 

The transition has been going smoothly except for 1 of my biggest responsibilities. It will be transferred to 3 different teams but 1 of those teams is just awful. They code orders wrong, assign them to wrong jobs, and many other errors. We have documented the issues but their team lead never solves them. Other teams clean up their mess (AP/accounting). I planned out a training course that takes about 1 month and me having over-site for an additional 2.

First 2 teams it’s going great. This last one is a team of 3. Training is to begin Monday for them. Their lead said they could squeeze the training down to a 30 min meeting and they could take it from there. He sent the email at 7pm and I saw it this morning. 

 My 2 options are agree or to fight back. If I do the meeting and cut them loose it will cost the company a lot and cause many issues for the other teams. Or I can fight back and explain why training isn’t so simple. I hate this team and simply want them to fall on their face. But I also don’t want my other co-workers to suffer fixing their issues. 

Has anyone ever been petty and let a team fail to prove a point? That’s what I’m really leaning towards.",Barkleyslakjssrtqwe,1,0.6600000262260437,0,1729965187,2024-10-26 17:53:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gcqrwf/transitions_to_new_position_team_taking_on_my/,10,2024
1gcqnda,Advice on staying focused on working towards a career while having ADHD,"I need a nice job to afford therapy, right now I don't have the money to even think about it. Everything I enjoy doing I could make money on, but it takes extensive time and money to get there (and luck), which I'm ok with, but I'm struggling to stick to it. I keep hopping between Game Dev/Design, Comic Artist, youtuber, painter etc. Mostly creative jobs, but I get to a few months and I completely lose interest. I've always been goal and money driven, so I tried the ""celebrating every small win"" trick, but that only worked for a little bit. Now it feels like the celebrations are part of my task list and aren't as enjoyable, or feel like indulging. I'm also terrified I'll learn these skills and they won't be enough to stand out against college grads, or that I simply won't ever make money and be stuck doing something I hate or jumping between part time jobs. I have no idea what direction to stick to, and my ADHD makes it nearly impossible to stay interested long enough to build a decent portfolio or resume.

1gcq0gx,Am I burnt out or just being selfish?,"2024 has been quite a year! I (22f) became the onsite manager of operations at a theme park, overseeing arcades, lockers, and mobility devices. Since I started, I acted as the manager due to the absence of higher-ups, and this year, I finally received the official title, which felt well earned.
We opened in April, but hiring was challenging; HR prioritized other parks, resulting in about half the staff we needed. Many of those I hired faced issues, leading to several terminations. By Memorial Day, I was without locker staff, and while I almost quit, a substantial raise kept me on. Thoughout the season I never had more than 2 employees on my roster at a time. Leaving me to cover locker for them last month due to my employee quitting, which was exhausting, especially in the heat.
Between ongoing staffing issues and regular call-outs, I had only 16 days off from April to August, compared to 33 10+ hour shifts. I raised my concerns with my regional manager, but any relief was temporary. The last week was particularly tough, as my final employee was checked out and frequently called out.
In September, I started babysitting my 10-month-old niece to help my brother. While I wanted to spend time with her, adjusting to the early mornings has been challenging, leading to moments of exhaustion and doubt about continuing.

1gcpm67,"Transitioning to DA/DS in Healthcare remotely as a non-EU/non-US citizen. A year through the journey, been applying to jobs for 3 months. With current situation happening, now stuck on what to do.","Hello everyone! First of all I’ve been lurking in Reddit for a long time and getting a lot of insights and references from you guys, thanks a bunch for that. Lately I’ve been inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bc83ua/career_paths_at_the_intersection_of_data_science/), and I figured to shoot my shot asking for feedback. It’s gonna be a long one, so buckle up for the ride folks.

**Quick background:** Finished bachelor degree in Biomedical Engineering from Indonesia (GMT +8—non-EU and non-US), self-paced learning on data analysis to deep learning for 5 months in DataQuest, and making my way to create projects relevant to healthcare and business.

At campus the area grew on me to be a passion of mine, and I also made up my mind to create a dream to start a healthcare start-up one day. But I realized that I don’t have enough resources, mainly insights, skills, and money. So I decided to start with data, and overtime I love the idea of driving strategy and business development through data insights in the area. I do want to make it my career trajectory.

My goal at the moment is to get a job abroad as a business/data analyst or data scientist, preferably remote in the EU or US. When exploring the job, I feel like getting there would be way better for career growth. I’ve been applying to 37 jobs by far starting from August (3 months now), with CV and customized cover letter tailored to each one. To this day, 19 rejected either through closed positions or through email.

My concerns on the current situation would be:

1. I’ve tried to dive deep into scraping available jobs out there—from searching at remote and start-up [job boards](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/1acasqx/whats_the_best_cs_job_board_in_your_country/) in EU/US, looking at job boards from [venture capital websites](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/39ltv9/lpt_use_vc_firms_websites_as_job_boards/), looking at companies in healthcare and seeing for jobs on [app.dealroom.co](http://app.dealroom.co) (with campus account), up to finding ‘hidden’ jobs with [advanced search](https://medium.com/ft-remote-job/how-to-find-hidden-remote-jobs-using-google-search-12ebaa2ea8ea) on 30+ patterns in ATS websites (I even make a bookmark folder to check them up once in a while). Now I feel like as time goes by, the amount of jobs are getting limited. I’m still keen to explore more jobs, but I feel like my area is pretty niche so I feel like you may not see it as much as other areas. I have to compete with people across the world who have better proximity and experiences. I also noticed in my country that the healthcare companies are more on the side of healthcare supply distributors, and they’re mainly based in the capital city. There’s not a lot of companies that provide direct help to healthcare stakeholders (patients physicians/providers and other companies, or areas such as digital health, nutrition and wellness, and alike, and RnD companies too as of AI in healthcare) as to companies I saw abroad, which is the place I’d rather go to.

1. I feel grateful to learn at the campus as it’s considered one of the top ones in my country, and it helps a lot in opening me up to a ton of knowledge and experiences. My major is still relatively new (5 years), with most of the successful colleagues either working on different areas (P.S. I read about some post abt BME such as “[jack-of-all-master-of-none](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/11ddf9a/a_minor_rant_about_biomedical_engineering_what_do/)” and [limited options](https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/31xks8/my_experience_with_biomedical_engineering_bmes_i/), and unfortunately I see the same pattern as my colleagues shift their career to other areas) or working on their masters or PhDs for those who’re sticking with the major. With that aside, to keep things short, there was a natural disaster in my hometown when I was in 2nd semester. Things went downhill from there and the tuition process had always been exhausting for my family since. I’m glad and relieved that I finally graduated, however long story short my dad asked me to go home while learning at the city my campus is in. Now I’m in my hometown (3 hours by plane, a rather smaller province). When I look at the condition, it is \*that\* dire and complex. Things went 360°-different financially compared to the last time I was here three years ago, they need a lot of money to pay the debt while keeping the business going, I need to remain here as a support system to keep my family on the cool ground, and my dad can’t even afford to support the living if I’m taking a job in the capital city. 

With all that, the pressures are there, like a ticking bomb not knowing when it would explode. That way I’m feeling a huuuuge amount of urge to help. I do have the privilege, time, and knowledge to create projects and apply worldwide with what I have. I also won’t mind dealing with the timezones, as I’ve been getting used to working on this every single day from 1pm to now 4am, pretty much feasible for EU/US time zones. I do have a ton of dreams to fulfill too—getting into hobbies and interests, and cherishing moments with friends who help me through the journey, as I mostly spent the whole year grinding on my own. But seeing the circumstances, I \*need\* to make sure that my family is okay first, and I need👏 to👏 power👏 through👏. With all things considered, I think that remote jobs abroad as either DA/BA/BI/BS is my best option. It helps me by working from home with feasible time zones, secure me and my family financially, and also opens more paths for growth in healthcare areas. To put things in perspective, the monthly salary of a Data Analyst in the EU or in the US is 5-20 fold compared to here in Indonesia. That could help alleviate their burden \*a lot\*, and I could eventually make my way through better growth and better opportunities in healthcare.

But right now with the concerns above I’m stuck and don’t know what to do. I’m trying to find the bright side of it, like, “Oh they’re not responding yet—maybe I’m on the waiting list or they need time considering it since my location is not in their vicinity,” but I don’t know for sure, that’s why I’m asking here. I do have some ideas to begin with, but I feel like I need more insights so things could run optimally.

1. Learning new tools for adding skills on my sleeves. Not long ago I finished learning fast.ai LLMs through their Jupyter notebooks. I’m intrigued on how I could apply it in healthcare but to this day I have no idea on where to start. When there’s not much I could apply to, I try to learn R since I observed a lot of people in healthcare RnD using it. I’m also thinking of learning other required tools—I saw SalesForce, AWS/Azure, such as Snowflake and Airflow, or domains of healthcare with AI. Do you guys have an idea where I should go?
2. When I make my recent projects, I like the flow of learning as I go, and I would try to make a project utilizing other required tools. Right now I’m thinking in the realms of [Marketing Mix Model](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/uqqx9t/media_mix_modeling_what_variables_should_i_use/) or adjacent areas, or getting into advanced projects such as Signal Processing, Medical Imaging, or NLP. I’m wondering tho on where I should start: Should I learn it comprehensively first, or work on projects when I’m somewhat proficient on the tools?
3. While learning, I do time-boxing to make sure I could go on from one activity to another effectively. I could also try getting back to learning mode. I feel like the pressure is getting the best of me atm. Previously I wouldn’t mind if things start slow, as long as I’ve done something towards progress, I feel okay. Now I need to make sure it feels the same despite the current condition.

For additional resources, here’s a redacted version of my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-vuxt4SaGFVSHddc2UWl_2BRWoRY7vffUBtrXRsXFQ0/edit?usp=sharing), and a sample of recent cover letters I’m feeling proud of—one in [Europe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/112I0LkuIdsXDDxg6sC2IQk1OFgjp5PUXGewLgThv5rY/edit?tab=t.0) and one in [the US](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aSL2ZFts1pHvZKfouFSEkWtjKcZU9Se5nV2RYbrVeD0/edit?tab=t.0). I'm not comfortable to showcase my LinkedIn here atm, but you're more than welcome to reverse engineer by searching my portfolio in case you’d like to check for more as I put all my experiences on LinkedIn. 

At this moment any feedback would be greatly appreciated. I feel like some things that may help would be:

1. Experiences alike on creating more projects while applying or on learning additional tools,
2. Things that could help on realizing the ideas—would it be resources to learn the tools, relevant datasets (preferably in healthcare or business), or opinions on the required tools.
3. Some perspectives on different stakeholders such as executives or recruiting people,

I’ve tried to dive deep into scraping available jobs out there—from searching at remote and start-up job boards in EU/US, looking at job boards from [venture capital websites](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/39ltv9/lpt_use_vc_firms_websites_as_job_boards/), looking at companies in healthcare and seeing for jobs on [app.dealroom.co](http://app.dealroom.co) (with campus account), up to finding ‘hidden’ jobs with [advanced search](https://medium.com/ft-remote-job/how-to-find-hidden-remote-jobs-using-google-search-12ebaa2ea8ea) on 30+ patterns in ATS websites (I even make a bookmark folder to check them up once in a while). Now I feel like as time goes by, the amount of jobs are getting limited. I’m still keen to explore more jobs, but I feel like my area is pretty niche so I feel like you may not see it as much as other areas. I have to compete with people across the world who have better proximity and experiences. I also noticed in my country that the healthcare companies are more on the side of healthcare supply distributors, and they’re mainly based in the capital city. There’s not a lot of companies that provide direct help to healthcare stakeholders (patients, physicians/providers, and alike, and RnD companies too) as to companies I saw abroad, which is the place I’d rather go to.

1. I feel grateful to learn at the campus as it’s considered one of the top ones in my country, and it helps a lot in opening me up to a ton of knowledge and experiences. My major is still relatively new (5 years), with most of the successful colleagues either working on different areas (P.S. I read about some post abt BME such as “[jack-of-all-master-of-none](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/11ddf9a/a_minor_rant_about_biomedical_engineering_what_do/)” and [limited options](https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/31xks8/my_experience_with_biomedical_engineering_bmes_i/), and unfortunately I see the same pattern as my colleagues shift their career to other areas) or working on their masters or PhDs for those who’re sticking with the major. With that aside, to keep things short, there was a natural disaster in my hometown when I was in 2nd semester. Things went downhill from there and the tuition process had always been exhausting for my family since. I’m glad and relieved that I finally graduated, however long story short my dad asked me to go home while learning at the city my campus is in. Now I’m in my hometown (3 hours by plane, a rather smaller province). When I look at the condition, it is \*that\* dire and complex. Things went 360°-different financially compared to the last time I was here three years ago, they need a lot of money to pay the debt while keeping the business going, I need to remain here as a support system to keep my family on the cool ground, and my dad can’t even afford to support the living if I’m taking a job in the capital city. 

With all that, the pressures are there, like a ticking bomb not knowing when it would explode. That way I’m feeling a huuuuge amount of urge to help. I do have the privilege, time, and knowledge to create projects and apply worldwide with what I have. I also won’t mind dealing with the timezones, as I’ve been getting used to working on this every single day from 1pm to now 4am, pretty much feasible for EU/US time zones. I do have a ton of dreams to fulfill too—getting into hobbies and interests, and cherishing moments with friends who help me through the journey, as I mostly spent the whole year grinding on my own. But seeing the circumstances, I \*need\* to make sure that my family is okay first, and I need👏 to👏 power👏 through👏. With all things considered, I think that remote jobs abroad as either DA/BA/BI/BS is my best option. It helps me by working from home with feasible time zones, secure me and my family financially, and also opens more paths for growth in healthcare areas. To put things in perspective, the monthly salary of a Data Analyst in the EU or in the US is 5-20 fold compared to here in Indonesia. That could help alleviate their burden \*a lot\*, and I could eventually make my way through better growth and better opportunities in healthcare.

But right now with the concerns above I’m stuck and don’t know what to do. I’m trying to find the bright side of it, like, “Oh they’re not responding yet—maybe I’m on the waiting list or they need time considering it since my location is not in their vicinity,” but I don’t know for sure, that’s why I’m asking here. I do have some ideas to begin with, but I 

1. Learning new tools for adding skills on my sleeves. Not long ago I finished learning [fast.ai](http://fast.ai) LLMs through their Jupyter notebooks. I’m intrigued on how I could apply it in healthcare but to this day I have no idea on where to start. When there’s not much I could apply to, I try to learn R since I observed a lot of people in healthcare RnD using it. I’m also thinking of learning other required tools—I saw SalesForce, AWS/Azure, such as Snowflake and Airflow, or domains of healthcare with AI. Do you guys have an idea where I should go?
2. When I make my recent projects, I like the flow of learning as I go, and I would try to make a project utilizing other required tools. Right now I’m thinking in the realms of [Marketing Mix Model](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/uqqx9t/media_mix_modeling_what_variables_should_i_use/) or adjacent areas, or getting into advanced projects such as Signal Processing, Medical Imaging, or NLP. I’m wondering tho on where I should start: Should I learn it comprehensively first, or work on projects when I’m somewhat proficient on the tools?
3. While learning, I do time-boxing to make sure I could go on from one activity to another effectively. I could also try getting back to learning mode. I feel like the pressure is getting the best of me atm. Previously I wouldn’t mind if things start slow, as long as I’ve done something towards progress, I feel okay. But I need to make sure it feels the same despite the current condition.

For additional resources, here’s a redacted version of my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-vuxt4SaGFVSHddc2UWl_2BRWoRY7vffUBtrXRsXFQ0/edit?usp=sharing), and a sample of recent cover letters I’m feeling proud of—one in [Europe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/112I0LkuIdsXDDxg6sC2IQk1OFgjp5PUXGewLgThv5rY/edit?tab=t.0) and one in [the US](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aSL2ZFts1pHvZKfouFSEkWtjKcZU9Se5nV2RYbrVeD0/edit?tab=t.0). I'm not comfortable to showcase my LinkedIn here atm, but you're more than welcome to reverse engineer by searching my portfolio in case you’d like to check for more as I put all my experiences on LinkedIn. 

At this moment any feedback would be greatly appreciated. I feel like some things that may help would be:

1. Experiences alike on creating more projects while applying or on learning additional tools,
2. Things that could help on realizing the ideas—would it be resources to learn the tools, relevant datasets (preferably in healthcare or business), or opinions on the required tools.
3. Some perspectives on different stakeholders such as executives or recruiting people, 

Thanks and hope you guys have a good day! 🌟",lambentblue,1,1.0,0,1729961668,2024-10-26 16:54:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gcphn7/transitioning_to_dads_in_healthcare_remotely_as/,10,2024

1gcojh5,How do I know when it’s time to apologize to a client/individual? How do I avoid having a “smart mouth”?,"So this is one of my many throwaways as a heads up:

TLDR; I was cursed at by a resident in the building I work in and I told him to pay his rent. I know it wasn't a necessary response so how do I avoid this in the future?

I (29m) work in leasing for a relatively small company in Minnesota. A few days ago a resident (46m) called complaining about his internet not working and he's been having issues reaching out to the internet service providers. Apparently he's been unable to connect his computer to the internet despite the fact he was originally able to. 

So normal stuff.

Issue became when he started cursing. At first it was a small f word which I kinda just let slide because he was frustrated. The second time he said ""I pay my F'ing rent! I shouldn't need to deal with this BS"". My response, which was admittedly unnecessary, was ""Are you going to pay this month yet?"" because he's 2 months behind and never pays on time.

This set him off.

He said I was being disrespectful and continued to curse from that point forward, getting mad because I called him sir instead of his name, and throwing a tantrum so I hanged up on him. 

Apparently he emailed the higher ups with his version of the situation (leaving out he was cursing and why I said what I said). My manager asked for the full story, chuckled a bit then said I've just gotta watch my mouth.

I know at some point I'll see him in the building again and tbh I'd love to embarrass him because he's the type of being it up again and demand an apology. With that said I'll give a half hearted apology if I'm asked to by higher ups and I won't go out of my way to antagonize him.

How can I avoid this situation in the future?",NorthOk5990,1,1.0,0,1729959059,2024-10-26 16:10:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gcojh5/how_do_i_know_when_its_time_to_apologize_to_a/,10,2024
1gco4ap,I’m mentally fried and emotionally drained. 15+ months of unemployment. Where to go from here?,"Disclaimer: I’m reposting this because I want to clarify that I’m asking for help with a career change.

A bit of context: I’m a 28-year-old woman from New York with a BA in English and a MAT in English Teaching (completed in 2021). I incorrectly assumed that teaching would be a practical and safe career choice for me, but after graduation, I faced constant rejection and was told I should consider going back to school for a master’s in TESOL or special education to be a competitive candidate. Living in a highly competitive area, I took up substitute teaching in hopes of getting my foot in the door. After nearly two years without pay increases or job offers, I decided to leave, which I now regret because I didn’t have a job lined up.

From early 2022 to spring 2023, I was jobless, living with my parents (still am), and applying to well over 5,000 jobs. I finally got a call back to work as a talent sourcer for an agency, where I excelled and closed more vacancies than the senior recruiters. However, I was let go due to animosity from others regarding my performance. Since the end of last summer, I’ve been unemployed again, applying to countless jobs without success.

I’ve exhausted all referrals and connections. I’ve messaged dozens of hiring managers, job posters, and recruiters, and changed my resume an embarrassing number of times. Despite all this effort, I’ve gotten nowhere and feel incredibly frustrated. I thought by now I should have been a year into my new job.

I’ve considered going back to teaching in areas with shortages, but I’m concerned about financial stability. I could tolerate low teaching salaries if I could live with my parents, but I don’t want to struggle on my own. After my experiences, I’m not happy with teaching anymore.

I’ve thought about going back to school, but I don’t want to take out loans, and I don’t qualify for financial aid or scholarships since I already have degrees. I feel low enough as it is, and I can’t imagine how I’d feel if I faced another setback.

This is both a rant and a request for help. I’m open to constructive feedback, advice, or guidance on how to transition into a new career. I need a fresh direction and a way to get myself out of this situation.",observationcorner,0,0.5,1,1729957943,2024-10-26 15:52:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gco4ap/im_mentally_fried_and_emotionally_drained_15/,10,2024

1gcnlz4,Should I stay or should I move on?,"Hey all. I’ve been struggling with this decision for a while now and I’m looking for some help on it.

I’m pretty much deciding whether or not I should stay at my current company or if I should move on to something else. Some background, I’ve been working at this company for about four years now. I currently make 106K and work remote. The benefits are OK, no bonus structure. 

The big things I really don’t like about My Work is the social situation. It’s extremely clicky and if you’re not really in the click, you’re not not gonna get put on the good projects or get put in a position to grow. I currently feel I’m not gonna get fired or anything like that because I do good work but I don’t feel like I’m gonna be moving up or growing a lot because I’m not in the click. 

I have another option in front of me which is to work for a bigger company where I actually do know some of the people there as I’ve worked with them before. This job would definitely be higher pay and in a better culture for sure. The downsides are their new and they don’t have a lot of work yet so it’s not quite stable. It’s a little more risky. I do know that this job would give me a lot more exposure to things I haven’t worked before for sure. The people are also very gossipy and it’s just kind of a toxic place all around. Very disorganized, very gossipy.

The way I see it is it’s kind of high risk, high growth versus low risk, low growth.

I’m 31 years old with no kids, and my friends have been telling me to take the jump. If they think I could learn more and and be with people I like working with. I’m just very, not confident in the managers ability to make the business flourish at the new company because I’ve seen them fail before. I’m not completely sure why they failed. I just know it did fail. 

What do you guys think?

Today I even had an interview where they asked ""Did you use GPT to generate the mail?"". I said ""No."" since I used only GPT to form the body of email. The contents were completely mine. So feeling down, I ran my mail through gpt zero, it showed 100% AI generated and that broke me down. Though, I completely wrote it myself and only used body framing the mail as in what contents should go where. This was my first time in an academia based interview as well. Now, I'm completely writing only manual mails in fear of this. I probably won't hear back from them after this cause I sounded very much like a liar.

1gckfag,Work coverage while coworker on maternity leave,"I need some advice about a tough situation I'm in at work. I've worked at this company for over 10 years, and honestly probably should have left years ago due to the lack of recognition and obvious favoritism by management on my team. That is my own fault and I am looking for other jobs at this point with no real luck. 

I have literally watched almost every coworker of mine be promoted, and now two coworkers will be on maternity leave. This leaves 2 people to do the job of 4 people for the next two and a half months; there is no temp help brought in. And nothing has really been said about this shitty situation other than we should communicate. I have more business knowledge and experience than the third coworker (they also show no initiative half the time), so I honestly am feeling like all of the work is just going to fall on me and I'm kind of freaking out about the stress and workload I am somehow expected to support. 

I know this is more of a conversation I need to have with my manager about their expectations of me during this time, but I am also trying to prove myself for a more senior role...so I don't want to sound like I'm overwhelmed even when I probably am. I tend to turn myself into a pretzel trying to support what I can, and then get stressed out when I have so much on my plate. I know that sounds silly it is what it is. All I know is when 2 people are out on my team, if the volume is high, it is literally unmanageable. I am fearing the workplace stress is going to push me into a bad place where I'll either have to go on medical leave or just quit altogether. I know that sounds drastic and maybe I should reach out to HR too about this situation but I also don't want to get a target put on my back.

1gch3cu,Need help and guidance,"Hey everyone, I'm feeling really lost and could use some advice on my career path. The more I research, the more confused I get. I’m feeling quite lost I want to find a direction that leads to a better future with a well-paying job and a good work-life balance—preferably one that allows me to work from home.

A bit about me:

I have a degree in English Studies.
I have some Marketing and Business experience from running a small business for 4 years.
I’m currently learning basic programming through a free course. I have the option to do a short internship in 7 months, but I’m unsure if it’s worth it since I lack a computer science background. I worry about not being good at programming.
My goal is to become a Project or Product Manager, and I'm considering starting in Marketing and working my way up.

I've been applying for Marketing internships and entry-level jobs for two months with personalized resumes and cover letters, but I haven’t landed any interviews yet. It’s disheartening, and I'm starting to wonder if I’ll ever find a job.

Right now, I can focus on studying for less than a year and am considering working abroad in a higher-paying country over the summer. I could also pursue a master’s degree next September, but I’m not sure what to study.

I’m also interested in woodworking and found a course on treating wood. I think I could potentially make money restoring and reselling furniture, but that would likely be a side income.

Any advice on what I should study or apply for would be greatly appreciated!",Future_Ad7565,1,1.0,0,1729934190,2024-10-26 09:16:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gch3cu/need_help_and_guidance/,10,2024
1gch05k,"Feeling Stuck in a Test Engineer Role, but Want to Be a Control Engineer – Seeking Advice","Hey everyone,



I recently graduated with a degree in Control and Automation Engineering, and my career goal has always been to work as a Control Engineer. Unfortunately, my current job title is “Test Engineer,” and it’s been really tough for me to feel satisfied or motivated in this role.



While I respect the importance of testing in engineering, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m doing someone else’s job rather than working toward what I want for myself. The tasks don’t feel challenging, and they don’t give me the same sense of purpose or development I think I would have if I were in a more control-focused position. Instead, I feel like my skills are stagnating, and I’m worried that spending more time in this role will limit my chances of transitioning into a Control Engineer role.



Adding to the challenge is the economic crisis that’s affecting the EU and MENA regions. Many companies are freezing hiring or reducing workforce, making it even harder to find roles that align with my career goals. I’m trying to stay motivated, but this situation makes the path forward feel even more uncertain.



I’d really appreciate any advice or personal experiences you might have about making this kind of transition. For example:

* Has anyone else been in a similar situation, and if so, how did you make the shift?
* Is it worth sticking it out in this role, or would it be better to start actively looking for a new job that aligns more closely with my goals?



Thanks for any insight you can share – I could really use a bit of direction!",Amiens20,1,1.0,0,1729933783,2024-10-26 09:09:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gch05k/feeling_stuck_in_a_test_engineer_role_but_want_to/,10,2024

I have a current job making about 85k and about 20k in bonuses. The company I work for is top of its industry. About few months ago I started just exploring any opportunities to further my career and make some more money. I recently received an offer for 130k and about 30k in bonus. The company is much smaller and probably has less stability. I plan on talking to my boss after all pre employment stuff goes through. My main concerns are I may ruin my resume because of I have hoped around about every year (better opportunities / more money). Also concerned that going to another company provided less stability and might backfire down the road. On the other hand I’m young and feel like this risks is worth that pay difference. Also, I feel like my current company will counter offer. (Won’t match but will probably come up 10-20k). Should I accept a counter if it’s pretty good.

1gcfv7k,They fired my collegue and tried to make him pay for the car,"So long story short, they fired my junior collegue a couple of weeks ago, because he did not grow fast enough into his job, still made lots of mistakes etc... I don't necessarily have a problem with that, an employer has the right to do this and i understand a company is not a charity.

But we have a company car policy, which states that, at the end of your work contract, you have the choice to keep the car (take over the lease), find a new owner for the car or, pay the remainder of the lease. If you only drove the care for 2 years, this remainder can easily exceed 10000 dollars. And the first 2 options are not allways easy...

Now, the dirty thing is that the car policy states ""at the end of your contract"", but it does not mention who needs to end the contract. In other words, the boss can in theory fire you and then make you pay this huge sum of money.

I assumed that he would not do this, and pay for the cost himself, because I mean, what is 10k for a company with a turn over of a couple of million each year?

But now i hear rumors that they were actually gonna charge him this fine... The only reason it did not happen is because 2 other senior collegues basically stood up for him, stepped into the boss's office and threatened to leave if he would ask the junior to pay up.

I like to think of myself as a person who has principles. And this is one of those things for which I am now considering to quit. I feel a bit betrayed and dissapointed. Other than that the job is, allthough sometimes stressful and not the highest paying, really my thing and feels rewarding. The collegues are also generally great...

Would you keep working for a boss that you no longer trust? Or do you completely seperate the job from the employer in your mind?

1gcdfef,Is choosing to be a technician at a good company over an engineer at a bad company a smart move? early career,"Hi all!

I wanted to figure things out regarding paths.

(no real world engineer experience besides internship, currently working data entry, graduated 2 years ago)

I got an offer for an early career engineer role decent pay. However my concern is that the company’s review has been rather not so positive (mainly with HR and management) and I’m unsure if that's an ideal situation to be in.

I also interviewed for a rather big semiconductor company that has a lot of positive review but it’s for a technician role(l (mechanical repair/maintenance very labor work) with pay being roughly 20k less then the engineer role. Reviews are very positive and I have friends that work there that vouch for it. However, as mention it is a technician role but I was told there is lots of opportunities to learn and grow to be become engineer. Interview went very well and was told to be on the lookout.

I am unsure of which option to choose. I of course want the best for myself but I don’t want to be burned early.

Both are quite big company but in completely different states.

I'm leaning towards the semiconductor company and low pay and working my way up to be an engineer at the cost of body pain, but I am not entirely sure.

Tldr:

Early career Engineer: not so good reviewed company with good pay

Technician: referral. big semiconductor company, Potential learning to engineer + vouched as a good company but low pay and not an engineer. Labor work

1gcbp0r,Does not enjoying learning something means I won't like working with it?,"quick context: I'm 20, male, have depression, anxiety problems and am burned out.

I've seen this notion of ""getting through the bad part"" of something to get to the good part quite often.

My literature teacher saying ""if you get through the first chapter of this book, the rest of it is just a bliss"".

My uncle ""You may be struggling now, but you'll reap what you sow... in a good way!""

And honestly many other people in my life saying something similar.

From my own experience, I know this is true in some cases. Sometimes I hated the first 3 episodes of an Anime, then I loved where it went. Same thing with a lot of games and so on...

But is it the case for a career? I myself I'm studying to be a data analyst/scientist, but daaaaaaaamn, it's like my body just rejects it (trying to learn excel lol), even if my mind thinks ""well it's not that bad"". Like, I can't stay focused for more than 1 hour, and by the 2 hour mark I'd rather be doing anything else, including cleaning the bathroom. While for other things, I can stay focused without much effort for 8-10 hours, sometimes not even stopping to eat. My record was 30 hours ( because I had to deliver a college project that went wrong ) and it wasn't that bad.  
I have a friend who's studying astrophysics, says he hates maths, and the course if 75% maths. But he's ""determined"" and says he just has to get through it.

1gcbk14,Should I consider moving across the country for a 30% pay raise,"I received a job offer that will take my salary from 80,000cad to 100,000cad per year with 5,000cad to relocate from Vancouver,BC to Sydney, NS. 

Things to know about role: 
1. Their office is in Vancouver but are using a research lab facility in Sydney, NS to help with research. 
2. Its a small startup just like my current role 
3. There would be only one other person that would work under me in this location. The rest of the team (7 including co-founders are in Vancouver)
4. They mentioned that the plan is eventually to move back the both of us to Vancouver(in one year or could be longer) but cannot provide in writing about the move back

Things that are stopping me from saying yes already 
1. Sydney does not have an international airport. I would need to drive to Halifax which has the closest international airport and thats 4 hours away. As an immigrant who would like to fly out to visit my family abroad or would like for my parents to visit me or to just travel in general- this seems very inconvenient. 
- Also would only get 2 weeks vacation vs 3 weeks + christmas week off at current job. 
2. My spouse is currently unemployed (PM in the tech) and he is worried that if we make the move to NS his job prospects would be lower than in Vancouver 
3. Just moving across the country in general. It took me a while to build friends in Vancouver when I moved here few years ago and having to start my life over seems scary. 
4. Anyone who knows Sydney knows that the weather and vibe is different from Vancouver. I do not own a car and would definitely have to buy one if I move there to get to work as public transport is almost non existent. 

Reason why I think I should say yes: 

1. would earn a lot more, be in a senior position. 
2. save more money because I would be living in a smaller town 
3. My current job seems like its going nowhere. They haven’t given out any pay raises to anyone in almost 2 years, no CEO, no performance reviews and mostly no vision. Whoever is left in management is just running around to bring in some money for the company. 


A bit about me - Me (F) and my spouse are in our mid 20s. My current job is my first real job out of university.

The negative if I do this is that it will negatively affect my health since i will be working full time and going to school full time. Also, if I fail any class it will be money down the toilet.

1gc6ywt,Mentally fried and emotionally drained. Unemployed for 15+ months. Where to go from here. ,"I think it would help I share some context regarding my background so it helps to understand how I got into this situation. 

I’m a 28F from NY state and got a BA in English and MAT in English Teaching for H.S./M.S. (finished grad school in 2021) I incorrectly assumed that teaching would be a practical and safe career choice for me but post-graduation, I completed a handful of teaching interviews and was told each time that I should consider going back to school and complete either a master’s in TESOL or special education so I can be considered a competitive candidate. I live in an area of NY where teaching jobs are highly competitive and positions sparingly open. I took up substitute teaching in hopes that I could get my foot in the door somewhere and when I asked the dept head and superintendent of the school, I was given the same advice to go back to school. I was so angry for wasting time on completing a graduate degree that was essentially useless. After working as a substitute for nearly two years without a raise in either incentive or pay, I decided to leave the position (which I regret not having a job lined up) and fix up my resume to positions both inside and outside the education sector. 

From the start of 2022 to the spring of 2023, I was jobless, living with my parents (still am) and had applied to well over 5,000 jobs at that point. I got a call back to work as a talent sourcer for an agency and although I knew about the reputations of staffing firms, I took the job out of desperation and hoping that at least I’ll be able to gain a skill set outside of teaching. I did really well in the role and ended up closing more vacancies than the senior recruiters and managers at the workplace and for the sake of condensing this experience, my boss had her favorites and ended up firing me for what I suspect to be animosity harbored regarding my work by other employees. Since the end of last summer till today, I have been jobless and applying to, again, thousands of jobs. 

I’ve exhausted all referrals and connections. I’ve messaged dozens of hiring managers, heads of people, job posters, and recruiters for jobs I’ve applied to, etc. I’ve changed my resume an embarrassingly large number of times. I’ve written specific resumes and cover letters for an embarrassingly large number of jobs. I’ve done all this and I’ve gotten absolutely nowhere and I’ve wasted soooooo much time that I’ll never get back and I’m just really freaking angry about this entire area of my life. After all this time and effort, I thought that not only should I have been hired by now, but I should’ve been a year into my new job. 

I’ve thought about going back to teaching in areas where there’s a teaching shortage in the U.S., but I don’t know how I’d be able to support myself financially. I’d be able to tolerate the low teaching salaries if I could live with my parents or someone I know, but to move on my own, I don’t want to struggle to get by. After going through the wringer with my failed attempt at a career in teaching, I’m not happy with it. 

I’ve thought of going back to school but don’t want to take out loans for a degree that might lose its value before I’m done graduating (just like my teaching degree). I already feel low enough, I can’t imagine what my mental state would be if it happened again. Plus, I’m broke and don’t qualify for financial aid and a lot of scholarships being that I already have degrees. 
  
This is a rant as much as it is a post asking for help. I’m open to constructive feedback, any advice, tips, tricks, information, a point into the right direction. I don’t know how to get myself out of this.

1gc6fjx,Is there anything you can actually do about this situation,"LDR: My manager and his supervisor are shifting blame onto me for issues that arose due to their poor decision-making. Although I am documenting everything to cover myself, I am wondering if it’s best to ignore this and move on, or if it might make sense to consider legal options down the line.

Here’s the background 
Both my manager and the manager’s supervisor are under scrutiny because of their own approved initiatives that didn’t go well. After reviewing and approving certain features and initiatives with me, they later faced negative feedback from leadership. Now, my manager has told me that unless she improves her performance, she’ll be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).

I have been focusing on what I can do to improve rather than placing blame, and my fiancé been helping me organize my action items, including documenting dates of my reviews with my manager to protect myself in case of performance monitoring. However, later on, a friend of mine from a different team mentioned out of the blue that he’d heard from his manager that her own manager and supervisor were scapegoating her. He had no prior knowledge of the situation, which confirmed to us that this was more than a private issue.

They continue to criticize me for actions they themselves instructed, like asking her to loop in someone only to later question her for doing so. This is not a performance issue but just unfair treatment or whatever is the legal term. This has been negatively impacting my mental health too. 

Should I keep a record of these instances in case of future legal action, or is it better to let this go and move on?",No-Jeweler6373,2,0.7599999904632568,4,1729894990,2024-10-25 22:23:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gc6fjx/is_there_anything_you_can_actually_do_about_this/,10,2024

1gc5eab,Dentist career Options... feeling stuck,"Writing this because my partner who is a dentist by profession in the US and feels stuck in her profession. She worked hard for so long to get into a dental school. Graduated and her first job was at a DSO. Didn't work out in 6 months due to extreme pressure, and since then it has been on the downswing. Picked up work 4 months later at a private, where she has been there for a year. The last 6 months has been brutal, with not enough patients to the other doctors ""stealing"" patients. She is constantly demotivated and does not seem interested in finding a better job. Last 6 months, she goes in to the clinic on an average of once every 2 weeks and rest of the time, just idles around at home.   
Tried to sit down explain the importance of keeping her clinical skills current. She says none of the job boards have helped. Couple of bad experiences have traumatized her to the point she doesn't have the drive anymore. Not only does she lacks motivation, she now finds excuse for not finding a better job. Every time I bring up this topic, she gets defensive. She doesn't have any other hobbies or interests, but wants to travel and enjoy life. I am in a full-time job but I can only contribute so much financially.   
What do I do to help motivate her? Would a career coach help? She doesn't have a network she can rely on, and she is bit of an introvert.

1gc3rmg,"Keep, quit, or get fired?","Hi all! I make 99% of my income in my primary field, which is contract/gig based; but, I have kept a part-time job in big tech since the pandemic, almost solely for the benefits...of which there are many. Now that business is largely back to normal (and has been for some time), should I keep, quit, or allow the part time gig to fire me?

The PT gig was fine with me taking off for my normal job early in my tenure, but they have become increasingly inflexible in the past year or so, since the management has been almost entirely replaced. I took the job with the their knowing explicitly that this is part time for me -- should absolutely anything come up related to my regular career, that will always come first. I am extremely responsible and let them know weeks, months, or sometimes years in advance whenever possible...which is more than I can say for my younger, less-life-experienced colleagues. But still, I am often seen as the difficult one because I am the only part-time person on that particular team. So, they are constantly trying to pressure me to make adjustments to my schedule, which I cannot and am unwilling to do.

Again, my regular career is gig-based; so, for example, I'll make about $12k for less than 2 weeks of work in December...but it's not consistent. So, what would you do?

1gc3ipg,"Accepted an Offer, but Potentially Still Interviewing Elsewhere?","I'm a 4th-year college student who'll be graduating this Spring and have been applying for similar roles this fall (entry-level/associate positions that all have training cohorts starting during the summer).

Earlier this month, one company (we'll call company #1) I've been interviewing with since late August gave me an *amazing* offer on 10/04, and I had till 10/08 to respond (that was a super short window, I know). Given how great the offer was and the fact that I met in person (for about an hour or so) with the individuals who'd be on my team, I went ahead and accepted the offer on 10/08 (because I knew I'd feel pretty foolish later on for rejecting it or letting the opportunity slip through my fingers).

However, there's another company (we'll call company #2) I began interviewing with in late September (only having done 1 interview at that time), that got back to me on 10/16 to schedule a second interview. I met with this company briefly during the career fair my college had on 10/2, and I loved the energy and draw they gave, the work I could potentially be doing at that company, and the fact that I know someone who currently works there and is enjoying their experience with this company so far.

Given that, I'm feeling iffy about accepting company #1's offer so soon. They're great people, the pay is out-of-this-world, and the location is closer to where my family lives (which would lessen the strain of commuting). However, I am not in love with the idea of the particular work I'll be doing (but who's to say I won't enjoy it once starting). Company #2 is a further commute (which I'd undoubtedly be taking the train for), I'm unsure if the pay would match anywhere near the pay I'm receiving from company #1, but I believe I'd love the work I could be doing at company #2.

Should I continue interviewing with company #2 behind company #1's back? I haven't received nor signed any offer letter for company #1 (I was told I'd be receiving that in the spring), and only received an email offer which I expressed my acceptance via email. I don't want company #1 to feel as though I'm stringing them along, and I'd hate to burn bridges if I end up loving company #2 and choose to go with them (the industry is rather small).

What would you all do in this situation? Any advice? Suggestions? Should I just put my big girl britches on, stop being indecisive, and ride it out with company #1?

A similar house in DC costs about $8000 for monthly mortgage payment. He is really excited about the opportunity and really wants to go there for better job outlook and career growth. He felt the new job opens up a lot of opportunity for him. I'm also excited for him. However, as much as I want to support him, I have mixed feelings, especially considering the high mortage rate and housing price. Child care, grocery, etc.. all are pricier in D.C.. Is it worthwhile to move to DC? I wouldn't want hubby have regret years later if not taking this opportunity, on the flip side however, I also feel silly if we sell our current low-mortgage-rate house and jump into the crazy housing market in D.C.

1gc2vdp,How to quit? How to give a 2 weeks notice?,"Background: I (27F) work for the state at an environmental agency. I've been here since 2019 and was hired as a full time staff member in 2022. This is the first and only place I've ever worked at. I worked some internships here while in college and was fortunate enough to be offered a full time position right out of college. I'm very grateful to have been given the opportunity to work here. However, I have sadly realized that this just isn't the right career field for me. I've been sort of mentally checked out all year (mostly due to going through the worst year of my personal life and I've also just come to terms with all the ""cons"" of working here and in this field) and am beyond ready to move on with my life. 

  
I am planning on going back to school in the spring to study and enter a completely different career field. I have been looking at new jobs for a few months and have finally sort of figured out what I want my next steps to be, I just have to send my resume to a few places and get in contact with my college. 

  
Anyways, I am terrified to quit because I've never done it before and my boss can be pretty weird and judgmental. I'm so scared to have this conversation with him. I also just don't really know how to quit. I want to be professional about it and give a 2 weeks notice, but, how? How do you actually do that? Do I ask to meet with him or do I leave it in his inbox or send it as an email? I've truly never done this before and don't want to embarrass myself or make myself look bad. What do I even say in the notice? 

  
The worst part of it though, from my perspective, is the civil service exam for my position has finally been scheduled for the first week of December and I have to register for this by next Wednesday. I do not plan on taking this test as I do not plan on staying here or even in this career field so I don't want to waste my time and potentially make it harder for me to leave if I do take and pass the test. I'm afraid I'm already making myself look bad by agreeing to everything while knowing I'm going to leave and keeping it a secret for months and blindside my boss..

1gc1m7e,Considering a Job Move to Join an ESOP – Is It Worth It?,"Hey everyone,

I’m looking for some advice on whether I should make a move to a new company. Currently, I live near Raleigh, North Carolina, with my wife and kids, and I’m in my early thirties. I work for a specialty contractor that ranks in the top five in North America. Recently, I received a job offer from a company near Denver, Colorado, and I’m weighing the pros and cons of making the switch. The retirement benefits are stronger, the wages are adjusted for cost of living, and I’m not thrilled with my current boss. Here’s a breakdown of each role:

Current Position:

	•	Yearly Salary: $131K
	•	401K Match: $0.35 per dollar up to 6%
	•	Average Yearly Bonus: $17.5K
	•	Company: Established in 1950 with yearly revenue of $250M
	•	Stability: Good job security and I get along well with my colleagues

Offer Package:

	•	Yearly Salary: $152K
	•	401K Match: $1 per dollar up to 5%
	•	Average Yearly Bonus: $12K
	•	Relocation Package: $17K
	•	Company: Founded in 2002, became an ESOP (employee-owned) in 2020, with yearly revenue of $25M

I’m interested in the new company because of the ESOP, better 401K match, and a fresh start, but my current role feels secure, and I have a good working relationship with my team.

So my question is: Is it worth moving to a smaller company for the ESOP and enhanced retirement benefits, or should I stay with my current employer where I have more security?

1gc1kd6,Torn on an offer,"Hi, thought I could request some advice on my current situation:

I really like my current job. It's a government job, so there's plenty of security, I like the people I work with, my office environment is great, I get lots of perks and free meals throughout the year. However the key downside with a position like mine is that the pay isn't as high as it could be. In the 4 years I've worked here, the pay has been plenty enough for me, but I closed on a house at the end of last year (had been saving up extensively) and am worried about my salary not keeping up with the rising costs of homeownership.

In my role, I have enough responsibility to qualify for a title promotion. This was a request I put in a year ago, in hopes that a salary adjustment would come with it. I have witnessed my work create new positions and promote individuals in other departments. This has me feel that, while these individuals are inarguably more important than me, it wouldn't be difficult for them to promote me if they really wanted to. I've begun to accept the fact that it likely won't happen. When I planned to purchase my house, I factored in my pay at my current static amount. While it is all within budget, money would be tight.

I began interviewing and was offered a position at another company. The pay would be at minimum 12K higher than my current position, but there are downsides here:

\-when I need to be in office (3 days a week), the commute is twice as long (1 1/2 hrs each way, provided minimal to moderate traffic)  
\-no idea on the level of job security compared to current position  
\-no idea on the office environment. i'd be the only person in my department working in-office

I'm very torn about the long commute time. I live by myself with my dog, and I don't like the idea of leaving him home longer than I do currently, which amounts to up to 10 hrs. on some days. The higher pay would mean I could put in real savings again, but at the cost of time. I've also considered how, at my current job, I have a great relationship with almost all my colleagues. Maybe bide my time a little longer and see if anything changes. 

Would like to hear some outside perspective, thank you!

1gc1d91,I think I'm getting bullied at work,"29F. I started a new job almost a year ago. It's a big company and my department is about 7 people. Over the last couple of months Im sort of getting a weird vibe. I am on the quiet side but I do talk to my coworkers when I see them. Over the last month especially, I have noticed the following: 

**- My work gets undermined in a way that it's not seen as ""important"" or ""priority"" so it's left until last minute to be actioned** 

**- My manager rarely lets me do anything without having to check it** 

**- \*\* the biggest one \*\* Being ignored/excluded - The entire department talks about things that are connected to my job but I dont find out until the very last minute. I feel like an idiot when someone mentions something and I didnt know but everyone else does.** 

**The entire department is going on a work trip in 2 weeks for a conference on something they know I love and want to learn. I'm the only one from the group not going and i didnt even know about it until the intern told me.** 

**- They mock me being ""too quiet"" when I have social anxiety (they dont know this)**

Maybe im overthinking this but even other employees have commented on how my department treats me. 

Whats weird is that my department would randomly say ""oh youre so amazing, you work so hard, we love having you on the team"" but i think it's only when they need something. 

Anyway, I do want to start my own business and I am in the works but just needed some advice because it's really getting me down.

  
Thanks.

1gc0r1g,Another remote job post - how do I get there before hundreds of others?!?,"So, I’m not going to ask where to find remote jobs, because I (mostly) know where they are. Sometimes even company pages have jobs that aren’t advertised anywhere. My question is… 

How are people able to get ahead of hundreds of applicants BEFORE there are hundreds of applicants? By the time I get a job alert it’s already been up a few hours and sometimes hundreds of people have clicked “apply” on LinkedIn. 

I know that doesn’t mean they’re all qualified or that they even applied… But I’m sure at least enough of them applied that the recruiter is going to be overwhelmed enough to not get to my resume. I had one recruiter say if you’re number 100, it’s not likely you’ll get it, because they’ve already gotten to their top ten.

TLDR: I got a great career set up but slightly unhappy, do I stick with it, or find something new.

  
I (30sM) work remotely for a tech startup, making between $100k and $130k annually, depending on the year. My workload varies a lot—I might work anywhere from 10 to 30 hours a week. Some days are intense and packed, while on others, I might just send a few emails.

I'm in a unique spot in life: I have two young kids under two and a loving, supportive wife who’s a full-time stay-at-home mom. This setup allows me to spend lots of time with my family, which I really value. Right now, we’re housesitting in a fairly remote but beautiful area, so life is relaxed and pretty low-key.

Here’s my dilemma: I feel like I’m wasting my potential. I have an MBA and am confident in my ability to take on more challenging work. Part of me feels I could earn more or contribute more either by advancing in my current company or by moving to a higher-paying role. But I know that would likely mean a more demanding schedule.

Sometimes I feel anxious, like I’m underselling myself and missing out on bigger opportunities. At the same time, I know I have a great setup, and my company is happy with my performance. My manager assumes I’m working hard because I consistently deliver quality results, even though I’m not working full-time hours.

So, what should I do? Should I just appreciate what I have and enjoy the time with my family? Try to start a side hustle to channel my ambition without giving up this lifestyle? Or go all-in on a new job to push myself further?",AdDesperate4903,1,1.0,0,1729879455,2024-10-25 18:04:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gc0lzf/milk_it_or_change_it_up/,10,2024

1gc0b95,Is it my career or the location?,"Hi all, I’m sure there are similar posts but didn’t quite pinpoint my dilemma. I have my MA in CMHC and have been working as licensed clinical mental health counselor (NC) for several years now. (Other than feeling misguided in choosing this program and having the same exact jobs as an LCSW, I figured this would be a sound career path after a BA in Psychology). 
Problem is that I had planned on moving back home to CA after graduating, where there are plentiful job opportunities and competitive salary.
I instead found myself stuck out here in a rural area and went ahead and got provisionally licensed. Every 6-7 months into a job, I find the organization intolerable and have been asked/demanded to do unethical or illegal things in each of 3 jobs. I love the work itself, but at this point I’m ready to leave entirely after my 3rd job and just 600 hours short of full licensure as both LCMHC and LCAS. It is taking me so long because I have a total mental health crisis after each job ends as I’m exhausted, traumatized and overworked and overwhelmed all the time.
I make very little compared to other states - 40- 55k/year and there are no opportunities for advancement without going back to school for doctorate. I still want to just get it done so I can move on and someday move home, but my question is: How the heck can I make money out here doing anything else or find a new career of comparable pay with no other skill set? I don’t care if it’s boring or laborious; I love being outside and have zero construction skills. I’m also a military veteran…I believe I am highly valuable but I can’t afford to move and don’t have IT skills for good remote jobs. I’m also in my early 40s and tired of wasting time feeling miserable and putting up with company BS that doesn’t benefit employees or patients. 
I’m just stuck and broke and feeling endlessly hopeless.

I don't know if this is the right sub to ask this but I've been coming across people that look at me with hostility and especially with people that are more conscious of their race and try to pin on me as a racist even though I haven't at all done or said anything out loud or even thought of any racist things. Which makes me furious and confused. Furious because I'm being accused of something I've never thought of and confused because I'm more at a disadvantage as a person and my background so it does not make sense for me to hate a race. 
Im quiet and soft spoken and I avoid confrontation. I also hate to be a part of the gossips they do at work. Im just there to work. I clock in expecting to just deal with customer complaints but when there is a pile of coworkers at my back stabbing me with glares. How do I survive this type of environment?

1gbz3pb,Seeking Advice: Should I accept a job offer or pursue a PhD?,"I'm nearing the completion of my master's in Cybernetics and Robotics and recently received an offer from the most attractive employer in my country, which had over 10,000 applications for its graduate positions. I applied to two roles:



\- Graduate - Automation, Robotics, and Cybernetics (my first choice)

\- Graduate - Subsea Facilities and Operations (the offer I received)



While it's the company I really want to work for, the role isn't directly aligned with my primary interests in automatic control, cybernetics, robotics, and AI. I'm unsure whether I'd thrive in this position, as my true passion lies in the areas mentioned above.



I'm also strongly considering pursuing a PhD in Cybernetics, where I'd get to focus on the areas I'm most passionate about. One potential plan is to take the PhD, then reapply to the company in a role more closely related to Automation, Robotics, and Cybernetics, or maybe within R&D. You may think I would be overqualified, but the job description for all graduate positions states that they're looking for candidates with a Master's or PhD, and it's a company where many employees have PhDs



Additionally, I’ve applied for a position at another great company that’s much more related to my field of interest, and I've completed the first interview. I'll reach out to them to let them know I’ve received an offer.



I would really appreciate any advice on whether to accept the offer, explore the role, or pursue a PhD.

1gbz323,Stuck on a Fence between 2 jobs - Which one to take?,"I've posted before but thought I'd try and get everyone's advice here. 

I have 2 jobs and I'm unsure which one I should take. Thought I'd get everyone's input here. 

**Job 1** 

* Salary: 150k
* Company: Small local company with no name recognition
* Job type: Exempt Employee
* Relocation: 15k (Company is not providing any relocation and I'd have to pay for it out of pocket)
* Insurance: Decent (Not great, but mid tier insurance)
* Commute: 45-60 minutes
* Will I need to look for new job right away: Yes - (The job is 30k below my market rate so It'd be a stop gap until I get a new one)
* Schools: Where I can afford in new city the schools will be 6/10 for my kid
* Misc: It's a much better title than I've had before so it could be a springboard to better paying positions in a year or two. 
* Monthly expenses: No change to day (rent, insurance, and bills would be same in new city) 

  
**Job 2**

* Salary: 145k Company:
* Large name-brand tech company (contract through 3rd party agency)
* Job type: Contract Employee - Contract Renews every 6 months
* Relocation: $0 - It's near me so I won't have to relocate
* Insurance: Minimal, basically emergency only 
* Commute: 15-30 minutes
* Will I need to look for new job right away: Yes - (The job is 30k below my market rate and it's a contract so It'd be a stop gap until I get a new one)
* Schools: Right now my kid is in an amazing school 9/10
* Misc: It's a lower title than I've done in years, but it would be a possible ""In"" at a huge tech company 
* Monthly expenses: No change since we're not moving.  

Basically it seems like it boils down to this: Do I want to pay 15k for a better title in a new city (with sightly worse schools) for a guaranteed job or stay the course for a 6 month contract that MIGHT renew with worse benefits. For both jobs, I'd have to start to look for a new job right away to get back to my market rate. It seems crazy to me to pay 15k for a new job, but my partner sees the guarantee job vs. just a contract.

1gby54o,How valuable really is your time?,"I’m seeing a lot of posts and responses from people saying that a recruiter or a manager wasted their time by contacting them or interviewing them. I don’t really get this frustration. I would get it if there’s something revealed long into the interview process that should have been revealed right at the beginning, but I don’t get the sense that this happens very often. I know of course that this does happen, but it really can’t be that frequent.

Here’s why I ask this question. I’ve been in positions where I’m making great money, and if someone contacts me about a job, I’m flattered even if it’s below my seniority level. I tend to have a polite conversation, let them know what I’m actually looking for, if anything, and move on. Sometimes those people call me months later letting me know that they have something that’s actually a raise over what I’m making, and I consider it. Or maybe they are contacting me about something pretty good and I make sure to go over what I’d need to consider it, and if they can’t work with that then I thank them for their time. If I spend 15 to 60 minutes on the phone with someone, and I’m doing so willingly, sure I could say that I wasted whatever I’m typically paid equals out to for that time, but who cares? It’s just an hour. This seems like the same type of perspective that people have when a romantic relationship comes to an end and they feel like they wasted however much time they were with that person. Oh I’m sorry, were you turning down advances left and right and now they’re all dead? Come on. It’s an hour. Relax.

I don’t really get it. Have the interaction. If it works, great! If it doesn’t, great! If you don’t have time for it then, say so and schedule it for later.

How many good opportunities are people missing out on because they don’t want to “waste their time”? 60 minutes to find out if something will either be life changingly amazing or not worth more effort.

1gbw5em,Leaving new job after 5 months for higher pay - worth it?,"Prefacing this by saying, I am not a job hopper. My previous job I was at for 5 years.

Was hired on to a new company 5 months ago, with a company that has a great reputation within the industry. The job was a 20% increase from prior job.

Company A --

Current job is remote 2 days, in office 3 days. However they are very flexible with it/aren't enforcing it. Work is primarily from behind a screen, not a lot of interaction with the actual customer/client aside from email, maybe phone call. They are a relaxed but driven group. I really get along well with my team and my manager. Bonus is minimal if any. No true structure to how I could get a compensation increase in the next few years. Company is downtown, parking is free. Commute is 25 mins one way.

That said, I was asked just a month or two after starting new job to consider a role with an even bigger/""better"" company. I really considered not going for it, but convinced myself better to know now if they're full of sh*t then vs down the road if I ever tried to interview there.

Company B -- 

Nearly identical job, although more client facing. Pay is 30% increase what I get paid now, sign on bonus, and would push me well into the 6 figures. Plus there is a written guaranteed bonus, and sign on bonus, more ""free"" PTO. Parking is downtown in my city and would cost me.

Does have a good rep, but are also known to be more ""go getter"" types. Therefore, seems like there is a chance I could get burnt out in time. But that is not a for sure. I have heard that they are making some weird moves in the industry and undercutting my current employer on various accounts. There is 3 days in/2 days home but some local travel 1x a week for one of the days ""in office"". Pay is 30% more, and that could be a big change for my family. 

All this to say, I don't know if this is the industry I want to stay in. I can either ride it out with my current role, and have an easier time of it (lower stress, lower pay but not shabby pay) or take the other role, sock away the increase in pay and be done with it in a couple of years once I hit my limit. Could afford nicer vacations, or earlier retirement.

1gbvry8,Negotiating Salary After Saying What Is Being Offered Isn't A Dealbreaker,"Hi! I know this topic is often brought up here, and I've searched and researched other responses, but still wanted to post to just see how others would respond in my specific situation. So thank you in advance to anyone who has guidance/advice. 

I've been on the job hunt for about 4 months now. It's been quite an unpleasant experience and I would like it to end soon. I'm currently working part time doing some freelance stuff, but I'm looking for something with more stability. 

I'm currently interviewing with a company that I really like and it seems to have good vibes and culture and the benefits are amazing. The role is exactly what I want to spend my days doing. I'm in the final round of interviews and while I haven't been offered anything yet, I'm just thinking/planning ahead in case I do.

During the initial interview with the recruiter, she asked me for my salary expectations. I told her between 90k-95k. I am aware that I messed up here, as I shouldn't have been the first to give a number, but I did, and what's done is done. I then asked what the budget was and she said she didn't know the exact number, but that it was for sure less than what I was asking. The salary wasn't in the job posting. It said compensation dependent on experience or something like that. She said she'd get back to me with the amount so that I could decide if I wanted to continue with the process.

When she got back to me, she said they were targeting around 79k full compensation with a 75k base salary. I responded that it wasn't dealbreaker (it's not, I meant that) as the benefits are very good in comparison to other companies and that'd I'd like to continue to learn more about the company. 

My question is, if I'm to get a job offer, is it okay for me negotiate the pay, even though I said I was okay with 75k? I would ideally like to ask for 80k base, but I'm scared that they'll rescind the offer as that would be the absolute worst thing (I'm being hyperbolic here, but I don't want to be unemployed anymore). I really need a job and I'm not currently in a position where I can walk away and keep looking, and I don't have any other offers or interviews happening. I'm okay with 75k, but I do feel that I'm worth more than that considering my experience and overall work ethic. I just don't want to make anymore missteps regarding salary. Clearly I've made a few. 

What would be the best way to go about asking for 80k? Should I even, or should I just accept (assuming I get an offer). Thanks again!

TLDR: Recruiter told me job paid 75k, I said that wasn't a dealbreaker, but that I would like to learn more about the role. Now that I've learned more, I'm wondering if it's okay to ask for 80k upon an offer.

1gbv5aq,Higher pay in unfulfilling job VS Lower pay in more fulfilling job,"TLDR: the gruelling job with the amazing pay, or the more fulfilling job with the crap commute?

Hi everyone,

Looking for a little guidance here. I currently work in Fintech (trading company), £80K per year, 3 days in office. 40-50 min commute via public transport. Been here 5 months and it's a bit of a sh\*t show. Constant changing of priorities, everything led by the whims of the cofounders rather than any strategy, high workload and lack of process.

I've had an offer for a gaming studio I love, £60K per year, 1-2days in office. Nearly 2 hour commute via public transport. The team are lovely, and it's kind of a dream role with a dream studio.

I'm very confused as to what the best route is. The money at my current job is fantastic, but I wouldn't say I'm happier for it. I'm definitely starting to find my feet with the role but it's a strange culture - people just disappear over night, whether through being let go or leaving. There are some great people there and definitely found my 'group', but it's gruelling, full on, and I'm not sure I'm built for that kind of job or industry. There's a high turnover and burnout rate. The other role is much more up my street, but doing that commute twice a week is gruelling in itself and could also lead to burnout.

Looking for a little outside perspective on this one. If the new job didn't have that commute I'm not even sure it would be a discussion tbh and I would already have accepted the offer.

All comments appreciated :)",pixelpunkz,1,1.0,5,1729865379,2024-10-25 14:09:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gbv5aq/higher_pay_in_unfulfilling_job_vs_lower_pay_in/,10,2024
1gbuuv0,Disliking new job 3 months in. Wondering if I should stick it out or start looking? ,"I just began a new job 3 months ago and felt somewhat mislead about the role and it feels like a step down from my previous role and I’m noticing some red flags as well. I’m looking for some advice/guidance on how to best proceed. 

In my last role, it was my first job out of college so I’m relatively new in my career. I excelledn and got promoted to a team lead role. Yet I was doing some director level work as well and was very overworked/underpaid. However, I did like the work more and enjoyed being in a leadership role. I was there for 3 years and could no longer afford to work there. My company was always in a hiring freeze so raises/promotions were out of the question. It was also bad for my mental health. 

I got recruited for my new role and interviewed for it and it seemed like an easy way out, but like a similar role in some ways, so I was looking forward to jumping in. I was also told this was a leadership position when it really isn’t. I got a $15k raise in this new role where I have significantly less responsibilities and am not overseeing a team. However I am being micromanaged and share a role/responsibilities with 3 others so there is not a clear definition of who is responsible for what, which creates issues on a daily basis. My manager also tests the other employees here and she’ll ask random questions/assign random tasks just as a test instead of actually needing work done. Overall I am disappointed in the role and it feels like a huge step down and it’s hard to come from being a leader to being spoken to like im stupid and micromanaged. However at this company you can transfer internally in 6 months which is an option but I’m not 100% sure if I want to stay here. It is a big company with a lot of jobs though. 

I’m looking for advice. Do you think I should stick it out 3 more months and try to transfer? Or do you think I should just start looking? I want to start looking but the only thing holding me back is how to navigate looking for a new job while only a few months into this one. Should I just lie and say I took time off from my last job and don’t have one currently? Should I just put my last job on my resume and not this one? Any advice on how to navigate this if I do manage to land an interview?

1gburw0,Seeking advice on career break and health prioritization ,"I'm a 34-year-old Recruitment Manager from the UK but based in Germany with 13 years of experience across agency, blue-chip, and scale-up environments. I enjoy my work, but in the last four years, I've experienced a recurring cycle of burnout and poor health. After a stable 9-year stretch across two companies, I’ve moved through three roles in four years post-pandemic, with multiple diagnoses of burnout and depression from my doctor. She attributes this to the long hours and sedentary nature of 50-60 hour workweeks. In addition, she has strongly recommended I lose 30kg to prevent future health issues and suggested I might need a more extended break than the brief gaps I’ve had between recent roles.

I recognize that I’m skilled in my field but see flaws in how I manage my workload and wellbeing, which now impacts my team. However, I'm uncertain about the best course of action. Financially, I have enough saved to manage about six to nine months without income, but this isn’t ideal. I’m also concerned about the job market in Germany, particularly given my intermediate (B2) German skills, and worry about the impact of a gap on my CV if I take time off.

I’d like to ask:

Has anyone here taken a similar risk by stepping away to focus on their health and seen clear long-term benefits or drawbacks?
Could a short-term career break to prioritize my health and mental stability ultimately be worthwhile?
Am I being too cautious or, conversely, underestimating the potential risks?

Thank you for any insights you can provide. At a total loss for what to do and find the opinions of those around me to vary massively and to have too much bias as they know me.

I've never really cared about this but now as I'm getting older it's starting to make me feel a bit stressed and like a bit of a loser. In high school I never studied or did homework, skipped class all the time, didn't care about anything & finished school with a 2.4 GPA. I didn't go to university because I had no concept of the future & had nothing I wanted to do.

I moved to another country when I was 18 and have just been kind of ""living"" since then. Been in and out of employment. I've only actually worked a total of 4 years with how much time I've spent being unemployed the past 8 years. I feel like the only thing I have going for me is that I've travelled a bit, but even that I haven't done that much. Like I said I moved country when I was 18, since then I have lived in 3 cities & travelled Europe 1 summer.

Other than that, I really have not accomplished anything... I was watching a movie last night that involved a woman in her 20s who was climbing up the career ladder and it really just started making me think about my life... I have literally 0 desire to work, I hate working. There's no career path I feel any passion towards. Most of my jobs have been hospitality like bartending & housekeeping. My last job was my first real ""serious"" job working at a hospital but I just quit after 3 months because I hated it so much.

My parents tell me they're proud of me but I don't understand what for and I feel like such a failure. If I had some kind of plan for what I wanted to do & accomplish in the next 5 years I don't think I'd regret my life as much but since I literally have no plan, or no IDEAS of plan, I'm starting to feel about hopeless. I feel like the only advice anyone could give me is to find a career & make a plan, but I literally don't know how or what to do.

1gbouie,Do I take the new job?,"
Earlier this year I was told that my entire team of 6 including myself were being made redundant. I got put through the redundancy process and handed my notice, only for the company to do a u-turn and say they wanted to keep me and me alone out of the team of 6 and move me to a different team to essentially do the same job under a slightly different job title. Up until the redundancy and even after I’d only ever been told I was doing an amazing job and that I’m very valued, but was growing tired of the same old excuses of having to wait until the next salary review period. 

After deliberation, I accepted this role change at the time as I figured it was the sensible thing to do as I’d at least have a stable income whilst perusing other jobs on the market. I asked for a pay raise once more but didn’t get it. 

Fast forward to now, I’ve been offered a job at a smaller but ambitious growing company in the same industry and the role seems perfect on paper and they’re offering me a significant pay increase. Initially I was certain I was going to take it, I handed in my notice to my line manager on Wednesday and he was upset but understood my reasoning and wished me the best. 

Today I’ve had phone calls from two really senior leaders in the business essentially begging me not to leave. It’s clear they’d match the offer but I don’t think that’s enough and it’s almost too late.

 I do really love my current job and I know I’m good at it but am I being conned into thinking these people really give a shit or is it just beneficial to the business that I stay on? 

I’m a bit torn as I wasn’t expecting this reaction. What would you do if you were me? And how would you politely explain to your current employers that it’s too late and that they should’ve acted sooner.

1gbn2qp,Worried about getting fired and burning out ,"I got this job even before I graduated from university at a big software company as a Devop, and I have been working here for over a year now, but I feel like slowly burning out.
People who graduated together with me keep telling me how hard it is to find such a good job, and how lucky I am in current job market. I see people with far better degrees from famous universities having a hard time to find a job, and my coworkers whom I think are far more capable than me got laid off. This has made me question myself every morning: what did I do to deserve this job? There are so many better candidates in the job market, what's so special about me? And if I'm easily replaceable, what's stopping them from lay me off and find someone better for half of the salary? 
So I have decided to work extra hard to be more valuable to the company to avoid getting fired, what I have done include: voluntarily work unpaid extra hours and on weekends regularly, forfeiting my vacation time, take on coworkers' tasks whenever they ask me to, even take on tasks from other teams. 
My boss have often told me he only expects 9-5 regular hours, and I should go to sleep at Saturday 2am, so I had to explain to him how my work is adding value to the project, and I choose to do it because I want to help the team to move forward.
This anxiety of getting fired is slowly burning me out, but whenever I think of taking a break, I think of those stories where people were told to never come back after a vacation, so I have to carry on with the anxiety. 
At this point, I would rather work at McDonald's just to know I am overqualified for the job and not worry about being fired. What should I do? Should I start applying to other jobs at this point(since I've already had some experience)?

What should I do?,"I work at a car dealership where I manage the loaner fleet (LM) and was later given an assistant manager-like position (AM) when the previous one left. For the AM role I need to deal with the vast majority of customers for the day alone. Other staff will show up to take over after I've dealt with 90% of the appointments for the day, however seeing as there are only 2 other people who do this and 2 days out of the week only one, while I'm trying to complete my LM responsibilities I will constantly be pulled out of it by any and all other members of staff who need the AM. Every day I'm either getting reprimanded for not doing X, Y, and Z the day before or for getting X, Y, and Z done but getting between 1-3 hours of overtime. Everytime it's the ladder my manager tells me I need to ""Manage my time better"" which almost always results in me complaining about the lack of other staff and the fact that I'm trying to fill two full-time positions. For example, a few months ago I had asked for a raise because everyday I was running around getting pulled in 6 different directions, I was then told to ""Manage your time better"", I then argued that even then I do more then the previous LM who made more than me which was met with ""Well they did blah blah blah which you're not doing."" I said it was impossible when I have to be AM as well which was again met with ""Well they did blah blah blah and you're not doing that either."". But every other member of staff loves me and always is so grateful for how helpful I am and for being one of the few people that doesn't slack off constantly.

Recently my responsibilities as LM have been almost rapidly increasing due to my general manager wanting to be able to increase fleet turnover, because, as he put it, ""Finally we don't have an idiot anymore"". His increase makes sense. More car turnover means it's easier for sales to have access to fleet cars and it means that corporate will pay us more. At the same time my direct manager has been increasing the load as well with wanting me to interview the advisor then the tech then the parts advisor to have roughly a paragraph detailing what's going on with each clients car that's in a loaner, this is very time consuming and is only to appease one of the owners who sort of puppeteers my manager. To add on to this more frequently while we have additional staff, my manager will ask me to do AM tasks despite having other staff to ask this of preventing me from doing my job. Which I will then be reprimanded for not doing later. I have raised my frustrations with them but am always met with their typical response, I have also pitched hiring more staff so that I can go back to being strictly LM and drop AM entirely, or some of staff have even offered to open with me to help take some of the load off, but they always say that someone new is starting this week or tells the staff that want to help me that ""I can handle it"".

All of this is just constantly aggravating and to add onto it I just learned that (Allegedly) my manager hates me and wants to ""Milk me until I'm dry"" so that I will quit. I know for a fact that typically this is how they try and get rid of people so that they won't have to pay them unemployment. The owner often through my manager (their puppet) is constantly manipulating and controlling things to the point that everyone first has to appease them and then can continue doing their job.

I'm not entirely sure what to do because all-though I like all of my co-workers and really need the money, I can't seem to find another job. Also, I know that frequently my manager will look at all of our unpaid lunch break times and will change them to an hour if they're less.

Overall just looking for some direction in how to handle all of this whether it's just that I need to quit or if I need to take legal action etc.

Sorry for the long and poorly structured post and thanks in advance for your advice and responses.",Flashy_Flight4978,2,0.75,8,1729830099,2024-10-25 04:21:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gblyw4/my_manager_overworks_me_and_wants_me_to_quit_what/,10,2024
1gblisq,Question about the hiring process?,"Hello everyone,

Nice to meet you all! I'm a 22-year-old recent graduate with a degree in finance and accounting.

I have a question regarding my job offers. I received two offers: one from an industry position and another from a public firm (a top 10 company, just below the Big 4). After comparing the two, I found that the industry position offers better benefits and salary, so I decided to accept that offer.

My concern is whether I might get blacklisted by the public firm for rejecting their offer, especially after completing all the interviews up to the partner level. I sent a formal note via email to express my gratitude and asked to keep in touch.

As I’m new to this hiring process, I would greatly appreciate any advice or feedback you could provide.

Thank you!

Being a pilot seems so chill tbh. I love flying, I love exploring new countries. And I've heard that pilots get so much free time once the plane has taken off (since it can cruise on autopilot). 

If I want to, I can change my degree to mathematics, statistics and business and possibly enrol part time in a flight school. I don't think I should drop out because many major airlines do require pilots to have a degree and I'd like to have a backup plan in case I don't like flying.

1gbjc01,Job offered me more after denying initial negotiation… do I try one more time?,"Job offered me more after declining first offer… do I try again?

So this new job that I am being offered from offered me 1k less than what I’m making now but they have a vested stock bonus which is 15% of my total pay. I am fully vested after the third year ( 1st year 1/3rd 2nd year 2/3rd vested etc.) 

The number was too low so I, negotiated 10k more than the base salary , got declined, then declined the offer in email. 1 hour later I get a phone call stating they would bump up the offer 5k more and nothing more ( yet last time before I declined they said the same thing)

Doing the numbers with this new offer I would essentially be making +7k the first year , +12k the second year and +17.5k in total compensation after bonus and stock vesting if I accepted the offer and work at the new company as opposed to staying put at the company I’m at now. Averaging that out it’s about 12k increase for the first three years (before taxes ofc)

The thing is I asked about getting that last extra 5k after the second offer and they came back and said no again. I truly want to decline again to see if they will give me the money this third time but would be a little miffed if they took away the offer.

All in all I’m asking should I decline again and see if they would give me the 5k I’m asking for? Or just sign. The numbers are enough for me to move and I plan on being there 5 years. I get every other Friday off and 5 weeks PTO as opposed to 3 weeks at the company I’m at now with 1 random day off a month. Most other benefits and features are pretty equal . Commute is slight farther to being in downtown but it’s fine. There is room for growth as this company is much larger than the one I’m at now which doesn’t really have growth for me. Also don’t really like my current manager now if that helps lol.

 TL:DR - Do I risk it for the biscuit and decline again hoping they give me the last 5k I’m asking for with the risk they take the offer away? Or just take it since it meets my minimum of atleast a 12k jump? The extra 5k would put me at 18k a year before taxes. Live in a MCOL area and am single if that helps.

1gbi2pq,Is my supervisor being insane or is it me,"Background: I work at a clinic for severely disabled children, which at times can become dangerous due to the severity of aggression. I have been here for 5 years and a year ago switched to a higher position which required an advanced degrees, certifications and exams to obtain. I had never had a complaint against me or problem with coworkers proceeding moving up to a higher position.

My direct supervisor for the last year has brought to my attention that at times I make a “face” which makes people very uncomfortable and my tone of voice can sound sarcastic (it is not intended to). I took this advice the first time and ended up getting Botox to help “fix” whatever face I was making - this seemed to help for 6 months. Then the conversation got brought up again, saying people were complaining about my face and voice- without any objective examples (I was also to panicked to ask for direct examples) during this all other feedback has been beyond exceptional on the work I produced and impact I have helped make. Over the summer this conversation had been brought up again, this time my boss had brought up it (it appeared my supervisor had her to), my boss has let me know she thinks that these “faces” I make are just my face and how it moves and my voice is just mt voice- but suggested I tell people to let me know if I do make a face or use a voice they are uncomfortable with. 
Fast forward to today- my supervisor was out for a few months and came back, called me to a meeting and started it off by being very angry with me because I am continuing to make faces and use a tone of voice. This time I did ask for direct examples and situations which she had none. She has also told me that this is putting my job in jeopardy. 

I am unsure what to do- if I am a problem in the situations or if it’s poor management and a company culture where a person or two has it out for me?

1gbhy0n,Hate New Job - Smart to go back to old job?,"Hola,

So I just took a federal job and I had a bad feeling since day one.  Let me lay the situation out for you.  My previous job was in the private sector at a large defense contractor.  I loved my job and I loved the company, but with any private company you have its cons.  My reason for leaving was simply because it was a federal job, which offered job security, better benefits, and ability to have a pension.

While all of those points are awesome, does it matter if you hate the job?  I am a highly technical person and I enjoy being in the systems and working, which is what my last job was.  This new one is a compliance roll, which  is just a bunch of paperwork and pushing policies on programs that I support.  On day one my manager was complaining all day, saying how this work sucks, the people suck, and how she cant wait until she is done with it and or retires.  The pay is comparable as they matched my pay so that isn't one of my concerns.

* Federal Job:
   * Pros:
      * Better benefits
      * Job Security
      * Ability to invest into a pension
      * Every other Friday off, and ability to telecommute 50%
   * Cons:
      * I hate the work, I don't feel like I would be proficient in it and I have no interest in it.
      * The people do not seem excited or motivated to be there
      * My manager told me she hopes I do good so I can help pick up the slack of others
      * Pay as you progress in your career isnt as good as in the private sector.

*  Previous Job:
   * Pros:
      * I enjoyed the work and got every Friday off
      * The people were excited to be there and wanted to work
      * Fully Remote and can live anywhere in the US
      * Wasn't super stressful like I know the Federal job will be
   * Cons:
      * Potential layoffs/restructuring as you have with any private company
      * Health benefits aren't nearly as good, but they offer an amazing 401k and HSA program

I need advice because in my head, going back is the move.  But I know I should give this new role some time for the new job blues to pass, but if I do that, my old position is gone within 2 weeks.  I am at a loss and have never been this stressed over a job before, and I half feel stupid for feeling this way.  Any advice is good advice here.",millsa_acm,4,1.0,6,1729816882,2024-10-25 00:41:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gbhy0n/hate_new_job_smart_to_go_back_to_old_job/,10,2024
1gbhtvo,"Should I settle for a ""boring"" job that otherwise offers a great company culture and flexibility?","Before anything else, I understand that this is ultimately a ""good"" problem to have, and I'm pretty privileged/lucky to be able to even make these choices. I have a job at the moment but am looking for a career change and hopefully a higher salary. I'm just having trouble making a decision and am falling into a spiral of overthinking.

Basically, I've been trying to apply for roles within a ""dream"" industry I currently want to pivot my career to. These positions are few and far between, so I was pleasantly surprised when I got an interview for one and the employer seemed to like me - even accepted my salary expectations off the bat. Was promised to have a second one scheduled in, but I haven't heard back in two days. 

In the meantime, an employer from my current field took an interest in my experience and wanted to interview me. They seemed to like me too, and have since progressed me to the third round of interviews, while I'm still waiting on the first employer (and frankly, my first choice) to get back to me. (Both are also willing to pay higher than my current job atm, and both are remote - which is great since that means I can better balance both work and my passion projects.)

My dilemma is that I really want that first job and am holding our hope that I'll hear back soon. However, the second employer seems to be moving pretty quickly with me. The thing is is that im not that excited at all for this second role, as it's the same sort of thing I've been doing for years and I feel like my career won't ""evolve"" in any way if I settle for it. But also - it's a job, and there are perks: its highly flexible, the option to work fully remotely, the work is something I've been doing forever so it's familiar (and easy ig?), and I get along really well with the people. 

Even if the first employer never gets back to me, should I continue to look for jobs in my ""dream"" sector (though there are less opportunities on the job market) and forget about the second one? Or should I just continue pursuing this second employer given how they're offering a great company culture, high flexibility, and high pay, even if the job itself feels like a ""dead end"" to me? Which will matter more in the long run? 


TL;DR: I'm stuck between continuing to pursue elusive roles in my ""dream"" industry or just settling for a ""boring"" job role that otherwise pays well, is flexible, and has great people.",Any_Intention_3219,1,1.0,1,1729816514,2024-10-25 00:35:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gbhtvo/should_i_settle_for_a_boring_job_that_otherwise/,10,2024

1gbg82x,Needing advice: should I quit or wait it out?,"I’m on my 3rd week at my new job, which is a significant promotion since my last one. The people and opportunities are nice, but I realized I am ill-equipped for the role. 
People look to me for guidance and I could not answer them as they are expecting me to be the expert. For context, my previous work was with foreign markets, but now I was moved locally where tbh I do not have much knowledge of. I am only around 30% qualified in terms of technical skills, and I lack leadership experience. I was actually rejected for this role because they thought I was too junior, but eventually they called me again to offer.

I am also starting to have doubts because I feel like the culture isn’t for me. It’s very fast-paced and experimental, and you are on your own. I worked at a place like this before, and I developed extreme anxiety because of this. I realized I wanted a routine and to be able to control my time. My boss discussed the expectations, which I know I could do, pero deep inside I know I would be unhappy and dread it. I dread waking up everyday.

I had no significant problems with my last job (I was there for 3 years), I just tried applying as a friend invited me. I took this job because of the significant increase in pay and benefits, and I thought I needed this change for me to grow. I’m satisfied with my old job, but I just wanted to see what else was out there. But now I’m thinking, maybe I made a mistake.

I realized that I want a technical role and being an individual contributor, which also suits me as an introvert. I was stressed with the timesheet setup in my old work, but here I realized we need to go over 8 hours to get anything done because there are a lot of meetings. I struggle with this so much, even I am expected to meet with others regularly. Then there’s dread dealing with the government again, which I thought I have outgrown, but apparently not.

I’m starting to get anxiety and bad feelings all over. I vomit due to stress every morning, and I could not eat no matter how hungry I am. I don’t see my future in this kind of setup. I tried sharing how I felt to my boss, and she says I need to give it time. I know there is this aspect, but I am observing others and it’s really common to work overtime. Like people care too much about the company. 😩 I just want to do my 8 hours and not think about work after and during weekends. My mental health is just declining everyday.

If you’ve been in this kind of situation, I would appreciate hearing your thoughts. I’m thinking of resigning asap and just resting to work on my mental health (I could afford to do so in the next few months).

1gbg0wc,The Ethical Implications of PIPs as a Termination Strategy,"In today’s competitive business environment, organizations often implement cost-cutting measures, including the contentious use of Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs). While PIPs are designed to enhance employee performance, they can also be misused to target high-performing employees for dismissal, raising significant ethical concerns.

**Deception and Manipulation**

One troubling aspect of PIPs is the potential for deception. When organizations assign employees to roles misaligned with their skills or experiences, it sets them up for failure. This manipulation erodes trust and can lead to a toxic work atmosphere. Employees who suspect that PIPs are a strategy for elimination may disengage, affecting overall performance.

**Violation of Psychological Safety**

The fear of being unjustly targeted through a PIP can threaten psychological safety in the workplace. Employees who worry about humiliation or unfair treatment may suffer increased anxiety, leading to lower morale and productivity. A culture rooted in fear and uncertainty stifles creativity and collaboration, ultimately hampering organizational performance.

**Damage to Organizational Reputation**

Companies that employ unethical PIP strategies risk tarnishing their reputations as ethical employers. This damage can have lasting repercussions, complicating efforts to attract and retain top talent. In a climate where workplace culture significantly influences job satisfaction, organizations must be conscious of their practices' perceptions in the job market.

**A More Humane Approach**

To address these ethical issues, organizations should consider adopting a more transparent and humane approach:

**Open Communication:** Establishing clear lines of communication regarding financial constraints and potential layoffs fosters trust among employees. Transparent discussions about the organizational situation can build understanding and acceptance.

**Respectful Treatment:** Employees deserve respect in conversations about their status. Rather than relying on PIPs, organizations should embrace direct discussions regarding performance and possible severance packages.

**Prioritizing Employee Well-Being:** A supportive work environment is crucial. Prioritizing psychological safety enables employees to thrive, feeling valued and secure in their roles.

**Additional Considerations**

While PIPs may adhere to legal standards, fairness in their implementation is crucial. Organizations must also reflect on the long-term implications of their practices, as unethical strategies can adversely affect morale and the ability to attract top talent. Exploring alternative cost-cutting methods, like trimming non-essential expenses, renegotiating contracts, or implementing systemic efficiencies, can yield better solutions without singling out individuals.

**Conclusion**

By embracing a more ethical approach, organizations can safeguard their reputations and strengthen relationships with employees. Focusing on open communication, respectful treatment, and employee well-being fosters a healthier work environment beneficial to both the organization and its workforce. In navigating complex workplace dynamics, ethical practices enhance employee loyalty and contribute to sustainable success.

1gbdemn,Thinking of changing jobs,"Hello! As the title says, I'm thinking of applying different for jobs. For context I work in the public sector and my current job is nice. I work from home most of the time, my workload isn't too much (actually it's not enough to be honest), i never work more than 40hrs a week, pay is pretty decent and my leadership is great. Everything is very flexible there too which is good because my wife and I just got a puppy. 

However if I'm being honest my job is just not fulfilling. I never dreamt of being the kind of person who sits behind a desk all day. 

There are some jobs opening up in my city that I'm likely qualified for that I may want to apply for. However, my wife also just got a new job where she is working about 55+ hours a week. On top of that we recently got a puppy which we can't just leave at home all of the time. 

I feel conflicted because on one hand my current job is nice and I am grateful that it is stress free. It allows me to stay at home, take care of the dog and be pretty low anxiety. But it's boring and it's feels pointless most days. At the same time, I don't want my current job to know I'm hunting around for a different job because it may come off wrong to my higherups.

1gbdckt,Found out I am under investigation by legal under exaggerated false accusations ,"TL;DR: I’m a junior officer in a large organization and was recently reported to legal over claims that I grossly breached the code of conduct on social media by misrepresenting my role and inflating my position to attend an event I was not authorised to attend. 

Hello everyone, I’m in a difficult spot at work and could really use some advice on navigating this situation.

I’m a junior officer working in a large international organization. Recently, I was informed that I’m under investigation by our legal office due to what I believe are exaggerated and false accusations. A colleague reported me for allegedly misrepresenting my job title on LinkedIn and attending a public event without proper internal approval.

For context, I listed my role as “Business Management” to describe my field without disclosing specifics - as we are told to do in my work setting, and I work under this field directly as well. The intent wasn’t to misrepresent myself, but to provide a broad description that matched my responsibilities. As for the public event, I was invited by my alma mater to speak about my career journey as an alumni success story. I didn’t share any sensitive or internal information—my focus was on encouraging students to consider internships at our organization, which I’ve done before with full support by HR. My mistake here was only that I did not consider to report this “representation” to our legal or comms office beforehand, only because I was going there more as a alumni student, not my organization’s employee. 

The accusations suggest that I misrepresented my seniority and engaged in unauthorized activities. While I understand there are rules, I genuinely did not think to report this as an internal obligation since it was related to my university and not directly tied to my current job. I immediately updated my LinkedIn title to just say “temp” and reached out to event organizers to correct any misinterpret-able material they posted once I became aware of the concerns through my manager. 

To add some background, I’ve faced a few other issues in this workplace. I’m young and relatively new, but I’ve been proactive in trying to improve inefficiencies in a team that hasn’t changed much in nearly a decade. This has led to resistance from colleagues who are more comfortable with the status quo. I’ve also experienced dismissive behavior and indirect comments about my qualifications and identity (as an LGBTQ+ individual), which haven’t been addressed by leadership.

Despite these challenges, I’ve maintained positive relationships with senior figures and HR, and I’ve never faced disciplinary issues until now. I can’t help but feel that this legal report is a calculated move to undermine me rather than a genuine concern for internal policy breaches.

My question is: How should I approach this situation? My manager has listened to my side of things, asked me to recide code of conduct and said he will handle it with legal as he believes it is an over interpretation. Do I wait for updates on his side? Or consider speaking directly with some higher-ups to clarify my side, or is there a more strategic way to handle this without escalating tensions? I want to rebuild trust and confidence in a team where I’m clearly facing resistance, but I’m unsure of the best path forward. I already feel super isolated and bullied in this environment for months and this is making me extremely nervous. I have 2 months left on my contract. This is the last thing I need. What do I do?

1gbcinm,Torn between current job and offer that’s due tomorrow - help me decide ?,"Hi, for starters, I never thought I’d say receiving a job offer would stress me out this much but here we are. 

Background: I work for a tech company in customer support. My primary background is in communications, journalism, and copywriting. A mutual friend helped me get this job. 
Here’s a breakdown: 

-4 days WFH, 1 day in office (30 min away).
- $25/hr ($52,000 a year) 
- Great culture and fun activities 
- I recently started writing copy for our marketing team on the side. ***IDEALLY, I hope to move into there if/when there’s an opening. 
- BUT… my specific manager micromanages me. A minor mistake I made gave me a “final strike corrective action,” where I have no disciplinary history and haven’t really made any other major mistakes. 
- I’ve been here for 10 months. 

The new job I was offered: 
- in office all week (35 min away) 
-$55,000 a year 
- benefits all paid for (insurance is not taken out of your check 
- creating content and newsletters, more of my field 
- BUT…. I have some other responsibilities that lead me to think I may be working 50-60 hours a week sometimes. Also, my company’s leader is very old with some very….old school ideas on certain things if know you what I mean. I do not align with them very well socially or politically. I will say that much. 


I’m not sure what to do because I feel like my current job is in the air and moving to marketing is not guaranteed, but I’m not sure how happy I will be at my new job, other than having guaranteed employment. Thinking about leaving makes me very sad, I just felt forced when I sent out all of my apps a couple of weeks ago. 

For anyone who’s been here, help me decide? I am beside myself . Should I hustle where I am and put faith into the process or should I jump now and try something I know though I’m not feeling 100 about it?

1gbbpmr,Should I switch jobs after only being there for 2 months?,"To make a long story short, I’ve had horrible luck with jobs after I graduated college. I graduated with an environmental science degree and I found a job that was in Environmental Health and Safety. I moved an hour away to work at a job that ended up being awful. My manager wanted me gone, HR was like an unleashed rabies dog, and if you were a few seconds late clocking in and out you’d be written up. The job also had no environmental aspect at all, only safety. 
I left that job and got a job at Amazon that was also EHS. I need to preface that the interviewers said “there will be environmental work”. After my 2 weeks of training, I talk to the GM of my position and he tells me straight up there is no environmental, only safety AGAIN. 
That leads us up to now. I just got a call for an interview for an actual environmental science position for the city I live in, but I’m worried this is going to happen again or I’m going to hate it like I do my job now. What should I do? I’m conflicted on if I should take it and leave Amazon or should I stay at Amazon (I have a sign on bonus for 2 years) and wait for environmental position to open. I would be getting a pay cut regardless if I switched to environmental.

1gbbke8, How to Consistently Apply for Jobs While Working Full-Time? Looking for Advice on Landing UK Visa Sponsorship,"Hi everyone,

I’m an engineer with experience in cloud computing, API development, and DevOps, and I’m hoping to relocate to the UK through a job with visa sponsorship. However, balancing a full-time job while actively applying for positions has been tough, and I’m looking for some advice on how to handle this process more efficiently.

For anyone who has been in a similar situation, I’d love to know:

1. **How did you manage to apply for jobs consistently while working full-time?** Any tips on staying organized and keeping up with applications without feeling overwhelmed? How did you stay on top of it while managing your current responsibilities?
2. **What strategies helped you land interviews for jobs that offer visa sponsorship?** Did you rely on certain job boards, recruiters, or other methods? Any advice on how to find companies willing to sponsor international candidates?
3. **When and how did you bring up the visa sponsorship?** I’m not sure whether to mention it upfront in the application or wait until later in the interview process. How did you navigate this without scaring off potential employers?
4. **Any unconventional tips for getting noticed by employers?** Whether it’s networking, cold emailing, or other creative approaches, I’d love to hear how you managed to stand out and secure interviews.
5. **For those in tech, any advice on how to showcase my skills effectively?** I’m experienced in cloud computing and API development, but I’m wondering what might help me stand out more in a competitive market.

If anyone has gone through something similar, your advice would be super helpful! I’m especially looking for practical ways to streamline the job hunt while still working full-time and how to increase my chances of landing visa sponsorship.

1gbbcan,Forced to relocate (uk),"Hi just wondering where I stand. I’m an electrician that was employed to only do inspection and testing after 11 years they are out sourcing my role and putting me into maintenance which I do not have much experience me, I will also have to do standby rota. There is 4 testing electricians like myself in different areas / depths. 

However they are opening a new depot and I was chosen from mine as I live closer. I have said I did not want to move and it is causing me stress. The other testing electrician arnt being moved. And two of them don’t have to do standby as there depots have agreed to cover due to age. 

I sent numerous emails to my manager saying how I’m happy to go into maitnence however unlike the others who don’t have to move in stressing about being moved to a new teams whilst transitioning into a new role. 

 I was up worrying for months and led to burn out and had 3 weeks on sick due to stress. My manager reached out to contact him about it for support so I said I would talk to him after a meeting we had arranged a few days on that week. He never showed up as busy, I waited a week then emailed him to check in saying I was still stressed about being relocated. He said he was on holiday but would happy to put some time in his dairy which I agreed. I never heard anything back.

In meantime I contacted Union who advised to contact hr. They were very cold when I spoke but said they would speak to my manager, I waited 4 weeks then txt the guy from hr to see if any conversations took place as I had no contact and they never replied as it’s been another 3 weeks.

I’m still meant to be moved. Through out the company there is lots of ppl living closer to different areas and far away. There is 3 ppl who live within the area but never got chosen. 

I’m stuck on what to do. There is a clause in my contract that says I can be retrained and relocated however I feel it hasn’t been done fairly. 

Someone has left my depot where I want to work but my gaffa said I may live to far away now even tho I’ve worked there 11 years. I was hoping to go back. My manager said it would be an option at the time of being forced to relocate as the reason I got moved is they were downsizing depots. 

Is there anything else I can do apart from leaving. I previously loved working there and would just be happy staying in my own area. 

All advice is much appreacited.

Thanks. ",allornothing63,1,1.0,1,1729798715,2024-10-24 19:38:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gbbcan/forced_to_relocate_uk/,10,2024

1gb9uda,Should I go back to school/next career steps,"First a little back story; I’m a 26 year old male, currently in the metro Detroit Michigan area. I spent a lot of time bucking the system so to speak and spent a lot of time hopping from sales job to sales job until I found one I really liked, paid well and I was able to teach all the new people coming in. Covid came around and our sales department got laid off, I went and worked at whatever job would take me and ended up as a GM at a pizza shop for the last few years. I went and got my associates degree while I was doing that. My fiance went back to grad school to become a therapist so I’ve been working a lot to make sure all the bills are kept up and we can minimize debt. Her program is coming to an end in 6 months or so and we will be looking to get married and move to a warmer climate, likely Alabama from what we are thinking. Until she is done with her program I’m kind of stuck doing what I need to do, but I’m free to figure out what’s next as far as starting a career. I was always successful in sales, and it was fun but ultimately lacks any structure for growth in most companies until a sales manager quits which has always left me outgrowing my bowl. My other option would be to go back to school and finish my undergrad, which even after our down payment on a house we can fund with cash, in order to try to do some internships and try to be competitive for a “real job” after getting a higher level degree, most likely in Business Stats or MIS at U Alabama. I also want to say while I know a degree doesn’t land you a cushy job, but I am mainly just looking to help open some doors to prove my self in a more substantial way professionally speaking. So I guess the question is do I go back into sales and just try to enjoy where I’m at, or go back to school and try to land some competitive internships and stuff?",YoureSourDough,1,1.0,0,1729794939,2024-10-24 18:35:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gb9uda/should_i_go_back_to_schoolnext_career_steps/,10,2024

I had a string of interviews earlier this month that resulted in an offer, but for one of the jobs that I didn’t meet all criteria for.

I want to get into a new career role and I’m willing to go to school but I just don’t know what I want to do with my life. 

In high school I wanted to be an accountant and I started to go to school for it but I left and I have decided that that’s not something I want to do with my life anymore. I’m great with numbers but that feels like it would be the same thing daily and I’m trying to get away from that. 

I am great talking to people over the phone and excel at customer service in that way but in person communication is something that I struggle with. I have little to no skills in any other field but I’m a fast learner and pick up on most things fairly easily but I want to start on a career that I will enjoy. I’m not worried about the money that it will pay to be honest but if I have to go to school then I need to justify the tuition. 

Ive looked into so many different fields but I don’t know about any of them. Any recommendations on jobs that you’ve worked or know of anything that isn’t customer facing that I could enjoy? IT jobs that I can learn everything I would need to know in school with no previous experience?

1gb91jr,co worker sleeping at work,"Hi,

I am writing as I need some advice. I consistently (daily) catch my coworker asleep at his desk and I was getting annoyed. 

The other day I had enough, maybe I had woken up on the wrong side of the bed. I’m not sure. I took a photo of him asleep whilst on the clock (was only him in the photo and his office) and sent it to my manager asking him for the 100th time to do something about it.

He brought it up with our HR team who were more concerned about who took it and the Information Governance breach. 

Can I get disciplined for taking the photo and sending it to my manager? Will she get disciplined for me sending it to her?

Any advice would be appreciated. ",Proof_Pause9532,0,0.30000001192092896,24,1729792926,2024-10-24 18:02:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gb91jr/co_worker_sleeping_at_work/,10,2024
1gb90hk,I feel like no one at my current job takes me seriously,"Sorry guys, I want to vent so it might be a long post

I'm working in cyber, and and I'm not quite sure if I'm utterly dumb or I just give that impression for some reason. I'm a woman btw if that matters.

I have experience work in cyber, and more specifically governance, so I'm not a very technical person but of I course I do understand security stuff. Like, I don't know how to configure a firewall, but I know what it is, it's importance and important rules and possible risks/vulnerabilities associated with it. In my previous jobs (larger organizations) I usually had the issue of people assuming I knew more than I actually knew, so I was usually in a constant feeling of anxiety trying to learn everything I could so I wouldn't embarrass myself haha

However, since I started working with consulting in a very small company, I feel like things have switched. I feel like my bosses and most coworkers actually underestimate me for some reason. I know I do a good job, I receive good feedbacks all the time from my clients (even those who are hardly impressed!), I know I do a good job but still it seems like no one really acknowledges it. For example, obviously I know what ISO 27001 is, I've used this norm before, and I use it now with the clients. The other day a colleague started teaching me about it, the differences from the 2022 version from the 2013 one, it's importance, etc, like I was an intern. There were multiple instances of them thinking I didn't understood simple technical stuff, like when the company's owner was talking to another analyst in a meeting about a AV agent update and apologized for talking about technical stuff because he thought I was totally lost. It was about a simple update, just that and apparently it looks like I'm too dumb to understand even that.

Today, one of my bosses called me (and my colleague) to tell us what to do if a client showed an interest in implementing a new plataform, like this was our first day on a job ever. And it's crazy because I've dealt with this before, this specific boss knows because I showed him when it happened for a client, I helped other clients to choose between different security platforms so they could make am informed choice, and suddenly it seems like I never did any of it.

I would say that sexism could be playing a part here, since all but one of my coworkers are man, but the person who decided to teach me about ISO was the other woman! I'm trying my best to do a good job on a place where everyone is used to do just the bare minimum, and yet its going unnoticed. Worse even. I went from being a person where everyone expected a lot from to someone people has close to 0 expectations it seems. And yet, I have to do senior work all by myself and I'm not a senior. 

Anyway, I'm sorry for the loooong post, I just want to vent, I'm feeling incredibly frustrated and sad. I really don't know what I'm doing wrong, or not doing at all, to make people think I know nothing, even when my experience tells otherwise.",ilus3n,4,1.0,9,1729792859,2024-10-24 18:00:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gb90hk/i_feel_like_no_one_at_my_current_job_takes_me/,10,2024
1gb8nyn,legal career advice,"Hi all! I'm seeking advice on finding my first entry-level position in the legal field. I'm open to legal admin assistant and file clerk jobs, as these seem easier to get my foot in the door and potentially work up to a paralegal position.  
  
I'm in my final year of college and have completed a paralegal certificate (from CLS Barbri; not ABA accredited, so I wonder if it's even helpful.) I also have a job doing legal research for a criminal justice reform podcast, but that's currently the only relevant experience on my resume. My paralegal cert and legal research job for a podcast don't seem to add much to my resume. Should I wait until after graduation to resume my job search, or is there any hope before then? Are there any other certifications/strategies that could improve my chances of finding a job before I graduate?  
  
I've only applied for 10 positions so far, starting at the beginning of September. I received two interviews at the very beginning of my job search. The first led to an offer that I declined (I looked at reviews after the fact and realized the work culture was transparently toxic based on reviews and anecdotes from one of the lead attorneys who interviewed me). After I declined that position, they replied that I was such a strong candidate that I should let them know if I changed my mind. However, I don't see myself doing so because it doesn't seem worth it.  
  
Maybe enduring a toxic work culture for a year or two is the trade-off to get my foot in the door, though? I'm aware that most positions want a candidate with experience and/or a degree. However, the fact that I received one offer so far leads me to believe it's possible to land another eventually. I generally interview well, but scoring an interview has been the challenging part so far. I haven't received any follow-ups on 8/10 of my applications so far, which feels discouraging.  
  
I've considered obtaining a Notary Public License, thinking that might be a decent option to strengthen my resume. Do you have any other ideas (certs/licenses, etc.?) to build my resume or advice on getting my foot in the door at a legal office job? I'm in NYC if that helps. Any advice is welcome.

1gb8j0i,"Anticipating a job offer, should I accept?","So here is my situation. I'm a 30yo(F) who has been a Medical Assistant for the past 6 years. I make $23.50/hour. I still love the job, but the low wages have really pushed me to do something else and I feel as though there is no other way for me to make a higher wage unless I do something drastically different ie; office management, nursing, x-ray tech etc. I'm also embarrassed to be 30yo and only making $23.50.

Anyways, I could never decide on what to do so to play it safe, I started taking online classes 2 years ago. Over all this time I could never commit to anything else and these classes were easy and convenient so I just kept taking classes and now I will graduate with an AS Degree in Healthcare Information in December 2024.

After lurking on reddit about how it is a great idea to apply to jobs in your final semester of school I decided I would go ahead and start putting my resume out there. I have applied to 7 jobs, 2 have been for medical coding and 5 have been for medical billing-type jobs. 6 have passed me up without even wanting an interview and 1 is very interested in me. I really think that I am going to get an offer. Except, now that not being an MA is a real thing, I'm not sure I want to make the change.

I don't really have any interest in coding, it's very boring to me. And now my thought is that maybe I should just stay an MA but switch specialties to get more skills and exposure. I have been wanting to try Urgent Care for a while now, but once again just never bringing myself to go and do it. So now I'm thinking maybe I try for an Urgent Care position somewhere and after I complete my degree take a year off (just focusing on being an MA) and then decide...do I really want a BS in Healthcare Admin? or maybe I should see if my credits will transfer to something like X-ray tech? I'm just super lost. And I don't want to waste more time/money because I already feel like I have wasted a lot of time/money to still make a low wage and be directionless.

The job that I am anticipated to be offered is to be a Medical Billing/AR Specialist for a multi-location Orthopedic Clinic that also owns multiple of their own surgery centers. It's a prominent company around here so I have heard that it would be good to work for them. The position is also hybrid-remote, and after 90-days on site, I can work 4x10s, 2 days at home and 2 days at the office which is appealing to me. But, pay-wise I may not be making any progress. I am under the impression that the pay range for the position is $18-$24/hour DOE. I have no idea what they would offer me, given my experience/education.

I would really appreciate advice on what I should do if I am offered this position? Would accepting this position be a good move because in the future it would open up other jobs with higher pay? I don't know what other questions to ask, but please help!",Pixy531,1,1.0,0,1729791661,2024-10-24 17:41:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gb8j0i/anticipating_a_job_offer_should_i_accept/,10,2024
1gb8c25,How Do I Politely Request Back Pay?,"I’m looking for advice on how to handle a pay discrepancy issue at my job. I was originally hired as a general education paraprofessional, but for quite some time now, I’ve been working as a Level C SPED paraprofessional, which comes with a higher pay rate. Last year, I was told that my position would be officially updated to reflect this change, but as it was late in the school year, I wasn’t too concerned when nothing changed right away.

Over the summer, while working summer school, my pay was adjusted to a slightly higher rate and my title was listed as a Level C SPED para on my pay stubs, so I assumed the issue had been resolved. However, when I returned in August for the regular school year, I noticed that I was once again listed as a general education para in the employee directory. I met with my supervisor in person, and he assured me that it would be sorted out, though he said it might take a few pay periods. 

After three (bi-weekly) pay periods with no changes, I followed up with a text, and he again said he would take care of it. A few more weeks passed, and when nothing changed, I emailed him to bring it up again. He responded that my information should be updated, but he’d double-check. Since then, I haven’t heard back, and my pay stubs still reflect the general education position.

Given that I’ve followed up multiple times and my supervisor has a tendency to forget about these things, I’m considering reaching out to his supervisor next. 

My question to all of you, though, is: how can I request back pay for the months I’ve been working in this higher-paying role, but without sounding confrontational? What’s the most polite way to say, “Hey, you know all of the money you were SUPPOSED to be paying me over these last few months?

1gb7kyz,To stay or to leave? And how do I do it???,"I work as a program manager for a tech company (but tbh... it's more of a product operations + customer experience + strategy/planning role). I am grateful for the generous compensation of the company and the growth I've experienced over the past couple of years.

However, over the past year, I have had this inkling to leave. There have been numerous company changes (and questionable decisions) that have made the job a lot less tolerable. I have also been involved in strategy plannings which exposed me to how leadership functions and how decisions are made. 

So far, here are the things pushing me to start applying elsewhere:

1. several batches of mass layoffs with no plan to replace the headcount but still expecting the same level of efficiency
2. ""rushing"" to keep up with AI but not necessarily having the resources/developer capacity to actually build things which will support how operations is doing things (technology teams seem so detached from operations so the features being released often makes it harder for operations)
3. incompetent employees are not sanctioned by leadership/HR and others (including myself) have to take over their tasks
4. leadership always wanting ""unstructured"" meetings which end up always being a waste of time
5. no clear sign of a promotion anytime soon

The things actually keeping me in the company:

1. compensation is actually good (above market value)
2. my direct manager actually has my back

  
That said, should I leave or should I stay? 

* I'm scared I won't find a job that pays as much as this. I'm sort of okay with a paycut but how do i tell the company iw ill apply for that i'm okay with a paycut?
* Am I just too attached to my work? How do I care less without lowering my performance evaluation?

1gb5rh5,How long should I keep my shitty subcontractor job?,"So, I am an industrial design engineer from the south of Spain, and as you may or may not know, good salaries and industry are not spain’s big thing, even more in the south.

I started working as an intern in a small firm from my city that designed and manufactured bespoke point of sale and trade marketing items for the main spirits brands. Stayed there for two years after internship, one as a production engineer (supervising delivery of productions and projects in time cost and quality and in charge of teams of temporary workers) and one year after, as a designer (making renders, cad models, prototypes etc).

After two years my salary was 18k gross per year and senior designers at my firm didn’t have better salaries so I started looking to improve my salary elsewhere. 

Found a refrigeration business which is very big in Spain and the world in general and went there to work as a design engineer for the American market for 28k gross per year. It was in a city two hours from home so I rented for 6 months in a near village and went weekends and Wednesday home to my city to see my girlfriend. 

After six months I didn’t like to live in a village and not see my girlfriend and family and friends and started taking the train and car two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening so I didn’t have to live far from home and pay rent. The expenses were kind of the same between renting and taking the train.

Two months later I got an invitation to work at an engineering subcontractor for an areospace company as a manufacturing engineer for 23k gross year in my home city. 

It would mean earning a little less but working 7:30am to 15:30pm and being able to do whatever I wanted in the afternoons, also I would go back to living with my family so o would get almost the same net pay taking into account gas and train tickets etc.

I accepted and now have worked in the subcontractor engineering firm as a manufacturing engineer for 6 months but I fucking hate my job. I has 0 creativity, it’s always the same and it’s not difficult or rewarding or challenging. 

I go to work, do the bare minimum for 8 hours and go home to live my life, but I have never been less proud or happy or accomplished at my job. The thing is, I don’t have stress, my bosses are good enough and I don’t get any micromanagement or abuse or nothing bad but I can’t help to find my jobs exasperating.

The firm I am now at is Alten and its famous for being a shitty place to work for, so I am not very interested in pursuing a career inside this company either because I hate what my bosses do selling exploited engineers to clients who want cheap labor, so I do not have too much  reasons to work hard, also the boss who is in charge to get people promotions and stuff is never in the client with us so he would not see it if I worked a lot. 

Given I have changed jobs three times in three years, and I’m also pursuing a manufacturing masters degree during the afternoons, how much do you think I should keep this job? I was think a couple of years so it doesn’t look in my resume like I can’t keep a job, but I don’t know if I can stay that long without boring myself to death.",Firm-Bother-8379,1,1.0,0,1729784734,2024-10-24 15:45:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gb5rh5/how_long_should_i_keep_my_shitty_subcontractor_job/,10,2024

* **PMO at a Startup (Valencia):**
   * Broader exposure across departments (management, operations)
   * Less stability, but more growth potential

The start-up in Valencia is offering slightly more than Glovo in Barcelona. 

I have **1 year of experience**, and my long-term goal is **entrepreneurship**. The PMO role seems more beneficial for that path, offering more opportunities for learning and growth.

I am a waitress and have been for 6 years ( I waitressed in college to make some extra cash) I graduated with criminal justice degree and worked for a non profit for about a year. Due to toxic work environment and lack of support/ communication I decided it was my time to leave. This was back in 2022. It was definitely the right move for me and I was honestly making more waitressing. Fast forward to now I work as a waitress and beauty advisor at Sephora working 5-6 days a week. ( I do love working at Sephora!) but It’s truthfully becoming exhausting working both jobs. 

I enrolled back into school at a university in Philadelphia and was in a Retail & Merchandising program with a focus in marketing. I completed a semester and I loved more of the marketing, PR, advertising side of compared to the merchandising aspect. I even had the chance to work with Burlington as a buyer shadow for their HQ in NYC. It was amazing.. Anyways I really wanted to be sure of my decision of going back to school because it is so costly. I deferred a semester with the intention to return once I figure out which career would be the most beneficial and stable. To my point..

1gb4w75,"Self doubt...Career transition from DA to PM?
","If you were to name the top 3-5 most important traits, personalities, or skills (both soft and hard) required to become a PM, what advice would you give someone who's on the fence about making the leap and committing a few months to study for this transition?

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm a 32-year-old based in Toronto, Canada, and I started my journey in tech three years ago as a data analyst.

About a year ago, I was laid off, and since then, finding new opportunities has been challenging. There were a few interviews where I made it to the final round, but in the end, I was rejected.

During this time, I’ve done a lot of self-reflection—thinking about what I truly want to do, what I’m good at, and which path I should pursue. I’ve realized how important it is to understand myself when choosing a career, given that work occupies such a large portion of our lives. While I’ve been trying to figure out what I enjoy and what I don’t, it’s still hard for me to confidently say, “Yes, I know exactly what I want.” I’ve found that while I don’t mind doing most jobs, the key difference is how easily I can absorb new knowledge and whether I’m genuinely interested in dedicating time to learning something new. One thing I’ve learned is that I don't particularly enjoy and sometimes get bored working with Python or SQL.

Recently, I’ve started to question my skills as a data analyst. I sometimes imagine others can effortlessly look at dashboards or data and immediately know how to analyze a report from scratch and draw insights. While I understand this comes with experience and practice, my self-doubt has led me to wonder whether I’m truly suited for analytics.

On the other hand, my partner is a product manager (PM), and through observing their work and doing my own research, I’ve come to enjoy many of the day-to-day responsibilities of a PM. I feel like I might actually do better in, and enjoy, a PM role more than my current work in analytics—despite not having worked as a PM yet, this is what I’ve observed.

I know I’m good at communicating with stakeholders—raising my voice when necessary while ensuring everyone’s opinions are heard. My background in data analytics has also given me skills in building dashboards and using SQL. Through my experience working with PMs and executives, I’ve learned how to break down problems into actionable steps, think from a product perspective, and create roadmaps. However, I’m not sure if these are the right skills to at least get me part of the way toward becoming a PM.

So, back to my question --

What are the essential skills and traits that are most evaluated during a PM interview? Or, if you have any other general advice, it would be greatly appreciated!",DinnerDesperate1976,1,1.0,0,1729782543,2024-10-24 15:09:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gb4w75/self_doubtcareer_transition_from_da_to_pm/,10,2024
1gb4v1c,Career Advice for EE to Coding/Programming,"I feel like a lot of new career advice is for people with no knowledge in programming. My question is, since I have an electrical engineering degree, what's the best approach to transitioning to software engineering of some kind, especially at 42 years old. Data Engineer is another possible role too.

I have a degree in electrical engineering. During school I programmed microchips, learned Assembly, C and Java. I loved programming, the thought process is natural to me. I regret not getting into the industry because it's something I really enjoy.

I've been out of school for 17 years, and can't do my day job anymore which is unrelated to programming. I've looked up some Python tutorials online, and it's like I never forgot how to program. Sure, I needed to learn syntax, but I've found out the stuff I learned in school is still in my brain. I even improved the code of some tutorials I've followed online which gave me an extra boost in confidence.

By no means have I mastered Python, and I've been away from C and Java so long I have vague memories of syntax (and nightmares when I learned Pointers in school). What hope do I have given my background?

1gb4fvw,I've destroyed my career,"Hey, so I am in my early 30s and have destroyed my professional career and don't know how to climb out of it.

I don't know how to frame my resume. I'm just not really sure if I should like pretend I've never worked before and don't have a college degree and start from scratch. Or if maybe I just need to be patient? Honesty just really ashamed of myself too.


Background:
My degree is in political science. During college I did sales associate, waitressing, front desk associate, and substitute teaching, etc. 

First ""professional"" job out of college, I worked for state government and did well but it was a super intense role and it was going to be a while to move up, pay was bad, night shift, etc. Worked there 2 years and I left with a 2 week notice and became a teacher at a public middle school.

I did well as a teacher, struggled with normal things, but did okay. Someone close to me died during the first month of my second year teaching and I just lost it. This is where I fucked up and continue to fuck up. I couldn't grieve and teach teenagers so I quit that winter break with a notice. 

I started at a law firm and worked there 6 months. It was an insane case load and there was not a paralegal on my team to convert our cases to litigation and I was swamped as the pre-suit case manager. I then found out a male assistant was making $10k more than myself and other female case managers and I quit. I put in a two weeks but left like 5 days early bc of dumb drama I just did not want to deal with.

I had to take out retirement and was unemployed for a bit and got hired at this remote job that was really competitive and I actually realized after the fact that I had made my metrics but I got really down on myself bc this private sector competitive job was just like so crazy and I like got down on myself and just gave up and got fired after 3 or 4 months there. 

I was unemployed for like a year at this point. I ended up doing some online odd jobs, such as Onlyfans. It was discreet and kind of successful but now I wonder if the taxes somehow show on my background checks? 

Anyways, I started at state government again and worked there almost a year. Honestly, I didn't find them to be following  their policies (statute) and when I inquired about it, I think the trainers felt I was being difficult. I feel like this ended up in one trainer bullying me. She would yell at me, refuse to answer questions, belittle me, and say just cruel things to me. I tried to bring this up on a few occassions to management and nothing was done. She controlled my metrics and they put her office right next to mine and it was just really stressful and intimidating and I put in my 2 weeks and they ""discharged"" me the next day. There was also just other drama but my manager also was just weird and always on my case abt being more extroverted and outgoing. It was also an integrity thing for me too bc of their iffy policies and they really seemed to push off work and it was gross to me due to the people we were serving. Tbh I did feel like most people there were incompetent.

So now I'm pretty much blacklisted from state government with my political science degree. I've had a handful of great interviews with new state jobs and I've explained some of what happened but as soon as they see whatever is in my file, they drop me. I even had fingerprinting done and they just dropped me.

Anyways

Idk what to do. I've been unemployed for 3 months now and I am so angry and hurt by my last employer and i'm still grieving and I feel like a failure and don't know what to do, if I should pivot, or just keep trying. 

State jobs seem to be out of the question now unfortunately and that breaks my heart bc I do have a passion for government work. Remote customer service jobs or any customer service jobs in general keep turning me down. Idk where to go at this point. I think I'm too qualified for CS jobs and now not qualified for what I am qualified to do.

I am looking for something with work life balance bc I struggle with mental health. I also have adhd and am on the autism spectrum. I am looking for something not entirely overwhelming when it comes to being social (which is why I'm a little hesitant for CS positions I just feel like thats my past experience).

In between I helped to establish successful businesses, helped some that was strugling.

It was very demanding and insanely poorly paid. I left it all behind. 

Now I have some months, up to half a year with my savings to decide what I want to do. I live in a smaller city, so there is not so much work around, and I also want to earn money. Here is what I thinking:

1. Get truckers (car haulers) license and leave family for this type of job and save money for couple years to start my own thing.

2. Learn programming and look for remote work. But I don\`t think I could become hirable programmer in that time. Who knows.

3. Learn an extra language, like German or one of the Scandinavian languages. Norwegian would be easiest, because I know basics, but this is a bit of a gamble. As hiring with language skills is hardly priority, because English is so widely spoken.

1gb3295,Deciding between paths 31 M. What would you do?,"So I have a few choices I need to make soon and it’s stressing me out about what to really do. 

So I’m 31 years old, no degree, traveled around the nation for 6 years promoting a career for a partner that left. Spent the last 4 years developing skills as a dog trainer and networking in that world. I have some really great mentors. I’m at a point where I have a few ideas of how I want to move forward with my life to hopefully progress into something I can actually live and create a life for myself. Right now I’m not making much money so my options are 

Move back to where family is and start my own dog training business (states away from my dog training network)

One of my mentors offered to coach me to start my own business where I am currently. Where I’m currently working at his business as a base level employee and living with him. 

Obviously there is risk starting my own business and the work involved as well as being tied down to that location for a long time to develop it. The pros of it is there aren’t high start up costs. Just the opportunity cost of time. High potential earnings for sure sure but also poor work life balance even when up and going decently. 

My other option is to go back to school. The way I’d do this is work seasonal jobs while taking online classes. Many seasonal jobs provide room and board. I’d use the income to take classes and potentially also work up the experience ladder doing the seasonal jobs (national parks, ski resorts, and other seasonal work). So I’d use the degree to push that or to pivot after and work through my degree. A downside about this option is that I’d be kind of tossing the stuff I’ve developed in the dog world such as skills and connections. And a pro is my cost of living would be low and I could enjoy nice areas like hike working on my degree.

1gb2fkl,Leaving a small team in good terms. ,"I work in a key operations role for a very small company. Over the last year, I have not seen the growth I was expecting and my management/operation style has been drifting further and further from the rest of the team. I focus on growth and development while they prioritize just getting through the day. I want to leave on good terms but concerned that my plan might be too generous so I'm looking for feedback. 

I would give notice that I need to be fully out of my current role by 12/31. This gives about 2 months to post, interview, and hire a replacement. Between the holidays, how busy the company is the last weeks of the year, how small the team is, and the wide range of skills the replacement would need, 2 months sounds right and allows for a clean break at year end.

As of 1/1, I would offer to stay on in a support type role for up to an additional two months to help train the replacement and fill in gaps while the replacement settles in. 

I would be VERY surprised (and a little amused)  if they simply say my services are no longer required once I mention my intention of leaving.

1gb23d1,Help us figure out the best path ,"My husband always wanted to be an MD. But has a better chance at making it into D.O school. The unfortunate thing is that he didn’t decide on this career path until he completed 80% of a social studies degree and we were married and own a house. We are trying to decide which option makes the most sense given that I also have a career and we are expecting our first child. 


Go D.O —> get a small apartment in the town of our nearest D.O school with our newborn baby (he can apply this upcoming cycle), and rent out our house for two years with the potential of making 300k+  in 7 or so years after residency. 


GO NP—> keep our house and attend school locally, to end up making a max of only 130k after 7 or so years. 


GO PA —> move to the closest PA school, make a max of 130k after only 5 years. 

Our main issue here is that DO is rewarding in the the long run, but uprooting our new family from a large 4 bedroom house to an apartment in a town with no help for two years, just for residency to beat the crap out of him for 2+ years and not make more than 70k just seems like a lot. Also my career and our child’s schools will have to shift as well.

1gay49y,How to progress my career?,"Hi, I’m 22f from the UK and I’m currently at a standpoint on what to do with my job situation. A bit of background, I left school at 16 and completed an apprenticeship in Finance. Covid hit I then went to more admin type roles because I couldn’t find any finance roles and I needed money. I then trailed off to billing roles, I’m currently a Billing Coordinator for professional services firm, earning £38k. 
My issue is that I don’t see much progression in billing. I’ve come to learn that it’s glorified admin. My aim is to go down a Financial Analyst route, or I’m open to roles that I can progress and make £70k+ at some point, but I have no idea how to make this change without sacrificing the pay. I appreciate this might seem easy to manage but I’m struggling, my family all come from low professions, they aren’t much help and I’m really trying to be the change.

1gaxy17,Should I change to a new job or not?,"Hi, I need your advice here. I am currently talking to one company that needs a QA Engineer, I am in SEA btw if that helps. The current salary I have is low if you compare it to other companies. However, this company I can say is my comfort zone. I started working here Nov 2017, I left on January 2023 and came back December 2023 because the contact on my previous company expired and that time, the projects I was working on allready done. 

My current employer accepted me wholeheartedly, however, the salary stayed the same as before I left. I was earning more than double on my contract job. Actually, I lost the job due to stress and my mental health wasn't really good, until now it's still not good as I am seeing the psychiatrist.



This new company I am talking with is offering me double salary, it is also just 1 station away from my current job so no problem. Now, the problem is that they only provide a 1 year contract, and not sure if it is possible to be a permanent role or what.



I am torn, should I accept this and leave my current employer again? If I leave, there is no turning back. I am lucky they wanted me back last time.

I am just scared that it the new company will be too stressful again, what will I do? I am not in my country, I need work visa and work permit to work legally. So, yea, maybe you can help me decide here.

1gax3uq,Switching to healthcare ,"TL;DR I’m switch career path into Health related field and before I make the jump to start school again, want to know what you find to be the best health career path / job. I feel like it’s so big, so surely I’m missing a few and want to be certain of my choice before I make a life changing choice. 

As the title states, I’ve been in my career for the last decade and while it was fun & great in the beginning it’s almost nonexistent and hard to come by jobs since the pandemic. I’m in the tv/movie world in Hollywood and I’m in a nice niche corner of Post Production. I’m good and my job, it comes easy to me most days and it’s fine but I’ve never wanted this to be long term. I’m in my early 30’s now and have really been feeling the push to start something new. It’s been a thought for years but I’ve never made the leap because, well ya see, I’m not sure WHAT exactly I’d want to do. I know I don’t want to be a nurse & I guess I’ve had it narrowed down to some sort of ultrasound tech or broader rad tech area of study and I’ve spoken to the colleges & university, have enough money saved to put myself through and still pay bills but I can’t help to think I’m missing some magical career in health I’m just not thinking of or haven’t heard about. Ideally (I already have a bachelors degree from a private film school), I’d want to only do an associates + the program itself, I don’t have another 8-10 years in me for college/uni. I’d also love to be bringing home some ballpark of $80,000k + pretty comfortably within the first few years. The hours don’t bother me as I do crazy hours and long days in stressful situations now anyways and moving (in in Los Angeles) actually sounds like a dream, so certainly not opposed to the idea. My main question I guess is, to you, what’s the best health related job that possibly covers those wants? I can’t help but think I’m missing something here, there is SO much in such a large industry.

1gav70x,Is this the right move? ,"I (24M) work in a creative industry and currently make 60k a year in a VHCOL area (SD) with a well known employer. 
I have always felt underpaid for what I do, and have taken on essentially double the responsibility in my role since joining. The other associate on my team makes 15-20k more than I do, and other employees located at other branches in my same role make ~20k more than I do. I’ve received 8 “meet and exceeds” quarterly/annual performance review ratings since joining, yet my request for even a clear path to promotion or raise to match other similar employees has been denied. I have felt undervalued to say the least. That being said, the culture, people, location, work life balance, and my direct team are all amazing, so I’ve stayed.
Enter competitor brand. I was contacted by a recruiter a month ago to interview for a position that was going to be a huge promotion from my current. The company isn’t known for having the best culture, but they’re moving from LA to SD soon and rebuilding the brand, so that could change and there’s a lot of opportunity within and a new CEO. 
Fast forward, I received the job offer. 90k, a great salary and position bump. The only catch is the work-life balance won’t be as great and for the next few months as they move HQ, I have to be in office once a week in LA….making for a long day. 

My current company will not counter. Am I a fool for wanting to stay, or should I take the opportunity, grind through the crap commute for a short time and reap the benefits of a nice promotion?

1gau5y7,How to deal with a new consultant criticizing me to my boss?,"A month ago my (27f) boss of 2 years was replaced by an outside consultant (70sf) as many of our internal roles are being moved to an external marketing agency my company has hired. I was kept on board and now report to my boss's former boss (30sf). On our first meeting, she told me she felt I had been underutilized, was really impressed with what I've contributed in the past, wanted to expand my role, and gave me concrete opportunities to share my ideas for improving our marketing channel. I was really excited about this. 

Within one week one of this transition, my new boss asked me to build a slide deck with some of my improvement ideas. I built mockups, reporting, etc, and presented it to my boss and the new consultant. My boss loved my ideas, was really excited, and told me to proceed with presenting one concept in particular to our internal creative team for development with the consultant included on the meeting. The presentation went well and the creative team loved the idea and wanted to get to work on it ASAP, and asked me to provide a creative brief for the project. 

Today I sent the brief off to the creative team. Less than an hour later, I received an email from the consultant titled ""Creative Brief Feedback."". My new boss was copied. In the email, she tore apart my brief, told me I was leaving out a bunch of other creative directions for different projects I was supposed to include, that I had worded everything wrong, my direction was completely incorrect, I had the wrong KPIs, literally every single thing she had a problem with, paragraph after paragraph tearing it apart. Her feedback was about 3x longer than the brief itself. She wanted me to rename the entire project, add her as a contributor, chewed me out for not including everything I had already covered in the meeting, basically she told me to change everything about it. She even told me I wasn't supposed to tell the creative team to incorporate the singular main element the entire idea centered around because I was supposed to ""let them come up with what they wanted"" and chastised me for pushing the idea so hard. In the last paragraph she said ""I was about to send over the creative brief for this project when I saw you had sent this."" 

Also, when I had the creative meeting prior to sending the brief, the consultant interrupted me after I introduced my idea and told me that we couldn't do what I was proposing (before I even had a chance to present it) because it would cost too much. After the meeting, I asked her for the costs she was referring to. I looked at them and she was incorrect -- my new idea would cost no more than the existing work. It's like she is trying to kill this project for some reason, and it's the first opportunity I've had to actually share my work.

I don't understand why the new consultant is so upset about my contributions and trying to kill my idea, and I'm worried about her making me look bad to my new boss, or taking over my idea/claiming it as her own. I don't even understand what my role is in relation to her - I thought she was an outsourced role and officially I report to my new boss -- so why is she sending my boss and I ""feedback"" on my work? 

Any tips on dealing with someone like this and hopefully hold onto this opportunity I've been given??

1gaqxjo,How to Approach a Difficult Conversation with My Manager and Director?,"Hi Reddit,

I’m in a challenging situation at work and could really use some advice on how to handle an upcoming conversation with my manager and our director.

A bit of context: My manager was a coworker before I joined his team as a developer, and we were friends through work. A few weeks ago, during a discussion with another senior developer, I expressed my disagreement with my manager regarding a design pattern he wants to standardize across all projects in our area. This led to a tense 1:1 meeting later that day, where he was visibly upset. He stated he wouldn’t advocate for my perspective and even suggested that if I continued to challenge his ideas, he would ask the director to move me out of his team and look for another boss.

This was unexpected and felt like a threat to my career. I decided to limit contact outside of work with him after that incident.

After a few weeks of no communication outside of work (but continue communication within work channels), my manager reached out for another 1:1 to understand what happened, where I expressed that he crossed a line by using my career against me to try to sway my opinion. He apologized and acknowledged that it wasn’t the message he intended to convey, but mentioned that if my project could not reach the same pattern that it would be an exception outside the project and that's it. This made no sense to me at the moment because if that was the case, why bring the director to the conversation?

While he apologized, I’m not comfortable being friends with him again. But now, we have a meeting scheduled with our director to discuss the challenges we’ve faced working together, which was triggered by a meeting between them.

I’m a top performer, and I want to make it clear that I’m not hindering our progress. However, I’m unsure how to effectively express my concerns in the meeting and defend my position, especially considering the previous tension.

I just want to do my job and maintain a professional environment. How should I approach this conversation with my manager and director? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

1gaqrh5,2 New Jobs and I Think I'm Psyching Myself Out,"I have been underemployed for the past 6+ months and have had not one but two opportunities. I accepted the initial job offer and started, but it pays less, and I would have to commute further. For the other job, I received the clearance to start, but I would be coming into a dumpster fire, and I have limited experience.

I think I am psyching myself out of taking the second job because I am finding things that would make me not take it. One job is growing in the legal tech industry, so I would have job security but not much disposable income after bills. The other job is in property management, but the position has a high turnover rate, and most of the reviews I see are terrible (how I came across the job is an entirely different story).

My underemployment has significantly damaged my credit and finances, and the extra income I would receive from the second job would help me get back on my feet and get ahead. However, there wouldn't be much room for growth, and I fear the job is not secure. At most, I could get current with my obligations, but I wouldn't be able to do much as far as saving or paying down debt.

On paper, it's common sense to go with the higher-paying job, but my anxiety (I previously left one job for a ""better"" job and ended up getting laid off three weeks later) is telling me to stay where I'm currently at. What advice do you have for me?

1gaqls1,"Pursue Dream Job, But Leave Everything You Love Behind","For backstory I never thought I would love my current living situation. I was moving from Chicago to SLC with no one friends and no idea what I was getting into. I was miserable for several months with a job that I saw as mediocre at best and applied to positions out of state that fit more what I wanted to do. Since then, my perspective has changed and have come to meet the best people and love everything about Utah. Though, the job I had was still mediocre.

I just recently got a job offer in Arizona for what I consider is my dream role along with relocation assistance and a slight bump in salary (which, after talking to the recruiter, I did not think would happen). The dilemma I run into is whether or not I should jump on the opportunity knowing very well that I would enjoy the role, but come to terms with the fact that I would be leaving something that took a LONG time to build.

1gaq34b,I think i’m getting fired tomorrow and i’m an anxious mess,"I have a meeting tomorrow with hr and my boss, and I think it is to let me go. 

I have been at my current job for under 2 years. It’s a highly-regarded company in my field, but it wasn’t something I was really *looking* to stay at long term. In fact my plan was to leave around early spring next year because I have an opportunity to work hands-on in the field elsewhere (however that work is on a call by call basis and the industry is kinda suffering). 

since I’ve been hired, work has slowed down so bad that some days i will have only sent a single e-mail all day. It has felt soul crushing for so long that it’s made me feel incredibly depressed. People have been getting laid off en masse, my home life has become incredibly toxic and emotionally abusive, my depression and anxiety are at an all time high, i went from a very social job to one that hardly requires me to speak, i’m getting migraines/cluster headaches every other day, going grey and losing my hair simultaneously before 30, and because of it all I have been using a lot of my PTO and coming in late quite a bit. In the last 2 weeks I took 3 days off because it was too difficult to get out of bed, and before that, i was still regularly taking time off over my depression. My boss is a chill guy, and our department is extremely small and it isn’t unheard of that any one of us trickle in 5-10-20 minutes late here and there, but I have likely abused the laxity on all fronts. My attendance has never been anything like this in my prior workplaces.

Now i’m not sure i will be fired for those reasons specifically because in the last year, and as recent as last month, they have laid off over 1000 people… but that doesn’t necessarily make me feel any better either. 

I can completely understand if I were to be fired for excessive absences. But it is still a hard pill to swallow that I could let everything get so bad. I feel overwhelmingly ashamed, and disappointed in myself, and i was completely aware of everything I was falling short of - but it doesn’t make my circumstances any easier to face. I was actively looking for a therapist in the last month to try and turn my life around but I definitely wont be able to afford it now. I have no idea how to pick myself up from here. I feel like I am spiralling and have accomplished so little. Idk. If anyone has any words of encouragement i’d be very grateful.

1gapph2,Where to go from here,"basically my current job is a low entry requirement one (mechanical aptitude required). i do preventative maintenance on machines for a Fortune 500 company in a contract company with the chance to be hired on for the supplying company

the obvious route is to work and push to try and get hired on as a permanent employee, but there's only been 2 other people in my team that have been promoted in such a way in the 1 year i've been here. they like to talk about how ""\*we want you guys to get hired on! our job is to get you to that spot!\*"" but it seriously feels otherwise

i've been told by one of the technicians i work with that the best route is to look for higher paying jobs every year or so, build up my skillset, and get to a good place via job-hopping; i've also been told to just stick it out and come hiring period they should hire me since i'm meeting expectations. i've also been shot down by others, saying that if i really want to move up with this company and actually get better career advancement opportunities then i need to start going to school for a relevant degree and try to apply in however many years that ends up as

so the question i'm looking to ask, is it really a stable thing to shoot for? ideally i would turn this manufacturing/maintenance/technician skillset into a desk job setting - but the issue is that the work being done is pretty much always hands on, at least to my knowledge. there's the roles of tool-owners and higher-ups who stay outside of the manufacturing side, but that likely requires experience AND education

i've looked into Field Service Engineering, but i'd really like to keep my career nearby since i'm car-free

There’s also bonus/incentive opportunities with the new position that my current role doesn’t have. Additionally, this role is being offered to me because I interviewed for a slightly more advanced position and made it to the final interview, and despite going with another candidate, the hiring manager offered me this role because she believed I’d be an asset to the company and there would be chances for advancement within the next year.

1gaoljj,A potential job wants to talk to my current supervisor — but she hates me,"Hi all! I am a finalist for a new job, but they have a policy where they have to talk to my current supervisor before offering the role. I really really want it! Only problem is, my current supervisor is a workplace bully and treats me horribly — and the reason I am leaving. I am sure he would not give me a good, fair reference. To make matters worse, I recently filed a formal complaint about him because he yelled at me during a meeting after he forgot an extensive in-person approval/conversation for a work piece moving forward. For context, it was basically “You can not expect me to internalize in-person conversations! You were wrong to assume that approval was real when I was working on x, y, and z.” The good news was, our joint boss was on my side and had similar sentiments about my supervisors treatment towards me and other people. But, they’re still keeping him around because his role is really important and difficult to hire for.

I’m thinking I will talk to our joint boss about this, so a step above, and give him as the reference for this role. While not technically my supervisor, he did supervise me while they were hiring for my current supervisors role. He likes me and we get along great. I’m conflicted though, because he’s not technically my immediate supervisor and I don’t want to risk my current job if this one doesn’t work out.

I already offered to have them call my former supervisor, who left the company a little while ago. Unfortunately, that wasn’t a suitable alternative.

Has anyone had experience with this and have any advice? I’ve never had someone ask for additional references outside of those I provided; especially those from my current role.

2. Two real estate developer offers: one in Northern Jersey for $75k and another in SoCal for $67k.

The restaurant job is very tempting, but I fear that career growth and development might be limited. The highest salary I can realistically expect in the next decade may be capped at the low to mid 100s. On the other hand, having that much money as a 22-year-old would be great. I’ve created a pros and cons list for each option. Please let me know your thoughts, especially if you have experience in either field.

\- I like being active and not just staring at a screen all day

\- Good food

\- Job is in an inexpensive location

\- The company is big, with the potential to relocate to 12 other  states

\*Cons:\*

\- My family might be disappointed that I didn’t pursue a financial career

\- Long hours (50-60 hour weeks 😬)

\- Limited salary and career growth in the long term

\- Harder to transition into another industry compared to the reverse

\*\*Real Estate Development Job:\*\*

\*Pros:\*

\- Very reputable firm, which would look great on my resume

\- Standard 40-hour workweek

\- Greater potential for salary growth later in my career

\- Better career development and growth opportunities

\- If I don’t like the field, it may be easier to transition back into the restaurant industry

If I stick around for a few years, I might climb that ladder, but let’s be real, I need a career shake-up.

I’m torn between diving back into academia for a PhD in History or an Ed. Doctorate, or jumping ship to snag an international business degree and join the corporate life. I’d love to keep the debt low because, you know, adulting.

Here’s my goal: I want at least 80k right out of the gate and dreaming big for 150k later on (mid career/ late career). Am I shooting for the stars or just daydreaming? Honestly, I’m open to anything except law and government and I’m hoping one of you have the answer.

My boss is historically very hot and cold, it all depends on his mood and it’s hard to know what’s real or not.

1gakb2v,"Manager left 5 months ago, new boss (VP) has left the position vacant for me to ""grow into it"" in 3-5 years, but in the meantime I am doing the manager's job anyways","I am still in the early part of my career and looking for advice. I love my job, my new boss, and my company, which is why I'm struggling to have an open and honest conversation. 

When I was originally hired as a junior project manager 16 months ago, I was okay with taking a salary decrease because I was excited about the company and my job was relatively low stress.  My original manager held all of the responsibility; even though I only took on 1/3rd of the projects and he took on the other 2/3, he still checked over my work and held himself responsible for my work. After he quit about 5 months ago, I became the manager for all projects. Granted, some of his other responsibilities were picked up by other team members and the VP, but my responsibilities have drastically increased despite my job description not changing. 

After a couple months of work, we had our performance reviews. My new boss highly praised my work and said he was going to leave the senior project manager position open for me to grow into in the next 3-5 years. He also gave me a 1% higher raise than the rest of the team because I was growing so fast and handling the job so well. While I was excited by the fact that he held me in high regard and was willing to nurture my career, I am increasingly frustrated that my position and salary have not truly changed. 

Common advice on this subreddit is to start looking for a new job and use that as leverage, but it is unfortunately not that easy for me in this early part of my career. I do not have a PMP certification nor enough experience to easily get the interviews I would want. I really need the title change or a year or two more of experience to get my PMP before I can seriously look for a better job. I think my boss knows this. He also knows he could have a line out the door of potential project managers with more experience than me - I know this because I saw the list of candidates that applied for my role and other roles in my company. 

So, how do I have a conversation with my new boss?

1gaimpc,Receptionist at a law firm. Looking for career advice. ,"
So I (M26) have been a receptionist at a law firm for almost two years now. The law firm I work at has a program, where they pay for receptionists to obtain their paralegal certificates through online courses. Well this summer, I did that online course and just recently passed and am awaiting my certificate in the mail. This week, I spoke with the managing partner.

Now here’s where the issue lies. The managing partner told me how great of a receptionist I was and how much they love me being the face of the law firm and how friendly I am. She stated that she spoke with the other partners and they agreed to give me a 10% raise, so I will now go from making $50,000 to $55,000 both pre-tax of course. Now I know that pay sounds low (because it is) but I do live in a southern state, where COL is not at all like California or New York. 

She stated that the firm did not have any openings for a junior paralegal and that everyone was too busy to help a paralegal who would just be starting out. She suggested that maybe I could bide my time, and attempt to do paralegal work and wait until a position opens up, and someone feels comfortable with the experience I have. I said okay and we ended it at that.

My question is, I don’t know I this is the right move. Currently, my job is very easy as essentially all I have to do is show up (no hybrid 5 days a work sadly) and open boxes the office manager orders, order lunch for clients, and occasionally assist paralegals with their legal work. On the other hand, I would like paralegal experience and I did work hard for that certificate and would like to use it, even if I didn’t pay for it. I also don’t want turn 30 and only have receptionist experience. 

I do have an interview for a hybrid paralegal position that pays $27/hr next week, however it is a temp position and I don’t know if I’m comfortable leaving a perm position where I have PTO and healthcare. 

Any advice?",naelisio,0,0.33000001311302185,7,1729710625,2024-10-23 19:10:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gaimpc/receptionist_at_a_law_firm_looking_for_career/,10,2024

1gagdjm,Looking for advice - Feels like an executive set me up for failure?,"Hi Everyone,

Looking for some advice on my career right now, using a throwaway account. 

I was hired into my current role by an executive whom I've worked with before at a previous company a few months ago. He mentioned how it was a super exciting time to be at his current company (large corporation) and essentially poached me from my previous job which was arguably a more prestigious organization but I took the role as I had a good relationship with him and they were offering a big salary increase. 

Over the past few months, a few things happened which made me super unmotivated and just generally unhappy. I'd like to know if I'm overreacting and just need to get my shit together or if this is a genuinely dysfunctional company:

- the manager they hired to lead my team switched roles within 9 months
- my teammates (2 of them) both quit within the first 3 months
- they didn't hire any replacements for my team and essentially said my team was redundant but still wanted me to focus on random tasks at hand
- whenever I reach out to adjacent teams for information I receive zero responses

The overall lack of structure and ambiguity combined with an unhelpful (every man for himself) company culture has definitely cause my motivation to nosedive and I admit that it has affected the overall quality of my work. I used to go above and beyond with my deliverables but now I can't push myself to do more beyond the bare minimum.

My executive just had a word with me and told me I need to be more of a self-starter as he expects someone with my experience to be able to drive things forward. He is absolutely correct but I feel as though this environment and the recent organizational changes have just sucked the motivation and drive out of me.

At this point I'm not sure if I should look for outside opportunities (which would burn some bridges), but I feel like I've truly wasted a few months of my professional career here and I'm not performing at the level I used to. I've also tried to communicate with my executive about all the issues I'm facing but I've just been told that everyone has their hands full and I should just concentrate on my work. 

Has anyone else dealt with this before? Looking for any advice/criticism! ",Additional_Lynx2440,1,1.0,3,1729704752,2024-10-23 17:32:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gagdjm/looking_for_advice_feels_like_an_executive_set_me/,10,2024

I’m currently in a role that I justified in my mind as being close enough to marketing but it really isn’t. I basically just act as a social media customer service person but I don’t like the current company I’m at. Seniority and shift bidding combined with shifts that aren’t great isn’t my cup of tea.

1gafxby,"Still haven’t heard about raises this year, feeling very frustrated.","I work for a nonprofit where I make decent money. I have been working here for multiple years. Every year we have our employee reviews mid year, a few months later find out about raises (amounts, when we receive back pay for them as they are back dated, etc). Well we are at the point in the year where we traditionally receive the back pay from the new raises and no one has heard anything. With cost of living increases if we aren’t getting pay raises we are essentially getting a pay cut. 

I know I am not the only one asking or wondering what is going on. I have fellow coworkers who ask me if I have heard anything about raises and they ask me what HR said when I asked. I contacted HR mid summer and earlier this month. Both times they said soon. 

I have a timeframe that I am willing to stay 1 to 2 more years if there is no raises. This is simply because I will have student loans and credit cards all paid off at that time and will feel more able to take a risk of leaving. 

Honesty, it’s been a nice company and I would like to stay if I could get a promotion and regular raises in the future. I just feel stuck.

1gafvir,I think my company is letting me go soon and not sure what to look for next. Long / TLDR included,"I've worked at a start up for the last couple years as the sole Programmer / IT guy. I initially signed up for programming but slowly started to have to pick up more and more work, to be honest a lot of it was just being naive and not knowing how to tell people to do their own work or realizing that it wasn't my job to help out. I did a lot of 12/14 hour shifts for the first year just to get us up and running as fast as possible and to be clear here's what I started with.

We are a research company and had several scientist work with us before who all recorded things differently in a written notebook so very little of it was standardized. My job was basically to get this into a database where we can draw connections between the data so it became useful. The idea was to hire a programmer instead of paying for prebuilt software. Following my bosses advice at the time who was also naive we focused on what was already digital and moved to start getting that running. While it was a huge effort after some months time we had a nice functional site with some bugs but they we're worked out as we went along. 

The problems really started when we hit a rough patch and the company could go either way. We started hiring only lab workers and I kept trying to convince them to hire just an intern or someone to help with IT work because I was extremely inexperienced with it while trying to keep up with the maintenance and growing our internal database. On top of this I pretty much never got any real authority and was constantly over ruled by execs, my old bosses favorite saying was, ""We need to get everyone's feedback first."". I never got why I needed everyone's feedback on a department I was managing, note I'm aware exec buy in is required to grease the wheels of productivity but why am I arguing with a scientist about how to organize files?

I get that sounds silly but if I'm working 12+ hours I don't super care to hear someone's opinion on how I should do something when they have no idea what it is what I do. A great example is I was given a project to organize our files and I propose a system to my boss and he says ok you need to talk to the teams so I do and they all complain about having to migrate their stuff because ,""Its not their job"". Its definitely not my job to organize a file system they've spent years **not** maintaining but here I am finding a solution. For the record the solution was to migrate their files to their own SharePoint site or Microsoft team so their files wouldn't be mixed with all the other units. Nothing hard at least from my experience and if anything its the standard way to do it.

During that last year I more or less had constant anxiety attacks which was always fun but I had no sleep and the fear of losing my job everyday. One of the main reasons for not sleeping was working as the sole support for our offshore team. We had a server onsite that needed to be maintained and it was only used by a team 13 hours behind us so the only time I would get pinged was the middle of the night. I basically had to switch to a work schedule of 10-4 then 9/2. I would basically work the day go home and nap for 3 hours then start again. That was an exciting time. 

I'll be honest I started missing deadlines for a lot of projects and stuff dragged on but I was being pulled into a ton of different directions from app development down to help other teams all the way to manually organizing file systems and helping plan cross unit projects. It definitely feels like I was picking up half my bosses work which to be fair I can't super blame him for because he was more or less the head of all our units when other people should of stepped up. I should of focused on my own projects more but hindsight 20/20.

Just before my boss left we hired a new exec from a large company and he very much brought that corporate attitude with him. While I think its good he did because we really needed to move away from the everyone gets a vote structure we also really needed to have people actually act like managers and manage stuff instead of having to, ""Suggest"", things to people. However he came in like a bull in a China shop and really shook stuff up by being what I felt was very pointed all the time. For instance he would ask about something and if he found out whatever he was asking about wasn't done he would then bring it up at a exec meeting in front of everyone and question you why it isn't done yet. Maybe this is normal behavior but it felt very sneaky and like playing dirty to me.

My boss soon left because he didn't want to deal with the new exec's politics so I had to work under someone else. So I work under another department lead who had a shaky history with everyone who worked under him however I liked his willingness to be productive past 9-5 when it was needed, mainly because I had to do it to so it made it easier to communicate out of hours when needed. We quickly decided to revamp an app using power apps which I manage to get done but it did take quite a while as I'm  not super well versed and he had some really specific request he wanted that required a lot of external tweaking.

After working two 60 hour weeks I have a final product that does everything he wanted but I didn't migrate our date base over yet to connect to the app. The data was structured differently so it was going to take quite a while to come up with something to convert it and I didn't have the time while also keeping up with my other task. Taking into account the initial discussions we had before with the team members we discussed what features they wanted in this new app it very much sounded like just getting to use the updated functionalities would be enough till I could connect the data at a later date. 

I was pretty excited to roll out and I know everyone else is but my boss sees the data isn't connected and explodes. He calls my phone and starts yelling about me being lazy and he cant believe I didn't already have the data connected. We made a pretty exhaustive list of what was required for a roll out because I knew he was a micromanager so I wanted to make sure to check every box but that never came up as a must be done before roll out task. I tell him this but he claims that I should of just known and then he yells some more before going to make a huge post to the entire company apologizing for the, ""Poor work"".

After this his messaging me at all hours of the day and night asking for updates on projects we're already going to meet about later. For example we have a meeting at 4pm to go over something but his messaging me at 7am for an update. I pretty much end up minimizing my communication with him as much as possible because the level of stress he brought to my daily work life was enough to make me almost completely unproductive. 

Well today I got sent a meeting request where we're going to talk to the representees of the software I was initially supposed to replace. I feel pretty defeated after three years of hard work only for them to go ahead and get the software I was supposed to replace. I can't really blame anyone but myself, I tried to step up when I should of realized my limits and been more firm.

I figure this means its time to start applying because I can only imagine its a matter of time till I'm called in and let go. I have a mix mash of skills so I figure its going to be hard to find something. I have some decent full stack developer skills and enough IT skills to probably find my self working as a general IT guy or something. However I'm not really sure what I should do next or what career to look for. Any suggestions?

TLDR: I worked at a start up for the last couple years as the programmer to make in house software. Being naive I didn't realize how much I needed to just say no and I let the scope of my work grow and grow until I basically burnt myself out. After our company culture changed and started becoming a lot more political my old boss left and my new boss turned out to be a pretty intense micromanager. Now the software I was supposed to replace is being purchased so I figure I'll be out a job soon. I have a mix of skills ranging from full stack development to Microsoft IT work and power apps. I'm not really sure where to look now especially since I have no degree.

1gabnl8,I 29f want to apply for a job but my colleagues fiancé works there and I don't want it to get back to my job through this link that I am looking for a new job. Any possible advice?,"Some stuff happened recently at my current job, which I want to stress I really love my job and where I work but I am extremely ignored how much profit my marketing is bringing into the company and how much I am doing and I feel extremely unseen and depressed as of September 2024. Last week something happened that confirmed I dont want to work here, and it has been extremely difficult for me to choose myself, as I really do like the job and a handful of my colleagues. But I have a mortgage and cat so I am choosing myself. I don't want to hate where I work as it will impact me personally as well. 

To be honest, I would like to work hybrid (my job doesn't offer this) and I miss working at least 2 times a week from home (working alongside my kitty has always been nice). I also would like to work for a charity, where I am helping people or somewhere with animals, I love animals and to this day I do dog walking and cat feedings on the side or honestly cars, I really do love a nice car haha. 

I am currently really sick, have been since coming back from France on 12th but started to feel a bit better today and started browsing for new jobs, but not applying as I don't feel well enough for all that yet. I saved a few jobs to get back to when I am feeling better, and one of them is for a charity shop in my town that also offers events/festivals to be a part of (my job kinda excluded me from events I could of been a part of and helped me evolve but that is nor here or there) and honestly I love this as I used to work at festivals and events during uni so this would be nice.

Now my colleague 26m, has a fiancé who works for a charity that also (don't know her age) and this charity also goes to events and festivals, after some research I am positive this is where she works.

1. I dont want her finding out that I am applying for new jobs, no idea where she is up the ladder but if I were to make it to interviews or for all I know she has a say in this hiring progress (dont know her job title) she will obviously tell her fiancé and because my colleague/her fiancé, is so close to my boss, I am 99% sure he will tell my boss. 

2. You might be thinking, oh, how would she even know you? Well, when I started my job in April this year, I had a crush on my colleague, end of June he asked me out for a drink to celebrate my 29th birthday. I thought he was single and that he liked me, I was crazy excited but half way through he mentioned that he has a girlfriend who's working the weekend coming up at a festival with her and he is basically packing up their place alone and moving alone for them to their new place. When he said this, I felt disgusted and honestly angry and sad as I felt like I was used and my excitement for love went. Also it is very wrong what he did when he had a gf that I did not know about at the time. When I came back from my bday break, the vibe between us was off, which is understandable, but working alongside him, has affected me mentally badly, especially during that time as I felt horrible and I was never again excited to go into work and honestly, since, I have never been happy going in nor ever on time, I am always 1-10 minutes late. In July, my colleague announced he is engaged which just confused me but was happy for him. By the end of August, my colleague stopped talking to me, making small talk, and most of the time would ignore me to go say bye to our boss and then leave. I know this sounds shit, but it is a small team and when everyone gets goodbyes and hellos, it does make me feel shit. 

So there's the connection, I am sure he spoke about the situation to his fiancé. Overall, this whole thing sucks as I like this charity and I worked for a different charity while doing my A levels, so this stuff is in my field of interest and also not too far from what the company I work for does. I also applied for a similar job role at this company 2 years ago so it's a place I can see myself enjoying working, but this thing kinda messes up with my head. 

I dont know if it is worth applying for when I am feeling better? Or just cut my losses?

Might be overthinking, just the last week everything has been worse for me, I am super ill and gotten quite depressed, but probably because I am sick and all alone and just overthinking everything in my life. Writing this hurts my head and eyes but really would appreciate some advice.

1gaa81h,Freelancing (Starting a SaaS) vs OJT with a Job Offer - Which path should I choose?,"Hi, I am a graduating IT student, and I’ve been freelancing for a long time already as a software developer, so I already have a good experience.

Our OJT will be next SEM, and there’s this academy who reached out to me to join their program, and I will be referred to thier parternered companies, once I complete the course. I passed their tech exam and interview, and the course is currently ongoing.

In our interview, I can be reffered to an international company for $1000 a month. This is already an actually job, and will be counted as an OJT.

I know it’s a good offer, but I usually earn more than that from freelancing, sometimes earn 6 digits in pesos. It’s just not stable. 

My thought is, working in a company is not really what I want. I don’t wanna work 9-5 on someone elses company. I am capable of starting my own software company or build a software product (which is what I am doing now, but no income from these products yet). 

So I really need advice, should I continue this academy so I can be reffered to a good company with good pay? Or should I go solo, find an OJT (less or no income, just for school requirements) then continue freelancing and focus on building products?

1ga8wpo,Should I go part-time at 30 for my mental health and try freelancing on the side?,"This year has been rough, and I’m feeling burnt out.

I quit my first job last November after six years. I was good at it, felt valued, and even got a promotion offer, but I had issues with my manager and needed a change. I switched jobs in December, but the new role wasn’t a good fit, and I was laid off in February. Fortunately, I was rehired by a company owned by my former bosses.

My current job in web/graphic/UI design is laid back, but I feel disconnected, unsure if I even enjoy what I do anymore. The previous job loss hit my confidence hard, and now I’m constantly doubting myself - always done that, to be honest, but this is the first time I'm doubting what do I even like or who I am. On top of that, my mental health has been suffering—low self-esteem, feeling lost, and struggling to find time for myself, my home, and relationships. I've been in therapy on and off for the past 7 years and regularly for the past year, so I'm working on that, but I still feel pretty stagnant in this low mood.

I’m also getting married soon, and we’ll likely need to buy a house. Since my fiancé works in retail, I’m expected to be the primary breadwinner. I’ve considered going part-time (30 hours/week) to focus on myself, and that would mean a pay cut of around €400/month (about €5k/year).

I’d use the extra time to focus on my mental health, exercise, clean my house, and eventually learn more skills and start freelancing on the side.

However, I’m worried about how going part-time at 30 might look to future employers, or if I’ll delay important life plans like buying a house or having kids due to the reduced income. Could I realistically make up the €5k/year difference through freelancing, even the first year, or would this move be way too risky considering my upcoming financial goals?

I'm a 26-year-old guy from Latvia, and I'm feeling pretty lost right now. I graduated in law, but young lawyers here earn very little—less than $1,000 a month. Even if you make it to a big law firm, without becoming a partner, you'd top out at around $6,000 a month. I did work in a big law firm, but I hated it because it was all office work with no court involvement. I went to law school to become a litigation lawyer, but never got the chance to work in that area. Plus, I never enjoyed the reading and writing that comes with being a lawyer.



I’ve always been good at math and interested in hardware, so I switched to software development. Now, I'm a senior developer earning about $6,000 net per month, which is quite high for my country. However, I don't like frontend development and feel like I've hit the ceiling in terms of career growth unless I start my own firm—which I've tried and failed at multiple times. I've also tried multiple side projects and SAAS products which I liked doing but it's more of a hobby because I've never managed to make money off them.



Recently, I met a girl who's becoming a dentist and loves her job. It got me thinking about dentistry because it involves working directly with people and having an assistant—something I miss in IT. I have enough savings (equivalent to a small flat) to pursue dentistry. It would cost me $15k per year for two years before potentially transferring to a non-paid program based on GPA.



I'm really desperate and feel defeated. I have no idea what to do next. Should I stick with IT for the financial security? I can't stand that year after year I'm in the same place. Should I take the plunge into dentistry? Or should I go back to law? Should I focus on starting a software house? I don't like coding. Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

1ga87j6,Can You Climb the Corporate Ladder Without Sacrificing Work-Life Balance?,"I’m 35, but in professional terms, I’m relatively new to my career. I spent a lot of time figuring out what I wanted to do and in which field. This is my first stable company, and I actually see myself staying here long-term. Despite only being here for a short time, the company seems eager to push me toward a higher position in the future. I keep hearing that I’m doing a great job, which is encouraging.

I’ve always thought of myself as ambitious. I want to move up the corporate ladder—take on more responsibilities, earn more money, and have a greater role in decision-making. I really enjoy tackling complex projects, even when they’re demanding, because they’re challenging and fun.

However, I’m starting to question whether I have what it takes to climb that ladder. Am I smart enough? Do I have the drive and endurance? On top of that, I’m a mom to a 3-year-old, and I’m planning to get pregnant again within a year. Balancing work and family is already a challenge, and I wonder how realistic it is to advance my career without jeopardizing my personal life.

When I look at the people above me—my manager, their manager, and others in senior positions—it seems like they’re all juggling the workload of two or three people. They work 10-12 hours a day, often grab meals on the go, and sacrifice time with their families. Many of them are still online late at night, dealing with emails and last-minute issues.

So, my question is: Is it even possible to climb the corporate ladder without sacrificing work-life balance, especially with a family? I’d love to hear from anyone who’s found a way to manage both, or from those who have faced similar struggles. How do you navigate career growth while keeping your personal life intact?


TL;DR: I’m 35, new to my career, and my company is pushing me for promotion. I’m ambitious, but I see senior managers working long hours and sacrificing personal time.

Recently, I met a girl who's becoming a dentist and loves her job. It got me thinking about dentistry because it involves working directly with people and having an assistant—something I miss in IT. I have enough savings (equivalent to a small flat) to pursue dentistry. It would cost me $15k per year for two years before potentially transferring to a non-paid program based on GPA.



I'm really desperate and feel defeated. I have no idea what to do next. Should I stick with IT for the financial security? I can't stand that year after year I'm in the same place. Should I take the plunge into dentistry? Or should I go back to law? Should I focus on starting a software house? I don't like coding. Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

1ga7h0i,Career change advice - marketing to psychology ,"  
Hi, I’m 23 and based in Norfolk, UK. I have been thinking about a changing career from being a marketing manager to a clinical psychologist for a while now. I want to make the switch, but I’m worried about the financial implications. 

My current role makes 34k a year, I have a mortgage but no dependents. 

I’m due to take a psychology conversion masters at the end of October - whilst continuing to work full time in marketing. 

I’m very aware to successfully become a psychologist I’ll need a lot of work experience, but I’m not in the place financially to be able to take unpaid work. 

I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for full time work I could explore whilst I take my masters - that pays similar to my current role?

1ga7bvm,What are the Top AWS Course in Bangalore to choose For my Career growth ?,"Hey everyone,

I've been actively searching for recommendations on the best AWS Training for beginners, and I've been asking around on various subreddits. Many people suggested that I bring my query here to the community, as this is where I can get the best advice from those who have experience with AWS certifications. I’m really hoping to get some insights from this community on which AWS courses or training programs are worth considering, especially for someone just starting out.

I’ve shortlisted a institutes near my area (I’m based in Bangalore), and I would appreciate feedback on them or any other suggestions you might have:

1. [Eduleem](https://eduleem.com) \- This institute has been highly recommended by several people I spoke to. They offer a beginner-friendly [AWS training course ](https://eduleem.com/aws-training-in-bangalore/)with comprehensive coverage of the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam, which seems to be a great starting point. Plus, they have experienced trainers who provide hands-on learning, which I believe would be really beneficial.
2. [SDLC](https://sdlctraining.in/) \- similarly some of them suggested me with this as They provide a range of [AWS certification ](https://eduleem.com/aws-training-in-bangalore/)courses, including architect and developer tracks.

I’ve also been following discussions on related topics, such as from another subreddit, where people shared valuable insights on choosing the right AWS certification. But I’m hoping to get more specific, detailed advice here.

If you’ve taken any AWS courses, I’d love to hear about your experiences—what worked for you, what didn’t, and what you would recommend for a beginner trying to learn AWS fundamentals.

Looking forward to your recommendations and any advice you can share! Thanks in advance.",1Mugiwara_no_Luffy,2,1.0,0,1729679720,2024-10-23 10:35:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ga7bvm/what_are_the_top_aws_course_in_bangalore_to/,10,2024

1ga6f3u,Burnt out wanting career change,"I (31F) have been working in customer service for almost 6 years in the same company now, and initially it was exciting as it was a new industry for me, the office was quite fun but since Covid we’re fully remote, and the culture in general has changed entirely, it’s like a complete different company than the one I joined. Although looking back there were definitely some red flags. I can now fully recognise it’s a very toxic working environment. I’ve also reached the point where I don’t think there’s more progression in this company for me anymore. 

I have been burnt out for a very long time, no idea how I’m holding on. I’ve also been grieving a very personal loss for months now. Every Sunday I’m overwhelmed with anxiety because I know Monday and the whole week is approaching, and I’m dreading it every time. 

With all that in mind, I have been thinking (for probably years… since Covid) that I would love to change to something that has NOTHING to do with customer service (some people are nasty, abusive, etc and with my mental state I just can cope). I’ve thought of many options (more active / physical jobs) but at the same time I don’t know what I could do that could support my lifestyle. I can’t leave my job because I need the money. I feel trapped in the hole of customer service and in the hole of this life sucking company. I’m too burnt out to look for a job (meaning that all
my energy is drained from that and I have no energy to look for a job, which is another job on its own). But I know for my sake and my MH I need to change jobs ASAP. It’s a never ending cycle.

Where does one even start looking for possible career opportunities?

1ga5wn6,My Journey as a Freelance Developer: How I Grew to Earning $14K a Month,"📈 For years, I kept watching online videos to learn Java, but each time, I would stick with it for about six months before realizing I didn’t enjoy it and quitting. In 2020, I moved from New York to Boston and, just before Covid hit, I decided to give JavaScript a try, starting with the MERN stack for web development. Since I had learned React, I figured I’d give React Native a shot, and despite being very early in my web development career, I decided to focus on mobile development because I found it incredibly enjoyable.

I started sharing my progress regularly on LinkedIn, documenting my journey up to the point where I could build simple mobile apps.

🎯After every post, I gained more followers, mostly from the U.S.

Among those followers, some eventually started offering me small freelance jobs, which was a dream come true for me because I had just completed a year-long full-stack development course and was struggling through tough interviews with companies.

As you probably know, most interviews are heavily focused on LeetCode challenges, which are often unrelated to real-world projects, and my brain just wasn’t absorbing that kind of information.

After getting my first freelance offer, I decided to gradually shift my focus to freelancing while also expanding my network.

It was during this shift that I discovered digital nomadism. I lived as a digital nomad in several countries, starting with Bali, followed by other Asian countries and eventually places like the UK.🌴

Today, I make around 💰$14K+ per month from freelance work.

I’ve now decided to step back from freelancing and focus solely on developing my own apps and managing my social media ventures.

Since making that decision, I’ve launched two diet-focused apps, both available on iOS and Android.🥗

My third app, which focuses on intermittent fasting, will be the last one I release for a while. That’s because all of my apps require a lot of work, and I simply don’t have enough time to keep creating new ones.

Additionally, after gaining a lot of experience on my YouTube channel where I publish React Native tutorials in my native language, I’m planning to launch an English-language channel and build a career solely around this content.

I wanted to share this with you because I’ve learned that building a career is a long process, but if you stay patient, you can eventually reach impressive numbers.

❓ Now, I’m curious about your thoughts: Do you think it’s a good idea to target women with my diet apps while targeting a mostly male audience with my software tutorial YouTube channel? I’d love to hear your perspective.",No-Access2366,0,0.5,1,1729673675,2024-10-23 08:54:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ga5wn6/my_journey_as_a_freelance_developer_how_i_grew_to/,10,2024

I have been at my current company for close to a year now. 
Due to some complications concerning the project I have been part of, our lead decided to leave.
Since I have been crucial for the delivery and development, I got asked by the PM if I wanted to stay in this project and get the lead role, which I accepted.
This overlapped with our annual reviews, so I discussed this with my manager. I mentioned that I would very much like to keep the lead title going forward even after the current projects ends. We went through my goals and my achievements. My manager said that it will be no issue to change my responsibilities. 
However, due to the nature of the meeting (I didn’t expect to be this upfront and my manager basically letting me navigate the topic), we didn’t get into any salary discussions. We only discussed the date when I am going to get the title promotion. We kept talking about job descriptions but not once anything about salary or even a new contract.

1ga5kg5,A friend of mine is going into nursing and she is worried she will be viewed as less than a doctor ,"A friend of mine is going into nursing and she is worried that she will be seen as ""less"" or less clever, educated etc. than a medical doctor. My advice to her and to anyone else pursuing nursing is as follows: 

  
**1. They are different professions**. 

A doctor is responsible for making diagnosis, prescribing medicine and in many cases charged with innovation in their specific field of expertise. These are all undoubtedly great things and require an immense of amount of training and education. 

A nurse is primarly tasked with supporting the clinician, providing hospitality and care as well as logistical work required for conducting a diagnosis. All these functions are inherently important to serving the patient. 



**2. Educational requirements are different**. 

As mentioned above, the training to pursue being a physician or a nurse are inherently different. 

Doctors will have to go through at least six years of medical training, at a university as well as completing a number of years in general or their specific field of medicine.  Costs for becomming a doctor can be immense, with medical school in the U.S. as high as $60,000 per year. 

According to the International Standard Classifications of Occupations. The ISCO standards range from 1 - 4. Doctors, lawyers, economists, mathematicians etc. are all level 4 or high skilled professionals. his is ranked in terms of educate obtained and analytical nature of the role.

Conversely, nursing is a vocational occupation that requires roughly 2 years of formal training in addition to multiple years of on the job experience. 

The ISCO level for nurses is 2 - 3 at most, depending on the skill set of the nurse. To put this into perspective, this would place a nurse in the same category as janitors, forestiers, primary school teachers and construction workers -- all of which are crucial roles in society. 

  
Again, let's be clear. Different jobs require different skill sets. Some people are great carers, teachers, artists or musicians. Others can write code or enjoy maths. All such skills have relevance in society. 

  
**3. What about salary expectations?** 

  
See above. They are different professions that require different skillsets. 

There is no ""better"" or ""worse"". It would be the same as comparing an economist to a nurse/janitor/teacher -- they are different roles. If you wish to think like that, you will make yourself unhappy. 

Average nurse salay in the U.S. is roughly $65,000 - 85,000. 

The average salary for a GP in the U.S. is roughly $120,000 - 180,000

  
**Final thoughts**

  
Studying to become a nurse or a doctor is surely a great entperise and is valued by society. However, they are different jobs, with different educational and oftentimes analytical requirements. Yes, they command different salaries but stop comparing apples to oranges. Both are great!

1ga46df,"What path should I pursue in psychology? Psychiatry vs Psychology, or something else?","Looking for advice on how to pursue a career in psychology 

As someone who’s about to start college, I’ve been thinking about my career choices. I know I have an interest for helping people regarding mental health, so I wanted to study psychology.

What I’m unsure of, however, is whether or not to aim for a psychiatrist route or a psychologist one.

For psychiatry, I know you’d do the regular 4 years of college, followed by med school and residency, which in total would be around 12 years. This also would come with more debt as med school is expensive 

For psychology, you would probably just do 4 years for a bachelors and later your masters, which in total is 7-8 years.

So overall psychologist is less time, less debt, but also gets paid less. Psychiatry is more time invested, more debt, but I believe the salary can get pretty high, upwards to 2x what a psychologist would make.

I’m not sure on what path to take, and what would be better for me, or whether or not the ideas I have are correct at all.

1ga3cyw,How do I ask my boss to work remotely due to car troubles?,"I would like some tips on requesting if I can go remote while I save up for a new car. Or see if I could go remote indefinitely, maybe use this period as a trial period.

My work is done completely through the internet and phone. There's maybe 4 people in the company who work remotely and the rest of us 20 work in the office. I'm not sure what qualifies someone to work remote, but I'd like to see if I'd be able to. 

My car is currently on its last leg and is also unsafe to drive, but I keep driving it because it's what I have. My dad told me I should probably stop driving around on it because it could give out at any minute completely and that could be in a dangerous spot when it does. 

I've been doing my research on how I'd get my 7yo to/from daycare that will take him to school and myself to/from work without a car:

**City Bus:** 

* Walk 1.7 miles from home to daycare by opening time at 6:30am & drop kiddo off
* Walk to nearest bus stop 1.2 miles away by 7:25am
* Be bussed to bus stop .2miles from work by 7:56am & be roughly 5 to 10 mins late every day
* Leave work 5 to 10 mins prior to get to bus stop by 4:55pm
* Be bussed to nearest bus stop to daycare 1.2 miles away by 5:30
* Walk to daycare 1.7 miles away by 6pm (6pm is closing time and there is a $2/minute fee if late)

**Uber Rides**

* Estimated $54/day to get a ride from my house to daycare & work and then back to daycare & home
   * Does not include a tip and the estimate came from checking around 10pm, not sure if early morning hours are different rates

**Taxi Rides**

* Not reliable in my city/more expensive than Uber



**Work Schedules**

Schedule with Car (current): 8am to 5am with 1 consecutive hour break from 12 to 1 

Schedule with Bus: 810amto 450am with 40 minute lunch

* This is only if busses are running very punctually & the city doesn't shutdown certain days due to winter weather 

Remote Schedule: 830am to 5pm with 30 mins off around 330pm

* School starts at 830 but I can drop off by 815 I think at the earliest, so I'd take half of my break then
* School ends at 330, so I'd take the rest of my break around then to walk to pick him up; might let him walk home if we both feel comfortable with it. I'd get him a phone of some sort so he could call me on but I haven't looked up if there's anything specifically for this other than getting a cheap flip phone
* I would unenroll him from daycare because school is maybe a 10 minute walk away which saves money to put towards the new car (no idea about getting him re-enrolled once I do have a car)

**Benefits**

\+ Productivity 

\+ Less distractions

\+ Available during colleagues' lunch hours

\+ Sick & snow season: already home and ready to work when myself or my kid is under the weather or if there's bad weather where the busses or daycares/schools shutdown (my daycare closes whenever the school does) 

\+ Less stress worrying about the bus schedule and making sure I make it on time/what to do if the school/daycare/buses shutdown due to bad weather (a thing that happens here)

  
My boss is also a single mom and is understanding of my struggles. I'm just worried what next if she doesn't allow me to work remote. I'll definitely try the bus route and see how it goes, but the winter has me worried. If was only me walking it'd be different, but since my 7yo will be with me and even if I do use his wagon, it's going to be a struggle in the snow for nearly 2 miles on a hilly sidewalk. The windchill can also make the temps go subzero very easily, especially in the early morning and that's when we'd be walking to his daycare. I also have pretty crappy credit so getting a loan for a car isn't very feasible.

1ga28jv,switched into the gaming industry and not sure how much I should be getting paid/ how to ask for a raise,"
So as the title says, I switched from a different creative industry to an indie mobile game studio. I have been working there for a year, and really enjoy it.

My switch happened due to the fact that this mobile game is themed around the creative industry I was working in before. I am the only person in this “department” and essentially do a lot of content conception, directing a team of artists (although this part is shared with an art director) and also doing back end work and general game design/jira task creation/ planning/game testing/research etc. 

I know the lack of detail might be confusing, but with other context from my profile, any more detail on my job would make it clear who I am to a coworker. 

Technically, I am not a dev, I don’t do programming, but my role has steadily grown in workload over the past year. 

The job pays much better than the jobs in my original field so I didn’t want to rock the boat. However now that it’s been almost a year, and COL means I have to have my office practically in my bedroom, a raise would allow me to improve my workspace (WFH). currently I make 65k before tax living in a major canadian city. This may be a shot in the dark, and if you have a better subreddit to direct me to I will happily go there. but I have no one to ask for advice on this.

I love my job, I don’t want to cause issues, and I’ve never asked for a raise before so I am not sure what is reasonable and how to go about it, especially having switched into this field. Any advice appreciated. 

additional info: I have a BSc with honours in a non related field, and 3 years of experience in my previous field. don’t know if that matters.

This is more about the older folks who feel stuck at their job and the only thing that is keeping them away from being recognized, a promotion and earning some extra Benjamin's, is a degree.

With age comes maturity and true curiosity to learn, as opposed to when you are young and there is nothing left to learn, because ""you already know it all"" ha!

\-I remember being in class listening and doing my work, but at the same time, having absolutely no idea what I was doing, memorizing exams; long enough to be able to answer exam questions. Now, decades later, I look forward to each lesson and seeing what's there new to learn.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, there is a lower percentage of college students who drop out between the ages of 35 and 64 than under 35. And it makes sense, when you are older you realize how valuable time is and cannot afford to waste it.

1ga1o6x,Need advice on my off-the-books job and whether I should quit,"Cross-posting because I genuinely need advice and I'm getting desperate.

So, as the title states, I (24) work an off-the-books job as a salesperson at a local bakery and have been for a bit over a year. Things have always been messy, but the past few months especially so. It's been so bad that two coworkers quit, at least four others want to, and honestly I feel like I need to before the job kills me.

My first question is this: **How much power over my situation do I even have, given that this is job is off the books?** I can't apply for unemployment because of that fact, so I'm a little desperate not to get fired, but I really cannot keep working here and being constantly micromanaged, overworked, and chastised for standing still for even a single moment (quite literally). We even got collectively scolded for *drinking water* while on the clock. As in, literally, because people sometimes stop to take a little sip of water off in the hidden corner. ""Are you that thirsty?"" the owner asked, ""I only let you have water here out of my own kindness, but maybe that needs to stop.""

On top of that, we aren't exactly required to take breaks on 8 hour shifts, it's discouraged to do so, and if you do take one, it's not allowed to be more than 20 minutes at the absolute longest - 15 or under is preferable. Is that normal for these kinds of places? I don't know. Maybe I'm just being childish and need to wake up to the real world or whatever.

To make matters worse, about a month ago a new trainee was brought on, and she's been making the place even more miserable. She bosses everyone around despite only being in high school, is confidently incorrect about everything, won't do any of her assigned tasks, keeps messing things up, and... faces no repercussions, where the rest of us get threatened with unemployment for much, much less. I don't even know how to process that.

Overall, I just really hate working at the place, especially because I have chronic pain (from fibromyalgia and in the process of getting diagnosed for a hypermobility disorder), and standing for 8 hours is bad enough, but slaving away at something or the other, lifting heavy trays and boxes, etc. is even worse. The pain and brain fog have gotten so bad that even writing this post has taken me around four days. I've given up all my hobbies. I no longer have the energy to play video games to unwind. I no longer have the energy to scroll through silly social media posts or watch YouTube videos to unwind. Lately I've stopped having the energy to even respond to people's texts (of which I don't get a whole lot in the first place, so it really shouldn't be difficult). My life is basically work, rot in bed, and repeat. My apartment is messier than it should be because I don't have the energy to clean.

I guess my final question is... **what should I do?** I can't just quit, because I need to pay rent, but I don't know how long I can continue. I want to quit so bad. I want to quit today, honestly. Can I report any of this to anyone at all, or is that a pointless pursuit? Is it even possible for me to get another job? One coworker just quit days ago, and already has other low-level job interviews lined up, but I've been trying for months to no avail. Is it because of my lack of a history in the US, given that I only moved here two years ago? I *am* a US citizen, hence the lack of trouble moving here, but I didn't go to school or college here, nor do I have any kind of references or local experience.

1ga11kv,"Found out my older, inexperienced coworker (36) has a higher title than me (27)","For background, I’ve (27) been at the company for 2 years. He (35) came in a year after me under a supporting contractor role—no title attached.

I’ve led a variety of integral projects and have even established new company guidelines. So much so, that higher-ups have requested he come to me to not just oversee, but also approve his work.  

A few weeks ago, I found out he signed a full time offer, where he told me he had taken a Lead role approved by the Director of my team (who has also requested me to top edit his work when there’s too much on her plate). 

I’m extremely saddened by this as I have been an Associate throughout my time at the company. I am also leading and working on much, much larger projects compared to my coworker. I should also mention I haven’t gotten a salary bump.

Outside of searching for new opportunities (which I’m doing), is this something I should bring up to my boss? Not to complain, but to gain some clarity about my expected growth trajectory and role-specific expectations?

The only reason I’m asking is because the job market is not the best right now (I’m American) and I’d hate to leave my position without having something lined up. 

If I can make the final months a little more manageable for myself, money-wise or “even-more-attractive-title-on-resume”-wise, that would make me very happy. Still, I’m not sure if it’s worth the fight. 

TLDR; My older freelance coworker with much less responsibility and experience recently accepted a full time offer with a higher title.

We found out some information about my in laws in regard to my 2 year old and just completely disregarding her safety/putting her in horribly unsafe situations. Long story short all hell broke loose when we put our foot down and basically now we no longer have a caregiver for our 2 kids. Which of course I don't want them back over there after finding out what we did and then them trashing my name because they can't watch the kids. Horrible!

Well I've been at my first RN job since graduating nursing school in December. I've only been there 5 months and technically under a 2 year contract. I've been trying to find a reason to leave because it's just such an unsafe place to work and I worry about my license all the time. But now I'm having to quit to be there for my kids. I gave my two weeks a couple of days ago. My manager called and said they required 4 week and if I left before then I'd be unhireable. I emailed back telling her I'm giving my 2 weeks. I don't even have child care for the next 2 weeks let alone 4. I have quite a bit of PTO saved up but I'm nervous to call out since she already made a comment about me calling out 2x. Just worried about being able to get another job after this. Having a hard time finding anything else for RN that doesn't require at least 1 year experience.

1g9zzd6,Am I due for a raise?,"Hey everyone, looking for some advice on if I should consider asking for a raise. I currently work as a sales manager for some online florist brands our ""office hours"" are 9-5 monday to friday however the sales team works 8-8 monday to sunday so I need to be available and monitoring in case there are any emergencies that come up which I do. My job responsibilities incude the following:

Managing and overseeing all of my team leaders and agents, monitoring call volumes, monitoring and agents sales metrics and productivity, hiring of new agents, coming up with new ways to boost conversions, sales, and productivity, daily, weekly, and monthly reports on sales metrics, setting realistic goals for my agents and teams, scheduling all sales agents, and just dealing with the day to day crap like annoying messages all the time in a timely maner. 

I started working with them about two years ago and was initially managing about 10 sales agents with a salary of 50k. I was given a raise to 65K at the beginning of 2024 as the company grew and I was at the time managing around 50-60 agents. Now fast forward to today and I currently have a team of 185 agents and team leaders that I am overseeing. Obviously the team and company is growing at a fast pace and I know the company is profiting a lot of money at this point however the work load is obviously increasing for me and my team as well. It has only been about 10 months since my last raise but my team has almost tripled in size since then and I feel like due to my efforts the sales team is thriving.

1g9zvy3,Due for a career change!,"I'm 25 years old and grew up without much exposure to the internet, in an environment where blue-collar work was seen as the path out of poverty. I went to trade school for four years and earned my high-voltage electrical license by the time I was 23. For the last two years, I've been traveling and working, making $3k-$4k a week with 70-80 hour work weeks.

Although the money was great, I always felt numb about the work—not sad, but never fully satisfied either. The highest-paying jobs are always in rural areas, which is where I spent most of my life. That changed when I worked a job three hours away from Chicago, and I got a taste of big-city life. I fell in love with the energy of the city, and on my days off, I'd drive there, have fun, and make friends, many of whom worked from home.

One night, while hanging out with a friend who worked in sales, I met his brother, a network engineer. I was curious about his work, and he gave me a glimpse into what he does. Although I didn’t fully understand it at the time, it intrigued me. Back at my hotel, I started watching YouTube videos like ""A Day in the Life of a Network Engineer,"" and I noticed how it related to the low-voltage work I was familiar with. I kept digging deeper, learning about different protocols, and slowly got hooked.

Now, I’m working on my A+ certification and moving on to my Network+. I’m seriously considering changing careers, but I’m trying to figure out the best road map for doing so.

1g9yt1k,Should I be worried?,"I was pulled into an investigation and asked many questions.

Regarding the allegations presented to me today, it was stated that I made sexual jokes and talked of my previous sexual experiences to co-workers.

It was stated that I mentioned my SO calls me “Daddy” in the bedroom.

It was stated that I had sex the prior weekend or spoke about specific sex positions doggy style that were tried.

It was stated that I had a conversation with a co-worker about a person that I was dating who was being “wishy-washy” in response to my advances toward them. 

It was stated I believed they had a fantasy where they liked to be forced into sex, without giving consent.

I am mostly isolated to myself, there is one co-worker who works in my corner. I have not had these types of conversations with them, or anyone else. It’s a sour atmosphere in the shop, in general. A lot of people do not talk to me because of the other investigations I've been in and people tend to not want to get wrapped up in anything.

It was stated I asked a co-worker mid-August 2023 “Is it gay if you taste your own semen?”

It was stated in October or November 2023 I made a comment about a person jokingly referring to the size of my penis being small.

I am on Tinder but I never told anyone at work, to “swipe right” if they found me on Tinder. I have absolutely never been in a personal relationship with any coworker and I have never asked anyone out.

A coworker asked in September 2023 to goto dog park, with our dogs. They asked just me no one else. I never went. 

Coworker also knew I liked to go on hikes and they mentioned maybe the two of us could go on a hike.

In October/November 2023, They asked me, and my SO, to go to a football game. We did not go.

I had a conversation at work with co-workers, about religion and politics I made a comment that the Republican party was supporting homophobia and racism. 

I remember having a conversation about religion I do remember saying the Bible was contradictory. That conversation I told them I have an Anubis statue and I am into Egyptology, I was called an Atheist by the co-worker.

I then stated If a few of these allegations came from August to October 2023, wouldn’t they have brought this up in anything of the prior investigations? 

All these questions were very vague and did not state a time, place, or area where they occurred, the person also stated some questions were asked to see if I was being truthful.

** I was sexually harassed, assaulted, and retaliated against before this happened previous investigations I referenced, which was substantiated and now I believe these were thrown at the wall to see what could stick.

Do I have a case if I'm terminated or could I be terminated?

1g9x20v,Salary negotiation after an internship advise ,"
Hi everyone!

I’m currently 1.5 months into my 3-month internship at an agency that focuses on advertising, content creation, and web design for large companies. Overall, I enjoy the work—I do everything remotely with flexible hours. My position is videography intern, but in fact I handle motion graphics and animation, and I’m the only one in the company doing that type of work.

Recently, I received a job offer to continue working after my internship, while I’m still taking classes at university. However, the offer was disappointing. They want me to work the same amount of time I currently do but for a lower salary—1000RM compared to my current 1300RM during the internship.

After doing some research, I found that the minimum salary for my position is around 3000RM. I plan to ask for 2500RM, anticipating they’ll negotiate down to 2000RM. I also learned from other interns that they were initially offered 1000RM for their internships, while I was originally offered 800RM, but I negotiated up to 1300RM based on my skills.

Any advice on how to approach this salary negotiation? Thanks ",Intelligent-Golf-174,1,1.0,1,1729641944,2024-10-23 00:05:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g9x20v/salary_negotiation_after_an_internship_advise/,10,2024

My pay structure is 55% fixed and 45% variable, based on hitting certain targets. Since January, I've been asking for my targets, but the company has kept me in the dark until now, only just providing a variable comp plan with the *exact same targets* as last year.

I’ve been doing my best within my role, but without any clear targets, it’s been impossible to stay focused and understanding what I should be working towards.

I previously raised concerns with both my boss and HR that setting retroactive goals this late in the year would be unfair, but they’re pushing forward with it anyway.

1g9wxac,Stuck between two options,"Hello, I am stuck in a dilemma at the moment because I have two choices too make and both sound really good but I don't know which one to follow. I'm currently 16 and find a job is hard enough so finding a job in the field I'm currently in trade school for is even harder (I'm in automotive technician (mechanic) classes) and a few days ago I started cold calling places nearby me to see if any would hire me, all but one said no.   
  
The one that said yes was an older man in his 60s, he owns his own shop working with only him and his (part time) son, this is a smaller family owned business and due to that he can't pay me as much as the big shops can and it'd be a different type of pay then hourly, per job pay or something like that. He said he would be able to pay me 12 per book hour which is minimum wage and this is because it isn't a big dealership shop where theres enough bays and techs for just a few lube techs who only do oil changes and etc, instead I would be doing various types of jobs ranging from changing the oil, to advanced jobs, either way he would have to train me on anything more complex then an oil change, and thus the reason for a lower pay, in the time he could get the job done 3 times over is the same time it takes to train me on the job. He seems like a great man and really seems like he would be a great boss. I would start late this week as he says that he's willing to give it a shot even though it will take time to train me and he will adjust the hours of the store to accommodate for school and everything.

A bit of backstory for this option, I had a tire blowout one day so we had to get it replaced here and when he (the store manager, who I will abbreviate to SM), asked how I knew a bit about cars I told him and he said come back when I graduate (that's what me and my mom heard). Anyhow, today the SM walked in to where my mom works today to get some food and he talked to my mom about how he had to fire a few technicians and he needs some more, and he mentioned that he wanted me to come in to apply. My mom asked him and apparently he never said or meant to say something else when he said I can apply when I graduate. He said he could start me out at around 15 dollars an hour, and the shop is much closer than the other one in the first paragraph. He would personally supervise me and before he talked to my mom he had guaranteed me that I would be the highest paid technician after I got my ASE certifications on the day he said to come back when I graduate. I also think this would be a great option because he seems like a great boss as well and the shop is closer, with better pay. 

My biggest part of this dilemma is that I really don't want to miss out on the opportunity of the first guy and he seems like he is really willing to give me a chance especially because I am enthusiastic about the trade, but the second option has better options for career advancement and also is in a bigger type of shop with better equipment and a full structure, I planned on going to the second option after I graduate anyways but I could start now so I am further into the ranks than I would be if I started when I graduated.

What’s up everyone, I’m potentially facing a very difficult decision. 

Little background: i am 4 years into my first consulting gig, working for a somewhat smaller, local Technology Consulting company. I’ve mainly done PM work for a Relational Data Base Project and more recently for a Medicaid Data access project. My client for both project has been DOH for my state. This work is pretty low intensity and my workload is very reasonable. 

I am getting closer to a promotion here, which should put my salary around 112k base with a 12-15 percent bonus. Promotions are given every September, but nothing is guaranteed. 

 The new gig: the new role is with PCG, which is much larger, nation wide, and has 3-4k employees. I’d be an Independent Verification and Validation consultant working on Tech/software like projects, and doing business development work. There gig will pay around 120 and also have a 12-15% bonus. 

I have a 13 week old son, so this is going
To be challenging year for me in general. The pay bump would be massive, but the likely additional workload is scary. I also should not my current job has very good benefits, so i will be taking that into consideration if i get the offer.

1g9wn4t,"HR threatened me for having a problem with a promotion, advice?","This is actually for my gf, but she doesn't have Reddit so I'm seeking advice on her behalf.

We're in Georgia, if that matters.

A few months ago she got a job at a law firm in Atlanta. The job is basically an entry level assistant who, after a few months, can be promoted to basically being a specific department assistant.

Including my gf, there are currently 3 of the entry level assistant who do a variety of tasks for the entire firm. A few weeks ago she was approached by HR (a specific person, the same one who on-boarded her) and was told she was up for promotion.

The core problem is the time at which she is supposed to come in. Currently, (as in is on her contract) she goes in at 9:30. This position would be a new contract having her come in at 8:00 (the department head actually wants her in at 7:00 but 8 is already earlier than almost anyone else in the frim comes in). The conflict for my gf is that she carpools with our roommate who works on the same building at a different company. It's a long commute (about an hour most days) and parking for the building is expensive, her firm does not cover parking but his company does, basically it's a lot of money she would be out if she was moved to 8 (which, based on what she's heard from others at the firm it is likely the department head will put a lot of pressure on her to come in at 7 at that point). Aside from the money, there's also the issue of this having never been discussed before.

**Here's the sticking point:** Last week's she told the same HR position about the time issue, and that person basically told her it was okay, that the people at that position are generally only contracted for 9 AM, etc. Basically she was really nice about it. Today, that same person did a whole 180, cornering my gf and telling her that the time can't be budged, and that if she does not take this promotion then there ""won't be room for her at the company."" 

My guess is that the department head basically put pressure on the HR person to get my gf to fold. 

For some added context, there are other issues with this promotion. It's an open secret at the firm that this particular department head does certain things (expense reports, time reporting) in a way that is not by the book and may in some cases be illegal, as well as generally being a bully to the people under him. 

At this point we're basically at if they don't back down on forcing her into this position then she will likely be putting in her notice. 

Is there anything else that can be done? The rest of the firm is apparently not as bad, and she'd be happy to work in pretty much any other position. Plus the pay is really good, so she doesn't actually want to leave this firm.

Any advice is appreciate.",Hormo_The_Halfling,3,0.6100000143051147,30,1729640746,2024-10-22 23:45:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g9wn4t/hr_threatened_me_for_having_a_problem_with_a/,10,2024
1g9vymy,Getting an HR Role with non-traditional recruitment experience.,"I'm looking for the best ways to get into a corporate HR Role. I have been recruiting for 4+ years in the real estate industry, managing the full lifecycle. My problem is that I don't have my degree and Real Estate Recruiting seems to not be widely recognized.

I dropped out of college (was getting my degree in Biology on a pre-med track) because I no longer saw myself going into that field and being financially independent, I didn't want to continue to go into debt when I was unsure of my future. I ended up working for a Real Estate Company that puts heavy emphasis on recruitment and ended up being good at it and enjoyed the relational aspect! I have been working as a 1099 contractor running my own recruitment business for the last year.

Should I go back and finish my biology degree? Do I go back and get a communications, business or a different major? Should I get a HR Certificate of sorts?

1g9vveg,Should I Jump Ship? ,"Current situation (for 3 years):

Job - Field Sales

Pay - 100k base/30k bonus (bonus hasn't come in two years due to poor economic activity in our sector)

Environment - Pretty laid back management wise. I set my own schedule, do what I need to do, only meet with my boss once every couple weeks to catch up. Work from home, but traveling 2-3 days a week to customer locations as needed.

Prospective Situation:

Job - Field Sales

Pay - 110k base/50k-60k bonus

Environment - Unknown but the company was sold into a corporate environment recently. Work from home, but traveling 2-3 days a week to customer locations as needed.

The big reason I am considering a new job is that the last 9-10 months, meetings have been more frequent with upper management as our sales numbers are not where they'd like them to be as a business unit. This has caused two new sales training programs they've put us through, increased clerical work reporting our day to day actions, and a more defined set of KPI's (meetings, lead time response, new business acquisition, etc). I have the best numbers on my team, but I'd say I'm the second or third best sales guy (team is 10 people). As far as job security goes, I don't feel like I'm in a bad position, but there's an obvious need for change or else consequences from upper management. My concern is that they could eliminate the entire team (and product line) in one swoop and I'd be SOL. The tone in general has just been bad and while I keep grinding away, it feels like I'm constantly having to worry if I'll have a job on Monday.

The thing I'm looking at is a $10k base raise isn't very significant for switching jobs, but the bonus package is substantially larger if I hit my KPI's and sales goals. The reality is if I take this job at $110k, I'm more or less locked into that salary range for two years before I can start looking for a higher paying role either within or elsewhere.

From the past few months, my company is not doing so well. To the point of laying off half the company. I survived, but don’t know for how long.

My degree is technical (physical science field), and was hired to work on laboratory systems to automate tasks. So doing a bunch of hardware and software. The caveat is the company had no senior engineers and had to figure everything out on my own, developing solutions which were not the most robust and work to some extent, but are far from industry standards.

Now, after 3+ years in this company, I’m starting to look out at other jobs, and can’t help but feel anxious about where to go next. This job left me alone to figure things out, and didn’t provide any real formal guidance. To top it off, I have been switching hats at this startups between technical and non technical roles, even doing marketing and business development tasks.

I’m anxious thinking that I’m not prepared to go up the ladder in any career path, as this job gave me a lot of breadth, but no depth in any areas. In this world with highly specialized professionals, do-it-alls are not that sought-after.

Kind strangers on Reddit, what can you recommend I do next? For example, I’ve been practicing LeetCode to potentially dive more into software engineering.

1g9usu3,Sales/Account Management or Gas/Plumbing,"Hi all,

I would really appreciate your help in deciding the best career step for my future.

My current situation is as follows:

I (24M) am currently working for a nationwide electrical firm that specializes in testing and repair work, and I’ve been with the company for around 3.5 years. I started as a lead generator and was promoted to Business Development Manager, earning £25k basic + £10k commission annually.

I enjoyed working at the company when I was first promoted, as I excelled naturally in sales. At that time, it was a family-owned business, which led to various opportunities and a good working environment. However, a couple of months ago, the company was bought out by an investment firm, and most of the staff, including myself, have become dissatisfied with the job and management.

Last year, the company sponsored me to complete a Level 3 Team Leading and Management course, which I now have under my belt. I’ve stayed with the company longer than planned, partly because I’ve heard that changing jobs every 3 years is important for maximizing your earnings and growth.

Currently, there are no additional perks such as WFH or a company car, which I could likely get if I moved to another company.

About my background and qualifications:

I studied plumbing at college and earned my Level 1 and 2 qualifications back in 2018. I even found an apprenticeship but didn’t stick with it because my boss was difficult to work with. I’d say I have around one year of plumbing/heating experience, but that’s not much.

Current thoughts:

I have around £6k in savings and can save £1k a month since I live with my mother. I’ve been thinking about starting a gas course with Brookhouse Training in Bradford, which guarantees a placement to complete your work portfolio and generally looks like a good deal, though it doesn’t guarantee a job at the end. The course costs £5.5k and runs over 20 weekends. Once completed, I’d go on a work placement (unpaid) with a gas engineer for 18 weeks to build my portfolio, and the last 2 weeks consist of exam preparation.

I’m unsure whether to invest my savings in the course, using the rest to live on during the 18-week work placement, or if I should stick to sales/account management and try to move to a better firm.

All advice is appreciated—thank you in advance.",Sizpopski,1,1.0,0,1729635583,2024-10-22 22:19:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g9usu3/salesaccount_management_or_gasplumbing/,10,2024

Anyway, I know the email is about me, because the rest of my coworkers wear heels all week. I'm just not that type of person... But, whatever, they want to punish me for it - I will take all the money I'm not paid and/or that goes to taxes, and I will buy a $60 pair of boots that I cannot afford to appease the HR Gods because they believe they are that special. Moving on...

This caused me to take 2 days off of work because I deal with too much bullshit doing my boss's grunt work, talking to supervisors who never give me correct or timely information, to get an email about fucking shoes. I think it's arbitrary, I think HR has too much time on their hands as there are less than 10 of us in the office, and I think corporate America is just a huge personality mismatch for me. But I'm not sure there is any work environment that's a match for me...

I want to aspire to more, do more, make an impact, make a difference, and enjoy my work. I do not want to be constantly nagged, micromanaged, I do not want to be spoken down to, or asked ""Can you tell me what button to slick next since you need to be paying attention to this?""

I am burnt out. I'm feeling underappreciated and I feel as though all efforts to educate myself to get out of this financial hole as a widowed 30yo will be entirely vain if I do not leave the job I'm in right now. I feel like I am a chained animal trying to chew my own foot off to escape.

I want a job where I am constantly learning, constantly finding new ways to apply concepts or researching ways to fix a problem I have. My job right now is of very little consequence or importance. It is actually so insignificant and unimportant that, 4 days after the email, I am pissed about it still.

I'm just tired and I want a path to a career that will pay me while I'm learning new, fun, interesting shit. Not sitting in an office of a family owned business surrounded by people who think they are much more important than they actually are.

1g9sljk,Carpenter to Civil Engineer?,"Hi,

What is the best way to transition into Civil Engineering?  
Do you have any other advice for an alternative career you think would best suit?

\*I do not want to go into ‘site management’.

I understand Level 3 qualifications such a A Levels are fundamental for any type of engineering. I am willing to work towards this in order to achieve a better life.

Background/Current:

I am 29, male and live in the U.K. Whilst at school I achieved 6 GSCE’s and 2x Level 2 OCR National GCSE’s in both IT & Business Studies both graded Distinction. When I finished secondary school I went straight into a carpentry apprenticeship as I was very passionate about woodwork, especially joinery. I am currently 12 years into my Carpentry career and have ran my own business for the past 8 years, in the last 5 years I’ve organised my own work, gained my own clients and have an industrial unit for my workshop, where I design, make and install bespoke furniture. I handle the CAD & design work, the making, installing, client meetings and quoting. I also spreadsheet my business and use outlook to maintain customer communication and implemented a system where clients can book their own appointments.

I run the social media side of the business for marketing and advertising. I also created the website for our portfolio and booking system. I used Wix but you’ve still got to spend endless hours making it look professional and appealing to the type of cliental you’re looking to advertise towards.

Reason:

Due to the current state of the economy here in the U.K and globally. People are not spending what they used, on high-end bespoke items.  They’re increases across the board from the monthly lease, cost of material, energy etc. I cannot increase the income, and the competition is very tight, with many people under-cutting quotes just to stay afloat. This drives the overall market price down and people’s perception of what things should cost down further.

The work-life balance just isn’t worth it anymore. The stress and annual return of the job once you account for your overheads just isn’t worth it anymore. After putting my all into this career and passion, I am burnt out and wish for a better life.",Ambitious_Equal_1603,2,1.0,1,1729629904,2024-10-22 20:45:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g9sljk/carpenter_to_civil_engineer/,10,2024
1g9sgdr,"I was just fired after a month after receiving positive feedback. This is the second time this has happened to me, and it's when other women are in charge.","Sorry for the wall of text. Also, this is NOT a call for sexist explanations.

I (36WF) work in a niche part of local government emergency services/public safety in America (not police or paramedics but a secret third thing). I came to this new job a month ago with several years of experience, certification, and an advanced degree. The work was easy for me and I was impressed with everyone's knowledge and skills. My direct supervisor praised my reports and her supervisor kept saying he'd fast track me through training since I know my stuff. Then, on Friday, my direct supervisor escorted me to the executive's office to fire me. Though they kept saying, ""we don't need to give you a reason since you were on probation,"" they cited ""insubordination"" and ""not a good fit."" No prior warnings, no indications that I'd done anything wrong. They seemed furious with me. They had already packed up my desk and walked me to my car.

Besides being devastated, I am trying to understand why this seems to be a pattern for me.

The first time, I was new to the field, fresh out of grad school. I was praised for my writing and how fast I worked. But within months my (female) supervisors were criticizing my every move. They came down harshly on me and two of my female coworkers with the same educational background. After two and a half years they found a policy I'd technically violated a year prior and showed me the door. (They did the same to another of us - she was a combat vet and they made her cry!)

I lasted two years at my next job. My supervisor was a man who was very supportive of me (and also with a lower level of education), but a woman who'd been there a long time but was not in a position of authority kept lashing out at me for not asking ""permission"" to perform very basic job functions. Then another two women, one of whom I'd considered a friend after a year of working together, made a bullshit report of discrimination to HR. My supervisor knew it was bullshit and did not escalate the matter further than the initial meeting. I found a new job (this most recent one) about six months later.

*None of the criticism against me has ever been about how well I actually do the job.*

The common denominator (besides myself) is that these women have, on paper, fewer qualifications than I do. The other is that, in the genuine spirit of wanting the job done right, I tend to question the way things are done. I **guarantee** that I have only ever been professional and non-combative in what to me have been minor procedural disagreements. And I do mean **minor**. I've never gone above anyone's head. I've never shouted a supervisor down and said ""you're wrong, I'm going to do this my way regardless of your authority."" At the most recent job, the one time this happened I believe I said something like, ""That wasn't how I was trained. Can we ask someone?"" and then that person sided with me, and that was it. The only other incident was that they harshly pushed back on my use of worksheets, insisting that I enter call information directly into the computer. I insisted I needed them to stay organized and that I would formally ask HR to consider them a disability aid (ADHD). I find it highly suspect that I was fired a week after that discussion.

I don't care that my supervisors are less qualified! I'm not trying to compete with them! I've only ever cared about doing the job well and see the job as too important for egos. But I'm a terrible politician and forget that egos exist. (Some have suggested I'm on the spectrum because of this.) At this point I'm seriously considering a career change, but I love what I do. I just don't know how I can keep this from happening again without an understanding of *why* or shoving myself into such a tiny box that I never learn or grow. Why is it always other women, when all I'd want as a woman would be to see others succeed?",vieux-yeux,0,0.4699999988079071,140,1729629538,2024-10-22 20:38:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g9sgdr/i_was_just_fired_after_a_month_after_receiving/,10,2024
1g9sfcs,"Everything I've been working towards won't work out, I need to pick something else...?","Hello, this might be a little all over the place so bear with me. I grew up in poverty so money is a pretty big factor in my decisions. ""Good money"" to me is anything above 85k. I'm an extremely creative person and have many passions in creative hobbies, sewing, film, and writing. But in no way do I have any net to catch me if things do not work out if I try to indulge myself in one of those paths. I have dreamt of the day since I was young when I do not have to constantly worry if I'll have enough money to feed myself for the rest of the month. So despite everything in me wanting to live the creative life of my heart, I enrolled in a pre-health major, with the intent of going into radiology. Two years in a community college and I'd be making 70-90k in a few short years. It has been debilitating. I've had to stop all my passions and put all my energy into this subject which I am terrible at. (i hate you a + p!!!). But I've been able to push through it with the constant reminder of why I am doing it. A steady job, a steady paycheck, and once I get past the studying, a job which I think I can be good at. This has been all going fine until it came to transfer to an actual radiology program. I had a slight inkling that this problem might turn up, but I wasn't sure, and honestly, I've been too drained to put the effort into it until it was time to. To complete said program, no matter the school, there are requirements that I'm not sure I'll be able to do. --- My parents had a child a couple of years ago, and despite our large age gap, we have grown extremely close. They are my best friend and I would do anything for them. The problem comes into play now- my parents in the past 5 or so years have changed their views on many many things, and are what some people would consider extremists. They are extremely against vaccines of any kind. (example: My eldest sister received a covid TEST through her work because everyone was testing positive, and when my parents found out they went ballistic and used it against her for weeks). If I continue the study I am in, I will basically be disowned by the family. My parents will not let me share food with my sibling if my sibling gets sick I will be blamed if I was on the premises and vaccinated, I will be constantly berated that I'm poisoned and my ""eyelids are going to fall off"", I most likely won't be able to give them little kisses on the cheek, and most heartbreakingly, I will be distanced from my younger siblings, whom I love very much. So in a desperate scramble, I am looking for advice and any other ideas people might have. I'm open to taking the risk and starting my own clothing line, I've considered the wedding industry, I'm interested in criminology, and there are many things, but I feel lost. Please be kind.

1g9s8hr,How long should I wait before following up with this job’s recruiter about scheduling an interview?,"Friday afternoon I was sent an email informing me that I was being invited to a final round interview with a company, and that I should send my availability for next week as well as the following week. I responded within the hour with my availability. 

It now being Tuesday nearing the end of the work day, I have not heard anything from the recruiter. At this point it seems as though the interview will not be this week, as they would give me max 2 days notice assuming they don’t send today after working hours. I don’t want to overthink this but I’ve run into scenarios before with recruiters who have poor communication, as well as ones who send me an “actually never mind the position has been filled” email a week or so later. 

Any recommendations for if/when I should follow up about scheduling the interview? Been unemployed 1.5 years and really hoping this is the one.

1g9rc3j,Bad time to change jobs?,"I’ve (male, early 20’s) been working at a company for around 3 years doing what is essentially quality control/assurance for construction contractors. For the last two years, I’ve really grown to hate this job, mainly because of the awful schedule but more so because of the absolutely pitiful pay and benefits. For some examples, my schedule for the next day comes out every night around 5:30, sometimes I wake up at 8pm one day and don’t finish with work until 4pm the next day and only get a day notice, some weeks I can’t even get 40 hours and there has been no sort of bad weather make up pay during hurricanes or anything like that despite my job being 95% outdoors, and my pay has only gone up a single dollar since I started in 2022 (I’d get paid the same amount if I worked at Walmart overnight). I recently got offered a job interview to be a Collection System Technician (sewer and water system) at another company and this is pretty much the only job that’s actually reached back out to me that I’ve applied for. This job would give me an immediate boost in pay, should supposedly be much better benefits, and will offer a more steady schedule that will allow me to actually plan my life and week around. Of course, this is all assuming I actually get the job after the interview.

Now, all of that may sound great and like a clear sign to move, BUT, the issue is that I am expecting a child towards the end of the year. My concern is that this interview with the new company goes well, I get the job, and now I have no insurance for said newborn when he is born and have no PTO/paternity leave to use being too fresh to the company. But, if I turn down this job now, I’m not sure if or when I get the next better job offer to get out of this job that has mentally and physically killed me for the last two years. So do I still go through and try to get out of this company, or should I be putting those plans on hold until my child is at least here and settled in to start moving towards the next chapter?

Additional information:
Not sure if this is necessarily useful but for reference to my qualifications, I have an associates degree, have lots of experience in different fields between heavy machinery use, food and beverage, management, water and sewer installation, computer aided drafting, among other fields and skills.
My child’s mom and I are not together and will be co-parenting, she will be mainly home with him for the first few months so I’m not necessarily worried that he won’t be taken care of, but I’d like to be there to help out and make things easier on her for the first few days/couple weeks as much as I can.

TL;DR: Hate my current job, got offered a job interview, not sure if it’s a bad time to switch jobs with a child being due by the end of the year.",Then-Guide-6418,1,1.0,1,1729626798,2024-10-22 19:53:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g9rc3j/bad_time_to_change_jobs/,10,2024

1g9q54c,Career change alert! What job should I realistically aim for given my situation?,"I'm nearing 30 and ready to say, fuck it, let's do something different. I have an English major and *almost* an MD in English Lit (damn dissertation!) but most of my work experience has been, randomly, in real state. 

Aside from assorted translation and copywriting gigs, I feel like I never put my degree to use, and now I'm getting that itch, which leads to the greater itch, which is quitting my job to write full time. But I'm not THAT far gone yet. I'd settle for a job that's at least English major-adjacent. 

Now, as part of this 3rd decade crisis, I'm willing to make big life changes, even moving wherever in pursue of this mythical job. But what can it be? I don't know how well my experience in the real state industry will translate to, say, marketing. I'd love to do something with translation, maybe technical translation (English-Spanish), but again, my CV is very light on that.

1g9plq9,Should I stop dreaming?,"Hi guys. 

Is the first time I write here after some time reading in the shadows, I will try to be brief.

I have extensive experience in hotel maintenance. I was a supervisor, and now I am a kind of manager. It is a job I enjoy, and I have been sending my CV, more than 20 years of experience in related fields, to Maldives resorts for close to a year. My sister is working in a Local island as well.

I have never passed the first step, not a single interview with HHRR. I contacted them on LinkedIn, but they did not reply. I try and try, I am starting to be angry, you can see the CVs of some workers there and is depressing, honestly.

Next week I have an interview to work in an Estate, this is Scotland, the salary could be good, 30 min driving from home, could be ok, I do not want to leave that dream but I see that is nearly a joke, not saying I am the best or I am the only one.

Stopping that career in Hotels makes me feel like no chance for an opportunity in Maldives and I do not know what to do.

What would you do? Does anybody has experience even in Maldives or know how things are there?

1g9phsn,Leaving a Job I just Started/Finances ,"Throwaway for obvious reasons...
I'll give some background to make the story piece together better.

I, (F18) moved out with my boyfriend and went 2 1/2 hours to a pretty well known college town to continue my education. My previous retail job was great & I made enough money to buy a car in full earlier this June. I moved in August and have been actively job searching since then. I've put in around 25-30 applications to many different businesses in town and even sent follow up emails. Crickets. Started worrying about money since I pay half rent, my car insurance, my phone bill, plus half the groceries. 

Should mention that my boyfriend has a full ride to said college and gets a shit ton of money in refunds per semester so he doesn't work. I would never leech off his money and want to have my own independent money lol. 

I got an interview at this clothing store at our local mall. I wouldn't call it a big name store however there are a good amount of their stores in my state. Immediately got red flags from the interview. I went in and the interview was in the middle of the store on a FaceTime with management, they were paused on the call and I was just speaking to a phone screen. Maybe thats common but every interview I've had was way more organized and ""professional"" I guess. I took the job because I am extremely in need of money. Not completely at the end of my savings but I have enough to last another 3 ish months, not including emergency costs like car repairs, vet bills for my 2 cats etc. 

My issue comes when I was told that I would be alone in this huuuge store (compare it to a mid sized dollar tree/dollar general in America) from 10-8pm. I worked alone previously and had no problem but I was also in control of a way smaller store. The job was also advertised as a part time job and I said multiple times I only wanted to work 20-25 hours a week. There are also a lot of policies here that I feel are sketchy but I won't mention them because the business is pretty known for them. This is my first week here and I have 38 hours lined up for this week. I mentally can't do this as I am a full time student online. I feel like this is selfish of me since I've finally gotten a job and a lot of hours after months of searching however I know I should value my mental health and social life first rather than being a slave to a company who doesn't care about me. 


Another worry is that when I get out at night it is PITCH black outside and the parking lot is completely empty. The mall is in a shady area and I don't feel safe as a young girl walking 100ft to my car every night. 


I've talked to my mom about this for hours and she is also worried for my safety as well as all my other concerns. She wants me to quit immediately and keep looking. I would honestly rather work at starbucks or a fast food chain for less money compared to this job. I'm going to continue putting in applications and start going in person to the business with my resume.


I guess I'm just looking for advice, is it shitty for me to quit after a week? I need the money but not so bad that I'm willing to risk getting shanked in the parking lot when I get off. 😭

1g9owop,Second round interview with company president- how to prepare?,"Hi Reddit,

I applied for what’s pretty much a dream job last week on Tuesday. Last week Wednesday, I had a screening call with their HR department, and then a first formal interview (via Zoom), yesterday (Monday) morning.

Yesterday afternoon, they reached out to schedule a next round interview for the week of November 4. The panel for this next interview will include their President (it’s a small company of ~50 employees), the President would be my boss’s boss.

I feel like I’ve been making good, positive progress so far. Things are moving along at a nice pace, and I assume they don’t waste their president’s time with candidates they’re not serious about. And getting called back the same day as an interview to schedule the next one is also probably a green flag.

I’ve never been in an interview with a company president before, and in general have been intimidated by the presidents at my previous companies.

Does anyone have advice on how best to prepare? Stories of their own experiences?

I'm an Electrical Engineer responsible for designing systems and getting them approved by local jurisdictions. I'm a one-person department which is very, very unusual in my field. I helped my current employer grow over 5 years to a point where they needed to expand their engineering team, but they refused to despite having a profitable year, way more than most years.

1g9olw6,6 months in..?,"I’m sure this situation has a clear answer, but I am a very anxiety-ridden person that absolutely hates conflict and uncomfortable conversations. 

I have been at my remote job for 6 months. It’s entry level and I am not entry level (it was not a very strategic move, admittedly. I was blinded by the offer). I was contacted by one of my old managers last week who is close with the director of another department at her company. My old manager recommended me for an open position in that department and they offered it to me, sight unseen without applying. This position is about $15k more than I’m making and is a much higher level position, plus it’s a state job. I know it would probably be a bad move to not accept it, but that brings me to my concern of telling my current job. 

My supervisor here really likes me and always tells me how great of a job I’m doing, which I do appreciate. I have quite a necessary job here (granted most of it is busy work because it’s entry level) because the department consists of just her and I. She always tells me how overwhelmed she was before she hired me and how me being here really helps her out. The idea of leaving makes me feel SO BAD, and I have not a clue how to approach that conversation. I’m almost ashamed to leave because I’ve been here 6 months and I know I am helpful.

1g9mxk2,Ideas on the Next Big Industry Within 20+ Years?,"I'm a 23 year old car salesman, looking to go into a different industry. I hate being a car salesman, and the dealership model. The salesman are kept ignorant because managers get to look at the backscreen, so you have to play a game with the customer to make money. The customers hate it, I don't see how when my generation and the generation after me comes into age and money this model will go the way of electronic sales, and just fade away and die. 

My question is, what's the next big industry? What industry would just take off due to the rise in block chain and electric vehicles? Any others industry's I might be missing? Maybe suppliers to those industry's? Like how when Rockefeller took off he would have needed the railroads to transport, so that industry became profitable. 

 I like to read into the gilded age, and our current age, and how these people who became rich started out. Most of them started out low or relatively low and just so happened to be in an industry that took off. I'm not saying I'm going to be the next Rockefeller, but a rising tide lifts all boats. Sometimes it's pure luck that you go into the right industry and you just end up building wealth. I think of how Nvidia was just a graphics card designer and now they are one of the richest companies, how Apple just made computers and now they are one of the richest. In the gilded age, the oil industry was small, it went from Kerosene lamps to now everything is made of plastic essentially.

1g9meyq,"How do I find my purpose, my path. Which way to go?","I have not planned ahead to write this, I’m writing out of pure desperation and hope. I’m looking for advice/help from people that enjoy life, and how to find purpose, your calling, your direction.

* ABOUT ME

23 years old, male. From Europe. Currently working at a job that does not provide any growth what so ever, been here the last 1,5 years. I’m tired of it and want to get out.

I’m friendly, warm and empathetic. I’m creative and generally a good human being (at least I hope so) although I’ve got flaws like everybody else. I deal with lots of anxiety stuff, you know… “what is she thinking about me”, “I’m ugly, I know they talk about me”, “I walk in a weird way”, “I need to be liked”. I can make this list far too long, but I’m doing you a favor by not doing the list the length of an Harry Potter book. But to make it short and sweet, thinking and anxiety takes up a big chunk of my life and I’m just trying to accept it.

I have a few close friends, and generally I would say I’m good with people, I’m likable as a person, at least I hope so (AnXiEtY). But these friends of mine and I are on a different path here in life, I want something else while they’re cool with dying in their hometown. Which is totally fine, but just the thought of it makes my panic spiral. Because time goes fast, next year I’m 24, I’m not young young anymore and it scares the shit out of me.

* WHAT I WANT OUT OF LIFE

This is a hard one. And it may differ depending on when I’m thinking about it. But I do have some main territories that seem to stick. On the long run I value a life of freedom, creativity and in some cases eccentricity. I want to be able to run freely and be totally me, don’t have the worries of other peoples perceptions of me, it’s garbage and I want it long gone. I’m interested in people like Bourdain, Hunter S Thompson and Van Gogh. Perhaps my interests in the “weird” have made an impact on me, I don’t Know and frankly, I don’t Care (To some extent I do care, anxiety). I value a life equal for all and a life worth telling my hopefully future sons and daughters about. I want to have experienced life to the fullest. Sounds cliche but it is how I depict it.

* INTERESTS OF MINE

For a long time, working out at the gym was a big interest of mine. But due to an surgery that made me unable to work out the way I wanted, I have put it on ice for now. Currently I would say that my interests are nonexistent. I work and I drink beer with the few friends at the weekend. That is basically what my life is now. And it’s getting tiresome, not that drinking beer isn’t fun. But going drunk to the same places with the same people gets boring. I could see myself going drunk to a bar in a foreign country with strangers that will become best pals for life at the end of the night.

I’m the creative type, I have sent in a few scripts to some production companies in my country but the constant no’s made my love for creativity, screenwriting and coming up with ideas come to a halt. But the love for it exists deep within, hopefully it can be dug out some time in the future.

* TIPS FROM EVERYONE

With this post I’m literally screaming in pure desperation to anybody out there. I need all, and I mean ALL the tips and tricks I can get. Small or big, everything is received with gratitude and love. And please, write to me for more in depth conversation. I’m aware that I’m not that good to get everything I want to say down on paper, or in this case, the mobile screen.

Thank you for your time!

1g9lphi,Making the next move - PM to director ,"So I work in a highly specialized trade contracting for utilities. I currently have about $35M in active revenue projects ongoing. about twice that completed in the last year and a half- still considered a PM, haven't gotten that senior title yet. I'm at the point in my life with my work experience and background where I really shouldn't be stuck in the PM bubble anymore. Anyway I expressed this to my current employer and while they are willing and interested in restructuring in order to bump me to director level operations, there's obviously no timeline for it. 

Current promotion outlook is probably 2-3 years unless someone leaves or is fired.

We have a sub we work with who I've known for about a decade. Much smaller company with really no leadership or management structure. They're stable and established, just looking to make that jump from ~50 employees to over 100. They're on the cusp of no longer being a family owned company if that makes sense.  

This company offered me as a PM / director of Ops hybrid. With the intent of me basically reorganizing their processes and laying the foundation for future growth. I'd be working directly with the owner. They've been successful so far due to our line of business - fairly easy construction work for subs, extremely demanding for the prime contractors. So I feel like having been successful with all the difficult prime contractor work I should be set up fairly well to succeed. 

I'm already leaning more towards leaving for the new role, it's a big risk, but I'm still young, ambitious, and honestly I love the idea of being at the ground level of an up and coming company.

1g9lb8c,PSA: You should be having a candid conversation about your progress with your boss at the end of the year,"If you care about moving up in your company, you should have a candid conversation with your boss at the end of the year.  Ask ""What do I need to do to get a promotion next year?""  Ask for specific feedback on what you actions you should start doing, what you should stop doing and what you should continue doing.

If you feel like you have reached those milestones... ASK FOR THE PROMOTION.  Or ASK FOR THE RAISE.

Your employer doesn't know that you want these things if you don't ask for them.  Your employer is not going to look out for your best interest if you're not doing it as well.  They're not going to give you a raise if you don't say you want it.  They're going to give that raise to someone else who did ask for it.

I see too many people post here saying they haven't gotten a raise in years.  This is how you avoid that situation.

1g9kq2h,No idea what I want to do?,"Hi there!! I’m never good at starting these things so I’ll just get into it.

I’ve been in the funeral industry for about 4 years. I finally decided to take the jump out of the industry because of the lack of work/life balance. I finally understood that a company simply won’t ever care if you’re not home with your family on holidays, or if you’re missing birthdays, weddings or funerals. I realized that a company won’t care if you died, it’s not going to shut down. It’s not going to grieve you. So I decided to leave and work a job that it wouldn’t be expected of me so do that. 

I took a job as a funder for a refinance company as a placeholder so I could find something I really wanted. This would give me the time to apply more thoroughly to jobs I actually want. The problem is, I don’t know of any career paths that would be as rewarding as the funeral industry was. I just want to be able to have a life outside of work and still make a difference in peoples lives. 

A lot of the jobs in counseling or other death parallel industries require degrees I don’t obtain. There’s one company that I keep applying to, but they usually reject my applications. I just think of it like I’ll keep applying until they either give me a job or tell me to stop. 

What would you do? What jobs can you recommend that are fulfilling and will make me happy? I know you’re not supposed to be thrilled to go into work everyday, and at the end of the day it’s just a job, but I really want something that I’m proud of, something that I’m passionate about.

1g9kpf3,Being pushed out by a work colleague ,"I work in a small company reporting to the CEO but my role is at mid director level. For a few months my boss has been saying he will promote me to an executive level with an office in December. 

In the last few months however there have been a lot of change management which has led to an executive also reporting to the CEO to take over the operations and reporting deadlines of the business are being done.  This has led to this person to be in line with CEO and make/influence decisions for the ceo. Part of my work blends with this execs new oversight responsibility and has taken over it completely.  

This exec is a micromanager, holds grudges and always talks bad about subordinates openly to my boss, colleagues and in meetings. Everyone is the problem except for their department. 

Before this change, I made a complaint to my boss about this execs director who was micromanaging me and spoke to me very rudely.  Since then, I have been excluded from important meetings, information that is relevant to my job.  My meetings with my boss are asking me weird probing questions about my work, how I do it etc. before he never had any issues with my work.  

I found out yesterday that the promotion is being pushed to January and I no longer am getting a office but it's being given to a new hire who is at the same level and will be promoted to VP. This new hire is very well liked by this exec. 

When I asked my boss he was like your promotion is still there you're still going to be VP but you have to deal with ambiguity for the next couple of months.

1g9kgba,Would it be wrong to leave my current job after 1 year? ,"I'm a graphic designer at an agency that has been extremely dysfunctional from the start. I would like to leave after my first year (which will be in January) soley for the fact of staying for AT LEAST one year, but I'm afraid it will look bad and employers won't consider me. 

I am confident in my abilities and am currently in the process of updating my online portfolio and making a few tweaks to resume. 

My whole objective is to grow at an agency where I can eventually become a senior graphic designer.

Of the 3 places I have worked in the past, I've been onboarded as a graphic designer but my duties almost immediately shifted to general marketing. I am well versed in marketing but I am not being paid for the additional work, and it's really weighing on me. 

My last position I stayed at for 1 year and 10 months and left for similar reasons. I'm not usually one to ""hop"", as my favorite position which was a mixture of graphic and web design I stayed at for 3 years, but I left as I relocated across the country. 

I don't know why, but ever since I moved to New England (from Austin, Texas) I have found a series of employers that looked great from the outside and interviewed extremely well but are flat-out unprofessional on the inside. 

My concern is that, if someone were to ask me why I am leaving my current position after only one year, it may not be enough to simply state ""my position duties shifted after onboarding"" and I don't want to speak negatively of my company, especially during an interview. 

What are your thoughts on this? Any advice?

1g9jz9j,Can I get a career In Finance with a criminal record?,"Hello everyone,

I'm seeking some advice and guidance regarding my situation and how it might impact my future career in the financial services industry.

A bit of background about myself: I'm a 23-year-old student currently studying Accounting and Finance at a Top Ten University. I’ll be graduating at the age of 25, making me somewhat of a mature student. My journey to this point has been quite unconventional.

When I was 18, I made a significant mistake that still haunts me. At the time, I was struggling to find a part-time job, and I knew a couple of people who were selling cannabis and making a bit of money on the side. It seemed like a good idea then, but looking back now, I realize how foolish it was and I take full responsibility for my actions. I ended up selling weed to my friends and people I knew.

One day, I was caught by the police with around 13 or 14 grams of cannabis and multiple small plastic bags, which clearly indicated I was selling it. I pled guilty as I was caught red-handed. Consequently, I was convicted of possession with intent to supply a Class B substance. 

Since then, I’ve worked hard to turn my life around. After moving to a different city, I enrolled in university but ended up dropping out after a year to start a recruitment business. I successfully ran this business for two years before selling my shares to my business partner. Now, I’m back at university, committed to building a career in finance, with dreams of working in investment banking, retail banking, commercial banking, private equity, or asset management.

My concern is that this criminal conviction, which occurred when I was 18, will jeopardise my chances of achieving my career goals. By the time I graduate, seven years will have passed since the conviction, but I'm worried it may still affect my employability in the finance sector.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation or know of someone who has? How might this past mistake impact my future opportunities, and is there anything I can do to mitigate its effects? 

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.

1g9eebh,Would it make sense to go part time at 30-yr old to have more time for mental health and try freelancing on the side?,"This year has been a rollercoaster to me and I’m frankly out of energy lol.

Last November I quit my old job, which was my first real job, after 6 years in the same position, working very hard, thinking about it 24/7 and taking on many responsibilities my manager was leaving behind. I was really good at that job, I felt valued by colleagues, and higher-ups tried to convince me to stay - but I was having problems with my manager, and she was untouchable (and unqualified, but that’s a whole other story), and they made it clear that I would get a promotion and pay raise but she would still be in the picture. So I made my decision and switched jobs, and so did many people on my old team since then. Plus, since it was my first job, I felt like it was important for me to grow and learn and try working someplace else to see what I could do with my skills.

I started a new job in December and I felt EXTREMELY out of place since the start. It did not help that I really missed my old coworkers, and the new ones felt “fake” in their approach to me. Despite completing all onboarding tasks with flying colors, I struggled a bit to understand what was expected from me and my role. I felt like my team lead did not like me and ultimately (against the team members’ will) she decided to “fail” me and I was laid off after my trial. This was in February, and I was lucky enough to go back to work just a month later since the owners of my first company also own another one - so I was hired there on the spot as soon as they knew I was “free”.

This “new” job is one many would probably consider very laid back. I’m in web/graphic/UI design and being in-house in a small company I don’t always have important or urgent stuff to do (but when I do, it’s always “urgent” to them lol) and my managers really like me. However, I still feel very lonely on the actual job lol. But most of all, I feel like I don’t even know if I actually like what I do and if I’m even actually good at it. I guess the failed job really really took a toll on me and I always, always hate what I end up doing and I feel like higher-ups, having known the “old” me that was eager to learn and try and grow, have super high expectations and that they must (or will) be extremely disappointed in me now.

I’m also not in a good place mentally, my self-esteem has always been low and my “old-old” job was the only thing that could make me feel useful or good about myself lol, until it didn’t and I decided to leave, hoping I would find that feeling again someplace else. But I guess that didn’t work lol. I work 9-6 and I feel like I don’t have enough time and most importantly enough energy (mental and physical) to take care of myself (I’m very out of shape), of my house (which is a burning mess), hobbies (I don’t even have them anymore) or relationships. I start most work days wondering what am I even doing, and if I’ll ever find something I actually like doing - both job-wise and in general - and having to fight back tears lol.

Even though I don’t feel like I belong or like this job, I’m grateful to have it since I’m getting married next year and we’ll probably need to buy a house soon after. My fiance works in retail and although he has a position in management, we both know I’m destined to be the main bread-winner in the house. So having a good job is really important for our future. I looked into it and by working 30hs instead of 40 a week (and assuming my company would allow it, of couse) I’d cut my salary of about 400€/month (net), about 5k/year. On my country’s average salary, that would not be considered “a huge lot” but not a small amount of money nonetheless. It’d be equal to a mid-low paying full-time job, just with fewer hours.

I was wondering if that may be worth it. I would probably initially use that extra time to rest a bit and exercise, clean my house, and try a hobby or learn more skills so that I could eventually confidently look into freelancing on the side. But I’m scared that going part-time at 30yrs old could be considered “lazy” by possible future employers, or that I would end up delaying important steps of my life (a new house, a possible child) because of money.

Realistically, is 5k/year (net) a number part-time freelancers with 6/7 years of experience would make in their first year? Would it even make sense for me to take this decision at this age considering I have plans that require a lot of money in the next years?",aizhana,1,1.0,0,1729590878,2024-10-22 09:54:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g9eebh/would_it_make_sense_to_go_part_time_at_30yr_old/,10,2024

1g9c3sb,I can’t quit my job but it’s killing me…,"I’ve worked at my current job for almost 6 years. I used to love it. Even a few years ago when things were a mess, I still felt okay with my job. Over the last year, after getting a new manager, I am miserable. My new manager is a mega micromanager. She’s extremely unqualified for the position (got the job cuz the manager above her is a friend) and she’s a bully.

I got promoted 4 months ago and since then it’s just been the worst. I can’t keep up with my day to day work because of the extra projects she gives me. Every day she changes processes without really understanding the process and why things are done the way they are to begin with. When I say it’s a daily thing, I mean daily. Things are constantly changing and it’s nearly impossible to keep up with how things are supposed to be done. One day it’s one way, the next it’s a different way and the next it’s something else. There’s literally no rhyme or reason for these changes. And she won’t ask for any input from people who actually know what they are doing. 

My team and the entire department have issues with her. My team is tired and frustrated and burned out. We’re actually considering going to HR as a team over this. We’re constantly criticized and blamed for everything. They’ll tell us other teams cannot do our job due to “segregation of duties” but then have no problem putting other teams work onto us. Prior to this manager, other managers never bothered us and just let us do our job. We are the strongest team in our department and most of the mistakes we get blamed for are not because of us. It’s insanity every single day. 

I get paid extremely well for what I do, I get to work remotely and they are flexible with my schedule. I have a 1 year old daughter and a lot of companies are pulling their employees back into the office. I might as well not work if I have to send my daughter to daycare. I also like everyone I have to work with. And everyone on my team I have worked for over 4 years. 

All the jobs that are similar to my current job are not close to where I live, not remote, and are paying between $5-$7 less than what I currently make. I just have to be at my current salary and be able to work remotely.

This job is affecting my mental health so much. I can’t sleep and I hate having to get out of bed to work. 

I’ve found maybe 2 jobs that fit what I am looking for but never heard back. I hope maybe a great job opportunity can come along. But until then I feel like I’m drowning. 

Any suggestions on how to just try to push through? ",Own_Ad_1990,23,0.9599999785423279,17,1729580345,2024-10-22 06:59:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g9c3sb/i_cant_quit_my_job_but_its_killing_me/,10,2024
1g9bzmu,What should I pursue - Marketing or Finance⁉️ Need your insights,"Hello, I'm 18 and from India. I will be starting degree college next year, and I'm currently in my gap year.

I'm in a very confusing phase, trying to decide whether I should pursue a career in Finance or Marketing, as I have an interest in both.

In Finance, I’m specifically interested in roles like Equity Research Analyst or Portfolio Management, and the best way to enter these roles is through the CFA program.

However, I’m not academically strong, especially in subjects involving problem-solving questions like math and statistics, which are a part of the CFA curriculum. After reviewing some quant questions from the CFA, I realized that I didn’t understand much.

Marketing, on the other hand, is a more result-driven and creative field, which better suits my personality. I've already completed a few courses on marketing along with a 3-month internship, which I really enjoyed. I for sure enjoy it, and if I get into it, I will deep dive and learn as much as I can while gaining practical exposure through internships. The only downside, from what I understand, is that marketing jobs tend to pay less, and I really want to earn good in the future.

My ultimate goal is preobably to work for a few years, gain experience, and then start my own business or agency, as that’s where I believe the real money lies.

**What do you think I should do, or how should I go about making this decision⁉️**  
  
The decision I make will also help me choose a relevant degree next year.

I’ll be speaking with an education/career counselor next month, but your thoughts would be really helpful in the meantime.",coolguyArmaan,1,1.0,1,1729579826,2024-10-22 06:50:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g9bzmu/what_should_i_pursue_marketing_or_finance_need/,10,2024

1g9bj5d,Which job would you pursue if you were in my shoes?,"I live in a small, rural town. I have no children, but my spouse has a secure career and relocation is not an option at this time.

Option 1: continue to work in-office at the small community bank I have been employed with. Growth opportunities are limited to none, because all of the non-frontline roles are occupied by ""lifers"" - people that stay until retirement, and then, the bank is keen on absorbing as many of these retiree's roles as possible. They are being replaced with multiple part-timers. I enjoy the work I do, and love the schedule, but the pay is low. New positions becoming available for full-time is very rare and competitive.

Option 2: accept a potential offer with a fully remote credit union. I have 1 final interview to go. Great initial interview. Same schedule as I currently work. The job pays 3% more than I currently make and I would be paid for breaks and lunches every day. However, would I recieve only half of the number of PTO days that my current employer provides. It would take me 4 years to build up the same number of PTO days that I have with my current employer. Additionally, my current employer will not allow me to work a 2 week's notice and I will be considered terminated immediately if I am going to a different financial insitition. I'm concerned about burning that bridge with my current employer.

Possible Option 3: accept a potential offer for a fully remote job with a local hospital in their Accounts Payable department. I have an upcoming initial interview with them, but in email correspondence they seem highly interested in me. I do not have formal accounting education, but the work I do at the community bank does involve me working closely with AP. I think I could be trained and pick up very quickly. It would also be at least a 3% raise (based on info provided by Glassdoor and Indeed) and would provide me with the same number of PTO days. I am uncertain on their holiday schedule, and intend to ask about that in the interview. 

I don't want to make a mistake in leaving a job I like with a great schedule. However, I don't want to waste time in a workplace that is not willing to invest in me and give me professional development opportunities, despite getting glowing reviews on every eval. The low pay, combined with inflation and economic chsnges, is also making budgeting increasingly difficult in our household. In my research, both credit unions and hospitals also seem to be much more stable in terms of job security.

I welcome any and all opinions to help me decide what would be best for my future. Thank you in advance.",probablyneedingghelp,1,1.0,7,1729577770,2024-10-22 06:16:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g9bj5d/which_job_would_you_pursue_if_you_were_in_my_shoes/,10,2024

1g9ari0,Am I being underpaid?,"I work for a small business in the US in one of the largest major cities in the country. I sat down tonight to run some numbers to see what's the exact revenue I bring to the company.

I work for a small business that has less than 10 employees, I sell second hand luxury items - not going into it much more than that. To boil it down: I am technically a ""sales"" person. The online platform where I sell things is exclusively managed by me. Intake of inventory, inventory management, repairs, photography, getting the items online, marketing, selling the items themselves, shipping the items, customer service: it is 100% my responsibility. It's a lot. It's a dense job with very expensive items and needy customers online. The duties themselves are simple in theory, straight forward, I'm treated with respect and have little complaints about the job itself - it's nice, but frankly I care more if I'm paid fairly than if I'm treated nicely. I generate a lot of revenue, have years of experience with these specific specialty items. This is not a job that anyone can do, I'm extremely consistent and hard working. My job requires a lot of competence, depth of knowledge and ability to handle a very wide variety of tasks. The owners are very content with my work, I'm the most profitable individual when it comes to sales and have boosted net sales beyond what has ever been done in the company before within a 12 month cycle. I practically don't make mistakes and I would be difficult to replace, but it would also be difficult to find another job like this -- again, it's a specialty business in an industry that is not just throwing money around aimlessly like tech, very few companies are able to do what we do in my city and finding a better paying job doing something similar would be tricky.

Ok let's get into it: so after commissions I am paid little over $30 an hour before taxes. Over the course of the last fiscal year, each hour that I work has generated $190 in net revenue on my sales platform alone after all costs of items, fees, shipping, literally everything before taxes paid on this revenue. So in short: I'm paid $30/hr and it nets the company $190/hr. My work accounts for about 20% of the businesses entire gross sales. We are very profitable and I require minimal effort to manage -- a couple hours a week at the absolute most, I'm strictly online and very self-sufficient within the company. I'm content at work, but would of course be happier with more money. The owners are happy. Are they too happy with the investment they make in me? That's what I'm here to find out.

1g9ahu6,Should I quit my job even though it is my first job in 3 years?,"Ok so I honestly don’t know if I’m just being a spoiled brat for wanting to quit this job 3 days in, or if I’m justified in wanting to quit so soon.

First off, I got hired within a week to work at my small town local grocery store (and only grocery store) working as a night shift deli clerk. And not only does my cousin work there but the  manger is my great aunt. So, I get pushed into applying by my family and next thing I know is I’m getting interviewed the very next day. I, of course, get the job and is set to work the very next day, which turns out to be a Saturday. 

My first day doesn’t go too bad but no one trains me because the management over the entire store told me the wrong hours and never said anything even when I walked in 3 hours early. Surprisingly things go ok and I get to leave early cause of the switch up of times I was told versus when I was suppose to come in. I thankfully get the next day off because most businesses in my town don’t open on Sundays. 

This brings us to today. I walk in at the right time and get immediately put in front of customers at the register and food bar where I have to then weigh and tag with the price. I got the hang of it pretty quickly, but as soon as the night to mid-day shift leaves, I am left with only one other person. You might think it’s not too bad until there are lines of people wanting food on the hot plate and people wanting a pound of sliced meat or cheese AND people wanting a personally made sandwich that we then have to toast for them. 

It is just rush after rush of people wanting specific item after specific item which has to be cut or bagged and then tagged with the price. Meanwhile, dishes are stacking up and fryers are going with food items that need to be prepared, cooked, and ready under the displayed cases to show off all the hot foods we offer. 

Finally when the rush slows down, I am left to do dishes and clean the fryers, while my coworker handles any leftover customers. By the time the dishes are done and everything is cleaned and wiped down it is already 2 hours after I was told my shift would end. I did get a 5 minute break but never got a lunch break, I didn’t even get time to go to the bathroom with how busy it was.

I am seriously considering quitting on the spot tomorrow because I feel like I’m getting paid shit for the work of two people. But I feel I can’t because they already had 2 people quit last week and 1 no show. Plus being related to the manager and the fact that it is the only grocery store in my home town I feel I can’t leave or everyone will hate me in my family and be judged by the whole town. Because everyone knows everyone in my hometown. I could always drive the next town over but it’s an hour away and would be such a hassle.

1g9842f,"If you have a boss that you don’t get along with, is it almost always a reflection of your work ethic?","

I can see how this is the common sense reason but from personal experience, I think there can be more to it. My mom was talking about a coworker who’s getting a lot of backlash from mgmt, she’s cried about it to my mom already. I think the coworker is doing very hasty things and says stuff that are only making it worse, my mom and other coworkers on the other hand seem to like that boss. My mom said the boss likes you as long as you do your job, another coworker came out to the one that cried to my mom and said she was also having a hard time with that boss but things improved when she worked better. 

Now my first role as a college grad, I had a bad experience at a former employer. I was very introverted and anxious, not to mention I didn’t have any close connections with my coworkers. When we got a new boss later, I liked him at first but noticed a few things about him that made me end up not liking him. I feel like he’d ask me too many questions, I would make it obvious that I didn’t want to elaborate and it came across as prying. Or when I would give more than advanced notice to take time off and he would find a reason to either use it against me or give me crap about it long after the fact. As someone that took her PTO very seriously, to the point that I had 80+ hrs of PTO available that was paid out when I left, it was uncalled for. Yes, I was nervous and deff wasn’t perfect but tried to show I worked hard in other aspects. When a coworker made a comment towards me in a meeting, he didn’t say anything but when I did the same to another coworker to get even, he scolded me. 

My dad had evil bosses, worse than my former one and my mom’s coworker, so I don’t think it’s always a reflection of you. Can it be a lot of time? Well yeah.

1g97zot,Is it worth leaving my job without another lined up?,"
I recently hit coast fire status at ~800K in assets at 28 years old (very lucky with single stock trading)

TLDR:

- Have found myself in an operations role at a startup which has been stretching me thin for years (have literally started therapy because of it)

- I’m dying at the minutia and logistics necessary to do the role, not to mention the craziness and lack of resources for a startup

- The company is a “hot name” company and looks good on my resume

- I’m currently making ~110k in NYC

- Burn rate is 5K a month

- I want to take some time off to recharge, and make “my job” to find something more sustainable and aligned with my passions. Especially as I start to go into my 30s.

1g97rpe,Stay or leave ,"Hello! 
I am really looking for guidance based on my current situation. I’ve been at my current company for 4 years. We were just acquired by an investment firm and are going back private. I have a wonderful manager and our team has no turnover. The rest of the departments are absolutely dumpster fires with toxic people which leads to high turnover. There is little growth potential on my team now because NO ONE LEAVES! I’ve talked to my manager and mentor (VP of or org) about my desire to go into management and she couldn’t tell me if we will have a future position in our org but said she supported me looking at other departments internally if a leadership role opens. 

I am not very happy in my role now mainly because we have a lot of unhappy clients. I travel for onsite presentations and we are always bombarded with CSAT issues, unable to expand the portfolio. However; I don’t hate my life; I make decent money and don’t have Sunday scaries every weekend. 

I have an interview tomorrow with a competitor who would offer better pay. I’d be a Director, managing a smaller team and growing that department. I spoke recently to a prior co-worker who works there and had rave reviews. The only downside is the company is way smaller (280 employees), their benefits aren’t as great and I would be going from unlimited PTO to 140 hours of PTO…

Should I stay at my current company and ride things out until next year? Or is it a sign that this other role is available? ",no0dle-rocks,1,1.0,2,1729564332,2024-10-22 02:32:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g97rpe/stay_or_leave/,10,2024

1g97c4o,Got Promoted to Director in 4 Years but Just Quit – What Should I Do Next?,"Hey Reddit,

Looking for some career advice here. I’m the kind of person who loves learning, and I’ve been fortunate to move up fast in my career. I went from an entry-level position to director in just 4 years (yeah, I know, pretty crazy). But here’s the thing: once I got to the Director role, I started feeling... stuck.

I got to a point where I felt like I learned everything I needed to succeed in the role. While I know there’s always room for improvement, I just couldn’t shake the feeling that I was spinning my wheels. The challenges weren’t exciting anymore, and I felt more like I was managing things on autopilot than doing something meaningful.

After a lot of thinking, I quit today. I know it’s risky, but I just couldn’t do it anymore. Now I’m trying to figure out what’s next. I know I want something stimulating, but I don’t know where to channel my energy.

Some things I’m pondering:

Should I try consulting or entrepreneurship?

Is it worth switching industries or roles entirely?

Or maybe I need to get more education (MBA, certification, etc.)?

Should I take a break to reflect or travel?

If anyone has been in a similar situation—or just has advice for someone who gets bored easily—I'd love to hear your thoughts. I want my next move to be intentional and exciting, but I don’t know what that looks like yet.

1g96o5f,Should I leave a full time role for a contract for a 50%+ salary increase?,"Hey guys,

I've been working full-time at my current company for 3 years, but lately, I feel stuck. There’s no room for growth, and I'm getting tired of the office politics and general nonsense. I don’t feel like I’m growing professionally at all.

I’m currently interviewing for a contract role at a fintech company, which would pay me at least 60% more than what I make now. The role seems like a great opportunity to build my portfolio and take my career in a new direction, so I’m considering taking the leap.

My concern is whether this gamble is worth it. My current company has a history of massive layoffs every January or February, so staying here feels like a risk anyway.

The contract role doesn’t have a set duration; they mentioned it’s usually 6 months to a year, with the possibility of an extension or transitioning to a full-time position. Even if it ends after a few months, I’ve got enough savings for a safety net while I find the next gig.

For context: I’m single, 29, male, living in Los Angeles, no kids. I’ve contracted before, so things like insurance aren’t a concern. I just want to get paid what I deserve, because I feel undervalued where I’m at now.

What do you think? Is it worth making the switch?

**TL;DR:** Stuck in a full-time role with no growth and tired of office politics. Considering a contract role at a fintech company with 60% higher pay. Current company has yearly layoffs, so staying feels risky anyway. Contract could be 6 months to a year, with a chance of extension.

1g95nm2,Going in for an interview at a wind farm tomorrow to potentially become a technician for the turbines. What should I wear?,"Hi! Not sure if this is a dumb question, but I'm conflicted on how I should go about it. 

My past experience is in construction for general labor, and I've only had one interview in my 2 jobs I've had so far. For construction, generally the way to go about it is to wear clean, presentable work clothes. If you're hired on the spot, you can get to work immediately. So the last one I went to I wore jeans, work boots and a nice button-up with  a t-shirt underneath. 

The job I'm aiming for is a lot different than my past experiences, but still a hands on type job that could get you dirty. So I'm wondering if jeans would be too casual or not. I have some well fitting pair that I could wear with a button up, or go with khakis or slacks. If I get hired, there's a possibility they may have me climb up a turbine as a test that I actually can, so this is where my conflicting opinions come in. I wanna look nice, but if I have to climb a big ladder I'll want something more flexible and breathable.

1g94s6g,"Low ambition, high debt ","TLDR; I am best suited for low paying jobs but have a lot of debt. 

I am 24F and have never had a dream job. My parents told me I would marry well. I currently work in a call center for a bank, at a company with lots of opportunity to move up. I make $27/hr. 

My issue is I am not well suited for this industry. In my current role, I assist older clients with online banking, and I’m really good at it! Measurable-metrics-good and get complimented frequently on my patience and ability to problem solve. I’m good at the soft skills of client facing roles— great at talking, highly personable, high drive for learning, volunteer frequently to train and take on new responsibilities. 

I do not like finance. I don’t have a good grasp on the hard knowledge needed to be an advisor or pursue certifications (see: $100k in private student loans for a writing degree). I do my best to learn because I want to succeed and I’m not lazy, but I just cannot find the smallest desire to move up in this industry. I was asked in a review if I would be interested in moving into training for a year to get into an account manager position, but am very unsure. I feel miserable and hopeless about work often (am currently in therapy). 

Basically, I really succeed in the skills needed to be a great mom, or teacher, or nanny, or related care provider positions. But they don’t pay even a whisper of what I need to pay my student loans, rent, and save for my future. I am really interested and could see myself going to nursing school, but can’t afford to add to my student loans. I’ve considered getting healthcare related certifications, which can be cheaper, but don’t know if they’re even worth anything in the job market. 

My question: what careers are good for someone who is passionate about caring for others that pays well and doesn’t require more education?

I just needed $150-160K to maintain my lifestyle (including saving money on the side), so anything above that is just a bonus. I care about about job stability, life work balance, and overall work culture. Can you guys share your thoughts?

**Company A:** **$230K base, $70K equity vested over 4 years (which could worth money or not).**

* Startup, Series A, $16M raised last year. 30 people in the company.

* Fully remote. Based in SD, requires travel 3-4X a year to the office for quarter annual meetings
* No 401K company match.
* Healthcare is expensive
* 16 days PTO
* No upward mobility, or very limited.
* **Unsure about work life balance, but I heard startups, especially newer ones can be very stressful, you have to wear multiple hats etc.**

**Company B: $200K base, 5-10% annual bonus depends on your performance, no equity.**

* Fortune 100, based in NY (where I'm currently at). Not a lot of layoffs happening recently.
* Industry: Bank/Finance
* Hybrid, 2-3X a week. Only 25-30 minutes drive away from home (20 mins if no traffic).
* 6% company match for 401K
* Low deductible healthcare, not too bad
* 21 days PTO
* Lots of internal mobility opportunities, promotion path is 2-3 years.

1g93nkk,Leaving My Manager Role and Taking a Step Down In Position. I'd this a bad call?,"I applied for another role in my company that is technically a ""step back"" when it comes to the title. 

For some context, I am 28 years old and I make 78,500 a year and receive a 6k bonus in the first quarter of each year. My official title is an Associate Manager and at times, I've overseen 20+ people and several different contracting companies. 

I work in tech and I am not in a WFH position. I do have the flexibility however to be in a hybrid style role, but it's up in the air on how much I actually will get to work at home because of how chaotic my job is most days.

I am currently required to wear a ton of different hats and am regularly pulled in a bunch of different directions. Although i like my current job, most things I do are extremely inefficient and most everyone lacks accountability. 

The other issue I am having is, my boss is extremely difficult to work with and is a very negative person. The other Associate Managers I work alongside are ones that he handpicked and they are spit images of my boss. 

Also, the area I live in right now has an extremely high cost of living and way over populated for the amount of infrastructure it has in place. I am from a very small town and am used to a slower pace of life, which is the total opposite of where I am living now. 

Which leads me to the title of my post. 

I have recently submitted an application to a new role within the company that will allow me to work from home. The pay for the position is actually slightly more then i am currently, and is still eligble for the same bonus i am getting now. The only 'downside' is, it's a non manager role. 

My bosses all think this would be a terrible career move since, in their words not mine, ""the trajectory you are on."" 

Which has led me to questioning whether this is a good move or not. I have a fiance and a 6 year old daughter that would also be making the move with me back home. 

If I ended up pulling my application this position, I was thinking of staying here another 6 months and waiting for a WFH manager position to hopefully become available and make a lateral move into it. 

TL;DR Should I take a different position in the company now for slightly more money, less responsibility, and lose my manager title so I can work from home and move back to an area with a better COL or wait a few months to see if I can get a WFH Manager job and continue to grow my career?

1g93gc6,How do you handle meeting boundaries with high-profile clients?,"Hey! Any Arcchitects here? I’m a 27-year-old female architect, and I’ve recently taken on a high-profile male client. I’m curious—how do you manage client meeting times? Specifically, what are your boundaries for meeting hours?

I try to keep a balanced schedule: 9-5 is for work, 5-8 is family time, and after 8 PM is for myself or upskilling (I’m currently learning BIM modeling). Recently, this client asked for a meeting, and I agreed. When I asked for the day and time, he requested a meeting after work hours.

For me, ""after work"" means I’m available until 7 PM at the latest. In my country, the sun sets around 6:30 PM, and anything after that feels late to me. I told him I could meet until 7 PM, but he said that was too early and even offered to drop me off at home after the meeting (no thanks). I already had a commitment that runs until 9 PM (online training for BIM), but he still insisted we meet around that time.

We’ve had several meetings before, but he then asked for a one-on-one meeting and said, ""we need to have a meeting so we can 'bond'."" The word bond made me uncomfortable—it didn’t seem like the right word for a professional meeting, and he could've used something better. But I brushed it off, thinking maybe that's just how he talks. Still, that word is one of the reasons I’m hesitant to meet at night.

I do understand that as the architect, you need to satisfy your clients' needs and interview them to know what to design. I seriously don’t mind meetings, but WHY does it have to be at night and late? And honestly, I don’t need to bond with him. 😅 Part of me feels he may sincerely want to talk about the project, but why at night? It could easily be done during the day.

Can you shine some light on this, architects? Is it normal to have meetings after 8 PM? I feel uncomfortable with it. I don’t have anyone I could go with if the meeting is in the evening, and the client specifically requested a one-on-one meeting.

To be honest, I don’t have free time in the evenings for work, and late meetings don’t fit with my schedule. But because he’s been following up for more than two weeks now, I’m starting to feel pressured.

The reason I’m asking now is that after days of not messaging me, he reached out again (at 10:57 PM 😭) and said, “You never got back to me.” I want to respond and give him a clear answer.

How can I politely tell him I’m only available until 7 PM? He works 9-5 as well, which is why I offered the 5-7 PM window. I might be able to stretch it to 8 PM, but after that, I really need to be home.

Also, how can I ease him into being okay with the 7 PM limit without causing tension?",SnooDoodles6709,1,1.0,0,1729551649,2024-10-21 23:00:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g93gc6/how_do_you_handle_meeting_boundaries_with/,10,2024

So far I had one career that I thought was the perfect decision for me but as of recently I explored a different one and now I have absolutely no clue. 

At first I wanted to go into a marketing career. I explored colleges in my area and found the perfect 3 year program that would give me working experience and was 20 minute commute from my home. Tuition, like any other school, would be expensive but do able and I could live at home while doing school. 
Marketing has been my goal job for about 2 years now, through out highschool I've taken business classes and I've felt prepared to go into a business career. 

However, recently I did a co - op placement at a school and I've discovered I absolutely love the idea of teaching. Not to be cliche but I really wanted to be a teacher as a kid but was always put off by relatives and the fact that it was an extra 6 years of school. On to my next point, an extra 6 years is a LONG time, and A LOT of money. I'm really worried im going to hate everything in a few years and regret not doing my original choice. Another thing is if it's realistic?

 I have a school that has a perfect program, not far away, not as expensive and a decent amount of time before I graduate. Versus, 4 years of university to get a degree in English literature and then another 2 years of teachers college PLUS the university that I think is the best option for the program I need is a much longer commute and the tuition is 2x what my original choice would be. The first choice just seems so obvious but I feel like teaching is what I want to do? Should I put myself through the 6 years old school? What if I don't actually like teaching in the long run but I would have loved marketing? I have 2 months till I have to start applying to either university or college and I am not ready at all. Do I choose business or teaching?

I am a hardworker, go above and beyond and I've been told I am a key person to company multiple times. I''ve started reporting to a different department recently.

I feel crushed, devastated and feel demotivated and underappreciated; I cannot even sleep.

There is a possibility of changing the reporting line to a central functional team, unlocking possibilities to grow and be even more useful. If I go down this path, I will most likely lose face with the local team. I work well with everyone and the pseudo-new manager would like me to join her team.

I have two options: stay where I am, accept the lower rating and discuss with my senior manager how I can improve and grow locally or change reporting line to the Central team to grow at a corporate level.

1g935ry,Feeling Stuck in Role I Hate,"I started an entry level role at a company over 3 years ago. Throughout the years I got more responsibilities and have grown. This year, like most companies, there were a few rounds of layoffs and departures so I ended up being shuffled around to a new team and boss. Some of the role and goals were the same as my original role but I also got new responsibilities. A coworker also left so I took a main part of their role. Now my main responsibility is a really specific function no one else does. I feel super pigeon holed and generally hate the work that is apart of my function. While it’s not a lot of “hard” work I’m so so so so unmotivated to do the job. 

Another kicker, I’ve been a contracted employee the whole time and denied a FTE conversion twice on the old team. I thought in this role I would have the opportunity to be FTE but it hasn’t happened yet despite requests. They are expanding the team with FTE roles and work I would be interested in.

1g931du,Submitting Resignation,"I started a new job in March at a smaller local company.  In the beginning things were good, but as time has passed I have realized I'm not a good fit.  I do not 'fit in' with my coworkers (different political and religious views), there are also big communication issues on the team that we have been unable to resolve in the past 90 days.

I have had several meetings, calls and emails asking to build better communication and voicing my concerns and trying to make it work but the frustration is too much.  I was left on an island without the tools needed to succeed.  They want to fix it, but it will take more than 90 more days to build out the processes and implement.  I'm not willing to wait.  I reached out to my previous job, they opened a new spot for me on the team.  This will hurt my current company.  I'm in a senior technical role and they recruited me hard for my skillset.  I really wanted to make it work and succeed, I tried for months to get them to see the issues and fix them, and it looks like they are now listening.  I do plan to give a 3 week notice, help the transition as best I can.  I don't want to leave them high and dry, I do like the leadership team, it's just their processes were broken and they were blind to the issues until it was too late.

1g930q7,Leave my comfort zone for something more fulfilling? ,"I’m 27 years old, and have been in my public sector municipal job for 4 years now in Ontario Canada. I make $73k, and will be at around $100k in 10 years time. I have a DB pension, 3 weeks vacation, 5 sick days, and the normal government benefits, and WFH. I’m quite bored, and I have 0 interest in my work whatsoever. I have a business degree, as I had no idea what I wanted when I graduated high school and that seemed like a safe option. 

I’ve had interests for a long time in two, sort of polar opposite careers. 1 would be computer science/IT, and 2 is becoming an aircraft mechanic. So I’ve been weighing the options to return to school to possibly pursue one of these. 

Option 1: Keep my current job, and pursue my comp sci degree part time at my local university across the street from my house. I would be able to go at a steady pace and by the time I’m in my early thirties I’ll have finished. I could then look for jobs elsewhere, or I could stay with my current company and transfer into our It dept as a developer / data scientist. I think pairing a comp sci degree / business degree is also a pretty good combo in terms of Pm roles later in my career. 

Option 2: Aircraft Mechanic, this would require my to return to college for 2 years full time, but I’d have pretty much guaranteed employment upon graduation. I know the pay in Canada is lower than in the US however I believe this would be the most “fun” and interesting field as I’ve always been an aviation nerd. The issue is that id be likely giving up my pension, and having a lower salary for the next 5 or so years until fully licensed at which $100k+ is quite doable. 

Option 3: remain in my current position and continue to find little certifications to upskill, and maybe try to transfer to a different department to switch things up a bit and keep my benefits / decent pay.

1g92c96,"Regretting going into tech, should I switch to medicine?","I’ve been in and out of college since I was 18 due to financial issues, COVID, advisors putting me in the wrong degree program (I was homeschooled before and had no guidance on what I was doing), and I’m now 23.  

I went from being accidentally enrolled into a Computer Info Systems degree that didn’t transfer at all outside of the community college I was at, to Computer Science almost transferring to UW for it before getting absolutely zero aid to afford it because my dad made over 6 figures (despite them paying none of my schooling costs), to now being a cybersecurity major at WGU because I saw all the software dev layoffs (which included my dad despite him having more experience in coding than I did in being alive) and got shit scared of being an unemployed CS major.

But I still see problems with the IT/cyber/software job markets in terms of pay, burnout, and just not getting a job.  Add to this my fascination with medical stuff, respect for doctors, seeing my mom suffer from various medical conditions and my dad having recently been a victim of his depression, and I’m wondering if medicine would’ve been a better move.  My end goal is to get some experience in whatever field I’ll go into, pay off my debts, and move abroad to work or retire.  I’ve always thought tech was cool, but what does that matter if I can’t get a job in it.  If I were to make that switch I’d like to become a surgeon since my dad always said that I’d be great at it since I’m always calm under pressure.  My main concern is how I’d afford it since I still want to not be a leech on my mom and not have to move back with her.  I haven’t had real friends for over 5 years, never had a relationship either, none of that is a concern to me.

1g91073,ppl who started from scratch on a new position: how did you become successful???,"I am so desperate for help, really don’t know what to do anymore.

I’m 25 and have been working with Language and Education since I was 17. I am truly passionate about my field and would love to stick with it or at least do something related to art and languages (creative writing or translation, for example). Carrying a routine like mine has drowned me emotionally and physically, and idk if my body can handle any more stress. I believe the best career move for me would be finding a well-paid remote job - preferably from a country abroad because the currency where I live is so low - that could allow me to rest a little, spend time with hobbies, and study, because I really need to focus on things I like and become better at what I do, but it’s practically impossible when I have to pay the bills and make ends meet, so I can’t afford to take a break from it all and dedicate myself to what really matters and would make me feel like I’m growing personally and professionally.

I’ve exhausted myself from sending out CVs, writing cover letters and cultivating a little bit of hope whenever I apply to any job opening. I’ve spent months trying to land one of these dream jobs, and I know I’m capable and experienced enough to offer a good performance. The thing is, I never get a chance to prove myself because there are so many others who, instead of starting as teachers and then moving towards writing and translation jobs, have been performing that one function I desire since the beginning, so they have more portfolio, more experience, more everything.

I swear, idk where else to look or what else to do. I cannot afford to start as an Intern or earn less because my life is already very financially unstable. No one gives me an opportunity and that’s not because of lack of attempt. I always put on all I have for those positions but I keep getting rejected. I really need to get my life on track and I believe the best way is to earn more and live more comfortably.

Can someone PLEASE give me any piece of advice? Or comfort me idk lol I’m genuinely desperate and exhausted.",putz_pirei,2,1.0,1,1729545189,2024-10-21 21:13:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g91073/ppl_who_started_from_scratch_on_a_new_position/,10,2024

I am a 33-year-old man currently working in the accounting and administration sector in a senior position, leading a team of three people. I have gained five years of professional experience: two years in a multinational company in Ireland and three years in a company in Italy. Last year, I decided to expand my skill set with the aim of possibly changing jobs or roles, with the medium/long-term goal of accessing higher-level positions like Manager, CFO, COO, etc.

Unfortunately, I am not sure how to further improve my skills, especially since in Italy it seems that the only path for advancement in accounting is to become a certified accountant, which doesn’t particularly interest me. I would like to move towards areas such as financial planning & analysis (FP&A) or management control.

For this reason, last year I attended a Master’s in Auditing and Management Control, but I must say it was too theoretical and not very practical, and I didn’t learn much. Currently, I’m thinking of studying to become a data analyst, combining my accounting and financial experience with data analysis and data visualization skills. Do you think this is a good idea?

1g90zxu,Person who had my job before me views my linkedin every other week or so...weird or normal?,"I am a virtual public school teacher who works from home. I just started my third year in this role and I love it. I don't know much about the person who had this job before me except for the fact that they were put on a PIP and resigned before being non-renewed. The reasons why are honestly none of my business.  
  
I really enjoy my job and have no intention of leaving but I set my my LinkedIn profile public when applying for summer school jobs and online tutoring side-hustles this spring. I forgot about it after that. Since I made my profile fully visible, the teacher who had my role has been viewing my LinkedIn more and more frequently. This person didn't send a connection request or anything. They've viewed it five times over the past two months. I didn't realize until this week, when I logged in for the first time since August and felt a little odd about how many times they had viewed my profile since then. I switched my stuff to private and switched my profile settings to make only my name and heading visible since I'm not actively looking for a summer school job. 

My question is this:  Is this a normal thing for someone to do this frequently? Maybe I'm just not super familiar with LinkedIn and this is a totally normal thing. I feel like I would understand if he wanted to see how the person who had his old job is doing and keep tabs on a former school he worked for every once in a while, but it seems a little much.

A chef apprenticeship, was far away but easy to get to via public transport (I don't have a drivers license) felt like a fresh start, I grew up in the suburbs and had never really been in the city much (which is where my new job was located) and it felt kinda nice having something fresh
.
But then came the work, I was lied to about my hours, lied to about my pay and was told even if I got my drivers license I wouldn't be able to park in the staff parking because I'm not a manager, I was constantly being compared to the head chefs kid which was the other first year apprentice but he would obviously have much more experience than me.

Since I was lied to about my hours, I was finishing at 9-10pm at night and the public transport back home didn't extend that late so I had to uber which cost a fortune. Got payed way less than I was told (I knew I would get paid much less than my fast food job because it was an apprenticeship but I was told a certain amount and then when I said something about it I was just told they pay all the apprentices minimum wage and that's that).

I was getting up at 7 in the morning and getting home at 11-12 at night, it was just too much of a toll for $14 an hour and constant overtime that I was pressured into doing and never warned/told about.

So I quit, I told them that maybe it wasn't the right career path for me, I live with my mum and I pay $200 a month in rent, I have about $1100 in savings atm and so l'm in a bit of a pickle, I have to really save my pennies while I go through the youth allowance process with Centrelink, I'm just wondering though;

""After consideration I realized I am very happy with my current role."" ??? Idk... then why did I waste their time? I want to move up in the org but I don't want to work with these people. And Im not desperate at all. I will wait for the right opportunity.

  
Thanks all

1g8xw8v,Clocked in for 5 hours and not been given a single thing to do,"Hi, I just started a new job a month ago today and as the title describes I spend most time sitting here doing nothing. 29 M with a bachelor's degree working in the field of manufacturing and design .

The job is for a university (a big one, and expensive one) but it is not teaching, it is working in one of the areas basically doing production. I had feared there would not be much to do at this job when I was interviewing for it but I had no idea it would be this bad. Everybody was very excited for me to join this role and it really does seem like they are happy to have me here.

A majority of my days involve clocking in sitting here for 8 hours, when I ask my supervisor for something to do, he says he has nothing. When I am given work it's very few and far in between, to the point where I don't even understand how this position even exists. 

Without over sharing, this is the highest I've been paid in my career and I get paid to sit here all day doing nothing. Except I don't do well with doing nothing, I struggle with anxiety and can't just scroll on my phone. I've tried writing things or drawing but it doesn't really help. I'm also in the position where I do not have a desk yet or a computer for me to use. Getting a desk for me is apparently being worked on and I plan to bring in a laptop but I don't know when this will be

1g8xee9,Should I leave my remote job for a $15k raise but a lower title?,"I graduated 3 years ago and work at a big tech company that’s growing very rapidly. I’ve been here for 2 years and while the benefits are great, I hate the work I’m doing, the work life balance is awful, and the culture is very toxic. Morale is super low and we’ve had a ton of people leave my team in the past year. It’s also really difficult and competitive to get promoted, and the raise isn’t even worth it— I got promoted after working my ass off for 2 years, and my raise was less than $5k. 

I just got offered a job at another tech company that’s smaller, but still a very well-known brand. They’re not doing so well financially and they laid off 10% of their workforce last year. But the culture and work life balance is supposedly great, the benefits are pretty good, and I'd be working more closely with leadership. I’d be taking a lower role in terms of job level, title, and responsibilities, but the hiring manager said they’re confident I could get promoted to a manager position within a year since I'm so overqualified. My current company has a different hierarchy structure and a “manager” title is 3 levels above me, so it would take me years to get to that level.

**Current role:** 

* **Job level:** IC3
* **Base salary:** $94k
* **Equity:** $75k over the next 2 years (\~$150 share price)
* **Bonus:** No bonus
* **WFH:** Remote, but we have an office
* **PTO:** Unlimited

**New job offer:** 

* **Job level:** IC2
* **Base salary:** $110k
* **Equity:** $70k over 4 years with one year cliff (\~$50 share price)
* **Bonus:** 10% annual performance bonus
* **WFH:** Hybrid, 2 days in office per week
* **PTO:** 20 days

Should I suck it up and stick with my current job & just try to move internally eventually? Or should I take the new job in the hopes of better work life balance and eventually getting a better title? What’s keeping me on the fence is my equity, my unlimited PTO, the remote flexibility, plus the fact that my current company is doing very well, has more “clout” in the industry, & our share price is triple that of the other company.

1g8wxtx,Looking for Help Automating My Job Search Process (Google Sheets + Scraping),"Hi! I have a google sheet to help me with my job search. Here’s how I have my process set up:

**Tab 1 (Companies Overview)**: Columns include:

* *Company Name*
* *Link to Job Board*
* *Notes*
* *Do I know someone there?*
* *Type of Organization* (Drop-down: Company, Agency, or Job Board)
* *Niche*
* *Value*
* *Last Date Reviewed* (Job Board Link)

My current approach involves reviewing Tier A companies (from most recently reviewed to least), clicking through to job boards, then moving on to Tier B companies. While this works, it’s incredibly time-consuming.

**Tab 2 (Job Application Status Report)**:  
When I find interesting jobs, I log them in this tab, which tracks:

* *Status*
* *Company Name*
* *Date Added*
* *Job Title*
* *Link to Role*
* *Notes*
* *Application Date (or if I decided not to apply)*

**What I Want to Automate**:  
I’d love a solution that automatically scrapes these job boards daily, pulling the newest job postings into a new tab on my Google Sheet. I’ve found a tool called *Kadoa* for scraping, but I’m not sure how to get the data into my sheet.

Once scraped, I’d like to rank the jobs based on a formula that factors in:

* Company tier
* Whether I have a contact there
* The strength of that contact (ranked A-F)

Finally, if I see a job I want to apply to, I’d love to simply check a box and have it move to the Job Application Status Report tab.

I’ve looked into *Make* as a potential solution, but I’m struggling to connect all the pieces. I’ve also tried *Import XML*, but that didn’t work for me.

If anyone has advice on how to automate this, or knows of other tools that could help, I’d really appreciate it! Happy to provide screenshots or hop on a call if needed. I posted in a different Reddit forum and someone said this is a large ask. If anyone could help me with the scraping aspect only, that would be super helpful.

1g8wlt4,"How can I pivot away from a ""passion career"" (that was never really my passion) to a ""day job""? ","# TLDR: How do I find a reasonably paying “day job” as a pivot from an unsatisfying but visible career in an ill-fitting passion field?

Now in my 40s, I’ve come to terms with the fact that my career and education choices in my 20s weren’t actually aligned with my wants and needs. I’ve had success in a low paying, high prestige, time and energy consuming role in the cultural sector. It’s something that most people think about as a passion career (typically supported by a mega-earner spouse, which I don’t have).

But: The career I’m in is NOT my passion, and never has been. It's the thing I pursued because it had proximity to what I actually wanted to be doing, which was making my own creative work. (To my credit, I didn’t pursue that thanks to a mix of internalized baggage from narcissistic parental abuse, depression and anxiety, and undiagnosed ADHD, not lack of talent or capacity.) I was “lucky” to find opportunities that I was told I should be grateful for, even if that meant ignoring my own thoughts and feelings.

I’m now middle aged, on meds, in therapy, and reparenting myself through the process of raising my two kids. Since 2021, I’ve given myself the opportunity to pursue the creative work I love when I can find the time. What I’ve done has been well received by both audiences and other artists. I feel more at home in my own skin and that’s worth a lot – even though it's unrealistic that I’ll make any substantial money doing this work.

I’m still working professionally in my old field. I’ve taken a lower paying/lower prestige job than the one I had before kids in order to not work 80+ hours a week like I used to. Even so, I find my creative energy is drained by the demands of my role and the masking required to manage the day-to-day. I’m burnt out, working with a lot of folks who have incredibly difficult personalities, and less able than before to throw money at life tasks in order to compensate for these issues. I make less money now (about $15k less) than I did in my late 20s; even though I'm in a cheaper city than I was then, I now have two kids with complex needs and a mortgage. My current role has no retirement plan or benefits, just flexibility and the ""prestige"" of working in the cultural sector (and you can't eat prestige). 

I took the current gig as a bridge until I could find something better, but now it’s been several years and it’s taking a big toll emotionally. I feel like a failure for spending my energy and my days doing draining work that will not set me up with a nest egg NOR allow me to course correct and spend my days better aligned with what would make me happy. Instead, I’m sinking deeper into a life I don’t want. I can't give my kids what I wish they had, both materially and in terms of a parental model who is happy in their work and has capacity for them more days than not.

I don’t want to give up on the joy I’ve found in making my own creative work (which would probably be the responsible thing to do). Instead, I’ve come to the conclusion that I need a “day job” that isn't someone else’s underpaid passion career. I need a job that offers me more stability and drains my energy less so that I spend more time doing what actually matters to me with my life. 

I’ve worked with (and spent way too much money on) career coaching before, with few positive results. I know that I have many transferable skills – especially related to writing and publications, communications, project management, teaching and training, and administration – but they’re not “hard” skills that would make my next steps clear. While I think I could be capable of success in many careers, the years I’ve spent looking for a new one without any concrete results haven’t exactly boosted my confidence. 

I don’t get tons of opportunities to have interviews. When I do, people think the transition I’m seeking to make is “strange” because I’m looking to leave something  “exciting” for something less so. I can’t be honest about why I’d like to make a change –  I’m not “truly passionate” about marketing, for example, and no one wants to hear their potential employee is looking for a “day job” – and this is making networking difficult. I have limited time to spend upskilling so I’m more attractive to potential employers, especially given that I already struggle to find time to do the thing I *actually* want to do.  I’ve tried doing consulting work in my field just to make a little more cash. It’s made it even more clear that the potential clients I’m currently qualified to serve don’t have money to spend that would make the time, hustle, and resources to find them financially worthwhile. 

I’m fully aware that I’m in thought loops around this and have been for years at this point. Right now, my coping mechanism is fantasizing about my partner somehow finding a job that pays much better than his current one, and that’s not likely to happen.

There have to be things I’m not thinking about or pursuing to solve this problem. I'd love to hear any thoughts, suggestions, reframes, or honest feedback that you might have…",Otherwise-Parsnip982,1,1.0,0,1729534548,2024-10-21 18:15:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g8wlt4/how_can_i_pivot_away_from_a_passion_career_that/,10,2024
1g8wa5u,Second carreer advice (confused),"Hello!

  
I am in mid forties and located in SF bay area - married with a kid. I was a career software engineer in big tech and expect to be laid off soon.  I have decent savings, paid off house, college savings etc. sorted.  Spouse has a started with a small govt job part time. Eventually she will be fulltime and pull in 50-70k with medical benefits (hopefully).

I would prefer to do a second job for 10 more years to avoid pulling money out from my savings so early. I was attracted to health care/EMS but realized the stress might be too much. I am looking for relaxed jobs with some decent pay in the range of 70-150k per year (pay is not most important criterion) but where I can help people and make an impact. 

  
I don't like nosy management or micromanagement. I enjoy autonomy in my work as much as possible. 

I have considered the following jobs:

1) School teacher: Tried some teaching. Lot of stress and red tape. Students don't want to learn often.  Pubic school teaching requires 1-2 years school. I have a substitute teacher license in CA. Need to explore that more.

2) EMT/ambulance: Got my CPR and was a bit excited for EMS. But not good driver and the shifts and stress might be crazy for low comp I felt. Also, any mistake and lives could be at risk. I might still get my EMT to learn more about healthcare.

3) Nurse/Respiratory therapist/rad tech/ultrasound tech: Will need 1.5 to two years or more school and will I be up to this? I have only worked cushy desk jobs so far. But I do like helping people as long as the stress and red tape not too much.

4) Front desk jobs in healthcare or elsewhere: Do they hire middle aged males for this?

5) Imaging tech assistant: Seems like an easier way to find out if healthcare for me.

6) phlebotomist/medical assistant: easier entry but will I get bored?

7) Library: At least the stakes are low compared to healthcare and no kids to babysit but not sure of this. I might have to start as a page and work my way up.

8) I have been in IT and kind of tired of it but like the remote work aspect. Not sure if any IT jobs low key would suit me.

I've an offer from one my senior leaders and my ex boss to move into their team of project management in the same firm. Should I take it?

Considerations:
1. Doing meaningful work is the most important thing for me-  where I feel progress and see something be created or grown. I feel project managers just pass around information but not create true value like engineering (sorry no offense). Is this a misconception? Is the work rewarding like development?

2. Pay - I am getting paid well in my current role, is pmo a step down. I feel director of engineers will get paid better than director of project management l.

3. Industry perception of pmo- I feel pmos are dime a dozen but good engineering managers are scarce and more valuable.

1g8tsn5,Burnt out data professional,"Hi, I am a 33 yr old data professional. I have had job titles ranging from data analyst to data scientist to business intelligence analyst. I have always done this work for non-profits, city government, and county government.

I tend to believe in the missions of the organizations I work for, and I take pride in my work. I am productive and try my best to do good work. Unfortunately I have noticed that this is not the norm in the organizations I have worked for. As a result, my workload over time grows and grows and grows until I am struggling beneath a mountain of work. This has been the pattern in each of the organizations I have worked for. It takes a mental, emotional, and, frankly, a physical toll on me.

For added context, in the last two positions I have worked for very high-achieving, driven, highly intelligent bosses who also believe in the mission of the organization. The organizations themselves are pretty dysfunctional. This creates a dynamic where the boss is eager to take on and fix the myriad problems of the organization, and a large share of the work falls to me (Although the bosses themselves are also very hard workers)

I am at a point where I honestly don't know if I want to continue as a data professional. I have reached a point where I have to expend an enormous amount of energy and effort just to get myself started each day. I am starting to resent the work, my boss, the organization, all of it. In short, I'm burnt out. So so burnt out. 

So, a few questions for you kind folks. 

1) If this pattern is repeating itself, it's likely that I am at least partially responsible for it. Has this happened to you? How do I break the pattern? And do you have any advice for how to advocate for myself so I don't get buried beneath an unending avalanche of work? And if you have been a data professional, how do you communicate with a boss who is not a data professional that this work can be extremely complicated, detailed, ect and that it can take a long time to get a project right?

2) Have you had to communicate to a boss that you are struggling with the workload and can only move a finite number of projects forward at a time, and that working on one project will necessarily take time away from others? 

3) has anyone pivoted from being a data professional to something else? If so, what did you pivot to? I don't want to start a new career from scratch, so I'd love to find something different that still allows me to leverage the skills I have spent a decade building. 

4) how do you take enough space from the burnout to make a thoughtful career decision? One thing I want to avoid is just reacting to my burnout. 

Thanks in advance for any guidance ❤️",datagrrrl,2,1.0,0,1729527803,2024-10-21 16:23:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g8tsn5/burnt_out_data_professional/,10,2024

1g8tce0,Applied for a job at a company I rejected a couple years ago. Can I increase my chances by doing this...?,"I work in the VFX and animation industry in India. Some of you might be aware that last year there were writer's and actor's strikes in the US because of which it greatly affected the movie/TV show production business. Naturally, almost all VFX companies around the world ended up laying off upto 50% of their workforce and some even shut down.

Now that it's been a few months since the industry has started stabilizing, we're seeing more job openings but almost never getting a call back from the HR.

And I've been laid off since 6 months. This is the reason I'm thinking about taking such an unusual and possibly a risky step.

Yesterday I saw a job opening at a company from whom I had rejected an offer to join 2 years ago. Since then they've really grown and worked on some quality projects. I already applied as soon as I saw the job opening. But I was wondering if I could reach out to the HR on LinkedIn (she's already in my connections and we've spoken a couple of times before) and let her know that I had rejected an offer to join them 2 years ago but I would really like to join them now. Mind you, at that time there was a different HR whom I was corresponding with.

Is it a good move? Would it increase my chances of getting hired thinking that we offered him a job before so with more experience I'd probably be an even better fit? Also, I still have that offer letter to prove that I actually was offered the job.",crackjack83,0,0.5,0,1729526700,2024-10-21 16:05:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g8tce0/applied_for_a_job_at_a_company_i_rejected_a/,10,2024

1g8sw1l,Desperate enough to seek constructive criticism on the internet. ,"Hello,

I have noticed that when people post their situations online there are always those who run to comment and say how they can get the whole story and the employee must be doing something wrong, and so I'm actually here for that today. I have a lot of backstory, but please bare with me. 

I got fired from my last job as an executive assistant/hr representative, because I pointed out to the owner of the law firm/partner that some of the choices they were making were potentially illegal, and that they were all liabilities and left them open to lawsuit. Instead of being a civilized business person and recognizing that they were in trouble, the owner of the firm said that I was making up lies against him, and he fired me. 

To clarify, he actually told me that I was so good at my job that I was no longer needed, and wish me the very best of luck. It was only when he appealed my unemployment, which I only had for 3 weeks, that he started making up nasty erroneous lies about me. I did go to the appeal, and I showed that there was no documentation that I never done anything wrong, that I had received limitless praise, and that I overall excelled at my job. I am getting the results soon, so fingers crossed that the interviewer saw the reality. I did point out the fact that he had no proof and he made it very clear that he had no documentation or even a clear line of focus in the appeal, so I am hopeful that I will win. 

I just moved to Washington state, and I took a position as a paralegal when I moved here. I was told that they would wait for me despite me not being available for a month after they open their appointment, because I was worth the wait. I started my job, and I loved it. I excelled, and I managed to break a bunch of barriers that nobody else had. For example I got a waiver approved that had never been approved in 20 years at that firm, and we all kind of scrambled to figure out what to do after it was approved. I got complimented on my notebook, and my trainer told my boss and the partner in The Firm that it was the most comprehensive example of what a training guide should be, and I was the one who created it. I was given 2 weeks training which was mostly watching the person I was replacing work, despite the fact that everyone else at the firm was given 6 weeks training. I was then sent alone to the Seattle office while everyone stayed behind in tacoma. I never missed a deadline, I was ahead of work, I had calendar and my attorney at 45 days in advance. The work for the week that typically took the person I was replacing all the way through Friday to do I had done by Tuesday morning every single week. I responded to all emails, I responded to my attorney, and I carried a reputation for being someone who handled extremely difficult clients with ease. Overall I thought I was killing it at my new job. 

Last Tuesday, they pulled me into the office and told me that they would be letting me go because, ""I was not excelling in a fast-paced environment."" My initial response was to chuckle because I thought they were joking, and I pointed out that I was significantly further ahead of everyone else. She then said that I failed to train properly, to which I responded that I had a total of 2 weeks training will everyone else got 6 months, and I was still performing at the same level as everyone else, and I asked no more questions than everyone else. To this she said I had an amazing notebook, but I had still asked a question about a waiver, to which I explained that I've never asked a question twice because I learned the first time. 

At this point, the person they hired to oversee the conversation is HR said that this was a moot point, and that I was fired regardless. I stated that I had no desire to sit at a table I wasn't wanted at, but I still wanted to know what led to the decision, if they would do me the kindness of explaining, so that I might have a better opportunity in the future. They said that they had made their statements clear, which of course I didn't feel that they had. I was wished the best and sent on my way. 

So further backstory, the new attorney that I work for his name is CA sought out my former attorney who had fired me his name is SH at a conference. CA told me that SH had nothing bad to say about me and that he thought I was an amazing employee when they met. He said they exchanged information and plan to help each other expand their firms. 

My final Appeal hearing with unemployment was Monday afternoon and I was fired Tuesday morning. There's a part of me that thinks that SH reached out to CA and made up lies to get him to fire me. 

The thing is, as a person I function by always trying to be better than who I was yesterday. I have a tendency to put people off because I'm very good at pretty much everything I do, not through natural talent, but through sheer force of will. I have never met a challenge I couldn't complete, and I have never found a problem I couldn't solve. It creates anger and frustration in my coworkers, but I'm also extremely helpful, polite, and overly willing to help others to reach their potential should they ask for it. I never point out other people's flaws, and I generally am quiet and mind my business which is probably the main reason I'm able to do more work than everyone else, is that I don't integrate myself into other people's drama. Somehow this is the second time I've been fired in a very short time, and while it's pretty simple to place the blame on SH, blaming him won't allow me future opportunities nor will it allow me the same income that I was generating from the position I just lost. 

I don't even know what to ask for but I'm looking for someone that I can kind of discuss my work history with and they can potentially find any flaws in what I've been doing and how I've been doing it. I'm open to any questions, such as did you ever do this? I really really want to find a solution. I'm also pretty newly married and I feel like I'm letting my husband down. Prior to working in this line of work I was actually a teacher for 8 years and a case manager for one. I excelled at that job as well, and my students had the highest test scores on campus, we're pretty high up in the district, and my students went from not speaking English on the first day of school to leaving my class in one year writing a collegiate level. At that point it's important to note that I'm  getting ready for an interview and typing this via talk to text so please forgive any errors. I don't have time to proofread. 

So if anyone has any suggestions as to what I can do, if you have any questions because you've worked with people and you know what nitpicky things they do that ultimately get them fired, or you have any suggestions on how to figure out how to be a better employee so this doesn't happen again, I would really appreciate any feedback. We took a lease on the place we live with the offer letter for the job that I had. We moved where we moved specifically with the job I had in mind and they knew all that and they just let me go. I'm not trying to figure out why they specifically fired me, I'm trying to figure out what makes me fireable so that I don't have this issue in the future. 

And if all of this is just a rambling mess and you've read this far and you think, dang this chick is crazy, then please send me love and light because I need all of it right now. I've applied to over 100 jobs since Tuesday, I've taken like 60 skills test, and I'm in full panic mode trying to figure out what the next steps in my life are. I'm in a new state that won't accept my teaching certificates or teachings not an option, and even if it was, I wouldn't want to. I just want to be able to provide for my family any suggestions welcome.

They said that the interview process is pretty relaxed, and that the day after the interview they would all talk about me and then if they decided to make an offer they would bring it to the manager for approval, and I would 'probably hear back the next day or so'. 

It's been about a week now so I am a bit concerned that I haven't heard back, they made it sound like it would be sooner. I am thinking of following up and maybe offering references or letters of recommendation (they haven't brought up references), but I'm not really sure how to go about it.

After I applied, an HR person contacted me for interview availability. After I gave it, a different HR person sent the meeting invite. I do not have contact information for any of the people who interviewed me. Supposing that I should follow up:

- do i reply to the email asking about my availability?

- do i reply to the email with the meeting invite?

- do i send a new email to one of the HR person, and if so which one?

Only time I ever hear from him is to give me praise or to communicate about one of his clients (he is a cpa) I run my own bookkeeping/payroll business on the side (mostly just family) which has been great to supplement my income because he pays me SHIT.

The thing is - he lives in a very LCOL area and me in a MCOL area. I see how much he invoices his clients for and his prices are incredibly reasonable - too reasonable IMO. 

I have been contacted by a company I worked with in the past (they were a vendor of mine) They are expanding and opening a business down the street from me. They have made me several offers and this latest one is over 6 figures. They would only need me about 30 hours a week, meaning I could technically do both (which they are fine with; they have expressed they are NOT expecting me to shut my side business down, and I could even just invoice them under my business and basically I would just being taking on a HUGE client) but I’m not sure my current boss would be happy with me as my availability would decrease.

1g8n0fr,Put in my 2 week notice for my current job however don't have another one lined up. Anybody been in a similar situation and how did you handle it?,"Hi all.

Last week I put in my 2 week resignation which was accepted. I wasn't feeling the best mentally after our new management shakeup. The TL;DR of it was I was working at the company for 2 1/2 years and had received multiple pay rises with my last one being 5 months back. We had a new manager come in who put me on a PIP which I expressed I thought was unfair considering I've never had any formal warnings from the company and the two instances she sited were from 1-1 1/2 years back. After waking up, I saw a had a PIP Performance Review (the day following my previous one with the CEO this time so I knew it wasn't going to be the best). I decided I'd just put in my resignation. They've asked me to work an additional 2 weeks meaning this will be effective in 3 weeks.

I've taken a couple of sick days as well, I did one today and they asked me to bring a Doctors note in which I can't do in the morning. I also have a lease signed for a new placed which costs $150 more then I'm currently paying so can't overly be out of work for more then 2 weeks.

I've taken a couple of calls for phone interviews so far however without anything being concrete I feel as if I've made a really bad call but also couldn't continue on with that job for my mental sanity. I'm currently in IT and do not have any qualifications (mainly customer support and training clients) however I know that this field I'm in is not something I want to do for the rest of my life so taking these job interviews has made it quite challenging to be mentally focused. Also doing IT for the past 5 years I do not want to go back to hospitality.

How would you guys suggest I play this/has anyone been in a similar situation? How would you handle these last few weeks at my current job?

1g8mzh1,25M newly grad (International Business) feeling lost ,"I’m hard working, great with people, but have a bit of anxiety about “career jobs”. I’m just completely lost on what to do. I live in a smaller city in Ohio so relocating in the future will be likely, especially since my degree isn’t very applicable here. I have 4+ years of experience bartending/bar backing, and a couple years of administrative assistance experience, but nothing that really gives me that “real job”responsibility. I’m open to pretty much anything as I have yet to choose a proper path, but seem to get ignored for supervisor/manager jobs in my location. Everything else pays a horrifically low wage and I don’t want to be a career bartender. There are a few factories near me that I’m thinking of re-applying to to try to land a supervisor job, but not much has come of that so far. Does anybody have any advice or in a similar spot?

For the last 8 years, I've been working remotely (with occasional trips) as a consultant for a big development organization. It can be interesting, and pay is ok, but not great.

I'm stuck a few ways.

First, almost literally. My husband is a diplomat, and we live somewhere I'm not allowed to work, so remote work is the only thing I'm in allowed to do. We have two years left until we can move. And we have young children, so where we are, we have good childcare.

Second, I feel so unmotivated. I miss human interaction, and days can be boring. In 8 years, there's no progress (I've not had a single performance review). I also have a sense of not achieving anything, which is in contrast to how I did in college and earlier in my career.

The problem is feeling stuck and bored is that it reduces my energy to do something - study something, take a sabbatical, make a plan, anything.

1g8mltl,I just got fired from my dream job while on vacation. How do I handle this?,"I’m on vacation after working for 7 days a week over the last 4 months. I desperately needed the break. Then, out of nowhere, I get an email with the subject line: Employment Status. I open it, and my stomach just drops. I’ve been terminated. Over email. One week into my 2 week long vacation.

I immediately call my boss, hoping this is some mistake. Spoiler: it’s not. She tells me this is some corporate way of “getting the truth out of people.” I wasn’t hiding anything! She just didn’t believe me or bother investigating further before sending a random termination email while I’m on vacation.

Here’s what started all of this: On Wednesday, October 9th, I covered a shift that wasn’t mine. When I was leaving, I noticed I hadn’t been clocked in. Normally, I’d text my co worker to fix it, but this time I used my company laptop to adjust it myself.

The next day, my boss asked me how I made the edit. I told her the truth—I did it. She asked more questions, but I didn’t think I did anything wrong. I worked those hours, so I edited the time. I assumed if she had a real issue, we’d have a conversation in person, not just text.

Fast forward 10 days—I’m across the country, enjoying vacation—and she changes all the company passwords. That freaked me out even before I saw the termination email. And that’s how I found out: via email. Fired.

Panicking, I called her immediately. Thankfully, she answered. I was barely holding it together and basically begged, “what’s going on? Why did you fire me?” She says that the way I edited the clock made her lose trust in me. Apparently, she thought I’d logged out of my account to log into someone else’s. I explained that I had used both my phone and my company laptop, which had automatically logged me into Montana’s account (not my own) without me realizing it.

Once I explained this, she seemed relieved. She even told me, “It makes sense. I still want you to work for me for years to come!” I thought it was resolved.

Then—30 minutes later—she calls me again. This time, she says she talked to her husband, co owner, and he still wants me gone. She says there’s nothing she can do and tells me I’ll “do great in life” and offers to write me a recommendation. Cool, right?

Here’s the kicker, I’ve been working for $15 an hour for the past four months, even though I was doing way more than my original front desk job. I took on the role of marketing, social media, and community outreach on top of front desk. No pay increase, no nothing. They promised we’d discuss my salary after I got back from vacation, so I believed them. But I guess they never planned to have that conversation.

What makes it even harder is that I’ve never been punished at this job—only praised. It gave me a false sense of appreciation, which is probably why I kept working for such a low rate.

This whole thing has sent me spiraling into self-doubt and confusion. I was so wrapped up in their lives—nannying their neighbor’s kids, working at her friend’s boutique, getting invited over for dinner—and they fired me over email, while I was on vacation. I just can’t understand how people can treat someone like that.",Itsabonesday,1090,0.8199999928474426,778,1729507288,2024-10-21 10:41:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g8mltl/i_just_got_fired_from_my_dream_job_while_on/,10,2024
1g8mjja,Move from supply chain to finance. Thoughts? ,"Hello all, quick context I work at a large automotive Company, I transferred two years ago from Mexico to Germany. 

Recently my boss apporoached me to tell me that they're creating new roles to fill a gap in our process, and he wanted to let me know that he was thinking of suggesting me for this position and asked me if I would be interested, he said he wouldn't want to lose me, but that it would be good for my career and a good fit due to my technical background.

My current role is NPI within Supply Chain and this new position is within Finance in cost engineeering.

The details on salary are still pending as the position is being created, but I'm kinda weary of leaving Supply Chain for Finance. I don't know if it would be smart, I really don't know much about finance as a department.

I've started my career in engineering (development of new products), then program manangement and now procurement.

Any advice? Whatever you can share with me about being in finance would be useful.

1g8lpyi,Not sure which degree to pursue,"Hi. I would greatly appreciate some advice regarding my thoughts on a decision.

I am currently trying to decide on what degree to pursue. The shortlisted options I'm debating is Film School (For a BA in production), Mechanical Engineering, Electical Engineering, and Computer Science.

I've always seen myself and been seen by others as a creative. All my past exploits have been in the realm of the entertainment industry. The vast majority of the marketable skills I have taught myself also fall under the umbrella of creative work. Directing a successful film and/or tv series is very much on my bucket list of life goals which I shall be pursuing regardless of what my day job is and there's a renowned film school just next door.

However, the constant warnings against pursuing creative work as well as the prevailing feelings of ""I could, so maybe I should."" is making think on this decision a lot harder than I probably should.

All throughout school and then some, I never once considered pursuing engineering or computer science.

I'm not particularly good at math and science, definitely have never furthered my knowledge of it outside of school, but I am not bad at it either. I have confidence in my math abilities and know I can make it through an engineering or compsci degree if I wanted to. The promises of a high salary and high employability are therefore drawing me in to consider these options.

I do like the ""idea"" of being an engineer. I'm sure I'll find some of what I learn interesting. I have sometimes taken things apart just to put it back together again. But I have no measure on whether or not I'll be satisfied actually working as an engineer. As I said, I have never spent my own time pursuing this course of action which makes me err on the side of caution. I watched through some free MIT Lectures on the subject and found little appeal in them. Forcing myself through a difficult degree with possibly disinteresting coursework to qualify for jobs that I may not find fulfilling is something I would like to avoid.

CompSci isn't completely outside my realm of experience. I have done quite a bit of programming under the context of making small video games both for my own amusement and to share with friends. Starting a video game studio is also on the bucket list of life goals. However, my movement in this direction has always been under the context of game dev. Programming was never the sole skill being developed. I learned it as an means to an end and have always enjoyed the creative work (3D art, illustration, design and writing) a lot more to the point where I have actually independently developed these skills (And even did some freelance work with them). I have no direct interest in programming under other contexts nor do I find the idea of sitting at a desk all day as particularly appealing.

Going the film school route, I know I would be spending the next few years with like-minded people. I know I will have some fun along the way with coursework that genuinely interests me and that I know I want to learn. The skillset I learn would be far more useful to me regarding what I'd like to achieve in this life. I am confident that I can leverage the degree for any graphic design, media, communications, and production management position should I struggle finding work in the entertainment industry. However, the risks of low employability, low income, and wasted time as perpetuated on reddit and other places have made me reconsider.

So what it comes down to is thus: I have no history of interest in Engineering or Compsci beyond the occasional episode of ""How it's made"", but the idea of a secure future and the perception of them being high status careers has brought these routes to my attention. I am confident that I am capable of pursuing these degrees, maybe even do really well in them, which leaves me to ask myself ""I could, so maybe I should?"" At the same time, I have no measure of whether or not I'll be happy in these careers and that uncertainty scares me. Moreover, I don't want the next 3-5 years while pursuing a bachelor's to be a miserable experience, which I fear might happen should I pursue the more theory based and quantitative Engineering and Compsci courses.

So, dear reader, I ask for some advice. Is there information I may be missing? Is there a way for me to get clarity? What would you say are the tell-tale signs that one should or should not pursue Engineering or Compsci? Should I quit overthinking and follow the direction that appeals to me the most?

1g8ldpb,I need a career advice,"Hi all, this is my first post. I usually don't write on social media but I am a bit stucked right now and I don't know what to do so I'm searching for some advice. 

I am an aerospace engineer in Europe, 27 years. I graduated about a year ago but I think I completely made a mistake in choosing my career path. During my years at university I focused on systems as a first career path even though also aerodynamics was on my interest so I tried to do also some exams in fluid dynamics and really loved them. 

For various reason at the end of the path, the only possibility to work before thesis was a internship of six months as a system engineer so I decided to do it because I wanted to start making experience. The job was ok but not great and I thought that maybe the problem could be the industry I worked for or the fact that it was just a traineeship.

So after graduation, due to the lack of offer in Aerodynamics jobs and due to the thesis/trainee I had done, I only received job offers in systems field. I needed money so I started working immediately after the master degree.

The problem is that now I am 8 months into this job and I can easily say that I hate almost every aspect of it and going to work has become pretty unbearable. I need to change.

My scope would be to switch career for a position like thermal engineer or aerodynamics and cfd related subjects but there are very few job offers and it is difficult to even get an interview with my system CV. Is it possible to do a complete career switch even though I don't have any experience in fluid dynamics other than 4-5 exams and a bit of experience in Ansys made during university? Are there any courses I can do to have a bit more experience in this field? Should I modify the CV, ""hiding"" the 1 year experience in systems engineer, in order to be more Cfd oriented for the interviews or leave it as it stands?

1g8lbey,"Plant engineer that prefers working outside, not stuck to the office","First of all, I know this all sounds very privileged. Some would love an engineering degree but can't get one. I got one but I noticed that most engineering office jobs seem quite toxic. There's competition among colleagues, there's pressure from bosses above or from clients, often you need to redirect that pressure to your colleagues that are lower in hierarchy. Deadlines get the worst out of people. 8h+ daily blue light screentime, sedentary at a horrible posture.

When I took a break to work outside on a farm, I noticed how my mood swinged. Not the same pressure to perform, lovely colleagues, the work trained the body and we got lots of fresh air and sunlight.

Now I've been playing with the thought of becoming a farmer, but economically it's very difficult to get land and to do that transition. I also don't think it is very wise financially and thinking about the future when I start losing today's mobility that I enjoy. Aren't there any (plant) engineering jobs that are outside? Did some of you make better experiences in office jobs (like those that have a gym for lunch breaks for example)?

As I'm working in the (micro)biology space, maybe something like that as an outside job could be interesting too.

So recently I have been thinking that I want to be a singer however I dont like singing lessons . Its not that I hate it , I just feel like its boring and I have no plans on being the greatest singer in the world like Whitney Houston . But I still want to be one because I wanna have my own concert someday and record my own music too . I wanna co write my music too . 

But isnt it in order to be a sucessful musician , you have to be either good at singing or song writing or performing ? So yeah Im not that good of a singer and I dont even like songwriting nor do i hate it . Thats why I thought maybe just excell in co writing music .

 Also thought of maybe I should be just good at performing instead because I always pretended that I have my own live performances (with my stuffed animals) when I was young . And I always dreamt of having a concert someday and its like broadway style . Like its gonna have its own story

I know its ad naseum atp but thats my reasons :)

I also want to be an actor because I enjoy portraying celebrities since I was young . I also enjoyed acting like i was in different tv shows with my stuffed toys back then . I think i might enjoy acting classes too more than singing class. I also imagine that I feel like im gonna be more intrinsically motivated on acting in set .

An issue that I have is that when my mind remembers that I have 0 desires on excelling vocally or i feel like ill think ill enjoy acting lessons more than singing my mind will switch up on being a actor or i and when my mind remembers I have 0 desires on watching films ill just be a singer instead .

And plus I want a career that ill wont quit after like 4 - 5 years or even a decade

 I know these careers are hard to get into but i want it.

I know i have posted an essay here on reddit similar to this but this issue is still lingering in my mind and it needs to come to an end.

1g8ik02,I took a career break and it changed my life!,"# 

I took a career break 14 months ago, and it completely changed my life. I believe everyone should take one. Here are 5 solid benefits:

1. RECALIBRATES THE DIRECTION OF YOUR MOVEMENT

With a busy job, it’s hard to assess your career and life trajectory. A break gives you enough time to reflect and make necessary adjustments.

2. GIVES YOU A TASTE OF FREEDOM

Since my break, new ways to make money have opened up. After 14 months, I don’t think I would ever want a full-time job again. The freedom feels worth more than a monthly paycheck.

3. DE-ADDICTS YOU FROM A MONTHLY SALARY

*“The three most harmful addictions are heroin, carbohydrates, and a monthly salary.” — Nassim Taleb.*

A career break helps you break free from one of them.

4. GETS YOU NEW PERSPECTIVES IN LIFE

Working 9 to 5 traps you in routine. A break lets you try new things like travel, reading, meeting people, and learning new skills. It expands your worldview and brings you closer to reality.

5. HELPS YOU VALUE YOUR JOB MORE

Stepping away makes you appreciate what a job provides — money, achievement, camaraderie — and makes you grateful rather than resentful towards your job.

If your finances allow it, I think taking a career break is a good decision. Everyone should take one.

**IF YOUR FINANCES DON’T ALLOW — START SAVING TODAY!**

I don’t know a single person who took a break and regretted it; rather, they started craving more of it.

It even helped some of them (like me) break free from their 9 to 5 jobs.

**Bonus** → You get a taste of building something yourself.

If, during the break, you start building something of your own, you realize the joy it brings. The thrill of having total skin in the game and seeing direct alignment between your inputs and outputs is unmatched.

You begin to understand the power of leverage and how to create it for yourself.

Very difficult to build something alongside a job.

**Bonus 2** → You discover how little you need.

With time away from the constant grind, you realize that the material things you once thought were essential don’t hold as much value. The simplicity and freedom from overconsumption become eye-opening.

# You realise that over-consumption comes from the over-stress of a hectic job. You stop overspending and realise that you don’t need a lot of money to survive.

1g8g6pk,Is this unfair and worthy of reporting?,"I'll keep this as short as possible without omitting pertinent information.

I've worked 100% remote for a very large, global company for almost 5 years. I have 15 years prior experience. Positive feedback every review; nothing negative. Last month I was told my role was becoming hybrid. My manager and her manager are both aware I have a young child in school and that my family has one vehicle. I live 60 miles from the nearest office and my commute takes 1 hour and 25 minutes without traffic or weather issues. I can't afford to purchase a vehicle without notice/planning but was able to temporarily borrow one when I need it. My situation restricts me from being physically present in office for 8 hours/day when I'm required to be there but I can easily still work at least 40 hours per week.

After a few weeks of giving it a shot just to see if it was legit (it wasn't... same exact shit I do remotely) I was told I had to be in office for 8 hours which would result in my leaving after the time I needed to be home. I was given a weekend to ""think about it.""

I met with HR and explained the impossibility of the situation and that I felt targeted. Then I met with the executive for my area and explained that I was being put in an impossible situation with not enough time to figure it out. Both were sympathetic and said they'd come up with something reasonable. Then I met with the person making these decisions and their solution was to throw my work-life balance even further out of whack, maybe having me come in more days, dismissed my concerns and their response about the drive time was ""the rest of my team are all an hour away."" But, I'm the only one with a child. My manager is an hour away, has grown adult kids and makes much more money than I do, obviously. Another colleague has a 15-minute commute, and the last member of my team chooses to work in office and also makes much more than I do. They're also less than an hour away. So that was bull$hit, my concerns were dismissed, and they actually suggested that they'd understand if I took a different WFH job that pays more.

I feel like I need to get in front of this, meet with HR again ASAP and explain that I absolutely feel that a manager is trying to force me out. Does it sound like I'm taking the correct actions to protect myself here?",im_tired_of_it,1,1.0,1,1729479999,2024-10-21 03:06:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g8g6pk/is_this_unfair_and_worthy_of_reporting/,10,2024

Finally I have made it to be able to escape my toxic workplace and will very soon join my dream job. And the time has come for which I was eagerly waiting for so long that is notice period aka honeymoon phase as they say! Lol 

But here is the catch, while I am actually serving my notice period,I am still the sincere, committed employee who would work extended hours if project demands and also because as a junior employee I am quite enjoying the current tasks I am doing  which has a learning scope for me. But that doesn't mean I would still adhere to their orders and demands especially when they engage in office politics and unethical means. 

So,I want to come out of my default dedicated employee mode to rebel mode,
I want to just do the bare minimum witjout creating any big issue and enjoy my notice period to the full. 

Please give me some tips:)

1g8fltg,Switching jobs after 6 months... twice?,"I'm a fairly new graduate (1 year) in mechanical engineering and had somewhat of hard time with my first post-grad jobs...

My first job was in the aerospace sector ; I've always wanted to work in aerospace/aviation and I did specialize in that field during my studies. Unfortunately, I've been kinda deceived during the interview process, I was told I would be working on some very cool tasks (think simulation, code, wind tunnel testing etc.) but found out once I started working there that they were mainly an ""integrator"", meaning that 95% of the design was done from third parties and that all the engineers did was to make sure the requirements were followed by the suppliers. I was basically working as a ""requirements"" engineer and I absolutely hated that role. Within 3 months I was already applying to other jobs and by the 6th month I left the company for the first place that offered me a half decent interesting role.

Here I am, 2 months into my second role, which is 1000x more enjoyable than my first... although there is still something missing. My role is much more focused on design (think CAD, 3D printing, basic calcs/FEA) BUT it's not related to aerospace at all AND even though I enjoy doing mechanical design, it's not necessarily something I want to do for my career. I feel like I'm stalling and not really gaining any useful skills or knowledge.

Therefore I'm thinking of starting to apply in a couple of months to roles involving more of the cool tasks (the ones I was supposed to do in my first job) in another aerospace company. I would make SURE that this next aero company would make me work on ACTUAL technical tasks by asking numerous people in my network I was able to connect with due to my first aero job.

My question is, would my profile and application be seen as a red flag during the hiring process? Since I'd be trying to job hop twice in a year? Is there a possibility that my profile goes on some sort of blacklist for a specific company because of that? What should I tell them at the interview? Should I wait a little longer before applying, at the risk of pigeon hole-ing me as a mechanical design engineer? Did someone have a similar experience in the past, and what happened?

I was in for computers for first year and graphic design, I wanted to do welding but I had option to switch after the first week because all of the academic sides of it was so much more than I had expected. You had to be good at math, measuring, and those types of the sort, I didn’t mind it being physical but academically I knew I wasn’t prepped for it.  As I got into graphic design it was much academically easier but then it was requiring so much skill and things I didn’t know you could do on a computer.

But boy was I wrong, and this all started because a year back a got kicked out of college for lack of attendance which was my fault but reason was because I just lost interest. I wanted to know for people who were my age, what can I do. 

Key thing is i don’t know what I want to do, and I want to know should I get back in shape and join the military or should I still consider college.

1g8ecdy,Resume Writers? College help?,"I’m 35, a consulting principal software engineer working with a large firm. No chance of going FT because of agreements and even less chance because of RTO and my current location. Been open to work and bouncing between active/passive searching as MH allows.

Has anyone used resume writers? Was it helpful? Do you have college education? 

I have a lifetime of tech experience and I have difficulty quantifying it even when I go out to 2 pages on the resume. I have no college degree, always got the runaround when applying to college, and finally got told around a year ago that “something” is wrong with my transcript that my HS should be able to fix. They wouldn’t elaborate what’s wrong and the HS stopped returning my calls/emails.

Today, I was checking the career page again to see whether the job is still open or not. Job is open.

I checked the interviews on Glassdoor and someone shared their interview experience and they accepted the offer. They shared that interview took 3 weeks and it was easy (based on what they shared).

Now, I regret for not taking that action. I'm feeling so bad at myself, feeling like punishing.

I'll still apply for that open job, hopefully they are growing and have multiple positions for the same job opening!

1g8e5p0,Advice for someone burnt out but whose life is only beginning? ,"I am an 18 year old American who graduated high school last year. I am taking a gap year to figure my shit out. My high school years were a nightmare I’d like to forget. I don’t want to air my life out on this app but I had traumatic experiences young that sent me into a spiral of bad decisions that ruined my life. This began at the age of 11, I began healing at about 17- now I am 18.  

Unfortunately the peak of my trauma occurred during my highschool years and as a result my transcript is shit. There are certainly worse out there but mine is not at all representative of my capabilities or intellect. This is a huge problem right now as I’m trying to figure out realistic options for higher education. In elementary school I consistently placed at the top of my class in standardized tests and pretty much everything academic. I was totally fluent in Mandarin Chinese by the time I was 9. I did do varsity debate from 8th grade to senior year but that’s about all I have to be proud of. 

I feel like I’m way too young to feel so old. I feel like all I know is that I know very little. But I have to make decisions soon about what to do and where to go from here. 
 
I can’t be the only person who’s been in this situation. I have too much potential to end up at a dead end job I hate but I’m not smart enough to figure my way out alone.

1g8dgam,"Applied for another job at the location where I work. I want the other job, but unsure how to tell both managers.","Hello :) 

I work at a medical facility as a receptionist currently. I only work for 12 hours on Sunday. I told my departments boss I am looking for more hours multiple times. To no avail. 

So, I applied online for another department but at the same location. This job is as an assistant for a social worker, and it’s something I really want. Something I would consider going to school for, as I think that’s where I’d shine. It’s also Mon-Thurs at 8 hours a day. 

Here’s the issue: 

My current boss doesn’t want me to leave reception. The boss for the position I applied for wants me as their assistant. They talked, and the social services boss, told my current boss, “I will take her if you cannot get her more hours. If you can get her more hours, you can keep her since you want her in your department.” 

I think this is because I started as reception. I don’t think it’s necessarily right to steal and employee from another department, but I’ve never been a manger/ department director (?) before. 

I want to tell both of them that I prefer working in social services as it’s something I would much prefer and see myself pursuing. I just do not know how to approach this, or if I should approach it at all and wait and see how it unfolds? 

I just subscribe to “go getting” (I guess?) and I would prefer that they know that the assistant position is something I want and will continue to go after until I get it. Whether that’s at this current place or somewhere else. 

TL;DR: applied for another job at my current work, in another department. I prefer the other department, and want to tell managers of both departments exactly that but not sure how.

1g8bcio,Boss told me to grow up… how do I move on ,"My boss ( 60’s m ) told me (23 f)  to “ grow up “
I work for a hotel and have been with the current company for two years. I started off at $14 an hour in housekeeping. Within two months of employment I was moved in to front desk $15 an hour and within six months of employment I was moved to an assistant manager at $19 an hour. I stayed in the management position for six months. 
Last October I stepped down from my management position to the front desk. I received very little support from my manager, we turned through people so quickly it seemed like it would never calm down  and my training was three days at another site. I did not feel as if I was prepared well enough for the job and I was working crazy hours, it was too much for me.  I was told I would keep my management pay when I stepped down and I had transferred to front desk title with the pay of $19 an hour. 

Then, I was told that I wouldn’t be able to keep manager pay and transferred to front desk title again, just with $15 an hour pay. When that happened, I ended up rage quitting and clocked out. I was working night shifts, still on the same schedule as when I was in management, I got fed up. I am a firm believer in you don’t leave a hotel unattended so I sat behind the desk incase a guest did need anything through out the night and I let my old manager know that I had clocked out, and I would be sitting behind the desk if a guest did need something and that tonight would be my last night. 

Which is how I got the job with my current manager. I had ended up leaving the company for five weeks. Quitting my job was the start of my nervous breakdown and during those five weeks I worked closely with a psych and a therapist to get myself back together. My current manager called me and offered me a job at his location. Because I quit, I was still expected to make $15. I didn’t care at that point though, I was about to go through a 6 week training for a mortgage company and I really loved my job at the hotel. And I loved the company.

And I was comfortable making $15 an hour at the time. I had only had a year of experience at that point and very little management training. When I first started here we had a full staff. I knew the amount of work I had to do and felt because I had quit I should just be grateful to be back with the company. 
Flash forward to a year later and I feel as if I 
have grown tremendously as an employee. Our full time night shift girl was late every day for eight months. No I am not making this up. It would range from 30-45 minutes, sometimes two hours, and as I said I am a firm believer in not leaving the hotel and some nights I would have to pull a double for a no call no show and my manager would never answer his phone like he was supposed to or hold the night shift girl accountable. We lost our old assistant manager last January and did not receive another assistant manager until this September. During this time I was stepping up, it was really organic and I didn’t even notice how much I had been doing for those several months until we got another agm and my responsibilities. significantly decreased with management stuff. Inventory count for orders, training new hires, stocking supply closets, putting in work orders… When we would lose housekeepers I was cleaning rooms with my manager while working desk or just cleaning rooms by myself and working desk.We lost out maintenance man in March and just hired one about three weeks ago. So I was also doing minor MT stuff, like changing light bulbs, pulling trash, changing door locks, unclogging sinks and toilets. 
And I am grateful to be relieved of those responsibilities because it has made my job significantly easier. 

However, we recently hired two part time new hires. My manager interviewed both in front of me in the lobby while I was working at the desk and both were hired starting at $15 an hour. At this point I was making ( still am )  $15.26 an hour. 

Within the past  month, we have started shutting down at night instead of having a 3rd shift. While this makes sense for the hotel and the business we attract, before the transition we heavily relied on that third shift to finish whatever day shift could not finish. Now, day shift and mid shift ( my shift ) naturally have more work to do. I spend a lot more time cleaning, still running trash, doing laundry, dishes, etc…
So, a few weeks ago I asked my boss for a raise and he explained he would talk to upper management. I hadn’t heard anything about it..
Two weeks ago I had gotten overwhelmed at work, like I used to when I worked for the other manager, and decided I needed to go home for the evening. I have never up until that point left in the middle of a shift. The previous three days our agm was off and our manager was working at the desk ( he doesn’t usually get to the laundry for whatever reason ) , so when I came in the laundry was insane and I did finish all of it, however I had misplaced the fitted and flat sheets on the shelves and upset one of our housekeepers. I apologized to my manager and out of frustration said that I would be more then willing to teach the housekeeper how to fold if she wanted to help, since she's always finishing her board super early.  However I will make sure to be more mindful when I'm folding. Because when I was in housekeeping that set me off too. 
And what set me off, and I don’t know why, was my manager saying, “ Yeah she bitched about it all day. All day bitching.” And I just left, I felt sick to my stomach and got a head ache out of nowhere.
When I came back the following day, he asked me if I had spoken to my upper ( district ) manager about a raise. I had emailed him and asked him to go part time two days a week when I left later that night. I was clearly unhappy but still wanted to stay with the company part time. I was going to look for another full time job. I explained I hadn’t seen him or spoken with him, I don’t really speak with him and I thought he was going to reach out to speak to him about it but I would call him the next day to talk to him about it. My manager said it was ok and he would speak to him about it. 

I come in after my day off and my district manager was on site. He was super nice, asking me how I was doing, if I had moved into my apartment finally ( I have ) helped me run dishes and linen. I was waiting for my district manager and manager to let me know about the raise and when my district manager left for the day, I figured I should just ask my boss. He explained to me my district manager said no, no raises until the annual in June and pay isn’t supposed to be discussed. And I was really upset I was told no, I am going to be honest. However I love my job and my company and I know it is what it is. I had asked my manager if there was anything he could do, if he could try to talk to him again it just didn’t make sense to me in the moment and he then said pay isn’t discussed and I shouldn’t be discussing it with the new hires or asking them about it. I explained I hadn’t and I only knew of how much they were making because he chose to interview them in the lobby in front of me and discuss pay in front of me. I was working my shift. 
He then went on to explain that I shouldn’t feel bad, he wanted supplemental pay over the summer and didn’t get it when we were understaffed. And that made me snap and I said to him, “ You’re the manager. You make a salary and get bonuses. I need to leave. ” and on my way out he proceeded to shout at  me, “ Oh grow up. “
And I did walk out the door, take a deep breath and think about what he said, and it pissed me off. I am the youngest in the office. I usually am. It's a huge insecurity of mine. SO when he said that, I decided to try to calm down and go back into my shift, while I still had a shift to work. He let me work it, so I decided not to talk to him the rest of the time he was there that night. 
And I apologize for the novel, I want to make it a point to explain everything because my current manager has treated me very well, up until the past couple months. I did switch my birth control so I know I am going through some hormonal stuff, but for some reason after no raise allowed and my boss telling me to grow up, Im starting to think this isn’t a good fit for me anymore. I know I needed to be told to grow up I just don’t think it was appropriate to hear it from him. Also though, I really am trying to grow up. I know I am only 23 and it shows and its so embarrassing sometimes and I feel as if I have to work 3x as hard just for people to take me seriously. 
I don’t know, I come seeking advice. I wouldn’t even be here if it was not for this manager, with this company at all. Should I find a different job? Should I wait it out? At this point I don’t even want to go part time because I don’t know if it would even be worth it with how insecure I feel over this grown up comment my boss made. I feel as if I am an ok employee. I try my best to do my work well and I show up everyday 20-30 minutes early. I just need advice.
Honest, honest advice please. And different viewpoints and perspectives,

1g8b3op,How to fill in employment gap with startup experience?,"Hey everyone I got laid off in July from my job as a senior analyst (product management). During my time I built my experience in strategy (building roadmap) and delivery (launching products to market using agile). 

I also developed my own mobile app from November of 2023. I was juggling my full time job and this startup. I was driving it primarily from a business standpoint (ideation, designing, testing, marketing, outreach). I figured with the layoff I can focus on my app. However, due to the current VC market, I have decided to get back into the job market to at least have basic financial standing and savings.

Currently I have placed this start up experience as a product manager role on my resume. Question is:

1. Does it look bad to companies/recruiters that I've worked on two jobs at the same time? On my resume my old job and startup timeline coincide in terms of dates 

2. Should I remove my startup experience or change the start date to when I got laid off? 

2a. If I remove my startup experience, would my chances of getting a job lower because of my unemployment gap? (July to present) 

I would any advice on this matter. Any ex-founders who have gone through the same thing or current recruiters would be highly appreciated as well.

1g8b1vg,Did I make a wrong decision with my new job?,"I was a very proud graduate a few years ago because I got my degree in a niche field and loved the industry I was working in. My first job out of college didn't work out because of the schedule, sexism, disrespect, etc. but I found another job still within the industry that I loved! Unfortunately, that company got sold and the buyers only retained the assets, not the employees. 

  
My mother works for a major corporation in a completely different industry. I have no prior knowledge of this industry which I have never experienced, as I have only ever worked in the previous industry starting in high school. This new job told me it would take 3-6 months to get used to the tasks, at a minimum. The job was listed as entry level and only required a high school degree, but once I met with my new manager, he told me it really wasn't entry level and was going to be very overwhelming and difficult for a while. I know I can do it, but I feel like a failure and don't really want to haha. I hate that I am already struggling (it's been 2 weeks) but I can't shake the feeling that I made a bad decision. I feel like I didn't try hard enough to stay in the old industry. 

  
Side notes: that main pull to this corporate job was the benefits. I would never have seen benefits like the corporate job offers if I had stayed in my old industry. I also am working from home now which is such a blessing.

1g8aspf,Work from Home struggle (quality assurance),"Apologies, this will be a lengthy post, and I'm not exactly sure where to begin. I guess I'm wondering if anyone has had similar experiences and, if so, how you coped with and handled them.

I've been working from home for two years. It's a call center position for a healthcare company—scheduling appointments, submitting medication refill requests, and occasionally handling crisis/emergency calls. I've been working in the healthcare field for nearly ten years and enjoy working with and talking to patients—it's genuinely rewarding. The first year on the job went relatively well. 

However, at the beginning of this year, I started getting super low quality assurance scores, and the same individual suddenly audited all my calls for almost two months. Most of the critiques had to do with not nailing the 'script' properly. Nothing was mentioned about jeopardizing patient safety or information. At first, I just accepted the scores and tried to 'do better' even though I felt uneasy. I eventually had to reach out to my manager because it was starting to affect my mental and overall confidence on the job. I was suddenly anxious about my every word which just made things even worse. My manager then had a meeting with quality assurance, and they reviewed my calls. All was suddenly well again, and the individual who had been auditing my calls and giving me constant fail scores hasn't reviewed my calls ever since. No explanation was given, but I was reassured my job wasn't in jeopardy.

Now, I'm having a similar issue with quality assurance again. There is a new auditor who has been giving me super low scores again for the past month. My average score is usually around 95%, with the exception of the fiasco at the beginning of the year (my average dived down to 85%). Now, my average is mired in the low 80s. I don't know if it's because she's new, but my co-workers have praised her for being 'fair and understanding.' I reached out to my manager again and I'll be having a meeting with her this Tuesday to talk about it. 

I'm not sure what to make of this recurrence (or even the first occurrence). I work from home and don't know these people; I never talk to them. I keep telling myself it can't be personal, but it sort of feels like it(?).

It's all the more worrying because this is my literal livelihood. I had been living out of a motel when I got this position (I left an abusive marriage, and my former partner spent most of our money on drugs and alcohol). This job was essentially a lifeline, and even though things in my life are more stable (no longer homeless and have an apartment) I'm still essentially living paycheck to paycheck. I don't want to give my employer a sob story, but my life isn't a game or a joke. 

I actually scheduled an emergency meeting with my therapist because I started experiencing something close to suicidal ideation. I also starting applying for other work from home positions in the same healthcare network (I live in the middle of nowhere because it's all I can afford atm). I really don't want to have to leave the company entirely because it would be difficult to completely start over. What's a shame is I actually like the patients (most of my co-workers don't - there is a lot of verbal abuse).

Anyone else go through something similar? Did you stay in the position and power through it? Did it get better?",Sufficient_Cat_3645,1,1.0,0,1729463031,2024-10-20 22:23:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g8aspf/work_from_home_struggle_quality_assurance/,10,2024

1g89reu,Thinking about switching careers/going back to school as a mom. ,"I’m trying to decide if I should go back to school and pursue a different career. 

I have a degree in graphic design & marketing and I graduated in 2017. I worked in that field a few years and realized I didn’t really like it, then I worked random jobs and went through a lot of life changes. 

Fast forward to now, I’m a stay at home mom working part time in graphic design/administration for a nonprofit remotely. It pays barely anything and I know as a long-term plan and in this economy that I need to have a better paying job. Graphic design in general isn’t the best paying unless you stay in an agency for years and when I was working in it, I really hated working in an office setting. Plus at this point in my life I don’t care much for design at all. I might do some side work with it but I don’t want to continue pursuing it as my main career. 

My husband is a doctor and our toddler has had a lot of medical issues, which has made me interested in the medical field. I was actually always interested in it but never thought I would have the brains/skill to do something like nursing. 

I’m looking for advice on going back to school while being a mom, and switching careers completely. Is it worth it or would I be wasting my time and money? Does anyone have experience or advice to share?

1g88kqe,Should I just stop looking for jobs and start a software company? ,"Hi everyone, I am a new business grad with 1YOE from internships and a good gpa. Given the condition of this labour market I am wondering if its even worth it to look for jobs. Most people will give advice along the lines of:

- Network: Takes time to build relationships (4-6 months, or more) and even then that ""network"" might not translate into a role.   
- Shoppers: Okay without, but I have student debt.

It's fine if I can land something by applying to 3-4 roles every day but so far it has not been working, I have a good boring resume (ones that work) minimal white space and good pointers. I need something immediately and at max have a 6 month (I have been burning cash for around 6 months now applying to jobs) 

Take me as greatest noob, but I am just looking for some advice. 

I need to learn flask of django along with postgresql, aws rds, and a few other aws services like auth, cc, etc. and Kubernetes. 

Sounds like a handful and if you haven't laughed by now I'd ideally want to learn them enough to build an app within 2-3 months. Cherry on top is I don't even know how to code and will probably go youtube and chatgpt route, for both building and debugging. 

I did identify a really good niche problem and don't think it would be tough to hit 2K monthly once I have it built out.

What should I do?   
Get a co-founder while I make calls to potential clients?  
Build it out myself and just take the leap of fait?

I finished my associates, although I feel like that really is not even worth mentioning. I am also unsure of how much weight veteran status carries.

So as the title says, I've been a bit confused as to which  direction I should be heading right now in my career.  Currently 'm (27m) working as a Garden Maintenance  Manager, making a pretty average salary of around £35k  per year on a visa here in the UK.  

Lately, ï'm just really not enjoying the whole idea of  doing this the rest of my life. Constant stress about  workers and managing expectations of hundreds  of clients, minimal support from directors and to be  honest, it's just goddamn boring at this point. 
 
Kinda feel like at my age, I should be exploring as many  options as possible, and the workload I'm doing just  doesn't justify the salary. I do see a whole load of people  my age making a heck of a lot more, and l'm wondering  how it's possible, but I know it often boils down to  personal circumstances and who you know. 

To give some background, I don't have a degree, and did  a course in Landscape Design fresh out of HS but that  was it. Still have absolutely no idea what I want from a  career or life going forward.  

Any ideas on how to spice things up, stress less, Or  maybe improve my situation? There must be more to life  than this surely?  

Side note, I do have ADHD and know about the whole  not being able to focus/consistency issues thing. Not  on meds for it atm though, so any tips here are welcome  too!

1g855ix,Should I Accept a Gov't Internship or Wait for a Potential Offer from a Tech Company?,"Hi everyone, I’m a 4th-year data science student at a Canadian university, aiming to secure a **data engineer** or **ML engineer** role after graduation. I’ve done an internship as a data analyst at a record label, and now I want to complete 1-2 more internships to further build my skills and hopefully secure a return offer.

Here’s my dilemma:

* **Current Offer:** Junior Statistician/Mathematician intern with a gov't organization (starts in January). The work involves sample design, data analysis, estimation, quality control, and more. **Pros:** Good pay, math/stats skills development, and I'll be assigned to tasks based on my skills. **Cons:** It’s more analysis-focused, not aligned with my data engineering or predictive modelling goals, and accepting this offer withdraws all of my other applications (\~20, 3 of which I've had an interviewed for).
* **Other Possibilities:** I interviewed this week for **Data Engineer internships** at a bank (Summer) and a tech company (January). I feel that both interviews went well but not guaranteed. The tech company internship overlaps with the gov’t one, so I can’t do both.

I need to decide by **Monday morning** whether to accept the gov’t offer, which is before I will hear back from any other positions. If I accept it, I could still pursue the **bank internship** in the summer, which if I was to get I would be more than happy doing both one after the other. If I decline, I risk not getting any other offers for January, though I have around 20 more applications pending. The pay for each role is similar enough that it is not a deciding factor and I am more worried about gaining the right experience.

What would you do in my situation? Is the gov't role worth it for someone aiming for data or ML engineering? Or should I take a chance and wait for the tech company’s decision?

I’m looking for some advice or guidance on how to move forward in my career, or even switch fields entirely. To be honest, I’m feeling pretty burned out in my current job and could use a fresh perspective. Do you think it’s worth sticking with what I know because of my experience, or should I take a chance and try something new? 

I've been a caregiver for disabled adults for the past eight years, mostly working with people who have developmental disabilities and Autism. My experience with physical disabilities is pretty limited. Over the past year, I've been trying to find something new, applying to different entry-level positions that don’t require a degree or much experience. Unfortunately, I haven’t had much luck—either I don’t hear back or get a rejection. On top of that, since Indeed shows I’m looking for work, I keep getting calls from employers in the same field, offering roles with barely any more pay. It’s been a bit discouraging, to be honest. Feels like I'm only seen as a glorified babysitter. 

There has to be something for me, right?

When I started the switching and applying for different companies, my dad passed away. Suddenly. It was very sudden. He was diabetic and had BP, but he was probably the fittest and healthiest in our family. It was a shock to all of us. He didnt see it coming at all. He was never bedridden or sick longer than a day or two. It happened on the way to the Hospital. It was terrible. It has been months but we still haven't really able to accept it. The void never goes away I believe. Mom has really full recovered at all, and has physical implications due to that. She was hospitalized too last month due to sever loose motion and weakness. All the tests were normal. We suspected it to be a mental issue. She got better and we brought her home. I was working from home all this while. I asked for WFH since I could not leave Mom in this unstable condition at home all by herself. Mean while, The office situation seems to have stablized and workoad is earlier level. It has again therefore has become stressfull, and the management is pressuring and being toxic again. And all this while, my colleagues kne by one left. My favourite seniour and my last familiar and good colleague left at the beginning of this month. I was devastated. These colleagues were the only reason we all were able to stay in this organisation for this long. It's stressful and low paying as well. Now I need to switch. I don't see any point being here. All the seniour good people left and the my fellow colleagues have left too. 
Now I am very stressed and scared about the switching process. I am scared to even apply. I am good at my job. I am confident that I can learn things. I have always been a good student all my school years and have been the atmost sincere person at everything I did. I am not underconfident that I can't get the the job done. I believe I have good communication skills, and if I can calm myself down, I will be able to articulate my thoughts well and answer well with all the technical questions be it regarding Solar or Technical or Logical. Problem comes in the Personal Questions. The Salary Question. The Why are you switching question. I also have a problem to be honest about things, so I am not being able to the fake it till you make it thing. I have two month notice period. I am really done with it all. I could really use a one month break between job to get into a sane mental space too. 
Also, one important note, I did the applying to new jobs part, but I am resisting to talk to the calls from HR. I just don't answer smartly I guess. I don't really consider myself street smart believe. I just be frank on things and say the truth or what's on my mind or what's real. So I end up saying not so great things(maybe) and saying a lower number for salary expectations(also what a good estimate to answer this question?). Also I have career dilemma, and I am not able to decide whether I want to continue in Solar or not. I sister said ki currently I need not focus on the career clarity part, everyone has this clarity issues and all stages of life, so it doesn't really completely goes away. So just take a simple job, one which is near and easy to find, for one year until we get over this emotional distress and take the time to figure out the career question or other things. 

Should I just resign and then look for jobs in the notice period? Is it taking too much risk? I have my 6 month Emergency fund in place, moneywise there is no urgency.
Is it okay to take a one month break between jobs? Is it okay to resign without having a job in hand?
How to find the courage and right mindset in this situation?
I don't want to get stuck at another job, with either a employment bond, low salary, or stressful/toxic environment. There should be atleast some compensation on some aspect. 
Also I Don't want to switch cities as I have my old Mom with me, so it will be difficult for her. 
And I have a Medical condition and had a surgery 2 years back, and a surgery is due, so I want an office job and not a field job. 

All suggestions and guidance or any words of comfort are welcome and appreciated.

Hi all, I’m an immigrant who moved to Phoenix, AZ, last year. Back home, I worked as a clean room assembler and machine operator for a pharmaceutical company. After learning English and becoming fluent, I transitioned into customer service for an Irish promotional products company. Once I moved to the U.S., I found another customer service job, this time answering calls for a primary care practice.
I recently resigned from that role because the stress and difficult interactions became too much for me. While I’m grateful for the opportunities I’ve had, I’ve realized that customer service isn’t for me anymore. I’m looking to change career paths and find a job that pays at least $50k.

1g83ura,Biotech - Young leadership position approaching first raise,"Good afternoon redditors!

Some relevant information:

I am 31M, Ph.D. in Plant Biology from elite R1, and I work as Head of R&D for a agri-biotech company. We are a very late stage startup and we are profitable with a projected 2025 sales being double 2024, in the millions. I was offered this position after a 7-month long interview process a month before I defended my dissertation. There was no way I could turn down this opportunity. I am quite happy, my work-life balance is so much more favorable than when I was in grad school, and I am gaining an incredible amount of experience and have gained a good reputation among folks in my industry. I have worked at my company for 13 months, and my position is very secure. I am at the top of the ladder in my sector of the company (R&D), and I am expected to be promoted to CTO/Director of R&D in the next year. We run a natural evaluation cycle. My current pay is currently, and has been since starting, an annual salary of $110k + 2 months salary as a discretionary bonus. I live in a medium COL area. I am expected to be relocated to coastal California in May 2025, but we will cross that negotiation when we get there (though, if any advice comes to mind, I am all ears)

I was given a budget sheet for 2025, which includes projected expenses that fall within travel, expendables, equipment, 3rd party testing, personnel requests, car allowance requests, and salary request. All of which, with the exception of a salary request, seem to be straight forward.

Here are some questions I have that I would love some support to understand:

1.) Is it normal for someone in a leadership to provide a raise request?

2.) What does a natural cycle mean exactly? January 1 - December 31?

3.) What is a standard raise for someone in my position? I am given the freedom of a request, and I have an immense amount of leverage in the company.",ReggaePhD,1,1.0,0,1729444845,2024-10-20 17:20:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g83ura/biotech_young_leadership_position_approaching/,10,2024
1g83t7p,Is this a red flag?,Hi I’m having second thoughts on going through with this job offer. The manager who interviewed me ignored me an laughed with staff when I came for my initial interview. I had to call him on his cellphone to meet me for the interview. He had me shadow an Med asst. He left without saying goodbye thanks for coming. Three days later I was turned down for the job. Two weeks later HR called me to offer me the job I was initially offered. I accepted and they didn’t want me to give a 2 week notice to my current job. They wanted the start date to be 10/14. I said no I had to give a 2 week notice. They agreed but changed the start date to 11/11. Since then I’ve asked by phone and through email about onboarding process. The recruiter hasn’t responded to my emails. She said someone will email me information about parking. My parking pass expires before my start date. She said just wipe the date off with sanitizer and write in December. She claims it’s hard to describe to me where I’ll be parking. I’m supposed to do online training the first day at home but she hasn’t sent new details since the start date was changed. I checked online and the position is still posted. My current job I’m a receptionist and they’ve changed the job so I have to check in all the patients while my coworker does nothing. I really don’t feel wanted anywhere. Meanwhile another Med asst job offered me a position but this company is paying less and they hurrying me to make a decision by Monday morning. Either way I have to turn in 2 week notice Monday if I take either one. Also the second job offered is forcing me to start work 11/4 which gives me only 1 day off. I’ll be exhausted. ,chileplease82,4,1.0,4,1729444734,2024-10-20 17:18:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g83t7p/is_this_a_red_flag/,10,2024

Started college when I was 16, and chose that major because I was pressured by family just to *be in college* and didn't have a passion yet. I was told by advisors that the major choice would give me vast opportunity and I'd have lists of different jobs to choose from. Instead of being stuck with one job option. 

I don't work in my field because I was promoted to upper management at my part time college job, and went full time as soon as I graduated. I make good money but the company is going to shit and I want to use my degree to get the hell away from it. 

It seems employers don't care about my degree, most jobs relevant to my field want experience or I'd have to take an outrageous pay cut (roughly $10 an hour less).

1g823a0,My Resignation is not being accepted. Need Help!,"Hi Guys,

I have resigned from my current organisation as I received a better offer for working at a MNC. The culture is very toxic here and hence I decided to move out. The notice period here is 90 days and my hiring company wants me to join early (probably in 45-50 days). Hence, as stated in my agreement letter that either I serve 90 days or pay the salary in lieu for the shortfall days. I have informed them I will be serving 50 days and rest I am willing to pay the salary. It's been 10 days now and my resignation is still not accepted. The hiring company is asking me for the acceptance as they have to revise the joining date in my offer.

My manager has told me that mostly she will send me the acceptance by the next week, once the client agrees to relieve me early. But can they really hold me off? And without acceptance will the hiring company not send me revised offer? I could send them an email where I will be confirming that I won't be continuing after 50 days as I have a medical urgency and I need to treat it. Also do you think if my hiring company is waiting for me 50 days, will they wait for 10 more days and make it 60? Because as we haven't agreed on my early relieving my current company could ask me to serve 5 10 days more.

I’m not sure how to even begin but I really need advice. 

A coworker(and longtime friend) passed away while at our work place a few days ago. It was during the work day and we all found him. It was the most traumatic, unreal, absolutely terrible experience I’ve ever had and witnessed and I wish it on no one, not even my worst enemy. 

It had been silent for about 20 minutes and when going to check if he was doing ok, we found him purple head to hands, not breathing anymore. There was also drugs involved that were found.
Everyone was screaming, people trying to resuscitate, crying, yelling. Absolute awful in every way possible. 

My boss wasn’t there so my boss does not feel the loss like we all do. It was just employees and a manager to go through, so my boss has not a clue on how we are feeling. I don’t want to return to work, I don’t think I should have to for a while due to what I saw, what we all saw and experienced. My boss wants us all back to work ASAP ( understandable from a business standpoint point) but it’s also a vision that will never leave, ever. Thinking about even stepping foot gives me the worst anxiety especially to see my coworkers and knowing how much trauma we just experienced. What do I do? 
I also work a job that we do not get PTO, we are commission based. ",ResortNecessary7747,69,0.8700000047683716,37,1729437536,2024-10-20 15:18:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g8128z/workplace_fatality_what_to_do_next/,10,2024

1g7xtjb,Should I do Digital Marketing or Tech Sales?,"I’m a 24M looking for a full time job again. 

A few years ago I finished a degree in Bsc Psych and International Business at a good university and got a digital marketing role at a well known FMCG company. I worked there for a year and half before resigning because I had been accepted into a venture capital residency program for a side hustle i had been building on the side of my regular job, which caught the eye of a few investors.

I knew the risk of leaving my full time job, but whilst I was young and could still live at my parents house for a year longer, I thought I would regret not taking the leap of faith and having a crack. So I did.

The VC program didn’t end up going as expected, however I found a technical co-founder and we have been working on the idea ever since. We have made some money and achieved a few milestones, but development has been slow and I am running out of runway. I also made it onto the national team for rowing whilst trying to build the start-up. It was a great experience but it was really hard trying to balance both commitments. 

I am now having to look for a job again. Tbh my main aim would be that (hopefully) my start-up earns enough money over the next two years that I can leave for good, but if not then I want to be in a career with great earning potential. 

I could go back into digital marketing in a mid-level position and earn around 100k. Orrr I was thinking of getting into tech sales. It seems like the base pay is lower (around 75-80k) but I could earn up to 110k commission if I hit my targets. Only thing for tech sales is it seems like I’d have to start all over again as a sales rep compared to if I continue on with digital marketing. 

Does anyone have any advice as to what path I should go down given my experience (and your experience)? Would I have any chance getting an account executive role given my start-up experience? I sold my SaaS fitness software to PTs, Sports Teams, and S&C Coaches, as well as B2C. I also managed multiple Olympians and run all content marketing for our company.  

Thanks 🙏

1g7v6w8,End result of my admin leave.,"Hello everyone!

I (26 M) had posted a situation on this subject regarding an admin leave that I was put on in the month of July. I got a lot of feedback, advice and suggestions on it, but eventually the end verdict from the management for me was to exit the company. 

Reason to put me on an admin leave -
I was put on an admin leave in the month of July, somewhere in the second fortnight of the month on the basis of following reasons -
Using unprofessional and unparliamentary language and having personal chats on the MS teams chat platform. I agree to the fact that I goofed up big time and I accept them all. But there are certain things that took place ahead and it never even made sense to me honestly. (I'll come to it below)

Now, it was not just me but four others along with me who were a part of this same situation along with me. All 5 of us were put on the admin leave on the same ground that I've mentioned above. 

In the first week of August, they invited me to a disciplinary hearing where they had a panel of almost 14 members including the HODs all to ask me the same type of questions that why the hell did you do this and all! And everyone was expecting different answers from me, I guess. 

I apologized about the goof up and was done with my meeting that day. 

Next meeting with them was in the end of August, where they had called me to hand me over the termination letter, that the committee was not happy with my responses and they have trust issues with me. 

This was an honest brief about my entire situation and I was just shattered because I was assuming some kind of prior warnings instead of such a drastic step. 

Now, as mentioned above, there are certain things that didn't make sense to me as per my observation and the situation that I've gone through with them so far. 

1 - Can I be terminated just on the basis of using unparliamentary/ unprofessional words?

2 - Out of the 5 of us, one person that was very close to the hiring manager of the department was retained with a final warning letter. 
We all were called on the same day to get the final verdict and he was called to the cabin last in the sequence. We were handed out termination letters and he was given his warning letter. 

3 - The person that was retained out of all of 5 of us had the most pathetic chats ever that can take place on MS teams and he had spoken and used sexual references with the one he was talking and many of us are a witness to it. Girl body parts, talking about the female members of the department, cracking sexual jokes on them and such things. HE WAS RETAINED DESPITE EVERYTHING THAT HE SAID ON THAT PLATFORM!!!!

4 - Now, the most important thing that happened was that when we met the HR director, the one who handed us our termination letter told one thing to all 3 of us that this termination letter is not the final one. The management and committee has decided to issue experience letter to you, so that it doesn't impact your long term career. They told this to all 4 of us who were terminated. 

5 - They said it will follow the normal 45 to 60 days process that is usually followed in the FnF process. 
I don't understand this one thing that if they have terminated me, then why are they issuing experience letters. 

6 - If the company has put 5 members on an admin leave, then why did they retain only one and terminated the four of us ? What is even being proved here ? They should've even terminated the 5th one, right ? If there are common grounds, then there must be common results as well, right ?

7 - They are not avoiding me, but whenever I seek follow up on the mail regarding the letter and final monetary settlement, then they're just confirming about the fund settlement part on the mail and not the letter. I've spoken to the POC HR thrice so far, after I was finally terminated and she has been telling me only one thing, that yes you will get the letter as well. She never denied or she never said that you won't get or she didn't even ignore my calls. She responds to my messages and picks up my calls as well. 

I agree and accept my mistake to the core and understand that I goofed up big time. But was this level of treatment and biased behavior necessary?

IMP: The last follow up that I took mentioned that my settlement will be done in the last week of October, 2024 & in that same mail chain, I had even asked her about the letter, to which she didn't respond. She just confirmed that my funds will be settled by the end of Oct. 

Is it an indirect confirmation about the letter or should I keep following up with them?

I'm not blaming anyone for what happened, but as per my understanding, if they can retain one person, then they definitely shouldn't destry other 4 people's career. Just to specify again, we all were terminated on common grounds - Usage of  Unprofessional and unprofessional language on MS teams chat platform. 

One more important thing:
They mentioned that we have been observing this things since a very long time and all, but I was working for this company since the last 1.5 years and I converted the onrole opportunity in the month of Feb, 2024 this year. If they really were observing, then why didn't they stop me from getting onrole at that time itself ? 
Compliance, BGV - these processes do take place, then why didn't they stop at that time itself ?

While I was on admin leave, they kept paying me my salary and even on the last day, when I was handed over my termination letter, they behaved nicely and politely as If I have not done anything. I had some points to vent and rant about, which I did, in a very polite manner with the HR director on the last day. She said this is the management's call and we can't do anything about it. But at the same time, she said the management has also asked us to release the experience letter, so that is doesn't hamper their long term careers. 

I would appreciate the suggestions, advice and perceptions from all of you!!",Fresh_Negotiation841,3,1.0,1,1729417855,2024-10-20 09:50:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g7v6w8/end_result_of_my_admin_leave/,10,2024

I have been looking for jobs abroad, maybe a winter seasonal but I am not a confident driver (haven't driven in 1-2 years) and it's mostly snowy resorts looking for that so idk.

Do you know where to look for English speaking jobs in Europe? I also burned through almost all my savings so if it provided at least assistance for accomodation or relocation that would be awesome.

I have experience in tourism, I was a cabin crew before and a campsite courier as well as diploma in it and the game design field. However, I wouldn't mind physical demanding work (though I'm a girl and not that strong, or at least for an extensive period of time)

I would do apprenticeship but it seems, in Europe I'd have to be enrolled for a degree qualification to be considered for those.... :/

Oh, I also have the right to work in the UK, I a just wanna look at options in Europe before shamefully moving back... And I can speak Spanish A2, Hungarian native, fluent English and some (self-taught) lower intermediate Japanese

I'm 22 years old, work in Auto Parts Sales, don't have my high school diploma - work in progress current- and I've had some trouble with the law in the past. Nothing serious but enough to cause some jobs a bit of concern. Where I am currently I'm not doing great financially and honestly I'm not happy with my line of work. I'm really just tired of customer service as it never seems to lead to anything significant and the environment can be mentally draining since we deal with people that usually aren't happy having to come into a auto parts store due to there being a issue with their vehicle. I guess what I'm asking here is for your guys recommendations or what you guys did when you were younger that ended up being a great decision for you financially. I know I'm only 22 years old and i have a long time ahead of me but i don't want to wake up and it be to late. I'd love to hear what you guys might have done when you were younger and how it ended up for you and if you had any regrets on what you could've done or did do in finding your final career path and advancing in your field of work. Appreciate any and all help, I wouldn't be here if i truly knew what to do from here that's meaningful.

1g7tfhk,How badly have I ruined my future ?,"Hey to everyone that has time to read my “sob story” ! I’m a senior in college and a biology major with a 3.3 gpa. I was supposed to graduate in 2023 but in 2022 my aunt who lived in India unexpectedly passed away to COVID, leaving behind her son. Because of this me and my mom had to drop everything and start providing and taking care of him. This left us both in a big hole. In 2023 I just couldn’t keep up. I withdrew from college completely. I wouldn’t say I was doing amazing before, I did withdraw from organic chemistry a bunch of times. I also had to keep my job as I had to keep providing for my family, myself, as well as pursue my education which was extremely difficult for me.

I have completed 60 credits at a community college, transferred to a university and completed 44 credits so far. I only have 16 more credits but the biggest bane of my life has been Organic Chemistry. I have dropped this course FOUR times. Each time with a W. This time after reenrolling back into college I had the intention of graduating in Spring 2025. and ONLY took Orgo as my 1 course this semester. I was ready and prepared.

During Exam 1 something happened. I circled all the right answers with the intention of double checking and bubbling the answers in at the end. Unfortunately time ran out and I didn’t notice it. One of the proctors was sweet enough to let me bubble my answers in, BUT another proctor who was extremely strict ran up to me and snatched my paper off my hands. Begging and pleading with her did nothing. Emailing my professor and the course coordinator didn’t help. I was confident I would end up with a 65+ (which is on the track to be a B or an A ) but I ended up with a 50. I guess this is just me being extremely unlucky yet again, or it was just meant to happen. Maybe it was meant to be. 

Anyways I do have a plan, unfortunately that plan includes dropping Orgo yet again, I intend on maintaining my 3.3 gpa, and fully focusing on acquiring back to back internships (an internship is a requirement to graduate for my school) and going back in the Spring with all the knowledge I have from previous semesters to fully redeem myself and kick Orgo’s butt (try my absolute hardest to get an A). I plan on taking 8 credits in the Spring, 3 credits would come from the internship. Then in the summer I plan on finishing up with Intro to Biochem (a requirement, with Orgo being the prerequisite), and another course. Ending with the 16 credits I need and by the grace of God hopefully graduating in the summer which would still leave me as a 2025 graduate.

My goal is to go to Grad school to get a Masters in Business-Science degree as I would love to work in a corporate setting.

My question for y’all after hearing my sob story is: how badly have I ruined my future? My chances of getting into a good Grad school (my gpa is still semi decent at a 3.3 fortunately), Do employers/grad schools care about all these consecutive W’s ? Would my gpa help? Should I drown myself in internships and work experience to “balance out the scales” before I apply?

I would appreciate any and all advice from you guys. Thank you so so much for reading this if you made it this far! (:

1g7st5a,How did YOU choose your career?,"As a student in grade 12, all I can think about is where I want to go in life. I'm interested in getting different perspectives on how people figured out what they wanted to do! + How they pursued. All the details. :))

A major issue I've been struggling with is basing my purpose on my future career — and I now realize as much as a job is important, it's not what I live for. So how do I find the line between working for something im passionate for/enjoy, that's also realistic and has a liveable wage. 

If what I'm saying sounds like it doesn't make sense I apologize — I don't totally understand myself either, I'm in a thinking-about-the-future crisis LOL. It's just been on my mind after many conversations with my peers. I ask them what they want to do, and for eg. many answer in different medical fields... but I never hear the why factor. Good pay, yes, but I wonder what motivates them? It could definitely be my ADHD speaking, because it's extremely hard for me to research and dedicate myself to something if I am not passionate for it. So I admire people's abilities to pursue something they don't totally adore. I guess this leads to bigger conversation on balancing the different parts of life Yada Yada..  going off track now. 

Anyways, would love to know !! 

For some reference, which i will go into on another post; I mostly want to pursue something in the sciences — Astrophysics, or Astrobiology, neuroscience... But I am also very philosophical and enjoy filmmaking.

1g7pyw0,Career/College Major Help,"I apologize for the long post, but I feel like I'm going to go into an anxiety meltdown and need just something to talk me down off a ledge.

Background: I'm 35 years old, have 4 years of college experience with no degree (I had a really bad experience and didn't handle my slipping grades to the point where I feel like I pretty much flunked out). I temped for a while, landed in shipping and logistics, moved over to customs brokerage in the same company and after 10 years total in one place I can safely say that although there are pros to my job, I absolutely hate the work and there isn't much mobility anymore. 

Now, I'm almost halfway through my first semester back at a community college this time, and although I'm doing well in my three classes (one biology, two criminal justice) AND have been balancing my job well at the same time, I feel like I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown when I research with I can do with a Criminal Justice/Crimijology degree. I'm pursuing an A.S. in CJ this go around, and thought my career track would be to get an associates in CJ, an BS or BA in Biology to become a civilian crime scene investigator. The sciences don't come that easily for me (original degree pursued was English), but biology was always my best science subject and I'm willing to gain challenging knowledge if I know it will pay off and I have a reasonable time frame to do it. However, when I look at the degree requirements for biology at my anticipated transfer school, I severely underestimated how much additional higher level math and chemistry is required. I should have looked into the transfer degree requirements sooner, I know. Really dumb mistake. I am not confident when it comes to higher level math and science, and seeing how much of it I'd have to focus on WHILE still working to pay rent and such in this economy is so incredibly intimidating. If I fail a class, that's just going to add to the stress of delaying my degree and therefore delaying my job search (when I already feel I'm too long in the tooth to be making this big of a change). If I fail more classes, that's just money, time, and hope down the drain.

My alternative paths were something to do with criminal psychology or a career in Homeland Security under the CBP Imports Specialist title. However, I'm seeing the criminal psychology track really aim to get you at least into a masters program, if not a PhD or a PsyD in the criminal justice field to even be considered for employment and to be in a decent pay bracket. If I were 25, that time frame for completing the educational requirements wouldn't worry me as much, but being 35, I don't know if the time it takes to get that level of education would end up being a hindrance in the hiring process. 

The CBP imports position is probably the most lateral and what I feel the most immediately confident in doing, but I'm already in that world and I'm not a fan overall. From what I'm seeing on the pay scales, it would also pay a decent amount less than what I'm making now, and the higher end wouldn't necessarily be that much more.

Does anyone have any advice regarding degree to career track in the criminal justice/criminology fields? I'm not interested in becoming a police officer, but it's not completely off the table if going through that process could lead me to something else in a decent time frame. I am willing to look into different majors/minors that would be in the CJ field, but I am trying to avoid spending an additional 10 years in school before I really get into a career. I do feel like this is the area for me, I just have to figure out how I can get my foot in the door in a time frame where I will not be passed over due to my age (I know I'm not old, but a company or department typically wants to make longer investments in people before retirement age).

If you just wan to tell me I'm dumb for waiting this long, I get it, but please be someone sympathetic. I spent the last 10-12 years learning a lot about myself and gaining professional confidence, which I severely needed. I just hope my ship hasn't sailed on my personal dreams to do something worthwhile and socially impactful.",DesperateCheck89,1,1.0,0,1729395240,2024-10-20 03:34:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g7pyw0/careercollege_major_help/,10,2024
1g7p71p,Should I Stay with My Current Company or Move to a New Job? Need Advice.,"I’m facing a tough career decision and could use some guidance. I’m an undergrad student with a background in information systems and data analysis, and I’ve been working for a few years at a mid-sized tech company in a niche industry (not related to degree). I’m currently in product management and have taken on other roles in operations, sales and business intelligence, but I’ve been through a lot of ups and downs recently that have left me feeling uncertain about my future with the company.

Here’s some background: After entering college, I was originally supposed to work part-time during the school year and full-time during breaks. But due to significant changes in the company, my role had expanded and it left me working full-time much more often, even during school semesters which decreased my grades. Over this past year, I felt burned out and started asking for a reduced role to better balance my school, work-life, and complete my degree. I reached out many times to our department leaders but it felt like they were stringing me along, promising a role change that kept getting delayed. I decided that I would quit after finishing a major project, as a way to close out my time there.

Before I could hand in my resignation, I had a positive conversation with a senior leader. In the end of that meeting they offered me a new position a week before I planned to resign, and I was genuinely excited. However, things quickly became less clear. For two months, I experienced vague communication, constant back-and-forth about the role, and rumors about our department’s future—especially after some recent leadership changes. It turned out the rumors were true. My department was restructured, with many team members laid off or reassigned. When negotiating my new role, we had agreed on three key conditions: reduced hours so I could focus on my classes, a promotion, and pay comparable to others at my level. They initially agreed, but after the restructuring, those promises fell through. They asked me to continue working somewhat increased hours, did not promote me, and instead gave me a new title while paying about 25% less than what was initially agreed upon.

I had always wanted this position for a long time, but now that I’m in it, it feels so empty. Most of the team members I liked working with have moved on due to the constant changes, and the work itself has become very minimal. As an FYI, I worked temporarily in a similar role last summer to fill a gap on the team, and I really loved the work and the people. It made me want to join the team full-time after graduation. Another thing that makes me uneasy is that the person who used to be in my current role—someone I saw as a mentor—was let go when their role was eliminated about six months ago. Now, I’ve been put into that same position, and I can’t shake the feeling that they might have me here temporarily to finish up the critical projects he left behind.

Now, I’m interviewing with a handful of other companies, and my most promising opportunity is a program management internship with a well-known tech company that connects well with my degrees. It has a high chance of leading to a full-time offer after I graduate. The big decision I’m facing is whether to stay with my current company or take the leap and pursue this new opportunity if I get accepted.

Based on what I’ve shared, I realize that most people might say I should just leave, and I understand why. The pay isn’t where I’d like it to be, I’m not using my technical skills, and I’d be required to relocate across the country after graduation and moving away from my support structure (friends & family). But the main reason I’m hesitant is that my current company has invested a lot in me, and I have a deep understanding of the product and this niche industry. I’m worried they won’t take my departure well, and I fear they might say things like, “We gave you everything,” and make me feel guilty for leaving. It would definitely burn bridges for me in this niche industry which I would say I have a lot of knowledge in and genuinely love the products. 

What if I’m just overthinking this? Am I letting these concerns hold me back from making the right choice for my career? I’d appreciate any advice or insights, especially if you’ve been in a similar situations before.

Basically I was asked about a situation with my boss that didn’t sit right with senior leadership. They asked for my feedback in writing. We all know what that means and nothing but conversations has happened. My manager is upping the manipulation and intimidation without directly asking me what was discussed. Due to a complete overhaul of our department I will be getting a new manager in the new year but my current is definitely laying things on thick to what feels like try to push me out. I do trust senior leadership and I believe there is still so much potential and promise here overall.

My question is, am I being an idiot? Have I realistically positioned myself in such an ill place that I really need to be looking elsewhere?

1g7mliz,Micromanaging and job security,"Hi all, I’m coming up on my third year working cybersecurity at a Big Tech company. I’ve worked in the industry for almost a decade and am about a year out from earning a PhD in cybersecurity. 

My manager is very encouraging as far as work/life balance, etc., but the amount of micromanaging over how I’m bothering people with questions, making them do more work, putting wrong info on my LinkedIn profile, probably gonna intentionally disclose sensitive company data, and so forth is making me worry. Examples to the points above:

-The peer reviewer on a report we edited complained to her that he had to spend time reverting all my edits that “changed the technical meaning” of the content. Turns out the authoring analyst confirmed my revision as correct.

-I was forbidden from working on the above reports due to these alleged issues and tasked with an open-ended threat Intel customer education project that I was really excited to make my own. Boss then says I can’t say I manage any part of it on my LinkedIn profile (I constantly see her viewing me in semi-private mode based on her job title).

-Boss CC’d her boss/my skip on an email saying she worries my “papers and presentations and all other stuff outside the company” (i.e. PhD deliverables) will disclose company data. I politely assured them that I have the utmost respect for NDA and that I am happy to share all publications to show that no company data has been disclosed.

-I am now the only person on my team who hasn't been promoted to senior level despite having worked there as long as four others and in the industry for as long as most.  


I don't need recognition/praise and have a pretty high tolerance for rudeness. I don't take it personally if it's just how they are. But I've had some bad experiences with PIP before that the manager later admitted was more about budget cuts, so not feeling great about this, especially given the rolling layoffs in tech. Layoff I can deal with, unexplained ""performance issues"", less so.

  
I will be diplomatically discussing this in our upcoming career talks/performance review which I am dreading, but just wanted to hear about any similar experiences in the meantime. I am not sure if it might be a matter of them thinking a PhD might give me a big head, as I would be the only one with one on the team. I am also not part of the team's ethnic majority, but I try to focus on that least, since it gets a lot of pushback in these conversations.

1g7l1kq,"Burnt Out & Sick Of My Current Career, Not Sure How To Move On (Or If I Even Can)","Hello all. So i have been in the food industry for about 10 years now, since I was 16. Started as a line cook, and have worked just about every position possible in a kitchen, from dishwasher all the way up to a head chef, and am currently working as a skilled dietary cook at a rehab and elder care facility. 

But I'm totally sick of it. The long hours, the absolutely relentless and brutal environment have really torn on me. No matter where I've gone, I see the same thing. Understaffed and looking for a kitchen savior, long hours and no schedule stability, no respect for work/life balance, zero consideration for mental health and wellbeing...etc. I'm sure y'all have heard it all in my industry, so I won't drone on.

However, I feel like I'm in a position where no job, entry-level or otherwise, will take me seriously. No one believes that the 27 year old head chef is burnt out and wants something less demanding, even if it means a decrease in title or responsibility. Other industries tell me that they want someone who has years and years of experience in the field... for an entry level position! It's maddening and I feel trapped in an industry I no longer have any love for, and have started to really hate doing as a job. (I do have plenty of hobbies outside of work, but none that are particularly profitable unless I get INSANELY lucky one day)

I've tried my best to leverage the skills I've learned as a chef to show other jobs that my skills are transferable. I can lead a team, I've plenty of experience in conflict management, cost saving measures, recruiting, training...etc. I seem to do well in interviews, and even with the downtick in those interviews the past year or so, I'm consistently receiving praise for how I express and advocate for myself and my skillset.... but I still don't get the job! There's seemingly always someone better, more experienced, cheaper, or whatever it is, it seems like.

I want to look at other jobs that I have that passion for, that I know I'm good at, data analysis, consultancy (as many kitchens have hired me specifically to ""fix"" the place), recruitment, customer service. But I never seem to land a job, or get told constantly that I'm voer qualified, employers scared that I'll wanna bolt back into chef work (I really don't lol), that I'll find the work ""boring"" (I'd love a boring job right now).

What steps can I take to make myself more likely to land one of these jobs? I can land food/chef jobs quite easily, especially since I'm the age I'm at, kitchen recruiters LOVE my extensive experience... but also think that my younger age means I'm willing to constantly work doubles, take up shifts...etc. Which I find incredibly disrespectful and disheartening. Starting what sounds like a good job just to walk into a kitchen falling apart and I'm the one tasked with getting it back together, it's exhausting.

I'm desperate to get out of this industry before I completely flame out and fall into some dark mental health nightmare that I definitely can't afford right now. No amount of resume changing (even going through 2 different resume experts) has garnered me any luck so far, and interview tactics seem to just completely bomb what chances I might have at some jobs (Saying things like how schedule consistency and a supportive culture around mental health being some of the most important factors when i choose a job).

Please tell me I'm not stuck doing this for the rest of my life.

I lost all the dreams that I wanted to become.

What steps did you take to get out of this situation?

Btw, my mom got a job and my brother too got a job but still, my mom’s family is still not letting my mom to rent a house because of me. I’m the problem and I’m stuck, have nothing to do. I don’t know how to become more productive and smart?! I do have skills, like I do Ui/UX designing, create a OS concept and will try to animate them. But one thing I can’t do is coding which is a huge bummer because that’s where a programmer makes a 7-figures. I’m only passionate about designing software, like Apps, Websites and solving the UX.

1g7js5j,Im going to be asking for a 14k raise this month. Any last advice?,"Ive been working at this company for over 6 months, and have years of prior experience in the same field as well as a BA and MFA in exactly what I’m working in. It’s a creative field, so I took on a starting salary of 24k because it’s a ‚prove yourself’ sort of situation. 

In that time, I have (sometimes stupidly) gone above and beyond. Work has taken over my private life, it’s a typical 9-5 but there are mandatory commitments like spontaneous trips, overnight stays hours away from home, one day you’re planning something with friends, the next you’ve been told you’ve got to do X at Y. And I did it all. 

My scope of work has changed immensely. From 1 main responsibility to 6. To add to things, a coworker that started 3 months after me is on 32k, we have the same exact amount of experience in our respective fields and I actually do half the work for them, as we crossover.

The company I work for is quite small, but spans over a few brands, and it puts a lot of pressure on me for a pretty unliveable wage of 1.8k a month. I am looking to get at minimum 2,5k per month from the company by scheduling a meeting with my direct line of management and laying out some facts.

My current plan is to create a document outlining my agreed scope of work versus my current responsibilities, then the market research for similar roles that I conducted that start from 38-45k, talk about what I have achieved within my responsibilities,  and in general just how I want to be paid fairly.

My main disconnect here is going from 24k to 35-38k. It’s a big jump. Because it’s such a small company everyone knows their salaries and I negotiated really, really poorly in my interview compared to everyone else. It’s my fault, but how can I spin this so they don’t take advantage of my starting salary? 

I worked really hard to get to where I am but getting 24k with a MFA is a serious blow…

Is there anything else I should include in this document? Any key points I’m missing that could sway the conversation? I’ll take anything at all!

Also, I am looking for a new job in the same field. Just in case. If you’re thinking to yourself why I’m still here, it’s my childhood dream job, picture perfect - I really want to have my cake AND eat it.

1. Ive been with the company for about 2 years. But we were acquired (with the previous company for 1.5 years). If we hadn't been acquired, theres no way I would have been hired for this role as they usually hire people with more experience. So I think I got lucky with this and wondering why chance it. 

2. I work remote. Our company this past summer had a big RTO but it was decided that our specific team was able to stay remote. They say theres no plans to bring us in, but have the right to bring us in office if they choose. 

3. I have a lot of flexibility during the day. Really only work 4/5 out of 8 hours of the day and feel i'm ""getting away"" with all the free time I have

I do provide value for the company and I have done some projects that have saved the company money, but wondering if I should put myself on the radar by asking for a raise.

Hi, looking for some career decision feedback. I got a call back for a public service job I interviewed for a few months ago. I wasn't hired at the time but the manager called this week and said another position has become available and it was mine if I'm still interested ( I am!).  I don't have to interview again and they are not posting the position unless I turn it down. They just have to check my references and get all the paperwork approved by HR and they will call to discuss my start date ect. in a week or two. There shouldn't be any issue with my references. But does this mean it's safe to give notice at my current job now? I don't want to jinx it. 

 Problem is my current work situation has been so stressful and I'm really struggling to manage.  I feel I can't wait a few more weeks to leave. I'm working on some major projects there that I don't even want to get started on because hopefully I'll be gone.

1g7i3im,Need advice: interior design vs dentistry,"Hi everyone,

I’m feeling really confused right now and could use some advice. I graduated with a degree in interior design in June 2024, and after four years of hard work, I realized that I still need to do an additional two years of certification to become a fully certified interior designer. Without that certification, I can still work at a firm and make around $50K-$60K a year, but I’d be starting as a junior designer.

For context, I was at the top of my class in interior design, and I produced beautiful work that I was really proud of. But honestly, it was exhausting. I would spend hours and hours perfecting my designs because I care so much about my grades and the quality of my work, but by the end of it, I was burnt out, but it was doable.

Instead of continuing in interior design or doing a master’s, I decided to switch paths and pursue dentistry. I’m currently in my fall semester, taking prerequisite courses. I chose dentistry because I love hands-on work, and it feels like a form of art to me. Plus, it offers a lifestyle I’m aiming for: working a few days a week while earning a good living. but i feel like maybe that isnt enough for me to keep going? or is it worth it in the long run. I love educating and teaching what I know and creating an impact and I feel like that's something dentistry has instead of interior design IDKKKKK

Here are some key points about my situation:

* I’m 23, female, and married. I want a lifestyle that allows me to travel, work two days a week, and have a stable income
* Since the beginning of uni, ive tried computer science, then that didnt work out, I hated it, then wanting to teach and be a math professor, failed calc 2, didnt work out, which led me to finishing and doing interior design and doing so well in it too.

* I love beautiful things. I’m passionate about making things beautiful, whether through design, photography, or film. I’m naturally good at these creative fields, and I genuinely enjoy them, but maybe thats why i got burnt out because i didnt like having my creativity be marked or in the future clients, i like doing them for fun but idk.
* I’m also good at science. If I put in the effort, I know I can get the grades I need to pursue dentistry and succeed. It’s not easy, but I’m capable of doing well in this field if I stay committed as ive already taken 5 prereq courses and got A+ and As. only.
* My dilemma: Should I pursue a career in dentistry, which offers stability and the lifestyle I want, or should I keep pursuing my love for design and creativity? Is it better to keep my creative passions as hobbies, or should I fully dive into them as a career?

I feel torn between these two paths. One offers stability and a good income, while the other is closer to my passions for art and beauty. I know the answer ultimately lies within myself, but I’m looking for advice or perspectives from anyone who’s faced similar choices. How do I figure out the right decision, or is there even a “right” decision?  thanks everyone :(",sashario662,1,1.0,0,1729370218,2024-10-19 20:36:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g7i3im/need_advice_interior_design_vs_dentistry/,10,2024

1g7gx0i,Jack of all trades that's stuck,"I haven't posted often in this site so I'll keep this as brief as I can. 

I'm someone that's been in a wide variety of jobs. I've been a pizza delivery guy, retail worker, construction worker, dumpster driver, cabinetmaker, aircraft mechanic, locksmith, etc. I'm currently working at a place as a cabinet maker (or at least that's my official title). They needed someone to run a laser cutter and I got voluntold to go and learn it. 

Since then, I've had to teach myself how to run this machine and all applicable programs that go with it. I was ""trained"" by a guy that was out the door and only gave me 2 days of instruction before he took off and I was moved to another shift. He'd been on the machine for 2, almost 3, years and by the time I'd been on it for 3 months I was already programming things 45 minutes on average faster than he did. 

I am very good at learning things quickly and can be good at them in a short period of time. The problem I came to this page to get help with is that I'm trying to use the knowledge I've gained on the laser to get a job doing something similar elsewhere. My current place of employment says I'm ineligible for promotions because I'm not technically anything related to my title. I'm frustrated because I feel stuck and what's worse is I've been training someone to run the laser that got the official laser position over me because I was lacking the companies education requirements for that job. And they're making more money than me. I've been teaching this person for over a year and they are just not grasping the laser at a level of self sufficiency. I've tried going back to cabinetmaking but they require so much help I'm unable to take on any cabinetmaking tasks and my management wants me to assist my trainee over anything they try to assign in cabinetmaking. 

My work has been able to utilize many of previously learned skills like driving big trucks, locksmithing, programming, Excel programming, etc. I'm the guy they go to with any special projects. But I don't have any education behind me other than a high school diploma. And I feel like that's holding me back. I've attempted many times to go back to school. It's not something that meshes well with how I learn so I end up leaving or not doing well in the classes, which for me, feels worse. 

I have a wife and kids that need a lot of medical care. That's why I've been sticking with this company I'm at. There aren't many places that have better insurance than here. All I'm attempting to do is move somewhere within the company where my skills don't go to waste and I feel somewhat better compensated for my time. 

I don't know what my goal of this post is. I'm at a loss. I don't aspire to be a millionaire or anything. I just want to make a modest income so I can cover my bills with no problems. And I feel like I'm constantly hearing about people my age (28) that are so much better off financially that don't have a fraction of the skillset I have. Just as an example, my brother in law is 2 years younger than me and makes $20,000 more a year than I do working a data entry position. He works with Excel all day, every day. And I've shown him spreadsheets I've made for my own use and he has no idea how I've made them. He's even said, ""Wow. Those formulas are very complicated. I couldn't imagine making anything that complex."" And he has education behind him. 

I would just like some advice. I'm not particularly fond of the idea of going back to school. I don't like the idea of putting myself into debt so I can ""prove"" I know what I already know. I make a decent amount of money. I live well within my means, have very little debt, no car payments, I'm house poor and like I said, no aspirations of great wealth. I would just like to not stress out over a $300 purchase every now and then when my cars break down and actually use the skills I have that I have no educational proof I know.

1g7gmng,The project I am a part of is coming to an end. Should I quit now?,"Hi. I am a team member on a project that is going to be finished by the end of the year. My boss has already told me that there won't be a place for me in the company after that. I believe he thinks I've got a two-month leaving period (which is the law in my country) but I've got only a one-month period in my contract and 10 days of my holiday unspent which I think I will be forced to take (which is good from my perspective). So if I quit by the end of the month I'll be free approx. in the middle of November. But I am afraid it might have an impact on other team members and there might be quite a workload for them. I don't want to upset them. But on the other hand, the quicker I leave the better I'll feel about myself. The obvious disadvantage is one month salary less but it does not matter to me. I want to spend the next few weeks or maybe months by my career-related education (BI/data analytics etc.) and I can't wait to do that.

But I have my doubts about leaving unexpectedly (or at least I think it would be unexpected for the others). So should I suffer a little for another month or should I quit now? What do you think?

1g7gjrm,From Mechanical Engineering to Physics: What Will I Become?,"Hello everyone!

I’ve just completed my Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering, but along the way, I realized that this field isn't quite right for me. Now, I’m considering switching to Physics for my Master’s, though I haven’t settled on a specific path yet. I’m especially drawn to Astrophysics and Complex Systems.

My main concern is: What will I be at the end of this journey?
Will I be an engineer, a physicist, or will I fall into a grey area, being neither one nor the other?

I’m also uncertain about career options. On the one hand, I’m thinking about a career in Finance/IT; on the other, I’m considering pursuing a PhD. However, I worry that my profile might lack clarity—will my background in Mechanical Engineering make me less appealing for Finance or IT roles?

Am I just overthinking all of this?

Thanks in advance to anyone who shares their thoughts!

1g7fjwj,I went to school for product design but I’m hoping to get a job in interiors - which softwares are essential?,"
As I was working on product I focused mostly on furniture lighting and homeware. I hope to slowly build a business / brand for those product categories but after graduation I want to work in interior design to get some well rounded experience and understand stuff like suppliers, industry practices etc. 

I basically taught myself Rhino and I render with Keyshot. I now have pretty advanced skills with those two. I briefly learned SketchUp. I’m good with all of the Adobe creative suite (indesign, illustrator, photoshop).

I watched a YT video recently where I saw someone say that SketchUp and Enscape are most commonly used along with AutoCAD and Revit. I don’t know Autodesk or enscape. I tried asking my tutors multiple times about which were more important for interior design but I feel like they didn’t know what they were talking about they said it was Rhino that was the most important. 

For context I’m based in the U.K. if that makes any difference. Realistically, which are the essential softwares for 3D and rendering that good interior design studios use.

1g7ez1g,"Seeking Advice on Career Transition from Debt Collection to IT (6 Years Experience in BPOs), can you guys help??","Hi everyone,

I could really use some career advice. Here’s a bit about my background:

I have an engineering degree and an MBA in marketing, but due to some poor life decisions, I ended up working in BPOs. I started in customer service and eventually moved to debt collection. I now have a total of 6 years of experience in this field. While it’s been stable, it’s not something I enjoy, and I’m really looking to make more money and move into a different field, ideally something in IT.

A friend of mine suggested content authoring, which looks manageable and something I could get into with some practice. However, I’m looking for more career options that are relatively easy to learn, don’t require an extensive technical background, and can offer a good pay increase. Ideally, I want something that I can study and pick up quickly, given that I also have a learning disorder.

I would really appreciate any suggestions or advice from those who’ve made similar career shifts. What fields should I be considering? What skills would be easiest for me to pick up? I’m willing to learn and work hard, but I want to make sure I’m moving in the right direction.

1g7est3,Advice to be efficient in a long-hours start-up role?,"Dear everyone.

I finally got a six-months internship within a start-up in a field I had been aiming at during the last two years, and I am very excited about starting there soon and looking forward to give my best with the goal of getting a full time return offer at the end.

However, I've been informed the start-up has a long working hours culture. In words of my future colleages, one ""sort of determines his/her own hours and leaving time"" and ""it can vary a lot, some days it will be six and some days it will be later"". While I am ok with going through this, I am worried that I have never been in a role requiring this much time-comittment. 

Furthermore, my previous employments have been rather task-based and very straigth-forward (think ""project manager gives me a task and tells me the time to do it, I do it in the time indicated and leave""). This role seems more independent and complex, where some tasks will be suggested by my manager or more senior peers and others will be more freely determined by me. Therefore I also see challenges in terms of responsibility to get complex projects done in a highly independent well, being well organized and such.

I am looking for advice of people with more experience with this situations. How do you deal with this long hours culture in terms of making it through the day without ending way too beaten up? And how do you manage the visibility aspects associated to it (not been seen as an early leaver, managing to give the impression you put over-average effort without actually doing so...)? And any advice for improving my organizational and responsibility skills?

I guess I am just nervous and wanna be prepared to give my best, Thank you for any advice!",Sufficient_Hunter_61,1,1.0,0,1729361071,2024-10-19 18:04:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g7est3/advice_to_be_efficient_in_a_longhours_startup_role/,10,2024
1g7ejfu,7 yrs into teaching and realizing I hate it... Help?,"As the title says I am 7 years into my teaching career and I am reaching a point of burnout that I cant adequately explain. I started at a boarding school for kids with LBLD and they overworked and underpaid me for 6 years BUT I got my masters in special education out of the deal (not the worst). My intention for this year was to tutor, but when I put out several ads and got no bites, I applied to a public school in late august. They hired me basically without an interview, then thrust me into a reading specialist position I am quite frankly underqualified for. Now I hate work everyday and I just NEED to move on from being a teacher. 

  
All of this to say... what do I do? I still would like to work with kids, but in a more social, less structured way. I have heard about adjustment counseling, and that sounds like something I could be interested in, but I think I would have to go back to school to get my MSW if I wanted to go that route. While that's not something I am totally opposed to, I would love it if there was a job out there where I could work with kids, help create a safe space and make them feel good about themselves, and maybe help with homework/ongoing projects and things of that nature. 

Sorry for the long post... but does anyone have any thoughts?

1g7dh3o,UK - can’t find a graduate job after 2 years!!! What am I doing wrong?! ,"I’m having trouble finding a marketing job and I can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong.

I didn’t perform as well as I’d hoped in my GCSEs due to personal circumstances. I finished secondary school with just 5 GCSEs, including a B in both Maths and English.

I didn’t do particularly well in sixth form either, leaving with a C in Media, a D in Business, and a D in Sociology. I then went to college to boost my UCAS points, where I studied Business and earned a double merit pass.

Luckily, I got into my dream university and graduated with a First-Class Honours in Advertising and Marketing. 

During my first year at uni, I started my own apparel business (which I’ve temporarily paused for rebranding) and it actually did pretty well! I even got a YouTuber with over 300k subscribers to promote my brand, which really boosted my sales. I also set up a graphic design business, teaching myself both graphic and web design. I’ve created logos for over 50 business owners, designed a few websites (including for my siblings), and worked on various other designs like business cards and flyers.

I also have experience with content creation. I’ve managed to reach 100k impressions on two Pinterest accounts, gone viral a few times on TikTok, and gained a decent following there.

Since graduating in 2022, I thought I’d have job offers lined up. But I’ve only been able to secure two retail jobs so far, which isn’t what I want to do. I left my last retail role, as it was temporary, but it completely drained me.

I suppose the move during my final year hasn’t helped either. My mother relocated, and after living in London my whole life, in 2022 we moved to a smaller town with limited job opportunities, especially for someone my age or in my field. I’ve applied to jobs in London, including remote roles, but I’ve been rejected repeatedly. One company even told me it was because I’m no longer based in London.

I feel the move has played a part in my struggle to find work, and it’s frustrating. I’ve applied for hundreds of jobs in the past two years and had a few interviews, but nothing has worked out. I’ve had help with my CV from professionals and even support from my uni, so I don’t think my CV is the issue. I’ve revised it many times, and my current version is by far the best.

I feel confident in my marketing skills and have gained relevant experience through my entrepreneurial ventures and content creation, but nothing seems to be paying off.

I’ve also tried networking, particularly on LinkedIn. I got in touch with an older lady who promised to hire me if I helped her with her brand and content creation, but she was just taking me for a ride honestly. She knew I was working over 30 hours a week in my retail job at the time, but she was incredibly demanding. She even asked me to translate an entire book from Spanish to English… I’m not entirely sure why as that has nothing to do with marketing. There was no contract or agreement in place, and it seemed like she was having me do all her work for her, so I after a month I stopped.

I’ll admit, I’m not the strongest when it comes to interviews, and maybe that’s holding me back. But with most of the jobs I’ve applied for, I haven’t even made it to the interview stage.

I try not to compare myself to others, but I’ve seen people with far less experience land marketing jobs. So what am I doing wrong? I’ve got a a degree and a wide set of skills; I can do marketing, graphic design, web design, and content creation. When will I be enough?

Does anyone have any advice or tips? People I’ve spoken to suggest I should continue working for myself since that’s what has worked out for me so far, but I’m really keen to gain some experience in the corporate world and environment. I worked incredibly hard at university, despite everything I’ve been through and the challenges I’ve faced with my education, and I thought by 25 I’d have it all figured out. I imagined I’d have a corporate career, my own flat, a car, and a cute pet in a lovely town by now.

I am a mom of 3 from an Asian country. My partner and I decided that he focus on the kids while I work in a city 6 hrs away from home. (He's fine with this, he is very supportive, even while I was completing my Master's Degree). 

Over a year ago, I left the Healthcare system since I began having medical issues related to lack of sleep and constant stress. I registered under UK's regulatory body so I can practice there. After I got my license, the UK-based recruiter ghosted me and pretty much everyone I reached out too do not like recruiting from my country due to the government policies. I tried Ireland too but failed their interview recently. 

Every single night for the past months, I have been praying to get a job abroad so I can save for my kids and treat my aging parents before they leave the earth.

Hi everyone,

I've been struggling to find a job for a while now, and I'm hoping someone here can offer some guidance. I have 10 years of solid experience as a customer support advisor. I would say I'm an average employee; I've never been promoted at any job.

Currently, I have a 4-year gap on my resume. What complicates things further is that I didn't leave my last job on good terms. My supervisor was bullying me, and instead of going to HR, I lost my temper and walked out. So, unfortunately, I don't have good references from there.

I'm really in need of a job ASAP, and I'm open to any kind of work. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!",petitalbert,1,1.0,0,1729347143,2024-10-19 14:12:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g79sfi/struggling_to_find_a_job_need_advice/,10,2024

1g79k7r,How to deal with feeling defeated and lost?,"For some context, I’m 24 years old and I graduated with a bachelors degree in fine arts (I regret choosing this major.)  During school I got an internship at a print shop doing graphic design and was hired immediately after graduation. I really enjoyed printing. My initial plan was to work there for a year and then attempt to freelance with the knowledge I had. Adjusting to that job was really difficult for me, the first 6 months I thought were just hard because I was getting used to it, and on top of doing design, I was also doing sales for this company which was new to me. Every day was miserable and I was not getting paid well, but I wanted to stick to it because the job market is difficult and I felt like I needed the experience to advance in life. After a year of working there and still feeling miserable even though I was fully adjusted to the position, I was ready to quit. Then, my coworker beat me to it and I was handed his clients, some of which were the top clients in the business. This company paid an hourly salary, with opportunity to make commission if your sales numbers are high enough. After this happened, I thought I could possibly stick with it longer as it meant more experience and better pay. Well jokes on me, it was more work and no pay increase. Every quarter, my manager would hint at me finally getting my commission next time around, and then something would always come up and I never would. I felt extremely under appreciated. I worked so hard for that company, took on extra tasks nobody else did, even had to take work home with me to meet deadlines for all of my clients. I could never just clock out and not worry about it. My mental health was failing, even my physical health was going down due to all of the stress. All for $20 an hour (which is absolute trash considering this job was in a major city.)They had never once given me a raise or anything. I’m mad at myself for sticking around for so long. I eventually quit in April, took a few months off for my mental health and now I work 2 part time jobs. But I feel like I am not going anywhere with them. One of them actually does pay a few cents more than my previous job (it is half the work and almost no stress) , but they can only offer me 18 hours a week until I take a civil service test, which I have no clue when that will be available. It could be years. The second part time job I have is just seasonal. I still have not written off the idea of freelancing, and I think it would be good to work on my portfolio nonetheless, but I just feel so uninspired. I feel like I have hit a creative block and on the rare occasion where I can come up with a creative concept, I’m not happy with the way it’s executed and it’s been very difficult to keep with it. I’m not sure if my previous job also ruined it and made me no longer want to do this anymore, or if I’m just not cut out for the freelance lifestyle. I feel really lost and I’m not sure what I can do to fix it. I’m not sure what careers will be good for me or what my next step should be. I am lucky to have 2 jobs I like at the moment, but I feel like there are not many jobs or opportunities that pay a livable wage. I have considered getting a masters degree to be an art professor and be able to pursue other jobs on the side and hope that would give me a decent income and schedule, but going back to school is a financial risk that I’m not sure is worth it to take as those jobs are high demand and hard to come by. I just feel like I have nothing going for me and I wonder where I’d be in life if I had not wasted years of my life in a job that made me miserable and underpaid me. Seeing my peers go on to find careers that pay well and they enjoy makes me happy for them, but it also makes me feel jealous and start to spiral because I feel like I’ve put in a lot of work and I’ve never once had a good outcome thus far. I just feel very behind in life if I’m being honest. And very defeated that I have not been lucky to find a fulfilling career path in which I can live a comfortable lifestyle.

She is working as Lead data engineer for almost a decade and was in her dream company & good position for 3 years until last year but she was in a sort of shadow IT team and her supervisors lacked IT know how to take the data engineering team to next level, there was also a problem of clear ownership which made it difficult to drive things that could deliver better results.

She moved internally to another company but in a new tech stack within the same field overall and received a job in IT function this time with talented people and she was also given necessary ownership to drive/grow the area. 

She was new to the tech. and team and surrounded by smart colleagues which she liked but she also reflected on her lack of knowledge, 6 months after she joined, the Main office announced layoffs which worried her because she was in new environment with new tech. so relatively less demand for it than previous company and she started to re-think her decision, when her old role was advertised about a year later she applied and joined in her old job which gave her short-term stability but the earlier problems still remained. It turns out her recent job was *not* going to be redundant and there was ad out within few weeks of her leaving.

Now she is confused and thinking of going back to a place with the right setup to grow the data program with talented people in a clear ownership role where she was able to make some impact before she left.

Should she explore going back to company and negotiate for a better contract that protects against sudden layoffs or try to make changes in the current role?

I will start a Bachelor degree this year (2025-26), in a Belgium university. I'm really excited, but also really stressful. Because I don't know which field should I choose. 

Actually, I really don't want to work at all. But if I will, I want to get the best shot. 

I want a career that has high salary, valid internationally (think all over first world countries), has lots of free time (think dentistry locum) and futureproof. I can choose dentistry but it has a lottery system, so it's not guaranteed to get in. 

I want to travel a lot, sitting on a beach, having a relaxed lifestyle. But also I want to earn good amount of money.

1g77v66,Is it wise to ask my recent ex-manager/mentor for a casual career and self-improvement chat out of work?,"This is a whole situation on its own and I want to just ask a slice of it.

I'm a software engineer coming up to about 2.5 years of experience. I report(ed) to this manager who, despite everything, is quite nurturing and pretty idealistic (eg. has said to not give ""strongly positive"" answers on company-wide surveys if you think it's ""just ok"" despite that I'm pretty sure it's a desirable metric for a manager to have) and I look up to him as a slight mentor figure. I've been asking him things like career positioning, interpersonal improvements, etc. I'm currently in line to be promoted to mid-level, and he has been helping me from assuring me not to worry about year end performance review to shielding me from being on his boss' bad side (the one who'd have the final say) as some of my current projects are quite anxiety-inducing. I have to note that I am the only candidate from his direct line - other candidates from my department are from my sister team which is under a different manager, but the promotion slots are pretty much shared.

Out of the blue, he was fired in the morning few days ago. It was unceremonious, he was packed up and about to leave before lunchtime even came. The news came as a huge shock to the whole team. On top of that, now my direct report is to his boss, the department head, while the sister team still reports to their current manager. I have virtually no other layer of management to be able to advocate/shield for me. It sucks even more that I am going to be the only candidate affected by this; the sister team's candidates still have their manager to back them. I'm afraid I would get really picked apart not just for promotion, but also my year end performance.

This gives me career anxiety and unsure if I should just give up on hoping for promotion or even a good performance result at all. I wanted to turn for advice to my now-ex manager at what should I do with this position, eg. push on to focus effort on performance and bear whatever the result is, throw expectation away and start focusing effort for other opportunities, etc. Optionally, now he's not my manager, I kind of want to hear his more casual takes on some self-improvement/interpersonal topics that I haven't said previously as I didn't want to ruffle any feathers.

He has mentioned he is available to chat out of work anytime if any of us wants it. I know he basically has no stake in all this / in me anymore so he's not obligated to help, but I believe (some call it being naive) he would still give some helpful advice here and there. I've heard that it's not wise for me to do so under the same reason that he has no stake in everything, he could also blab and talk about what I'm talking with others and it can still indirectly affect me at work.

1g77nkf,Walked out on inexperience micromanager ,"Hi all, just need some thoughts and opinions on my situation. 
A month ago I was promoted within the company, from inside sales to continuous improvement specialist where I was excited to not be dealing with angry customers all the time. I have basic knowledge of the continuous improvement role such as 5s Lean Methodology etc not much but enough to get me by. I started my new role all good but at the end of the week I was written up for have my phone out at my desk (I wasn’t even using it, it was just there) and from that I lost enthusiasm for the role. My manager instead of addressing the situation with me first, he runs to HR and writes me up for it. From that moment on I felt like I was being watched and monitored every single thing I did, it was even to the point where I saw my manager look at my screens every chance he got. This previous week I noticed he would walk out a couple of second after time when I would go fill up water bottle and or walk out in the warehouse. Yesterday, more specifically I walked in the warehouse to just simply get my legs moving and that was it, I come back to a teams message saying “why are you out there, you have no business being out there.”  At that point I decided to contact HR and explain my side of the story, but unfortunately for me  my manager was in HR before me and painted me to be a terrible worker. For the record, I was in inside sales for 1.5 years and not once was I ever in trouble by HR or the inside sales manager. 
It got to the point where the continuous improvement manager had a whole word document with specific times on when I walked out to the plant and who I talked too, once he showed me that I politely asked to end the convo and requested to go home for the day. 
I don’t think I will be working for him on Monday but HR is able to find me an internal job but with a $4 pay cut out in the warehouse. Granted something is better than nothing but I do not want to “rub salt on the wound.” 
Am I wrong for walking out and calling out his micromanagement to HR and him? At one point he also started to raise his voice. ",miguel_623,1,1.0,11,1729340433,2024-10-19 12:20:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g77nkf/walked_out_on_inexperience_micromanager/,10,2024

I then got placed on a project that we should never have taken on. I worked like a machine, and often more than 8 hours on somedays. This project also burned up a large number  of hours due to its scope.

Due to burnout and a reduction in resources as I was approaching the last milestone I slowed the momentum. I got pulled from the project and was give no to little work for months 😒, I felt like quitting but I liked the company so I stayed on. I didn't really take it personally because the project manager wasn't professional to start with.


These first two projects are still ongoing despite the project manager putting other people to work on them.


About six months later I was given two difficult projects, I was excited but it also felt weird because they involved doing research a solution to something that was never done before. My manager suggested that it was never done before, so there was no point in asking for help from technical experts.


From management's point of view I am an outlier in terms of the number of hours spent on projects, but in my view the nature of the projects I have taken on has caused my hours to skew into the extreme.

I don't doubt that I can improve, but I doubt management will see the numbers they want if the project compexity and management practices do not change.

In my view I am a hard working employee who has taken on difficult projects that some of my colleagues would run away from.

For Medicine, I've to give an entrance (I'm preparing well for it),

For pharmacy, I could directly get admission. 

But here's the thing,
I'm having second thoughts about medicine, because I don't wanna be there for 5-5.5 years and then earn little and then prepare for pg entrance and study further with little pay.

I know once I finish med school after 9-10 years (In India) then only I'll be earning good and have a job security. 

But I'm the youngest and have a single parent, I can't even Imagine being in medical school and asking my mom to recharge my internet and buy me clothes and food and my medications, 

Because in med school you can't really earn that good except through yt.

And if I do pharmacy first, I'll earn through little jobs through four years, and after that if I choose to go back to medicine, 
I could earn by teaching high school chemistry and Biology (in coachings) throughout my med school. 

And if I just want to continue with pharmacy research (my real passion) then I'll just go for PhD.

The main thing is that I wanna earn early even if little, because I wanna support my mother and myself. 

And I can always return to medical,

And in pharmacy many subjects overlap with medicine so med school later on would become easier and that too with an earning source on hand.

Plus in pharma school, I'll get to develop more skills like VFX and all, and to build my yt channel which isn't possible with med school.

1g75kvw,International Student Dilemma: Finish Current Program vs. Transfer to New Country,"Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm reaching out for some advice regarding my academic and career plans. I'm currently a 24-year-old international student studying IT at a Russian university. I'm in my third year (fifth semester)of a 4-year bachelors program. Things are getting complicated due to ongoing issues in Russia.

Recently, I received an offer from a European university with a scholarship based on my SAT scores. Their program is a 3-year bachelors program. However, the catch is that I need to apply for credit transfer, which isn't guaranteed. To apply, I'd need to travel to the European country, but I won't know about the credit transfer until after I've made the move.

My dilemma: Should I stay in Russia and finish my bachelor's degree here, or take a chance and move to Europe? 

My main concerns are:

Potential complications with credit transfer

Additional time and cost if I need to return to Russia later

Job prospects after graduation


I'm worried that if something goes wrong, I might end up repeating years of study and waiting even longer to enter the workforce.

Any advice from those who have been in similar situations or experts in higher education would be greatly appreciated. What factors should I consider when making this decision? Are there any potential risks or benefits I haven't thought of?

Thanks in advance for your input!",ZacX20,1,1.0,0,1729331905,2024-10-19 09:58:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g75kvw/international_student_dilemma_finish_current/,10,2024
1g74ly8,First job out of college is not related to my dream industry,"Hello! I graduated four months ago and I have received my first ever job offer. However, the job is part of a really… really niche and small industry (like you probably wouldn’t be able to guess it lol) and I’m afraid taking the job might hurt my chances of eventually getting into the industries I genuinely want to pursue. I want to go into sports/music and I have internship experience in both.

I want to take the job because the pay is really good (far better than any other entry level entertainment position I’ve seen), the team seems awesome, and frankly, I’m tired of the job search and being unemployed. I live at home and it is weighing on my mental health to be back home. Taking the job would allow me to save up to move out eventually, but I know that getting another offer in a different city would also allow me to move.

The fact that it is in an industry I am not really interested in simply scares me and I’m afraid that it will hurt my chances of going to the entertainment industry. I’m also scared, however, that I won’t ever receive another job offer any time soon because of how bad the market is. 

Should I take the job and gain more skills? Should I take the job and continue applying to other jobs? Or should I reject it and completely focus on trying to get into the entertainment industry?

I could really use some advice on making a career shift into AI, data science, or software engineering. My current role is in HR, and while I do a lot of analytics work, it doesn't seem to translate well when applying for tech positions. I have solid skills in Python, SQL, and data analysis, and I’ve even built and worked with various projects on my own time.

The problem is, every time companies see ""HR"" on my CV, they seem to dismiss it, even though I’m capable of doing the work. I understand that my lack of proven work experience in tech roles is holding me back. I've been applying to entry-level roles, hoping to make the jump, but I haven’t had much luck so far.

I’m based in Europe and would prefer something remote if possible. If anyone has advice on how to break into these fields or has been in a similar situation, I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts! Should I tweak my CV differently? Focus on specific certifications? I'm open to any ideas.

1g71j07,Shld I go into medicine if I value my sanity? ,"Shld I go into medicine if I value my sanity 

So basically I’m thinking of going into med school and becoming a doctor/dentist because that’s what my parents have told me to do since growing up. I don’t particularly have much passion for it, but it’s the only career path I’ve rlly considered and know what to prepare for and I don’t really mind it. 

My grades are pretty mid and it’s bit too early for me to see if I’ll be good at coping academically, but I think I have a pretty good memory and I’m fairly interested in biology. My science grades are also pretty good (all A’s). 

However, I’m kind of mentally weak ig? I also get easily disgusted/nauseous and have a bit of anxiety haha. My studying is more of motivated bursts of energy rather than consistent efforts which is kind of concerning? Idk. But I’ve also learnt as a child to never be one of those people trying to ‘climb the corporate ladder’ so I’m also kind of against a tech job. 

People say med sch is damn stressful and all and me personally idk if I can cope with it but it’s all that I know and all that I’ve ever considered. My parents are slowly losing hope in me as they think ‘I can’t make it’ and that I should just go into finance or something but there’s a toxic side of me that wants to prove them wrong. I cry easily under pressure but after my sob session I’m usually unfazed. 

I’m not sure if I can meet the requirement to study Ivy-medicine (which is what I’ve been planning for, prob in the UK but I don’t live there haha) and here I am talking abt my career. I don’t have a lot of emotional support from my family and if I want to be sane I’m prob gonna have to make friends in college (which I have no worries abt since I’m rather extroverted). Another career option I’ve thought abt is law (bc I kind of like it and I’m good at debating). So please tell me if I should continue my pursuit for being a doctor or if I should switch to dentistry/law/finance instead.

1g713wy,applying for undergrad - should i do engineering or economics/commerce,"I am applying to universities right now and for the past two years I have been saying that I will go into engineering because that's sort of what my parents want also job security, etc (i wanna make BANK lol). 

While I am interested in physics and math, i don't love chemistry or anything robotics/building things with my hands (like circuits and mechanics). For reference, I would probably go into electrical engineering. 

I really enjoy my economics course so I was thinking about also applying to that but I'm not sure which between engineering or economics programs I should rank as my top choice. 

I know already that I want to either get a law degree after or an MBA. I don't see myself working as an engineer but it is a good fallback option in case that doesn't workout compared to economics. Also there are more opportunities to work with tech which is where I want to work. Either tech law, tech business or some sort of investment banking type analysis. 

My dad is really stressing me out because he has been saying that everybody has economics/commerce type degrees and that to get hired into these areas that I'm interested in i will need engineering.

I've spoken to people in a few of these fields and they have emphasized the fact that they really like hiring engineers and that I would never be out of work. A ""hot commodity"" they called me. 

But engineering is a big time consumption in university (like the most hours a week) and i'm not sure if i would actually enjoy it very much especially for such a hard degree.

I don't know if i should power through with engineering because it will give me better job opportunities or if i should just do economics which i know i enjoy but might prevent me from being able to do what i want to do.

i also don't know much about engineering and what engineers do all day at school. And i'm nervous for coding because I have only done it a small bit and i was really bad at the syntax stuff so i dont know if that rules me out.

Anyways, recently was replied to for one of the applications I submitted at a small consulting firm.

I'm assuming they obviously dont do this with every applicant but I got mixed signals about what the purpose of the chat was. Would this be more of an informal interview to follow up later with if they thought I was a good fit? Has anyone had similar ""chats"" in the past?

Since this is a different field, I want to be honest about my experience but what are ways I can sell my self in this new field and have a conversation if I have zero experience consulting in this field or in consulting in general.

I recently began a new job on a new team/division at the company. Two of us were hired in the same role, and we reported to the only manager overseeing the department. 

My colleague has been having a lot of conflict with the manager and has filed a complaint with HR about a toxic work environment and unrealistic deadlines/job expectations. If a complaint is made, HR is required to interview the entire team. I agree with some of my colleague's concerns but don't want to jeopardize my job or relationship with my manager. When I meet with HR, should I just say I don't wish to report anything, or what would you advise?",_lookingforadvice_,0,0.5,0,1729302415,2024-10-19 01:46:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g6ycv7/colleague_filed_a_complaint_against_the_manager/,10,2024
1g6xulo,I feel stuck where I work. How can I pivot to more challenging work?,"
I’m currently working as a Security Analyst for a great company, earning around $100K annually, with a solid vacation package and the flexibility of hybrid work. While I’m grateful for this, I’ve been feeling stuck in terms of career growth. My manager has been transparent that there isn’t much room for advancement, and I’m not getting exposed to the kind of work that would help me grow into a Security Engineering or Architect role, which is the direction I want to take.

I’ve received a few job offers from other companies, but I hesitate to make a move. With a newborn at home and a family to support, the fear of underperforming in a new role and the risk of losing that job has been weighing heavily on my mind.

I’m reaching out for advice from those who have made similar transitions. How did you overcome the fear of switching jobs, especially when balancing personal responsibilities? Any guidance on how to make a move like that?",ThrowRAthisthingisvl,1,1.0,0,1729300763,2024-10-19 01:19:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g6xulo/i_feel_stuck_where_i_work_how_can_i_pivot_to_more/,10,2024
1g6wx8c,I'm impressively bad at my job but haven't been fired yet? What should I do?,"I am 1.5 years into a public relations job for a municipality. I graduated college in 2021 with a marketing degree, was a social media manager in the private sector, and then got the position I'm in now.

My boss used to be in my current position but was promoted to leadership. My job is very demanding and very high pressure. I wear a lot of hats. I'm responsible for all communications including social media, press releases, etc. for all city departments. I'm also in charge of graphic design, photography, some events, and do a few other things here and there.

Everytime I send my boss something because I need her approval there are extensive edits or she will straight up redo it. When I give her back the edited work she has more edits for me. Lately everything I've sent her design-wise has been scrapped. I've taken to sending her multiple options that are vastly different, like having two completely different flyers she can choose from. They were both scrapped. I sent her something the other day that I thought was finally cute and she asked me if the intern did it. I told her it was me and sent her another option that was basically what we put out for the event last year with a different stock photo for the background. She didn't like either and wanted me to basically recreate another design she made when redoing my other work a while back.

It just feels like there's no point in me being there because she has to redo everything anyways. Then today I made an awful public relations mistake. She was very nice about it but we're in election season and I'm worried this will impact our mayor getting re-elected. I cried while she was explaining everything to me and I feel like it just makes me look even more unqualified. 

There are a lot of vacancies in her direct reports right now and someone else who is the only person in their department just put in their notice. It feels like there's only reason I'm still there is because of all the vacancies. My confidence is definitely destroyed and I feel like I can't do anything right. I get anxious whenever I try to design or write anything because I know it's going to be bad. I run everything written through chat gpt to try to hide it. I think I am definitely on my way to a PIP/termination though. I stayed late to sneak some of my personal stuff out of my office tonight so I only have to grab a few things off the walls if i get fired.

The job market is so bad right now, especially with how competitive my field is, but I'm wondering if I should just panic apply to everything I might be qualified for so I can pay my bills. Or should I try to switch to a different field? Just feeling a little lost on what to do here. I've been applying to some really great opportunities for months and have had great interviews but no offers. I feel like my next job needs to be something that has very little responsibility/real world consequences when I mess up. I just definitely can't take the pressure that comes with the public sector. Realistically I need something that pays $55 -$65 K a year due to living in a high cost of living area.

1g6w5cd,quite the dilemma ,"Hi all, 

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I am in quite the dilemma. I am currently working as an Accounting Associate for a wealthy client at an RIA. I have been here for six months and have received some knowledge regarding accounting, I have not really been trained in a way that I feel confident in my abilities as an accountant. I enter invoices, make payments, reconcile bank accounts, occasionally do re-classes, prepare financial statements and enter journal entries. I also work with the philanthropy team half the time doing donation reconciliations and very basic daily bank reconciliations. I feel as if I’m stagnant in what i’m learning and doing a lot more of a mix of business operations and basic accounting functions. My company is currently being bought out by another and we will be moving to an office that’s a longer commute for me and we will have a 4 day in office work week with one work from home day. My benefits will not be as good. (Didn’t have to pay for my health insurance, will now have to.) and I feel uncertain about this as I know there’s a possibility of layoffs. I also have been chastised quite a few times for not having enough billable time and billing some items for too long and am not sure when my time with the philanthropy team will end. Which will lead to me having even less billable time. 

I have another offer at a top ten accounting firm as an Audit Associate. While I feel this is an excellent opportunity I will be getting paid $8500 less with no overtime (currently get salary and overtime) and the benefits are relatively the same as the new benefits i’m going to have due to the merger. They also have a ESPP but you cannot sell until after a year. I will be able to work from home and from what I heard would only have to come to the office once a month. I also may be able to travel around the country or to different areas in the state if I choose to. I am pursuing my MBA in Business Analytics that’s heavily focused in information technology, computer science, and artificial intelligence. I personally feel that experience being an audit associate will be more beneficial in my career and would pair well with my MBA. However, I’m really uncertain about this because of the pay decrease and potential of longer hours (especially during busy season). 

I am not sure what to do and how to proceed with which job I should choose. 

I’m heavily leaning more towards the audit associate role but am still unsure. l tried to have them match by current salary but they declined. ",Miserable_Project192,1,1.0,0,1729295455,2024-10-18 23:50:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g6w5cd/quite_the_dilemma/,10,2024

1g6vdd4,I’m stuck in a well-paying job that’s stalling my career growth—what should I do?,"I work for a company that’s holding me back. In my previous role, I was a team leader, highly respected, working on exciting projects with great results. However, the company was located in a country with low wages, so I decided to accept a higher-paying offer from a company in a different country.

Now, I make 4x what I used to earn—well above the average salary for my position. I’m no longer a team leader, but I wasn’t too bothered at first since I figured I could learn from someone more experienced than me.

Unfortunately, that hasn’t been the case. My manager’s skill level is way below even the junior members I used to lead. But no one at this company seems to notice the gap in skills. They keep going in circles, failing to understand why their projects always lead to poor results. I can see the problems clearly and try to point them out, but I’m ignored because I don’t have any authority here.

The company doesn’t have an HR department, and I don’t even have a formal contract—but they pay me very well. The salary allows me to live more than comfortable and I can even access to luxuries, but I’m exhausted, stressed, frustrated, and bored. To keep my portfolio from having a huge gap (since I can’t show any of the work I do here because it’s all overseen by my not-so-competent manager), I spend my free time working on side projects. But that’s taking a lot of time.

I’m at a crossroads. Should I sacrifice this high-paying job for the sake of my career? One thing’s for sure—given how poorly the company is performing, I don’t think it’ll last much longer.

1g6vb7b,Lied on resume. What can I expect?,"A while back I was desperate for a job, and after months of not being able to find work - and my bank account on its last legs - I decided to take a drastic measure and start lying on my resume. I’m very ashamed of it, but I believe it was within the range of “doing what I had to do to survive.” It actually worked and I got a job (still an unskilled job, but I think the lying helped me get past the wave of other unskilled applicants). I made about 20 different resumes, and made various lies on each, such as saying I held a bachelor’s degree (switched the schools a couple of times), claiming I had coursera courses, and, although I never lied about my work titles, lied about my responsibilities. 

Although I’m an unskilled labourer, my goal is to land a teller position at a big bank and then move up the ladder from there. However, I believe I applied to teller positions back then with my phoney resumes, and now that I’m ready to be truthful, I’m wondering if I’m screwed. Can’t any hiring manager just go through my previous applications and see that I lied? Or even worse, will the ATS pick this up immediately?

Should I continue to try and get a teller position, or is it wiser to focus my efforts solely on companies I never gave the phoney resumes to? And even if I do land a teller position, could I be caught later on when I’m being considered for promotions?

1g6tjyf,"[Canada] I only have 2 YOE in mixed fields and finding a job in the last 5 months has proven harder than before. If I decide to switch focus and just learn for several months, would the job gap be justifiable or is it risky ?","Hi Everyone, 

I was terminated from my position as a Jr. automation engineer in May and I decided to continue my journey into DevOps on my own and apply to jobs in the same realm. 5 months in, and I have only got 5 interviews (just 1 in DevOps) and no callbacks. At this point, I have 2 YOE, combined. P.S. When they asked why I left, I just said that it didn't work out but I learned some valuable skills. [This is how I learned to say that.](https://old.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1e9r11p/i_was_terminated_from_work_during_probation_what/)

Last year when I was looking for a job after getting laid-off from Data Engineering, it took me 5 months and I got the automation job. Back then, I was at 1.5 YOE.

2 YOE = 1.5 YOE in Data Engineering + 6 months in Automation (probation period). 

So I did some digging to see where I can improve - I had already done courses in all tools and technologies necessary for DevOps using this [infamous Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops) which I managed to dumb down for myself using ChatGPT. 5 months of doing courses + applying to jobs. However, I found out using the hard way that getting into DevOps means professional experience not just having done courses or just proving that you are good in a 1 hour interview. I did a quick google search and reddit search and found out that DevOps is indeed an industry that has NO Junior positions - you have to just build your way up to it by working in the industry. 

So at this stage, I decided to just go back to something that I have done before but in a very limited manner - Full stack Engineering. I studied Electronics Engineering, but I am not interested to go back to it at all! I have a Ba. Eng. in it. I have all of my internships/Co-ops done in the realm of software but my mistake so far has been that it is all over the place. A jack of all trades. I thought by maximizing my knowledge and getting into devops, I can finally break that cycle, but unfortunately, I can't. 

Why Full-Stack? Because I still have some relevant background knowledge and experience from my Bachelor days (I had a course in it) and the learning curve is not as steep. However, there has been some changes in the world of Front and Back end since I did that course (2019) which means that I am set back again by at least another 5-6 months, according to this [roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxmfcnU3feo). Any other industry is relatively new to me and requires more time and effort to match the experience necessary to get a job as a junior (or any). 

At this point, just getting a job is of utmost importance and the Job gap is the ONLY thing that worries me. People tell me different things about the Job gap - some say it's dangerous after 6 months, some say 8, a few say 12. If the job gap was not an issue, I would gladly take my time and do more research to find my true calling - but that is a fairy tale.

1g6sjys,Need some direction and career advice please?,"I have been working for over 20 years in a office setting where my career always seems to be moving sideways (different administrative related titles and work but ultimately still just an administrator across different companies) and never upwards of the career ladder, from what I know of myself I'm very friendly with all my work colleagues (even the most difficult ones that not much people get along with) with a very broad self taught skill set around technical office related work.

I feel building such strong relationships and becoming very good at my job within a awkward team dynamic that my manager never wants to promote me (this has been the case in the past too) as that would mean finding a replacement which has always been quite difficult as most people would quit (and many have, being quite new to the the job and confronted by difficult work colleagues and no real support from management they pack it in within 1-2 months tops, I hear from internal staff that they would love to do the work I’m involved in but will not even take this on due to some difficult individuals in my team), I on the other hand refuse to be a quitter even during the toughest time and by this I mean slackers in my team and I'm having to hold 85-90 percent of the entire teams workload all by myself and my boss gives the excuse ""that's what you was hired to do"" all while others sit there browsing the net (me putting it politely) overall even my manager barely has any input in my team or work, I'm completely left to manage the entire workload, my time, and alongside this self navigating some very stressful and confronting meetings with the senior leadership teams as my boss is to busy to attend any meetings (and my colleagues shrug their shoulders and don’t want to know) and at times I feel like I’m completely out of my depth.

I had opportunities to move (very slightly)
up the ladder by switching to other internal teams on many occasion; as noted above I’m quite self managed and I have navigated some tough meetings by myself and other managers have noted this and would love to have me aboard their team, until it came to the managers of these teams speaking to my said manager to allow me to transfer and then each and every time that trail runs cold as my boss wants me to continue doing what it would take a team of 5 to do and pulls rank against other managers.

My boss having confronted me with “what are you doing!” (in regards to the above news of requests to transfer) I had a conversation with my boss that I like to move teams to broaden my skill set in other areas of the business, in return I’ve been told the work I do is to important and I am required in this role as not much people have the understanding, technical skill set and good people skills. When I confronted the fact of my career aspirations I was given a stern “if you want to take a different route I’ll have your job replaced within the next 3 months and you can move onto whatever it is you think you want to do, so please do me a favour and tell me now so oppose to wasting both our time, as I really wanted to develop you in to leading, managing and growing your team” (this comment alongside the fact I can’t move teams as they won’t allow it is a no win)

It’s been over 3 years and zero feedback even when I try to be more subtle in my approach (I did not want to prod the beast and face another unfair ultimatum) but get the same feedback as noted above.

One would say leave and move on but it’s difficult giving the field I’m currently working in is quite niche and hard to come by.

1g6sihs,Negotiate salary,"Hey all

Has anyone successfully negotiated a salary? I spoke to the internal recruiter who gave me a range and when I asked if if the top number was concrete he said “kind of…”. I think I messed up by saying “I won’t reject the job for that salary but it would be helpful if there could be some flexibility”.

So far so good, the process has been really positive. I think I will get an offer next week. I just want to prepare for if they offer me the number at the top of the range to see if I can negotiate up…

Role is offering 110-135. I was thinking to try and drive it up to 150. Is that too much?! I will be taking a pay cut but I’m just trying to get the best deal. The thing is I really like the sound of the role and it will hurt if the offer is then rescinded.

Hey guys, I was going to get laid off from my company from a position I don’t like (had to take it to serve the family better) but I got very lucky and got hired at another division but the same position. I expressed how grateful I was to the hiring manager and blah blah. However I’m 3.5 years in and I hate this position. It’s not terrible, it’s just so not where I want to be and I have absolutely no interest in it. 

So my question is if I apply to another position (in the same division), would it look bad to the manager that took me in and look bad for the position I’m applying for? The current manager will 100% know if I apply within the company. Should I tell him before or after I apply? Should I talk to other managers how the other position (I have to accommodate my family first and foremost and the position I have now is full remote)is or that’s going to bite me back later? Tell him I want to move to a different position? 

I’m about 2.5 months in this division now. Level 2 Electrical engineer with 5.5 years experience. I’m willing to take a level 2 (level 2 for 3.5 years now) position as I’m in not rush to climb up the career ladder and my wife and I make good money already.",Deezhellazn00ts,1,1.0,0,1729284170,2024-10-18 20:42:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g6s83u/got_saved_from_being_laid_off_but_hate_the/,10,2024

1g6r6xy,this might be a silly question -- should i get a raise?,"just a heads up -- there is a lot of office politics at my office job. another department called me and said one of their ai engineers quit for another job and asked me if i can replace them in a way. so i.e. work for two different teams but with no extra hours involved (it will just be a split). im not an ai engineer according to my company (i should be since i have my masters and am pretty knowledgeable about the space + doing a lot of ML related things at my current department). 

if this all get approved by upper management is it silly to ask for a raise? since im being recognized by another team for my ai work which proves me to be a valuable employee? if its not silly, how would you approach it without looking stingy?",Ready_Plastic1737,0,0.5,3,1729281460,2024-10-18 19:57:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g6r6xy/this_might_be_a_silly_question_should_i_get_a/,10,2024
1g6r6ji,How honest should you be with your boss ,"I have a performance review coming up and I have accomplished a lot more than I was projecting for this year. That being said there have been MANY issues this year with the way I feel I have been valued. 

To make a long story short: I feel that I get treated the same as my colleagues who quite literally do the bare minimum. A promotion was on the table at the beginning of this year, to keep it simple: my colleague and I had to “create” a specialization of our own to get this promotion. I worked extremely hard and played a major role in rolling out a new system, while my colleague didnt take any initiative or really interest in putting a lot of work into it. I basically taught them everything about the new system, that I learned on my own time and with the help of my manager over the course of 9 long months. I created blocks of coding that impressed the highest level executives in my company. My bosses literally presented MY work to push for the promotion and pay raise

Cut to: we both got the promotion and the same pay… 

This is not the first time this has happened with this particular colleague. They’ve also blatantly have said they do “ride my coat tails” because they don’t have the “drive” that I do. So they just come along for the ride while im working my ass off to advance. 

So my question is how can I be honest about this with my boss? How should I go about telling him that I feel slighted by this?

1g6qpmh,I went into the wrong field and I'm graduating college soon. I have two options. What should I do?,"I’m a junior majoring in International Relations, but I don’t really like my major or most of the jobs in the field. I’m almost done with the credit requirements and have two semesters left until I graduate. I can’t change my major for financial reasons because it would mean staying longer, and I can’t afford that. I’m also minoring in Public Health, but I don’t think that will lead to a good job either.

I’m an international student and speak two languages, so I have good cultural and global skills. I’m not sure what I want to do yet, but I wouldn’t mind working in an office. I do regret not choosing a business-related major since I think it would have made it easier to find a job in a good company. Like most people, I’d like to have a high-paying job at some point.

For my last two semesters, I have two options: I can either take media classes like photography and Adobe software to build creative skills, or I can get a GIS certificate. I really like geography, and GIS is a tool that works with maps and data. With the media skills, I could get a job in that field, but with GIS, I could develop software and data skills that might lead to tech jobs, which are usually higher paying.

He has been pointing me in the right direction and even helped me pass the security+ and Azure fundamentals by giving me his study materials. Back in September he was going to talk to the head of IT about getting me moved up to security analyst, but then it happened. Sometime in the early morning an email was sent out from the ceo that our company was acquired through a merger. This threw a wrench in everything planned. It got everyone worried, including the cybersec admin. Probably bad timing, but since then, I brought up the fact I wanted to be moved up to security analyst to the head of IT. He seemed very receptive to the idea and he said as long as the cybersec admin approves. Then I went back to him and he said wrote an email to the head of IT saying that he approves. Then I went back to the head of IT and he said that he would be ok with it but he has to check a couple things. This has been an ongoing process for about a month. Should I be worried?

1g6ny2t,I pushed back on a contract and felt good about it.,"I was recently offered a part-time freelance contract. The job seemed simple enough—just a few hours a week—but when I reviewed the contract, some things stood out. They offered me an hourly rate that was lower than I expected, with no possibility of a raise for a full year. I also noticed a non-compete clause that felt way too broad, limiting the kind of work I could do with other companies for 24 months. The problem is, I already have a small business that overlaps with what they consider competition, and I plan to grow it.

Another red flag was the four weeks’ notice they required if I ever wanted to leave. Two weeks is standard where I live, and I didn’t want to feel trapped if something better came along or the job didn’t work out.

After reflecting on similar situations in the past—where I stayed quiet to avoid conflict and regretted it—I decided to advocate for myself this time. I sent a polite but clear email asking for a higher rate, clarifying my existing business activities, offering to sign an NDA for confidentiality, and proposing two weeks’ notice instead of four. I also gave them a heads-up about some time off I have planned for the holidays.

There’s a chance they might rescind the offer, but I realized that if asking for fair terms is a dealbreaker for them, it’s probably not the right fit. This whole situation feels like a personal test—am I going to repeat old patterns, or finally stand up for myself? This time, I’m choosing to stand my ground.

1g6nokv,Career Advice Needed,"Hello! This is the first time I've ever used Reddit in search of advice but now I'm honestly desperate. I am very open to any life/career advice someone is willing to give/share. I am really sorry it is going to be a long post.

I've seen a few posts about people having late life career changes or people around my age pursuing different careers than the one they had their whole life planned for. I am 25 years old and I'm a college drop out (previously enrolled in two universities one for biological sciences and the other animal science) I have worked at an animal shelter, doggy daycare facility, animal testing lab at one of the universities providing care for the animals there and have done one externship at a veterinary hospital through the online school (ABC) Animal behavior college, when I finished my externship I became a CVA (certified veterinary assistant) .

Writing everything down it definitely sounds like I've accomplished a lot after I left high school. But I've been stuck mentally, financially and physically ever since I dropped out of both Universities and moved back home with my parents. I've been living with them for 4 years now. My recent job was working at an animal shelter ( I worked there for 3 years until i was wrongfully written up and other things) I haven't been able to find work in over a year. I've been doing side hustles and one seasonal job at a clothing store to make money but It doesn't last long. Ive tried volunteering at clinics, applying for vet assistant jobs at clinics/hospitals/the zoo but every single one either can't hire more people atm or doesn't want someone to volunteer there or they require someone to have more experience/knowledge working in clinics/hospitals. I live in somewhat of a small city that doesn't offer many opportunities to further your education/career in vet med. But it does have a community college, university (I dropped out from this one), and trade school that are centered around Biology, computer science and Everything within the medical field for humans etc.

I was able to figure out why I struggled so hard to learn in college which in turn caused me to drop out. I have been diagnosed with adhd, bpd, and depression. I am medicated for depression they said it can also help with anxiety/adhd. I want to go back to school and try again. But I don't think I can due to the financial debt I currently have and I don't know what to major in (do I try to get my basics done to then go on and major in biology again). I'm also afraid of being a further disappointment to my parents because i can't once again finish college.

I don't know if I should keep trying with veterinary medicine and hope something will come up or just change careers and go back to college to study something within human medicine that way I am financially stable enough to move out of my parents home. I honestly don't know where to go/where to start or what it is I can do that I'll enjoy just as much as animal science/vet med. I'm not really good at anything else. A friend told me about being an ultrasound tech due to it paying well and less time in school but I need to pass the entrance exams and everything would bring me be back to square one with doing externships, going to college for 2-4yrs and wasting a alot more of my parents money on something that I could fail again. They are still paying off my debt from the last university i was enrolled in. I am entirely grateful that I have parents that can help me somewhat financially but I feel extremely horrible that nothing is working or sticking since moving back home.",Even_Mall_6929,1,1.0,1,1729272384,2024-10-18 17:26:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g6nokv/career_advice_needed/,10,2024
1g6nm09,Should I accept an onsite job if I still plan on applying to remote jobs?,"I was laid off from my generalist marketing role in May and have been actively searching for a new role since then. I currently live in St. Louis. I have always wanted to move to LA but put it off in the past because of career opportunities I've come across. I took my layoff as a sign to pursue this goal, and have been applying to primarily remote positions or those based in LA. I want to pivot towards specializing in email marketing or CRM management so I have been mainly looking at roles in this field but also have applied to other positions I'm qualified for. I am fully aware of how competitive and oversaturated this industry is so I knew it wasn't going to be easy. I have had a few interviews here, haven't moved past first rounds but am still applying and still have companies reaching out.

A few months ago, I decided to start looking at openings here in STL and have been applying to a few here and there if they interest me. One of the jobs I applied to is at a company that my former coworker works for and she has had mostly positive things to say about the work environment there. She is part of the team that this role would be a part of and she's given me a lot of insight about the role/team/company and even looked over my resume for me.

I have a second round interview with the company but I am conflicted about continuing the interview process for several reasons.

Pros: I would have a job. Many of the job responsibilities closely align with the skills I want to improve on and specialize in. I have also felt a bit of a moral dilemma working in marketing but this company's product and message is one that I believe in and feel good standing behind.

Cons: The job is onsite. If I do manage to get a job that allows me to move, I would feel awful for wasting the company's and my former coworker's time and probably leaving on not-great terms.

1g6n38h,Looking for some direction and career advice please,"I have been working for over 20 years in a office setting where my career always seems to be moving sideways (different administrative related titles and work but ultimately still just an administrator across different companies) and never upwards of the career ladder, from what I know of myself I'm very friendly with all my work colleagues (even the most difficult ones that not much people get along with) with a very broad self taught skill set around technical office related work.

I feel building such strong relationships and becoming very good at my job within a awkward team dynamic that my manager never wants to promote me (this has been the case in the past too) as that would mean finding a replacement which has always been quite difficult as most people would quit (and many have, being quite new to the the job and confronted by difficult work colleagues and no real support from management they pack it in within 1-2 months tops, I hear from internal staff that they would love to do the work I’m involved in but will not even take this on due to some difficult individuals in my team), I on the other hand refuse to be a quitter even during the toughest time and by this I mean slackers in my team and I'm having to hold 85-90 percent of the entire teams workload all by myself and my boss gives the excuse ""that's what you was hired to do"" all while others sit there browsing the net (me putting it politely) overall even my manager barely has any input in my team or work, I'm completely left to manage the entire workload, my time, and alongside this self navigating some very stressful and confronting meetings with the senior leadership teams as my boss is to busy to attend any meetings (and my colleagues shrug their shoulders and don’t want to know) and at times I feel like I’m completely out of my depth.

I had opportunities to move (very slightly)
up the ladder by switching to other internal teams on many occasion; as noted above I’m quite self managed and I have navigated some tough meetings by myself and other managers have noted this and would love to have me aboard their team, until it came to the managers of these teams speaking to my said manager to allow me to transfer and then each and every time that trail runs cold as my boss wants me to continue doing what it would take a team of 5 to do and pulls rank against other managers.

My boss having confronted me with “what are you doing!” (in regards to the above news of requests to transfer) I had a conversation with my boss that I like to move teams to broaden my skill set in other areas of the business, in return I’ve been told the work I do is to important and I am required in this role as not much people have the understanding, technical skill set and good people skills. When I confronted the fact of my career aspirations I was given a stern “if you want to take a different route I’ll have your job replaced within the next 3 months and you can move onto whatever it is you think you want to do, so please do me a favour and tell me now so oppose to wasting both our time, as I really wanted to develop you in to leading, managing and growing your team” (this comment alongside the fact I can’t move teams as they won’t allow it is a no win)

It’s been over 3 years and zero feedback even when I try to be more subtle in my approach (I did not want to prod the beast and face another unfair ultimatum) but get the same feedback as noted above.

One would say leave and move on but it’s difficult giving the field I’m currently working in is quite niche and hard to come by.

Anyone else been in a similar situation? How have you navigated it?

With no guidance or no network, i know for sure as a young man, i need to get out there and make something out of myself and get experience or get educated into something to then acquire a stable field.. thats why i considered medical rad tech which would only take 2 years. Unfortunately i missed the fall deadline until next year, and something in me tells me i need to go get educated and im wondering should wait till next year at my current job or go ahead with potential options will take my focus away from school. 

Job A- Bus operator for the city’s bus union which has good pay and benefits but it can take a toll on me mentally and physically and i’m not sure if its the right path
Job B- Understanding that sales/marketing is very important to today’s market, i was considering working as a low entry BDR or door-door salesmen in some random company to hopefully develop and move up with my skills into a bigger reputable company
Job C- Very Similar to Job B but working as a life insurance agent 
Job D- Take courses for accounting to see if it could work for me

I understand the only way to know is by trying to see what works and what doesn’t since we’re all different and have our strengths or weaknesses. People who have degrees or real world experience, what can you recommend to me? Should i drop it all and focus on acquiring a more stable career as the medical job i mentioned?

1g6ke2w,I keep getting promoted when I don't want it,"This might sound like a brag but please note it's not.

Background: I'm an IT engineer and have been in the field for 7 years now holding different roles but always being on the technical side. 

TL/DR: I keep getting promoted in IT leadership when I don't want it.  


I joined a company a few years back (still present of course) and when I joined my position was not what I thought it would be. I thought it would be a hands-on IT role but it turned out to be a Tech Lead role with contractors doing all the fun stuff. 

One year later I requested to be moved to a different team to be more hands-on and it was granted. Three months later, they ""promoted"" me to a Deputy Product Manager for a DevOps team because of my resume and the work I've accomplished as a Tech Lead. I refused but my bosses moved me there anyways. I expressed that I only joined this team to be hands-on on the technical side and I don't want to deal with stakeholders and be the decision-maker. They acknowledged my concern and did it anyways.

A few months go by in this new role, I reshaped the team to be a little more efficient and they liked what I did and now want to move me to a different team to be the Primary Product Manager of another DevOps team. My supervisor was excited to share this with me cause she thinks I'll do great and told me that I'll receive more facetime from executive management. ick.

Y'all's, I'm an introvert and I don't like having attention on me just for doing my job. Sure acknowledgement is nice but I never seek it. I don't know why they keep wanting to put me in positions of IT leadership. I know a lot of people in our field want this and to be a boss over others but it was never my aspirations. Now I feel my technical skills are diminishing as I'm no longer hands-on. My wife wants to accept it cause she thinks it's great for my career but I just want to get my hands dirty again like I did when I was a sysAdmin for a school.

Right now I'm only sticking with the company cause the pay is great even though it's onsite work and the stress is tolerable.

1g6joi8,Manager freezing me out ,"Hi all, I wanted to get some feedback on my situation. I’m in a unionized position right now and I entered into this position on happenstance.

In essence, I was not the top choice. 

Fast forward to present day, I’ve been doing this role for a few months now and I realize my manager is freezing me out. He’s respectful but takes awhile to respond to my messages and there’s generally a sense of coldness. I’ve asked for feedback for my performance and it’s never been bad. He’s always said I’m doing a good job. I’m doing my job to the best of my ability and there’s been no issues on my end from feedback I’ve asked of my colleagues. 

My apologies for the long rant but does anyone see any issues ? Or am I over thinking things? Manager aside, I think I have good relationships with my colleagues otherwise.

1g6itdn,Single dad scared to switch jobs even though company lost revenue.,"I can’t take the gamble of interviewing and looking disloyal, the company has been eerily quiet and hasn’t announced layoffs but everyone is on edge.  Really can’t tell because it’s WFH.  The company has lost business and revenue in the single digit billion per year, however their yearly revenue is in the hundreds of billions, 100k workers.  I may be overthinking this but the revenue hit is not something to balk at.  There’s likely to be future layoffs.  

More importantly I’m a single dad, 45 , in very competitive IT.  I’ve got no fallback if I were to lose my job or if I gamble and take another job, in this job market the offer could be rescinded after I give my notice or the new boss and team could be a nightmare and I have to start all over.  

So if I were to make the wrong decision my kids will face homelessness and hunger.  A lot is riding on my shoulders.

I am anxious I am scared . Because of this I can’t see the forest from the trees.  I am asking for your sincere advice on what I should do and if you’ve been in this situation please share your thoughts and experiences.

I have a pretty cushy WFH job and coworkers are great. So it’s really hard to start looking for something else or make a jump unless absolutely have to.

I am making 205k base and there's 8% 401k matching, paid at **beginning** of each year (weird i know).

I am being offered a position that is 170-180k (recruiter said could push to 180k). Same PTO and same 401k. They do have a 15% stock purchase match (if I buy 15k of stocks, company will match so essentially double shares). Their tech stack is amazing though and I feel I can grow a lot more professionally vs current stable but stagnant work.

There's a slight caveat in that I can try to interview for a higher level position from the same company in Dec/Jan, but the outcome could be Hired, Recommend to current role or rejection. If I do land the higher level, I would go there, no brainer. But besides that, is this even something I should consider?

1g6gmat,How to ask for salary increase earlier than manager promised,"I was working in the company (corporate) for around 1.5 year. Started as intern, and then promoted to junior position after 3 months of internship with new salary which was fair for this junior position. 
My manager and colleagues always say that they are very satisfied with me and happy to work with me. I was doing my job really well, and coordinating and leading the same stuff that Senior Coworkers do in my team while being a junior. They see that I can take more responsibility and do my job very well, sometimes I do overworked to deliver better results.  The work conditions are good, I am allowed to work remotely, and no one is tracking my time.

The last salary increase was around 5% from my initial junior salary(reviewed in June).
Recently(around month ago), my manager started to talk with me about “position increase”(from junior to middle). I was happy to hear this, and was expecting that the process of my salary increase will start. Some days ago, I had a discussion with my manager again, and they said the same stuff, but mentioned that they already informed upper management about my seniority increase. They plan to do it April next year UNLESS I can shout and ask for promotion now. During the meeting, I did not react on this, which may look like I am okay with waiting for April. However, it would be good to have it asap. Also we didn’t discuss any salary ranges.

1g6fle3,Which career should i settle in???( advices would be appreciated),"So i am a girl with adhd(inattentive) and ever since being diagosed it has taken a toll on me and now can make sense of a lot things but it has led me to another dilemma. Ever since i can think of me chosing a field for my career i have thought of going to med school and becoming a doctor. But i failed to get the scholarship the entrance exam in my home country twice. I have already taken a gap year and this time parents wanted me to apply for other option too so i reluctantly kept nursing. Idk if its my bad luck or good luck i failed in the entrance exams for being a doctor but got the scholarship to study nursing in the best nursing school of my country. Nursing in my country isn't good the staffs are not paid and overworked every nursing student tries to leave our country after graduation. 
The primary reason for me to be a doctor was to self diagnose me and help  others like me .It might sound childish but the place where i come from my parents don't believe in being Neurodivergent or having adhd. I didn't know what was wrong with me or ehat was different in me but these past few years i always felt lazy and unable to focus on assignments .When i talked with one of my friends who got diagnosed with adhd and shared similar story of mine. I realized i shared the same diagnostic features as him . So when i was old enough went to the doctor on my own and got diagnosed and still they don't want to accept this fact. Working out really helped me cope with adhd since i feared taking adhd meds I didn't wanna depend on them. But now parents want me to stop working out since for them it was the prime reason for me not getting into med school as i worked out a lot and wastee my time. 
For a while i was interested in studying pschology and being a clinical psychologist but our country doesn't offer good pschology courses and career there is not full filing and its better being a psychiatrist here. But ever since i got diagnosed my mind has changed a lot . I realized i wanted to be a psychiatrist to prove my parents that i was right all the way and mental disorders are a thing. Now i don't think that is a purpuse of mine .So now i am not even sure why i wanna be a doctor, or should i even be a doctor. Parents want me to go for the third and last try for scholarships for medical school since thry can't afford to pay the high fees and students loans also is out of the topic because of this . 
Whenever i feel like escaping the world i draw portraits or i sketch things or paint .I am not that passionate about art but i have a natural talent.i even won like a school level art contest even tho i appied it to escape  my social studies class. I seldom draw , I would draw once every 4month or so . Being said that , my talents are in arts and also in maths i can do calculus with ease and score good grades in mathematics with minimum effort in highschool i have been tutoring kids maths in my free time. Since i find it easy and everyone around find it hard. I was never passionate about maths either never applied for any contest or anything. Having said that, my friend think I would be a good architectrual engineer since i am creative, have artistic skills and i am good at maths. But the thing is i have never felt i belong there or felt passionate enough to try for it . 
Idk if its me trying to prove myself or my parents i am not not a failure trying to get scholarship in mbbs seems like the only option.
The thing is i just gave my second attempt for this scholarship test to get into mbbs .So now my options are to study nursing in scholarship or wait a year and again take another gap year then try for scholarships in mbbs or scholarship in mbbs. Mind that my parents cannot afford to pay alot . 
But rn idk what to do and I feel stupid because opportunities are knocking my door and i feel like i am resfuing it for a goal that isn't even my goal .I feel lost idk where my interest lies and which career should i choose i feel like I would waste another year trying to get into med school.But the only option than that is nursing i don't like nursing quite much as it very demanding job with little to less pay and in case of my country zero pay. I would eventually need to try for abroad like us or uk for nursing jobs and it would leave me in dept if i go into nursing but thats only thing i can chose rn.
If i wait for another year and think thorally and apply for med school and this time to architectural engineering and maybe others too .But i feel like living this gap year with my parents is gonna take a toll my mental health. One of the reasons of me feeling so is because i will be preparing for third time for the same exam and it is exhausting, and with constant reminder and by constant i mean literally hourly reminder that i am failure and a person with some made up mental disorders i might not be mentally sound by then to take the exam with the amount of excellence needed for scholarship.

1g6fi9x,"2 internships, 3 potential job offers? Need help!","So I have put myself in a pickle.

I’ve had Internship A for 2.5 years. In my last 6 months of school I realized that they weren’t guaranteeing a position with the company full time and kind of had a “well, good luck” view on me working full time. Because of this, I began applying to full time roles outside of the company which leads me to internship B. I interviewed for a full time role in June and they loved me. They wanted me to be a full time Analyst but unfortunately, HR would not allow me to be Full Time salary without having my degree, so they offered me an internship (B) until I graduate where they intend on giving me a full time offer. I’ll also add, when they did the 2nd round of interviews, they clarified with me that my intentions were to join them FT when I graduate because they didn’t want to invest 3-4 months into me for me to just leave. At the time, company A was pissing me off with me struggling to find anything that looked promising so my intentions at the time were to 100% join company B… but I think my perspective has changed. I have now been working both internships in my final semester that way I can see what options I have when I graduate.

Now here’s the problem… I am up for two full time positions from internship A because we recently got a lot more visibility and have people running to our program for FT work. But I still also have the FT offer from Internship B….

Internship A is a great company, has good benefits, will offer me the ability to travel for work, and reflects more what I want to do

Internship B is also a fantastic company with incredible benefits, work 4 days a week, the work seems interesting but the analyst position that I’d be doing right away is not anything glorious and doesn’t seem that interesting, although the levels above this analyst role that I’d be in for 2-3 years seems very interesting to me.

There has been a push recently to get people back in 3 days but ive had nothing said to me by senior management even when talking to them recently about it, they didnt suggest any more than my 1 day.

*  I have my currently role VERY handy. some days i maybe only do 2-3hrs work, start about 10am, finish about 4pm. I've been working more or less remotely since 2020, but i do think its maybe starting to affect me career wise. I'm only 31, and i do wonder sometimes if networking more would be beneficial, i hate going into the office 1 day because of the commute, and i do feel isolated from the team as they are all in 3 days but live very close by in Dublin city. 

* My fear is that this role will make me hate work again, ive gotten so used to making my job work around my personal life for 4 years now, its really down my list of priorities, i just make it fit around my day. I can walk the dog when i want unless something is urgent, run an errand etc.

*  **My wife and I are hoping to have our first child in the middle of next year which is a big factor,** i suppose having at least a couple of days from home would be a good help to her. But i'd hate to regret giving away 4 days at home for only 2. 

* She currently works Full time from home remotely for a software firm so both of us are in the house all day every day except the 1 day i go in. But we have very good exercise habits (gym and walk regularly) and socially we have lots of friends and events outside of work. 

*  *i think i may be taking this role for granted at present, and could enter a really heavy workload job. Sometimes i am really bored and feel a bit useless sitting at home with very little to do. Other days there is plenty to do but the tasks are mundane. I know some people reading this would kill for this job, others would not want to be sitting at a desk setup in their guest bedroom every day.*
* It's very hard to find another remote role in Ireland/Northern Ireland, ive been searching for over 3 months now and gotten right down to the final stage, but the other candidate got it ahead of me.",BrotherMore6592,1,1.0,0,1729246626,2024-10-18 10:17:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g6eonh/would_you_leave_remote_for_hybrid_in_my/,10,2024

1g6d9bc,Feeling Lost After 10 Years in a Mid-Sized Company – How Do I Define My Expertise?,"I've been working in a mid-sized company for the last 10 years, mostly in HR, marketing, and digital initiatives. My role has largely involved bringing in new ideas, leading projects, and setting up things that didn’t exist before. I've launched things like employee engagement programs, new technology initiatives, and social media channels, but I’ve always been self-taught—no mentor, no formal guidance.

The issue is, despite getting promotions and positive feedback, I don't feel like I have a clear skillset. I’ve worked in HR but haven’t deeply learned areas like compensation or talent management. Same goes for marketing—while I’ve done digital branding and strategy, I don’t feel like an expert in digital marketing, SEO or whatever. It feels like I’m good at ""building new things,"" but that doesn't seem like a defined expertise.

Of course i did  some course in HR and Digital Marketing, but rarely got to use most of them as i was mostly into building specific thing.

Now, I’m at a point where I want to develop a niche or become a subject matter expert in something, but I’m not sure where to start. How do I identify my core skillset and start positioning myself as a thought leader? Would love advice from people who have felt similarly.

1g6c7yh,Middle manager is incompetent and it’s starting to impact work and my sanity,"Hierarchy is:

Boss
|
Sr. Manager
|
(Middle) Manager
|
Me and 1 Coworker

Pros: This guy is really nice. Says all the nice platitudes you’re supposed to say: “thanks for the hard work, we appreciate it, etc.” he does tease about a few things that are out of line but that’s not an issue. 

Cons: This guy is literally incompetent. We work in digital marketing and:

- He doesn’t know how to use excel.
- He doesn’t know how to crop a photo in a square. - He lacks any sort of creativity, his ads look like shit (text formatting is bizarre, font choice is bizarre, taglines and headlines don’t make any sense, graphics are repurposed from other campaigns where it doesn’t make sense for that medium etc.) 
- He lacks any ambition to pick up responsibilities. If he does, it lasts for a few days and is quickly forgotten about.
- The few things that are his responsibility, he’s inconsistent (not doing weekly reports weekly. Or sending them on different days. Wildly different layout each time. Etc.)
- He asks me “how he can help” and acts helpless like an intern and wants me to teach him things, meanwhile I don’t have the time to because I’m busy making sure the work actually gets done.

He’s been here for maybe 3.5yr and I’ve been here 2.5yr. So he has had more time than me with the systems, yet acts like he’s at some disadvantage where I’m lucky I’ve figured out the programs and he hasn’t. 

I don’t want to rock the boat, but it is starting to drive me CRAZY because I’m wondering if I’m enabling his position every day that I don’t speak up. However, he’s literally the guy who writes my reviews and vouches for me. 

The problem is, my work continues to get more and more demanding and stressful, meanwhile he has an extremely light workload and shows no intent to help. So it’s becoming harder to not call him out for being dead weight.

I have fantastic rapport with my Sr. Manager, coworker, and Boss, in that order. I’ve said a small comment to my coworker about it but he kinda deflected and we didn’t go into it. 

tl;dr - Middle manager sucks. But he’s nice to me. My work is becoming more and more demanding and I need an actual leader/project manager. Do I say anything? I feel crazy and don’t know if everyone else has the same experience. I don’t want to enable him with tenure here and have it become even harder later on.",throwaway18311831,3,1.0,2,1729235202,2024-10-18 07:06:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g6c7yh/middle_manager_is_incompetent_and_its_starting_to/,10,2024
1g6bp6w,Finishing my degree in architecture soon. No longer want to be an architect and not sure what career path to pursue?,"Hi everyone, I am currently in my last year of getting my Bachelor of Arts in Architecture. I did an architecture internship over the summer, and it was good in the way that I learned a lot lol. In the past year, I've kinda realized that being a normal architect isn't for me. I have a lot of interests, but I am especially leaning into history, film, or even anthropology somehow lol. I am interested in historic preservation and this would probably be the only way I become a licensed architect if I am specialized in preservation. I just don't know if it's a viable career or if it would be as exciting as I imagine. I love architectural history and archaeology, but I am bad at reading and don't think I want to do a PhD. I enjoy doing research, I currently have a research assistant job, and I am enjoying it a lot. I also have a minor in architectural history, and all the classes I've had for my minor have been my favorite. I'm open to academia (full-time or part-time), however, once again, I just don't know where to start especially without a PhD.

On the other hand, I have always been super into film. I recently learned about scene design, and it seems like a possible dream job, however, I feel like the film industry is hard to get into. I have seen that people start in theatre design and work their way up. I also love the idea of working for myself and remotely from home, but I'm a little scared of not being able to find success. I live on the east coast of the US and do not ever plan to move to the west coast.

Either way, I will pursue a master's degree.

1g6bkl6,Best path to C-suite: Deep tech PM or consulting? What would you prefer?,"I've been trying to figure this out for myself, graduating soon.

TL;DR/bottom line up front: I am a PhD-MBA dual degree trying to choose between management consulting, tech consulting, or PM at deep tech startups related to my aerospace eng PhD. I'm at a T5 eng and T15 MBA school, mostly interested in not being exploited like engineers are--making it to the higher ranks and having control over my future.

To explain more, I could probably swing PM at like Anduril/shield.ai/Planatir, or become an IC at SpaceX/one of the googleX projects, or CTO in a good accelerator. Don't mind technical work, but generally engineers aren't promoted to high roles (and eventually top brass) in most companies (SpaceX is an exception) because they have a myopic viewpoint.

I'm a founder and am getting my MBA, and typical advice is MBB for me to have that mark on my resume. I've been getting advice from faculty that ""you can always go smaller, but you can't always go bigger. Just get a big checkbox on your resume for your first job with MBB."" which makes sense. I have absolutely zero runway to found my own company.

I've also been getting advice ""if you leave deep tech, you probably can't come back to technically related roles as easily."" Think FAANG SWE -> MBB -> FAANG SWE again might be a difficult path, but I have no idea honestly. I am good at deep tech (highly published), but tech is very difficult and sucky with AE, lots of projects don't turn out and you're only really selling to the gov't. Don't mind the work though.

""Technical CEO"" is a term I've heard recently and love the idea as a long-term target, but generally am more interested in management (NOT low/middle-management) anyway. Considered CTO before that. Not really interested in consulting except that it's a path to C-suite and respectability at the highest ranks. Is this something where I bite the bullet and just MBB for 3 years, get paid, and try and come in at the top of a good tech firm? Should I bend it more tech with Accenture or techy sides of MBB? I saw lots of LDPs, not sure if I should really care about those.

I should note that one of the things I've really been trying to learn is the business development/product-market/marketing side of things since the #1 problem I see is engineers who have no idea what anyone wants (it's a hard problem ok? haha). Wouldn't mind a good opportunity that helps me connect my work to upstream customers/clients in the future.

So, what should I do? Is consulting required nowadays for a quick shot to the top brass? Should I just take the highest offer, and the rest will work itself out?

I have a very strong resume and can kind of choose my own path anywhere.",2bystander4me,94,0.8799999952316284,22,1729232267,2024-10-18 06:17:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g6bkl6/best_path_to_csuite_deep_tech_pm_or_consulting/,10,2024
1g6b17l,"Should I take 30% pay-cut for public sector job (BC, Canada)? ","I’m (32F) currently working at a private startup for almost 1yr and half. my manager is not very supportive since the beginning. And I’ve been myself in my team, and finally I brought a new staff member onto my team and asked my manager for giving me a promotion to a more senior position. However, he didn’t communicate his intentions clearly before we hired this person. Initially, it seemed like the new hire would report directly to him, so I assumed he doesn’t want to give me a promotion. 

But once the new hire joined, my manager informed me that he actually wanted her to report to me, with the idea of giving me more responsibility and seniority. Despite this, he hasn’t changed my title or offered any compensation. To add to the frustration, the new hire was given a senior title, while I still don’t have one.

On top of that, the company is dealing with significant political issues. Many employees have been let go simply because they aren’t favored by the C-suite or senior management, and a lot of talented people are leaving every week. The financial situation is also quite unstable—one of my close coworkers, who is a financial controller, mentioned that we’re actually running out of cash.

Now, I’ve received a public sector offer with a 30% pay cut. I’ve never worked in the public sector before, but I’ve been seeking an opportunity like this. It’s a 10-month contract position with the potential to become a permanent full-time role, depending on my performance.

Is this public sector position worth pursuing? I’d appreciate any advice from those with experience in Canada’s public sector. Also, is it easier to transition to other public sector roles after gaining 10 months of experience?

1g6al5g,Potential discrimination?,"My wife recently quit her job because her employer decided to back track on a different schedule for her. 

The context is I was offered a different schedule at my work which would be better for our family. She worked 7am till 3:30pm. Monday thru Friday. I worked weekends, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, 6pm-6am. She asked her employer if she could go part time to spend more time with the kids and so we could see eachother. She talked to hr and they talked to the manager and he said shouldn't be a problem. She was going from salaried to hourly but at the same rate she was getting salaried and also not taking insurance anymore. Overall a money saving move for the company.

I take the new schedule and a few days after that, hr contacts her and says the manager thought about it more and decided she couldn't go part time. At this point I can't change my schedule back since my position was filled. Her employer even emailed her the information about losing insurance, new hourly wage and everything. So she put in her 2 weeks. The excuse was they couldn't let her go part time because then other employees would want to go part time as well. 

A few months later, we find out the person that was hired about 3 weeks before my wife quit was able to go part time because he is involved in the church. I'm not sure if this is a discrimination thing or sexism but this feels very fishy to me.

1g6a98c,Success story. I’ve been on here lurking for months. ,"Long time follower and reader. After a eight month search I finally landed a mid weight role with a great salary. I wanted to share my story to others, mine is very specific so take it with a grain of salt. I work in product design, my past experience is for a few companies that are “golden” when it comes to design. It took me about 50 applications. I heard back from about 10. Out of those 10 I got six interviews. Out of the those 6 I got 2 final panel interviews. I got 2 offers and went with the higher salary and better benefits. I tailored my resume every single time and kept tweaking my portfolio. I also would learn on here for tips, I saw someone recommend to find people at the company I’m applying for on LinkedIn and add them and message them. This was a GREAT piece of advice and totally worked. 

Another time was to use the job description in your own work. So if the description said we are looking for xyz, I would make sure I have a project where I cover xyz to present. 

I also networked my a** off. Constantly getting coffee and lunch with people, constant follow ups and bugging people for leads. Every single day I was at it like a full time job.

Attitude was a big one. I could tell the further you get with interviews the more it’s about personality and team fit.

1g689g4,My new job flies me to another state for the first time for an orientation & my anxiety has me miserable. Am I in my head or is my gut right to assume the worst?,"



*Please tread lightly with me, my anxiety is always worse in social situations. This will be a rant and I was excited for this trip, now just wanna go home*

I started a little over a month ago & was trained by my manager and have been passed down to my supervisor. Both have told me I’m doing well, they felt the need to tell the team when I was being introduced that I was doing well/caught on quickly. Maybe bc it’s remote but when meeting them through teams and just “talking”/them reaching out via chat, I didn’t feel nervous. When I talk to my supervisor, she gives redirection/correction but has been positive the other majority of the time too. She even pointed out that she calls it like she sees it and said I don’t take compliments well 😶, I owned up to that and told her I appreciate her positive feedback. 

Well they fly out all newbies to UT for orientation & yesterday I met my supervisor at a welcome dinner. I sat with her and another mgr from a different team that she’s friends with, talking to them and the other mgr’s newbies didn’t feel nerve wracking either. I felt uneasy when I was asking my boss pretty blunt role related questions (like will expectations with metrics become more strict after the probation period, trying to compare how I’m trending with other former newbies she’s trained that are no longer there). To help answer the metrics question, she brought up the 2nd newest team member after me and how he barely met metrics but it was still *good* because he’s new and it’s still technically passing. And I tried to ask in a way without sounding paranoid if mgmt was typically positive with newbies it didn’t work out with, since they’ve been reassuring with me from since my start. And she said that there were signs with those former newbies since day 30, she’d tell them that “they got this” but would still be “honest” with her concerns regarding how they’re trending with certain things. She said with me she hasn’t had that fear yet and apparently bragged about me to the other supervisor. 

The other fears at the dinner were: her talking about an introverted coworker that barely talks but drew attention at a recent meeting holding a baby that she didn’t know was her nephew but mentioned she’s really good at her job, talking about an interview she had recently where there was awkward silence bc the mgr that trained me was taking notes/has slow processing time and the interviewee asked if everything was okay (but mentioned she loves the mgr) & her friend/the other dept mgr at the dinner table mentioned her subordinate sending a file too soon & needing to correct her. It just…feels like gossip. Gossiping makes me feel uneasy since I always worry it’s being done about me. But my supervisor was *nice* in person, I just feel like no one can be that nice all the time and I get sus. 

Now today at the orientation, it was all the newbies and the presenters, I was seated with people I didn’t meet yesterday. They put us on the spot a lot asking ice breakers/our responses from the presentation and I HATE public speaking so I know I was evidently nervous. A few people sitting further up were at the table with me yesterday for the dinner and probably wondered wtf happened to me. There was a woman at my table who seemed *nice*, I guess I was a stranger since she knew everyone else seated at our table and she asked about where I live since we live in the same state/were victims of hurricane Milton. I was so shy but tried to ask open ended questions & not just give responses revolving around me. 

We were doing this game and it was so tense, everyone was on edge but I think that was the point, it required steady hands and balance. At one point, I was passing the marble but was shaky cuz again it wasn’t easy. It did land fine for another girl next to me but when she sensed I was having trouble, she said tensely “ok girl move it over here” and the woman I was sitting with/asked questions made a nervous noise because she was next to the girl that said that. I thought that noise was directed at me but she kept on acting nervous even after it was her turn. The woman I was sitting with/made that noise ran down the line when she was done and hugged me since I was standing next to her at that point. And I said jokingly “I’m not gonna lie you kinda worried me”. And when we got back to the table, she asked more about why she made me nervous and apologized. I said at first I thought you were nervous by how I was handling the marble but no seriously we’re good. And she apologized again and I said no it’s fine. When we were leaving, I was one of the last to leave since I had a question for the presenters and that same lady I was sitting with  asked me again if everything is okay and I said oh yeah everything is fine (imo pleasantly). 

Tomorrow is the last day, we’re meeting the CEO but it’s a short day. I was so nervous flying here yesterday even before all the anxiety today, my heart rate was high and I felt like I was gonna die with the turbulence. I know the newbies are gonna be put on the spot again tomorrow and I’m dreading it but from what I’ve shared from beginning to end…do I have a reason to be worried? Or is this another case of my anxiety?

1g687n4,How do I find someond to sponsor a work permit ford?,"Hi everyone, I hope you're all doing well. I'm a 21-year-old male, biracial (Algerian-French), with a bachelor's degree in Management. I graduated second out of 88 students in my field and hold various certificates including an English C1 certification and a 5-star student certification. I also completed an Erasmus+ scholarship in Poland during the final semester of my bachelor’s.

For most of my life, I’ve focused heavily on academics, but after returning to Algeria, helping my family with daily chores, and having time to reflect, I feel like I’ve neglected my true passions. I love music, drawing, and creating art, I can write two songs a day or draw cartoons effortlessly. I find immense joy in these activities, and now that I have more time, I’ve realized this is what I truly enjoy.

However, there’s a problem. My mother, who’s French, strongly insists I find a job abroad. She believes I have great potential and that staying in Algeria would be a waste. The issue is that I don’t have much professional experience, so I’ll likely need to start with an entry-level job (like a server or receptionist), which is quite hard to secure abroad without experience.

I’m feeling a bit anxious and lost about the future. I mostly speak English and have been considering relocating to the UK or Canada, but the pressure to secure a job by the end of 2024 is adding more stress.

Hey guys, I’m a 25F college student living in the Central Valley of CA & recently I have been stuck in choosing a career because of household changes. I have had to be co-provider along with my mom ever since she became a single parent. I had dreams of having an artistic career (interior design, production design, creative direction in: music videos, campaigns, photoshoots. Stage design for plays, concerts, and music festivals graphic design too.) 

But I felt that slowly go away because now I’m focused on money and helping my family move forward financially (helping with housing, bills, car payments etc.,). A part of me is kind of set on just finding a mediocre job that realistically pays well or decently enough to get by, but a part of me feels like I owe it to myself to still pursue something creative. I still want to do what I can and not give up which is why I came here to ask what are some creative jobs that actually pay well and how to go about it? As in $80k+? I want to believe there is a job out there for me that aligns with me yet also pays a livable wage! 🥲",CriticismStock9268,1,1.0,1,1729217782,2024-10-18 02:16:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g67oef/college_student_needing_advice_in_redirection/,10,2024

1g66zuf,Should I take a job offer if I'm waiting to hear back from other companies that I would prefer to work at?,"I'm an aerospace engineering major who graduated this past fall. I originally had a job lined up but they pulled my offer due to budget cuts in June, about a month before I was supposed to move across the country to start the job. Ever since then, I have been searching for a job with not a ton of luck until this past month. Up until about a month and a half ago, I'd interviewed with 4 companies with only one of them reaching the final stage where I was ultimately rejected.

During this past period of really struggling to get interviews, I started lowering my standards for which positions I apply for (applying for positions outside of the aerospace industry). I ended up getting a job offer for a position that honestly seems interesting and is in the defense area, but just isn't the type of work I'm hoping to do long-term. On top of this, it requires a security clearance and I wouldn't be able to start for at least 3 months, and it's also located in a place that I'm not super excited about moving to. I'd like to work in the space industry and that's what my background/experience fits better. Sort of during this same time, I've started to get a lot more interviews and I'm currently in the interview process with 5 companies, all of which fit what I'd like to do with my career better.

I feel like I'm stuck in a tough spot and don't really know what to do. It's tough to balance not settling for a job but also not sitting around and waiting for the perfect opportunity to fall into my lap. I'm almost considering taking the job but then if I get a job offer I prefer in these next few months, taking that one and dropping the one I currently have. But I know that's frowned upon, so I don't know.

They offered to bring me on as a contractor for a trial period, which I’m used to since I’ve been freelancing for 15 years. During the call, I outlined my base rate—essentially the lowest I could work with. At the end of the conversation, she asked if I’d consider a full-time role with benefits, and I said yes, but mentioned I’d need to be within a specific salary range.

A few hours later, I received an offer letter from HR, but it was at the very bottom of my range. I’m unsure how or if I should negotiate. I had made it clear that I was willing to start at the lower rate with the understanding that we’d reassess pay in six months, but that wasn’t reflected in the offer. Additionally, it didn’t include reimbursement for my home office setup or the expensive tools I use.

Would it be cleaner to request a signing bonus to cover these expenses, and/or should I ask for a 15% salary increase to be confirmed in writing after six months?

1g65ciz,What to do now ??,"

Three years ago, I worked at a company where I had the opportunity to learn 4-5 different technologies. This experience opened the door for me to attend 9 interviews, and I successfully cleared all of them. Some companies offered me hikes of 30%, 40%, 100%, and even 200%, as my salary at the time was relatively low for my experience level.

Eventually, I decided to join a leading MNC, where I was offered a 250% hike.

To be honest, for the first two years in this role, I did little beyond enjoying the benefits of my salary. However, over the past year, I’ve come to realize that I’ve been on the wrong track and now want to get back on the right one.

The current role and technology I’m working with offer no real opportunity for growth, and I’ve found it challenging to switch roles or move to a different team.

In the last 7 months, I’ve attended 5 interviews, but only managed to crack one, and even then, they offered just a 5% hike. Although the role involved more advanced technology and new learning opportunities, I decided not to join. I’m still unsure whether that was a good or bad decision.

Suddenly, tonight, in the middle of the night, I’m reflecting on how much I used to enjoy my work—learning new things and implementing new technologies at my previous organization. Back then, I cracked interviews because I was actively working with 4-5 different technologies.

Now, it feels like I’ve forgotten everything, and I’m struggling to clear interviews.

It's a tiny company, we have 15 employees total. I'm the whole marketing department, so I act as a jack of all trades doing whatever is needed in the moment. It's steady but slow work. I get to wfh 2x a week, and the office is a 5 minute drive from my house. We're small enough that I'm never micromanaged. I'm nearly undermanaged - I haven't had a performance review or goals assigned by anyone in the last 10 years. I make roughly $90k salary. No 401k, and we get a ""holiday bonus"" that is negligible (was $150 last year) I'm comfortable here but bored. Our technology stack is antiquated here in general (we still have our office assistant function as a paper runner for example)

I recently had 2 job opportunities fall into my lap, and I'm feeling really torn on it.

Job 1: my former boss from this job left 6 months ago, and reached out to recruit me at his new job. Salary offer is $110k. No bonuses were mentioned in the offer, and no 401k is offered. Job title would be the same, and my job would likely be the same as it is now as a jack of all trades marketer. I can still do wfh 2x a week, but the office is a 50 minute drive each way. The company he's at is another small company, and he would be my boss again so likely no micromanagement.

Job 2: I had a recruiter reach out from my company's #1 competitor. It's a much larger company (LinkedIn estimates 500 employees). The position is fully remote and their HQ is in another state. We haven't discussed salary yet, but the salary range on their career page for the posting is $90-105k, but I am going to try to negotiate higher. Glassdoor lists bonuses and a 401k match as perks. This position has a title of ""Director of email marketing"", and so my scope of responsibility would be more narrow. I'm nervous with it being a larger company that I'll have to deal with performance reviews/goals again, or possibly micromanagement (tracking mouse movement/clicks or something like that). If I were to leave for this company, it would be a big time burned bridge with my current company - one other person from my organization got hired there, and our owner tried to sue them (but lost as I heard through the grapevine).

1g62vzm,Which University Should I Choose for My Next Exchange Program as a CS Major?,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently in my third year of a 4-year Computer Science major with a minor in Finance, and I’m planning my next exchange program for my fourth year. I did my first exchange at Columbia University, but I can’t return there because the program doesn’t allow me to repeat an exchange at the same university.

My main goal is to choose a university with strong Computer Science programs and global prestige that will help boost my career prospects. Here are a few other key points to keep in mind:

* The exchange will last 1 quarter for most schools, but a few are 1-year programs.
* I won’t be taking Finance courses abroad, as I’ll be continuing those online through my home university. But Finance is also one of my main focus points after CS.
* A 1-year program in the U.S. (F1 visa) or U.K. (student visa) would let me work as an intern for a few months post-study, which could be a big opportunity for building work experience, especially in tech.
* I’m trying to rank these options from best to worst, so if you have any insights into prestige, Computer Science program quality, or career prospects, I’d really appreciate your input.

Here are the universities I’m choosing from (with rankings for CS and overall):

1. Boston University (Quarter) – (CS: 113 QS, 91 Times, 70 CSrankings; Overall: 108 QS, 78 Times)
2. UC Irvine (Accelerated Certificate Programs, Quarter) – (CS: 120 QS, 70 Times, 39 CSrankings; Overall: 307 QS, 92 Times)
3. UCLA Extension (Digital Tech Certificates, 1 Year) – (CS for main campus: 19 QS, 21 Times, 33 CSrankings; Overall: 42 QS, 18 Times)
4. London School of Economics (LSE, 1 Year) – (CS: 113 QS; Overall: 50 QS, 46 Times)
5. University College Dublin (Quarter) – (CS: 155 QS, 126-150 Times, 298 CSrankings; Overall: 126 QS, 201-250 Times)
6. Singapore Management University (Quarter) – (CS: 144 QS, 71 CSrankings; Overall: 585 QS)
7. Tecnológico de Monterrey (ITESM, 1 Year) – (CS: 84 QS, 401-500 Times; Overall: 185 QS, 601-800 Times)
8. University of Otago (1 Year) – (CS: 451-500 QS, 501-600 Times, 398 CSrankings; Overall: 201 QS, 301-350 Times)
9. Pontificia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (1 Year) – (CS: 201-250 QS, 301-400 Times, 398 CSrankings; Overall: 611-620 QS, 801-1000 Times)
10. University of Sussex (Quarter) – (CS: 601-650 QS, 301-400 Times, 349 CSrankings; Overall: 246 QS, 201-250 Times)

If you have any experience or insights on these schools (especially regarding their CS programs, career opportunities, or even what the exchange experience is like), it would be super helpful if you could help me rank them from best to worst.

Also, should I prioritize the 1-year programs for the deeper immersion and potential for post-study internships (like in the U.S. with the F1 visa or in the U.K. with the student visa)? Or would a quarter-long exchange at a top school still be a great option?

Thanks in advance for your help! I really appreciate any advice on how to rank these options.",Fit-Amount-4641,0,0.5,1,1729203098,2024-10-17 22:11:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g62vzm/which_university_should_i_choose_for_my_next/,10,2024

1g60xe6,Higher pressure and work  load role for the same pay?,"
Long story short im 26, i have no degree and very few years of work experience in customer service previous to my current job.

I’ve gotten in 5+ different career paths and courses that Ive started throughout my adulthood and never finished them. I felt terrible so I went to the psychiatrist and got diagnosed with ADHD and given meds.

Since then I’ve totally changed and my work output has just about 20x’d. I self studied for a while and landed a job in data analysis within about 2 months. 

I have been at this job for 6 months and when I arrived the data department was at a very low point as there was only one person working there handling all data and reports. 
I spent hundreds of hours studying the data to catch up to everyone and became extremely good at troubleshooting data inaccuracies and fixing them by working with the soft engineers. 

This put me in a good spot in the company as many very high level executives would be in contact with me daily to fix certain issues that arise.

I was now at the end of my 6 months contract offered to either join one of the departments as a project manager, or be a business analyst directly for the COO to provide reports to the companies global CEO.

The project manager role will be more laid back and allow me to keep building my experience and knowledge, the business analyst will envolve very hard work in which I will have meetings at any point of the day and will be very high pressure. However, no pay increase.

Keep in mind because of my lack of experience and education im on a salary very close to minimum wage currently.

I feel like the business analyst might provide me with better possibilities in the future in terms of career and even more visibility, but i’m afraid I will just reach exhaustion as I will not feel properly compensated for the hours im doing. So i’m very much so inclined to take the project manager role which is also a good opportunity.

However I also feel that i’m really in no place to make any requests of raises because of my absolute failure of a CV. But also feel that ive definitely proven to be very good and this is why i’m getting these offers.

I’m at a crossroads between feeling like i dont deserve more and to just go and work to exhaustion, and choosing the “safer” option because if I am to take such a high importance role I should be compensated differently?

Please help me with a 3rd person view on this.",Realistic-Coyote3018,1,1.0,0,1729197836,2024-10-17 20:43:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g60xe6/higher_pressure_and_work_load_role_for_the_same/,10,2024

1g604i6,Is this normal can someone tell or am I being dramatic?,"Ok so I started my internship with enthusiasm and I was doing a great job. I was even better than the intern that they had had there and they had planned to let that old intern go after a month of having them. Poor fellow. I was older than him but I could tell he had potential just the management lacked patience as the manager only stays for 5 hours every week day and the senior was on maternity leave so just the poor guy alone. Such a innocent kid. I personally wanted to train him. Whatever I pick up I am confident I could have taught and its two people yeah we could have learnt things and improved ourselves together. He sensed the management didnt want him and was not satisfied with him and stopped on his own after 3 months. Poor chap. To this day I feel sorry for the guy.  
But as I started handling things on my own, I felt like I need a bit of more time. While I did well in my early months I started stumbling and fell and fell afterwards because I felt like the manager I report to fusses over the smallest things that I feel numb and emotionless maybe at times now because I feel like most things are not things that need lecturing and she panics and stresses so much that I feel stressed to mention anything to her.............I am now overwhelmed, I feel nothing, I feel like I love doing the work just not with her, I love saturdays since my boss is not there on Sats but employees still come to meet me the intern as there is no other senior and now there's a new intern since June 28th 2024 whereas I joined a few months before her in 2024 as well. The thing is this intern was given all the shortlisting and making letters and basically if I had things to do it was thrust onto her by the manager and since is not constantly being pulled in by my manager (our boss) unlike me who is called by her for updates or to support her or it could be me going to other departments to pass messages I feel not organized by the time I get back to the cabin. I was good at shortlisting, arranging interviews that they quickly let the other guy go and gave me a 10k increase in a month which my manager mentioned when I tried to resign..........that no other intern had been granted an increase within 1 month of joining.

So basically, if I had 10 things to do and I was getting about doing it and my manager would ask wheres this wheres that and if I had not done it on the day it had been mentioned then the next day she tells it only takes a few minutes. Every second counts. You only had to call. You only had to meet the HODs. What were you doing after I left (boss stays for 5 hours.) What was I doing after she left from 3.30 till 5 and scolds if we dont have lunch while continuously asking what things have been done and what has not been completed and calling for support, calling to pass on messages, calling to lecture. She sends messages at night or in the morning and erupts if we misses even a single message (ITS A LOTTA MESSAGES IN THE MORNING AND THEN A DOZEN CVS TO SHORTLIST ALL URGENT).

Like everything becomes a huge issue. Plus its like if I say one thing she hears the opposite. They mainly communicate over whatsapp and its a must to get confirmations over whatsapp. I feel like this is so unprofessional and prefer emails but whatever their company so I did what I was told but I have had slip ups and scolded for not managing time well. I feel like no matter how hard I try I will get blasted for something somehow. It could be the door not being open, to asking whether I am doing my work while Im infront of the PC (LIKE WHAT DO YA MEAN I AINT THERE DOING HOUSEWORK, I AM DOING MY OFFICE WORK -I'm 28 btw). She asks and tells I hope you are doing what I told you, you have been having that screen open for some time, you just have to make a few calls it will only take a few minutes, what do you mean it took you so many hours for calls and photocopies (THE MACHINE WAS SHIT WE GOT A NEW ONE WHICH NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO OPERATE PROPERLY). I am in HR and I was told calling candidates will only take a few minutes and calling even 5 to 10 candidates will take max 20 to 30 mins and that also I feel like I myself am being generous as she would tell its gonna take 10 to 15 minutes. Photocopies according to her of Letters of appointments and contracts takes 2 minutes or even seconds. So when that is added up why did I not have lunch, why did I get late, she tells she has never told us not to have lunch.

God sent a witness and its that new intern. LOL she herself without me telling anything told how can we go and eat when she keeps giving work and it feels like there is no point where it feels like yeah we can stop this and go and eat and come because everything is told as if we sitting in an oven and might get roasted anytime so we have to act quickly. LOL but since she is new after this kid joined I could hardly have my lunch at all. Since she is my junior though we are both interns, I allowed her and told her to go and have lunch so she has it at 3.30 or 4.30 and by 4.30 I have lost my need or will to have lunch and have been drained, furious or might be bogged down with work..........I went 4 days with no lunch and recently 2 days..........I am constantly giving her updates over whatsapp, trying to get feedback and reading her bloody messages and stupid dozen recordings....SO MANY VOICE RECORDINGS I FELT WAS SO UNPROFESSIONAL! Another thing was the new intern herself told and our old accountant too, is that when we say something to our boss she hears the opposite and sadly its not funny or joke its true, she makes it dramatic too. she tells Im dramatic because I get startled a bit easily (maybe the influence of anime or just genuine emotions). I feel like better to be dramatic with my expressions than to be a paranoid gas-lighting loud banshee who is also a control freak!

She asks what I have been doing from morning, she asks why certain things took so long, she basically asks a lot of things that the area around my eyes feel weird, not because I want to cry (maybe? but its not tears) its just weird maybe from embarrassment, it just feels weird maybe prickly maybe numb just my cheeks and around the eyes feel weird when being interrogated by her. I mean I just have 8 months experience as an intern from this place. And I feel like no matter what I do to pick up my pace and do well again I am constantly being blasted for something by her mainly. I was taken in saying for 6 months and when I tried to leave telling since they are not telling what will happen to me I was scolded telling I was given an increment even as an intern quickly I am being rude trying to leave when the new kid has joined (HECK I THOUGHT THEY WILL KICK ME OUT THE WAY THEY KICKED THAT EARLIER KID OUT ONCE I JOINED AND WAS BETTER THAN HIM AND I DO NOT NEED IT IN MY RECORD) and honestly I dont know how she lives being the person she is (she calls her house caretaker and asks him if his son is asleep, whether he woke up, whether the caretaker took the drink and gave it to his hand, where he left the drink, was the drink covered, why was it not given...........son is 17 so not like he is a toddler.......maybe it seems normal but even the new girl told when she had overheard these conversations that our boss sounds controlling like and over the smallest things).

Now the new girl, I feel while confident is a bit of a gossip queen. She tells I feel what is told to me that my boss scolds me and someone had told her that I had never been scolded as much before she had joined and its true. I have lost two keys after the new girl joined which I maintained for 4 months prior to her joining, documents are missing cant find easily or where I left them. One of the missing keys turned up in an outside cupboard because she arranged the cupboards a month or so after she joined and guess who got scolded YES ME! HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THE LUNATIC HAD THROWN IT IN THERE AND ITS WHERE WE KEEP THE PARTY GOODS IS SHE NUTS????????? And when she first joined also a key was lost and she pinned it on me!!!!! Thank god the guy who used the key informed he had not given it to me and that he had given it to the new intern girl but she kept telling yes it was given to her and then she had given it to me and then she had seen me putting it to our container with keys THE FUCK? THIS KID! HONETLY! I WAS BAMBOOLZED AND I WAS WONDERING ME?? but I remember thinking the day before when I left the office thinking this guy didnt give me the key but he can give it to the senior accountant as well (he does that too, if not me gives to the accountant). ANYWAY KNOWING MY BOSS I THOUGHT OK HERE WE AGAIN. GUESS WHERE THE BLOODY KEY WAS.................IN HIS BIKE SEAT COMPARTMENT THESE BUFFOONS! The fact that the new intern girl also pinned it on me because when they key is given to me I usually do put it to a container and she was telling from that memory. CRACKED ALL OF THEM!

My boss has also told I am trying to finish my work and she is not able to finish her work and to first help her finish her work...........My boss has also asked how did I say something, how I had phrased it. Had I said it in the way she had told. She says she does not have time to be checking my work.............why did I even join as an intern.......

My boss has labelled me as someone who forgets, while my memory is not as great after my A/LS because of all the shit that happened in that period of my life, ITS NOT THAT I FORGET. ITS JUST THAT one thing is told and so is another and then another and then another and I am to remember it all and I would remember IF I WAS NOT BEING HOUNDED AND BLASTED ALL THE TIME FOR THE SLIGHTEST THING. Sometimes I cant find my own notebook with it being buried under the files we have taken out. So with all the stress, how drained I feel with her constantly breathing down our necks, the constant questions, the constant updates, the constant messaging and SODDING RECORDINGS TO LISTEN TO EVEN IF THEY ARE SHORT INSTRUCTIONS, I just feel like throwing it all in the air. Oh and we only have one PC and one desk for me and the other intern, so with her being on the PC a lot I barely have any chance to work on my own agreements and now even if there is a bit of time like random ad hoc work comes up and things get delayed and I get scolded and then I feel furious and then upset and then the work gets even more delayed with me trying to come back to my zen mode.......so yeah now I just feel like its all pointless I want it to just work out. I dont want to deal with this. I just want a new job but Im 28 and interning in HR LOL I am tired. I want a raise. I want to travel. I want my own space to work. I want to complete my work and get the heck outta here. I want to learn well I want to be able to do my job well in my chosen field. I want a higher designation. I want it to all just fall into place. Im just getting scolded, trying to catch up, being laughed at by the accounts department as well .........

Should I leave? Is this normal? Is there anything I need to fix?",elegantblossom,0,0.5,0,1729195741,2024-10-17 20:09:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g604i6/is_this_normal_can_someone_tell_or_am_i_being/,10,2024
1g60378,21F Need Advice ,"For some background: I’m a senior in undergrad currently and I will be graduating this spring with a BA in History. Although my university isn’t the most prestigious and is very regional, I have been very involved and had various leadership positions on campus and overall have really enjoyed my time here. I also have had very good relationships with my professors and can definitely get some good letters of recommendation. I also did study abroad at a well-known international school in the UK. For a long time, I thought I wanted to go into law after undergrad and I have been studying for the LSAT. I plan on taking a gap year to get a little bit of work experience, however as I’ve had some more legal-adjacent work experience I’m questioning more and more if law is something I still want to do.

I am open to moving to another state (currently in California, lived on the east coast previously) or abroad. My only concern is financial stability (duh). I don’t want to become a teacher.

1g5zl2p,I took Job A Sept. 1 and Job B just offered me 3x..,"Long story short I graduated in Dec. 2023 and landed my first job in February’24. It was with a super small company and I took it originally because I had bills to pay. 2 months later I was laid off and back looking. 

Because of the layoff, i decided to reach out to an old mentor if mine and ask if he could help. And he did. He helped me interview and land a job at a fortune 400 company in a field I enjoy. They have an awesome office space and i work with great people that are around my age. Fun environment. Salary is 40k + commissions that are supposed to bring my end take home pay to 65k while making 100+ cold calls daily. There is room for growth, but i would have to be promoted 2x to make more than Job B.

Job B I would be managing the west coast 6-8 states and would be a step up from my current role. It is in a field i am less interested in, but still in sales. I would travel a little which I like and would be able to continue to live where I live. I would make $125k plus quarterly bonuses based on performance. Benefits for both companies are great and relatively similar.

I think i am leaning one way, but i just dont want to burn any bridges because i genuinely like where I am currently and who i work with. But… 3x my guaranteed salary is almost impossible to pass up.

1g5z5yb,Need advice!,"I need help weighing a possible career move.

Current situation is full remote but moving to 3 days in office next year. I've also recently learned my annual salary is less than the midpoint despite a long tenure (10+yrs) and consistent high ratings and major accolades. I make $130K base and $142K is the median.  Recently recruited by an employer to do similar, but slightly different work. I also get total OTE of 30% of my base as an annual award. Because of performance I typically exceed the 30% mark and am often closer to 40-50%. 

Pros about this change are that I can likely jump about 20-25K in annual base salary while maintaining my additional compensation of cash bonus and RSUs.  Pros are also that I will be in a bigger organization and do way less individual work. They are already on a 3 day in office schedule. 

Cons, I would lose some of my subject matter expertise and have to do some learning to build up new knowledge. I would obviously lose tenure. Another is that I forgot to ask about PTO! I'm currently at 30 days annually plus 10 holidays. I am not sure what I would have starting over. 
Another Con is that I'm looking at a cash bonus and RSU in March 2025 of likely 50-60K.
Additionally I hold RSUs that are on track to be distributed as follows: 
2025- $15K, 2026 $26K, 2027 $28K 2028 $18K+ half of whatever awarded this year. I get $0 if I leave.

Other considerations: 

I just got a pre-approval to have a surgery covered on current insurance plan. It's good through end of year. It's a surgery that would cost me $14K out of pocket, and sometimes people are declined. I would be able to have the procedure this year and recover full while still totally remote. 

Another item, I am privy to some class action, multi-million dollar government fines, unmeasurable reputation damage type info, info that i found as part of my job and that i have fought them for almost a year to deal with it. If I choose to leave, how do I use this as negotiation tactic to retain my current stock holdings? Ie, agree in writing not to disclose anything I know in exchange for my long term equity, even willing to have penalty clause such as you tell and you owe us the amount back ect.. To be clear, in no way am I talking about blackmail. I am genuinely curious if there is an ethical way to negotiate my silence in exchange for my accrued equity if I decide to part ways. Getting them to recognize the stated deficiency took me 9 months of this year, caused me mental and physical health issues based on the stress, and I believe has contributed to my desire to consider leaving. 

I would love to hear how you would negotiate with the new employer, especially given the amount of funds I would lose leaving before March 30 2025. 

Things I have considered asking for is cash sign on bonus plus RSU grant up front, both with clawback options and RSU can vest over time helping demonstrate that if I come over, I'm there for the long haul.

I also considered offering some lower combination of the above combined with a delayed April 1 start date in order to secure my 2024 bonus through current employer without having to make the new employer pay for it all?

Also, if I get a written offer from them, my current employer is likely to match any base salary increase because I am the only one that does my job, and have been the only one for 6 years. Do I take it knowing im bitter that I should've already had it and then some? Ive absolutely been ok with it the past few years due to my placing a value of $25-$30K on being fully remote. Now that they removed that benefit I'll be even more underpaid than I already am. 

Really appreciate all of the thoughts. I've only changed employers twice in my career and it's been over a decade now. I am hoping to retire by 55 so in theory this is my last change of employer and I need to make it count. 

Thank you thank you thank you I am so stressed about it all! 

🙏😘

1g5yksj,Holiday season coming soon and thus the battle of shifts begins... What would you do? ,"Hi everyone,

I recently started a new job about two months ago, and I'm facing a bit of a dilemma regarding holiday coverage. In a recent meeting, it was mentioned that someone from our department needs to be working between December 25th and January 1st. One colleague has already volunteered to cover the 30th and 31st, and I offered to work on the 23rd and 24th.

However, the issue is that no one has yet volunteered to cover the 26th and 27th. My manager mentioned that it might fall on me, as I’m new, and there are concerns about my other two colleagues (who aren’t very reliable and are known to resist extra work).

Here’s the tricky part: I was planning to spend the holiday season in another city, which is about an hour away from the office. I’m willing to work during the holidays, but only remotely, as traveling back and forth between cities for just two days would be really inconvenient and disruptive, especially with family visiting.

I’m highly appreciated in my role so far and to be frank, I'm doing such a great job compare to the existing team that I know they really really want to keep me. This can be my leverage and I'd like to stand firm on my position that I’m willing to work if no one does but only remotely, which the top management hates though. Little detail, the other two colleagues are granted work from home once per week but I as a new comer do not and will not have that privilege at all. If my request isn’t respected, I’m wondering if I can let them know that this would make me consider whether this job is the right fit for me (even though I wouldn't leave nevertheless the outcome).

I’ve also thought about reaching out to my clients directly to gauge if there’s even going to be much work during this period, which could support my case for remote work.

What would you do in my situation? Any advice on how to handle this with my manager and the team? Thanks in advance!

Currently looking for some advice on next steps on my career. 

Background: 
Currently in Mid-20s. Graduate 2021 from non-target school with a degree in Finance and minor in Accounting. Started working right away as an execution trader for a small multi-family wealth management firm. It was very operational heavy and not what I was looking for so after a year I made a change and got hired as a PE FoF investment analyst in a reputable firm. 

I am nearing the end of my program and getting mixed signals from my current employer about promotion, etc. I have self reflected and realized I would eventually like to acquire a small business down the line and attempt to grow it to eventually call mine. For now I know I am nowhere near ready for that challenge and looking to bridge the gap on my operational experience side. Any recommendation on what type of position I should be looking at next? Thinking possibly Corporate Development Associate at a midsize company, or Strategy and Operations Associate. Should I consider sales at all? My background isn’t really a match given I never did IB, so breaking into corporate dev team might be more challenging for me. Could leverage the expertise I built in PE. Or should I be looking to go into a startup and wear multiple hats.

so I work at concrete factory. I’m an immigrant so my career purpose now is to make as much money as possible. it’s my second year at concrete factory now and I know my work well, and I know where to hurry up and where to slow down, I know how to approach my boss etc. money is okay but long-term I don’t think my health will handle this job.

now recently I’ve got an opportunity to work as an industrial climber which will make 3x of my salary. I’ll have to go through some classes (about a week or so) and then I should be good. although I’m a little clumsy and working with ropes requires to be focused.

so now I try to weight pros and cons.

current job:
+got used to it
+10 mins away from my home
-bad on health

a new job: 
+much more money
+less working time
+might learn new skills
-no idea if I’m a fit for that
-a cost of mistake might be higher
-have to move around cities 

what can you recommend? thank you",148147,1,1.0,7,1729190223,2024-10-17 18:37:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g5xzcr/career_dillema/,10,2024
1g5xwff,Follow up again?,"I had a job interview on 10/3 with a company I’ve worked for in the past.
I felt like it went well, I was confident and answered everything well. I prepared beforehand and the conversation flowed naturally.
The hiring manager stated they were hoping to make a decision by ‘the end of next week,’ which was 10/11. I know these things take time and there are lots of factors involved.
I hadn’t heard anything by then, so I nonchalantly sent the HR contact an email, asking if the team had any further questions for me. He responded and said he didn’t have any further info to share and that they were still working on interviews.
Today now marks two weeks since the interview, and still no word.
Again I know these things take time. Unfortunately I’m feeling the pinch because I’ve been out of work for a year now and it’s been such a tight year. We are currently struggling and I’m crossing all my fingers and toes for this one because my household needs it.
I know not to hinge everything on one interview, and I haven’t…. I’ve applied for so many jobs over the past year and I never thought I’d be one of those people to say that I’ve had a hard time finding work because of my skills and work history. But it’s true, the job market is awful and I feel like I keep hearing about more and more layoffs. It has also been a big blow to my mental health this year. 
Anyway, is it bad form to keep checking in? I don’t want to be annoying or off putting either but I’ve been so anxious waiting. ",PsonPDX85,1,1.0,0,1729190013,2024-10-17 18:33:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g5xwff/follow_up_again/,10,2024

I consistently excel at my job, receiving positive feedback from managers and colleagues who recognize my intelligence and strong work ethic. However, I’ve noticed that less productive colleagues are getting promoted while I haven’t had that opportunity anywhere I’ve worked.

I wonder if I struggle with interpersonal dynamics, as my efficiency might make others feel threatened. Perhaps I need to develop a new skill to stand out?

1g5xk57,"Late 30s, baby on the way, 6-months unemployed - Need Advice!","Hi all, I could use some advice or even just a pep talk!

**TL;DR:** Should I continue pursuing a professional job that aligns with my experience and pays well, even if it may take longer and strain our finances? Or should I consider any available work (grocery stores, labor, etc.) to generate income now, risking less time for job applications and interviews?

**Background:** I’m in my late 30s, expecting a baby, and have been job hunting for over six months with limited success. My unemployment benefits just expired, increasing the urgency to find work. I’ve applied to a variety of positions but have received minimal responses, with only a few interviews yielding no offers.

Recently, I’ve noticed a slight uptick in responses, possibly due to improvements in my application strategy or maybe the Fed rate cuts improving hiring overall. I’m awaiting feedback from a recent interview, but I feel increasingly desperate to have a job and income. While I want to avoid taking a ""backward"" step, I also recognize the importance of having a job for my mental well-being, whether that's being able to provide for my family or just feel more grounded by having the structure of a job again.  It makes me wonder if focusing on the easiest, quickest way to get hired might help improve my mindset and allow me to then look for a better job later, even if it means I have less time for the search.

1g5wgs4,Career break due to stress?,"Hi! 

I'm thinking about taking a carer break for about a year but I'm not quite sure if it's a good idea at all.

I'm a single 30 year old Software Engineer renting a flat in London. I have just under £80k in total which could be invested somewhere. My current job offers full time work from home and a 4 day work week so it would be disappointing to lose these benefits. 

On the other side, I have a job that I hate. I've been working here for 8 years now and the last 2 years were bad. There is just a lot of stress with ""urgent important"" projects, with vague requirements that take a long time to clarify, working on multiple projects at the same time, multiple rounds of layoffs and bunch of other issues.  

During performance reviews I used to be told I'm doing great, just keep to keep on doing what I'm doing. Of course, this has changed now and fingers are pointed at me for issues that ( in my opinion) could have been avoided if projects were managed better and I had more reasonable deadlines... 

I don't claim to be perfect but the general stress just makes me feel very miserable. I've spent half my annual leave stressing about return back to work. 

I'm thinking of quitting and taking 1 year break to focus on my health and work on some personal projects but at the back of my mind I'm also worried about finding a new job afterwards. This break would also cost me about 22-23k (assuming my rent won't increase) plus whatever time I'd need to find a new job which is quite a lot of money for me. 

Would it be some crazy stupid idea? Given the current job market, economy and the fact that I don't have any other ""wealth"" outside of this money it kind of seems like it is crazy tbh.

The good news is that my schooling will be fully paid for, so I don’t have to worry about the financial burden.

For context, I earned my undergrad degree in marketing, and ideally, I’d like to pivot into a marketing role post-MBA. However, I’m concerned that my limited hands-on marketing experience might make it difficult to land a job right after graduation.

However, the lady I spoke with has mentioned how the CEO has had negative experiences with NY hires in the past and is not so quick to take on a brand new person in NY, hence a 3-month probation period before becoming full time. 

In essence, I gave a number during our conversation, but am now realizing how I should have taken my time first to calculate things and not give a spur of the moment answer. I'm familiar with the lady and we have a good relationship, so would it be alright to just DM her again and say ""hey I made a mistake and was too hasty, I would actually like for this number to be proposed to the CEO""?

1g5ukya,Feeling lost because of changes ,"Sorry if this is not the right place for this sort of post.
I am a software engineer at a start up and recently a colleague got promoted to being a manager. I don't begrudge her success because she deserves it and at the same time I know that I don't have the skills to be a good manager, being an introvert and dealing with social anxiety (which I'm seeking therapy for). However she's quite a bit younger than me and I've been at the company longer. All this is making me feel very insecure and as a failure. The new crop of people are much more outgoing than me and fit in better than me with the company culture, which leans towards weekly parties and game nights, which I can't relate to. Therefore, they get better opportunities than me like leading bigger teams, having more say in roadmap planning etc. I know it's better for the company to have people's people in leadership roles but at the same time I'm feeling extremely discouraged and slightly depressed to not have the same opportunities as those others and feel like I've been stagnating in my role. 
I'm an ok employee otherwise and my reviews have been positive. Since we're an early stage start up and I foresee us doing well, I don't necessarily want to switch jobs.

I quit job A to expand my skill set, make more money and to eliminate call. When I started job B, they hired me on full time for nights after my friend from job A recommended me. Halfway through training on days at job B my manager asked me to come to day shift. I was honest and told her if anything I would like to go per diem, but they wanted me to stay in my position for 6 months before we could have that talk. Fast forward to my third week on night shift and my mental health got the best of me. I had a full blown panic attack from lack of sleep and stress. I can normally control my anxiety, but nights have really been getting to me.
A week prior to this incident I had asked my manager if I could come to days, but I was met with the same response of needing to wait six months. I still have job A as a per diem, and would like to quit job B but I don’t want to make my friend look bad.

1g5shur,New To the States: Sign-On Bonus of $6K in Ohio—How Much Will I Actually Take Home After Taxes?,"
Hi everyone,

I recently moved to Toledo, Ohio, and got a job offer that includes a $6,000 sign-on bonus. My employer mentioned that the tax rate on the bonus would be lower than usual, but I’m still trying to wrap my head around how much I’ll actually take home after taxes.

Can anyone help me estimate what I might expect to receive? I know it varies by state and individual circumstances, but any general guidance or personal experiences would be appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",Human_Document_2779,2,1.0,16,1729176147,2024-10-17 14:42:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g5shur/new_to_the_states_signon_bonus_of_6k_in_ohiohow/,10,2024
1g5sd91,I'm crying at work every day -- should I quit?,"I recently started a new position about three months ago and am finding it extremely difficult. I've been assigned to a project with little support, and even though I've spent weeks on it, I have nothing to show for my efforts because much of the work has turned out to be irrelevant or unhelpful.

Last week, I presented to the product owner, and he said, verbatim, ""I already knew all of this. What am I supposed to do with this information?"" In hindsight, he's correct, but my manager and I worked closely together on these slides, and I don’t know why my manager would have me present information that ultimately was useless. Now the project is severely behind, and I’m up against an incredibly tight deadline that can’t be moved. The product owner has a reputation for being tough and demanding, as well as the team in general. Attrition is high.

My manager has started requesting daily check-ins, but I still feel completely lost and directionless. I talked to a coworker who’s been supportive, but his advice hasn’t given me any clearer direction. The stress is overwhelming—I’ve had to work long hours to prepare for the daily check-ins, and when I’m not working, I’m too exhausted to do anything but sit on the couch. It’s impacting my sleep and even my ability to do basic hygiene tasks. I find myself tearing up at work multiple times a day from the stress and even fantasizing about getting laid off.

While my manager has been relatively supportive—he’s even provided code and worked late himself—he can’t push back against the product owner. I want to quit because the stress is becoming unmanageable, my work-life balance is poor, and it’s affecting my mental health. However, the job market is extremely tough right now. I was only in my previous position for a year, and leaving too early from this position would look bad.

Unfortunately, I know I am also a sensitive person, a huge perfectionist, and terrible at handling stress, which would explain why I'm struggling. This may just be a normal onboarding struggle, and things could improve over time. Additionally, there are still valuable skills to be gained by staying, such as learning to set boundaries, managing competing priorities and stakeholders, and navigating office politics.

What should I do?

1g5retv,Help me I’m ‘stuck’ at home with my mum?,"**Help me I’m ‘stuck’ at home with my mum…** 



I’m 27 (M) and currently staying with my mum whilst I find a job. 



I am getting extremely sick of being here and I find her presence deeply annoying, despite her being very friendly and generous. I want to leave but I have £24,000 in savings and I do not want to waste this moving to a city with no job. I don’t want to go broke and make my life even worse.



Before moving back with my mum, I was working in London local government for two years after graduating but left at the end of my contract due to not really fitting in at the company and then going through a bad break-up (long-distance, plus cheating, plus my Mum causing a huge scene and being verbally abusive toward my ex at a family gathering…) and an unstable rental situation (found out my tenancy was illegal) in London.



I moved back home after all of this because I had nowhere else to go (without wasting lots of money or sleeping on a friend’s couch).



I went travelling for a few months whilst applying and interviewing for jobs to clear my head and basically get away from the reality of being unemployed and living with my mum and the break-up etc. 



I have interviews for local government jobs and even one position to train as a commercial solicitor at an international law firm. So there is some hope that I will eventually land a job and be able to move back to London.



However, I am getting extremely sick of being here. I see no friends and my life is basically just job applications, online courses and going to the gym/running. 



I keep telling myself I just need to keep going and keep applying and I’ll get a job and can leave. But it is really taking a toll on my mental health. I am angry or miserable (not fully depressed thanks to meditation) most of the time and I feel like I’m wasting my late 20s. Obviously also not got laid since travelling and that is not helping things… 



I have considered taking a short trip to clear my head. Or applying for teaching jobs in China. Just to get away and start fresh. But I feel like it’s a bit random and I should stick to where I have experience and build a career… 



Maybe I should set myself a deadline to have a job by and if not then I’ll do the teaching in China? I could probably save £1k living out there and I’d probably have a lot of fun and learn mandarin ( I already speak French).

1g5qgeg,I think my job hates me because I used FMLA while I had a Parent in hospice.,"I've been working at a highly rated university, and highly donated to one. For the past couple of years it has been in a bad spot ever since the pandemic. The ""Leadership"" in place were hired during those times where they were the ""best"" of a bad situation. We work with a lot of people of many different cultures. I am white, and even I see too many instances of them not know how to work in a multi-cultural environment. I have as spent time temping in hospitals with life and death situations and even in that environment they know how to be respectful.

In the time Ive been there the only improvement ever was getting every other weekend off. But they took that away from us and people hired on those terms to one weekend a month. While ""Leadership"" kept it for themselves.

I've seen black people come in with extensive manager backgrounds and stick around to apply for ""Leadership"" positions only to be passes up by white people hired in a month and bumped up to ""Leadership"" with less experience.

With all the poor ""Leadership"" It cost the University even more money with them not know how to get people out on time. We stay over a hour late daily due to miss management (we've had cooks run the kitchen better). They do not give people breaks and claim one 30min break in a 10 to 11 hour day is enough. This while managers take more than an hour of smoke breaks everyday.

I recently had to go on FMLA to care for family in hospice only to have them say they don't believe it and seemingly hold it against me. Now I get no weekends and they are trying to hold me back on taking classes elsewhere or seeing family. 

There are many conflicts of interest in the University; my ""chef's""  wife works in HR. They have hired other spouses on ""managers"" for rolls they were not qualified for and messed up a lot of peoples pay checks just to have them rewarded to another ""manager"" roll 

I say this to bring up when anyone goes to HR they will call ahead of them and tell them they are just disgruntled employees and even yelling employees on there way to talk to HR ""good Luck"". You would think with the number of people bringing concerns to their attention would matter but no. Not even the amount of people who quit, which is higher than a restaurant that doesn't even have benefits.

I truly feel stuck and the only option I have is to put up with mistreatment, or try to put in my 2 weeks. I hate that I feel I will leave this job that I have been busting my ass for without even a reference.

All I want to to is to be able to work in a non childish work environment where people are treated at least better.

I do not have faith in the ""Leadership"" to ever be able to make things better, especially if they are the reasons everyone quits and we are never fully staffed.  

I am at the point of recording any closed door meetings with me because of how they acted in past cases with the ""executive chef"" trying to start a staring contest with me in his office.

Really I think I just need to leave but I don't like the fact that they will continue to treat good people bad and more than likely hurt. They is an ambulance out back at least once a month and many somewhat elderly people working there.

Im sure I should say more but I know this is too long too read already.

1g5pjjx,Should I stay in management or move back to IC?,"35M, I work in engineering and since 2020 I was promoted to manage a team of 10-15, the size fluctuates but it has never been below 10. Things were going well until this year when many decisions from upper management have been received poorly by my team and the overall morale is in the gutter, however this is not seen on other shifts/teams. Only mine. (I believe it is being felt but not communicated on these other teams.)   
  
Recently I have been hearing about how concerned upper management is about the morale on my team, with veiled comments about how 1 am dealing with it. This is very difficult to deal with since the feedback I receive from my directs is all about upper managements behavior/treatment, when I try to communicate this upward I am met with ""The other teams are not expressing this"".   
  
Here is the main question. My manager recently let me know of an IC engineering role on the same grade as my current role and asked if I was interested. I have worked with this person for many years and am reading between the lines that they are offering me an out and a way back to IC, away from this untenable situation. However I have asked around discreetly and discovered the new IC role is under a person and on a team that are somewhat toxic and extremely disorganized.   
  
Should I attempt to salvage this management role or move back to the IC role that may have greater challenge but also more stress? The IC role is physical and is about conducting experiments, the management role is of course desk based. (not WFH). I am torn and stuck in a pros/cons loop.

1g5nial,company laid off poc and rehired white… i feel discouraged,"title typo, i meant wronged (repost on throwaway) 

I (22f) worked at an independent retailer for two years. The management was rough and most staff stayed on for about 8 months before quitting. When I was hired, the racial demographics of the staff was fairly reflective of the city we live in (50% white), if not a bit more on the POC side. 

In late 2023, the manager that hired me was reassigned for physically assaulting an employee, which is crazy but not incredibly relevant to the story. A new manager (white) as assigned to our store. At the time of the reassignment, there were two black, four asian, one mexican, one middle eastern, and four white employees of all ages (22-75). When the new management, a white woman came in, the company was barely staying afloat and laid off all of their part time workers (April 2024)  on the basis of not being able to afford to pay them. The layoffs were two asian (myself and one other), the one mexican, and the one middle eastern employee. Fast forward two months and another asian quit, one black employee quit, two employees quit, and another white employee was let go. This leaves one asian, one black, and one white employee from the original crew.

Over the past few months I have dropped into the store occasionally and have seen new employees. Back in July, I stopped by and met a new very young female employee and asked her how she was enjoying full time at the store, to which she told me she was actually part time but was planning on going full time soon. This felt weird, but I wrote it off (she was white, but I didn’t really take it into account because it was a one-off; maybe they just didn’t like me and used lay-offs as an excuse, though it is a bit ridiculous as I was good at my job). Recently I stopped by again because I had an interview nearby. When I went in, I saw three young white girls working the front, and two white men in the back (one young, one older). Also there were my two old coworkers, both POC, and the white manager. When I finally took notice of how different the demographics were, I asked one of my old coworkers about it. I asked if there were any part timers and she told me there were three and that she also felt it was weird they rehired so white. After the old crew left for varying reasons, they rehired an all white staff (with the exception of one Filipino who I did not meet). So, the only POC left on the staff are the people that were hired by the old manager and the one new Filipino guy.

Once I realized this, I looked back and realized that all of corporate seemed to be white as well. When I was working there, we used to have displays celebrating all different cultures that rotated out every few weeks, but it seems like they stopped doing this. If this were the only odd thing, I would’ve written it off, but paired with the layoffs/rehiring it felt kind of icky. All the POC employees always felt there was a micro aggressive air about the company as a whole, but we (at least I) didn’t deem it to be enough to justify quitting (I love the book industry).

I guess what I’m wondering is if this feels weird to anyone else. I don’t plan on taking any action or confronting anyone about this, it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth and I am looking for validation. I talked to one of the other POC ex-employees and they also said it felt weird (they also had always felt the company was racist anyway). I guess I could be missing part of the story, but I’m not sure what context would be relevant. 

Is it ok for me to feel sad or am I being dramatic… thought?

edit: it could be argued that the layoffs were due to a palestinian display that was put up in june 2023 by our palestinian coworker (we work in a store that sells a certain type of media format). after october 7, we had threats called into the store and general harassment of employees due to people not believing that the display was up before the event. Myself and two of the other people who were laid off (both middle eastern and happened to be part time) stood up for the display. 5 or so more employees also advocated for the display, but weren’t part time. management also had plenty of opportunities to take it down and pointedly did not. They then made an israel display as well. If this was the reason why they laid us off, then they lied about it being because we were part time. That would also not explain why they hired new white part timers and full timers above the threshold of the racial ratio in the area. As previously mentioned, our former (white) manager physically assaulted one of the employees of color and is still with the company but has just been transferred to a different location. If we were to assume that advocating for palestine (though not letting it interfere with how we treat customers, receive complaints, and refraining from sharing any opinions about the situation in conversations with customers… we literally just thought the display should stay up as it was up before october 7) is worse than physical assault. This would also be racist. Since then, a coworker has advocated to put up displays celebrating cultural holidays like we previously did, only to be met with lukewarm responses.  The industry we are in is also infamous for being a white man’s field, only recently has it been expanding.",throwaway7252122914,0,0.20000000298023224,5,1729159948,2024-10-17 10:12:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g5nial/company_laid_off_poc_and_rehired_white_i_feel/,10,2024

1g5mjla,From biotech startups and R&D to architecture and fabrication to… feeling a bit stuck in my next career move..,"I’m 32M, based in the Netherlands, and yeah - the title kinda says it. I’m feeling a bit stuck in terms of job market and finding a position that either compensates at a level I’m satisfied with (€2800-3500/mo), is challenging to the degree of stimulating growth of skills and personal development, and/or is generally non mediocre.

I moved to the Netherlands at 28 after being burned out from a tragic start up experience that really took the wind out of my sails. Got the energy back up, studied architecture while consulting in start ups, prototyping, and reforestation before finding my way into the biggest or second biggest name in architecture within 3 years. 

I started building a department that was in charge of producing models, mock ups, and soon product prototypes but had no support from management - which inevitably burned me out and I got some gnarly vertigo as a symptom of long covid. It took me around a year to recover, and thankfully I’m at around 95% again, but in the interim they kicked me out of the company… borderline illegally for the NL but I have no recourse unfortunately. At the time, I was just scared about my basic functioning so couldn’t really think straight.

I’ve had enough savings and some people offering me work in the interim, which has helped me keep things together, but I really feel aimless. I’ve gotten offers at some relatively large companies, but the work culture just feels so mundane - so office space with a dull Dutch twist and it’s incredibly unmotivating.

Anyway, I’ve got an arrange of skills from making functional prototypes and architecture models, CAD, open source hardware from tensile machines to CNCs and 3D printers, molecular and micro bio, some lab hardware build experience specific to PCR, people skills, a bit of sales, some biz dev, some comms and some emarketing experience from 2017-2020; which I’m not sure really counts anymore.

I feel a bit all over the place and looking to set a clear path that feels like there is room for growth again.. I feel I have the parts for doing something that would be fulfilling and lucrative, but not sure how to align them and honestly a bit scared to take a bold step because of what happened in the architecture space.

Anyone have any suggestions? 😅",Ok-Significance-5047,1,1.0,1,1729155676,2024-10-17 09:01:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g5mjla/from_biotech_startups_and_rd_to_architecture_and/,10,2024
1g5mf7m,Finish school ASAP vs Try for a better school?,"Hey, I'm currently 25 and I'm feeling divided here.

Brief summary of my life here is
- Went to art school for a year
- took a gap year because of mental health issues
- got married in order to get US residency
- green card processing took 2.5 years. In that mean time couldn't get a job or start a 4year school. During that time I was able to overcome past trauma and worked out, lost 20lbs
- realized I could still get an associates and studied 2 years worth of courses within 1 with a 4.0GPA
- got my green card this year and applied to multiple high tier schools for the fall
- got assualted, physically and mentally spiraled, had to move, couldn't send in my supplementation materials

So, my GPA probably tanked from the 2 classes that I probably failed last semester, but I still now have 60ish credits. The competitive schools that I've planned to apply will only accept your application if they deem that you can stay for at least four semesters.

The question:
At this point would be worth it to...
A. Take my losses and find any 4 year for the spring term to graduate ASAP then get a job
B. Wait the year to reapply for the higher tier schools to see it it'll work.
C. Something else

Anyhow, thanks in advance for any advice.

1g5ltzm,"Am I being played? Copywriter doing the work of 3 people, no promotion in sight. ","I’ve been hired as a copywriter for over a year, but for 9 months now, I’ve taken on the responsibilities of a social media manager— without a title change or salary adjustment. 

I’m writing, posting, strategizing, tracking performance, handling content for multiple accounts, managing freelancers, art direction, acting as the head of the department, and now even expected to craft content for the CEO's account. 

Every time I bring up the need for a contract or pay change, I get told we’ll “revisit it later,” that ""i'm being too impatient"" and ""to do the work now, reward will come later"" but it’s been months, and nothing changes.

To make it worse, they keep dangling the possibility of growth if the company expands ""if we grow, you grow!!"", but I’ve already proven I can handle a larger role. I’m beyond burned out and feel like I’m being strung along.

On top of that, I’ve always kept freelance clients from LinkedIn. I promote myself and my services there because I enjoy freelancing and want to build my own career. I haven’t signed a non-compete, but my boss asked me to stop promoting myself because it makes his company look weak—like I’m an unhappy employee. He also told me not to reveal that I’m based in Asia because it might stir doubts about data safety with his Western clients since my country is considered “third world.” The irony? He’s an immigrant from the same country but now runs his business in the U.S.

Our Asia team has to work in an office (which is only free because it’s owned by a shareholder), while the team abroad gets to work from home. When I asked if I could work remotely too, he told me it’s impossible. So, I proposed freelancing for him instead. I prefer freelancing and want the flexibility to grow my own business, but he keeps saying no. Funny enough, when I pitched my freelance offer with a reasonable contract, he said he’d sign it right away because it’s better for him—he’d get high-quality work and pay less. He added that the current arrangement is better for *me* because if the company grows, I’ll have played a big part in it. Basically, he’s left it up to me to decide if I value “convenience” over this supposed opportunity.

Yesterday, I told him I’d made up my mind and I want to switch to freelancing, but once again, he said he’s “not in a position to make that change right now.” It’s laughable at this point.

I’m seriously considering quitting, focusing on my freelance career, and launching my own copywriting agency. This company is manipulative, and I feel like staying here is just closing doors on my own career growth. Should I cut my losses and go all in on freelancing?",whatyasaybud,3,1.0,0,1729152274,2024-10-17 08:04:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g5ltzm/am_i_being_played_copywriter_doing_the_work_of_3/,10,2024

It's a combination of knowing that I'm not a good fit, I can't handle change without spiraling into paralyzing anxiety and just overall burnout from being a working mom. The job itself involved managing multiple stakeholders from different cultures, and I just could not get through the day without crumbling from stress. It was a huge step outside of my comfort zone, and before joining I didn't have the space to do some internal work to prepare myself mentally and physically (i.e. no rest from previous jobs, full time and one part time that weren't any less anxiety-inducing)
I feel so so embarrassed quitting after my bosses had taken me out for introductory lunches, and overall being so welcoming. I just don't want to do my notice period anymore from the shame and am tempted to just disappear on everyone, just like I have many times in my life.

1g5jzvs,MBA or data science ,"It's been more than 1.5 years since I graduated in Mechanical Engineering. I initially wanted to do an MBA, but I thought doing an MS would be more related to my field, even though I wasn’t really into it. I thought I would figure things out later, so I applied to colleges in Germany. However, I wasn’t satisfied with the colleges and courses I got into.

Now, I’ve made a firm decision to drop my plans of going abroad, and I’m focusing on either pursuing an MBA or a Data Science-related course. But again, I’m in a dilemma. Given my circumstances and the fact that I’ve already lost 1.5 years, should I do the MBA directly now, or should I get a job, work for a while, and then plan for an MBA?

However, since there’s been such a long gap, I don’t think any company would hire me easily. So, I also thought about doing a Data Science course, but again, they might not prefer freshers either. Additionally, I have no background in coding, and while I’ve heard that there’s career growth in Data Science, I’m unsure if it's the right path for me.

I genuinely don’t know what to do. I’ve become indecisive, and everyone at home is worried about me. This is a tough phase in my life, one I didn’t expect.

I got injured at work and worker's insurance are paying to retrain me and cover costs until I find new employment, they've given me 3 options (possibly 4) based on my previous experience, previous salary, and university degree.

Those options are:

-construction estimator
-health and safety inspector
-construction project manager
(and possibly, if I put in a special request,)
-academic counsellor

Does anyone have experience in any of these occupations? Any advice as the best way to go about assessing/comparing them?



For more information: I live in Vancouver, Canada but am willing to relocate. I have 7 years experience working in construction (although no official training or red seal) and a bachelor's degree in psychology. 

I like solving problems and working with people; I excel at math but may find it boring if that was all I had to do.

I'm not really leaning one way or the other on any of the occupations so am currently assuming it's probably smartest to pick the job with the most valuable training offered by insurance and/or the highest starting salary (as insurance will end coverage as soon as I get a new job).

So I’ve just started a job as a carpenter in a construction abt 2 weeks ago. I already have 5 years of experience. And the carpenter position has 3 levels . I’m level 2. 

Then in comes a new guy today. (My helper) First ever time working any blue collar job. So I wouldn’t even put him on level 1. Doesn’t have any skills, no experience nothing. And we’re talking and he tells me how much he’s getting payed. Which happens to be the same I’m getting payed. I didn’t tell him that part but like it didn’t feel right with me . Still doesn’t . 

He has ZERO experience, no related skills. I have 5 years of experience , many many skills, I’ve had my own apprentices at age 18 . So I know I have good value and I’m a hard worker. What do I do ? I want to say something to the higher up’s but I’m scared I’ll get ridiculed or worse. 
 
I accepted this  starting wage because it seemed fair and thought if I just prove myself to them that then I’ll be able to quickly up the pay. But a complete newbie gets the same treatment as someone with 5 years??? I’m really teaching this kid how to wrap up hoses, he doesn’t know ANYTHING. I’m literally teaching him the basics . And besides my blue collar work we have roughly the same resume 

I just want to understand if the bosses think this is fair .But idk. I’m feeling useless and the situation is really fucking with my mental state rn . Im recovering from addiction , facing many hardships. And this just made me feel worthless. I was proud of myself when I got this job . But what’s the point if I’m seen as a nobody  
 
Should I look around for other jobs? Stick it out and see if they value me any?(seems unlikely since they have so many employees that are already in higher positions than me ) should I talk to management? Will it be a bad look for me ? Will I seem greedy? I really need the money . I have too much going on, at first I was okay with that starting amount because I was starting with a new company and they seemed like they were impressed with my resume . And I know I’m worth more. 

I feel like anything I’ll do will be wrong. And I know I’ll hold some resentment because of this .

(USA),"Hi so I recently got a job offer and signed the letter with a proposed start date of 11/4. After that, HR emails me about starting the onboarding process which includes a background check. I fill out the background check last Friday (10/11) and haven’t heard back from HR about additional onboarding steps.

Should I reach out? It’s been technically 3 business days since I submitted my background check (I guess 2 since Columbus Day was in Monday but many corporate offices still work on that day). I’m concerned because the two week mark prior to my start date is fast approaching (next Monday - 10/21) and I don’t feel comfortable resigning and providing a 2-weeks notice to my current employer without confirmation that the background check has been cleared. This issue has made me particularly anxious because I’m moving cross country for this job and I don’t feel comfortable making concrete plans and decisions about things like housing and rent without knowing my background check is cleared.

Also I have a clean record and my resume is completely accurate.

1g5hjut,Please help me.,"I am in the process of a career transition.

I have worked in film/TV in southern california for the last several years. I have coordinated and managed, done an unbelievable amount of administrative work, I have killed myself for these jobs over the years.

Since the strikes, the entire industry has collapsed.

So I am pivoting. I am looking for new work, in a new array of industries, almost all administrative. Office Assistant, Admin Assistant, Executive Assistant, Project Manager, Project Coordinator, you name it. I KNOW in my heart of hearts that I am massively overqualified for ALL of these jobs — but I am desperate.

I tailor my resumé to each and every job application. I have a well-written cover letter. I have had BOTH reviewed multiple times with good responses. I am using the key words in the job descriptions to convince the algorithm to push me through - I am applying 5-10 times a day, at least. 

I know this job market is absolutely crushed right now, and I know I’m not the only one. But my finances are absolutely fucked at this point, the industry’s collapse has also destroyed SO MANY lives — hundreds of thousands of people are out of work and have been since early 2023.

I was very lucky to be employed for 5 months of this year but that was it. Which of course prompted my decision to change. 

But I am fighting the most intense depression, and live in a constant state of panic. How can I not have even gotten ONE phone call? ONE interview? Just ONE reach out from all of these places?

I got to a point where I was applying to Target, Petsmart, etc. Not a single call. 

I am losing my mind and I feel so alone. My boyfriend is incredibly supportive and has already helped me with my rent once. I cannot fucking bear to need help once more. Unemployment is a complete joke, I don’t know how anyone is supposed to survive in this hellscape on a few hundred bucks a week, and I am out of options.

Even my old dog walking app that used to get me work while recovering from the pandemic now gets me exactly ZERO jobs. 

I don’t know what to do. I am capable of SO MUCH. But these companies now force you through these AI systems and all these hoops and how on EARTH is someone ever supposed to stand a chance?

1g5gz4e,Can indians on work visas in the US eventually shift to freelancing and being self employed if their skillset and credentials allows them to? ,"I recently received a job offer from the U.S. that is willing to sponsor work visa for a skill based role. Although I have built a good reputation and am well known in my industry, I’ve only been in my current domain for two years. It pays well for an entry level job in the country , will act as a means of legal entry into the country , but I’m concerned about the scope for long term growth. I plan to explore new opportunities during or after the first year as my credentials and skillset do give me an edge and allow me to find better prospects with ease. My line of work also allows me to operate by myself and thanks to being well recognised in my industry , I understand I can make 1.5x the pay this company is willing to offer me with half the effort and a healthier work life balance , So I was wondering whether indians on work visas can eventually shift to freelancing or be selfemployed in the US if their skillset and credentials allow them to ?

I think I’ve realized I’ve really started to dislike it. I’m having trouble finding motivation in my day to day and it’s starting to impact my performance.  I was getting by being “new” but now I’m not so new. I would like to find a new role potentially but my fiancé (soon to be married in a week) is at a company that is going bankrupt and could have a wind down? TBD on exact timing of that so he is looking for a new job while at his current. 

We live together and I feel like it would be more stressful for us both starting new roles and it really limits the other persons search geographically as we would be willing to move if he got a really good offer.

1g5gob7,"Feeling stuck, undervalued, and underappreciated","This is a snapshot of my professional career; I obviously cannot hash out every detail, but I will try my best to make it concise.

I have been in the finance industry for 8 years now within the Kansas City, MO metro area. I worked in banking for the first two years after graduation and for the last 6 for a small family-owned financial planning firm. I say small by the number of employees which is around 15 but in our large independent clearing firm we are in the top producing quintile.

When I began working for the firm, I figured it was a way to get my feet wet and do what I have always wanted to and get my degree in. Because I was so green, I sold myself shorts and chose to pursue the current employer because I liked the culture, values, and the work itself. When interviewed in discussion of compensation I gave a range of $35K-$45K, they offered $35K and again for the above reasons I accepted hoping with experience and time there was enormous growth opportunity and scaled pay. Now coming up on my 6-year anniversary after working my ass off and 12 new hires later (many of whom I trained extensively) and I have little to show for it. My salary is $55K, this was done incrementally with annual 5% raises as this was their ‘standard’ and last year my largest increase from 48K to 55K. My health insurance for myself and family is fully paid for but honestly my deductible and coverage are awful and seems to change every year so what was covered previously is not anymore. They also pay for my phone and have usually gotten some kind of bonus each year totaling between $500-1,000 annually as well as profit sharing around the same amount. I have a 401k option which I can only afford to contribute $50 to monthly.

My title is Analyst, and my work duties consist of responsibilities that most would expect an advisor to perform including financial planning, client communication, portfolio analysis/construction, trading, back-end business metric analysis, and more. I have improved countless workflows and processes since being here. I write half the emails my lead-advisor sends to the clients to explain scenarios and complex strategies.  
  
I have never brought it up in conversation, but I know that each of the salaried hires have been offered a higher starting salary than what I was getting paid (The range has fallen between $60-95K base salary pay). Each began with the first months of paid employment studying for their industries exams to become IARs (SIE, S7, and S66) I luxury I was not afforded, I have passed my SIE and 7 (after 3 attempts) by studying in the evenings after work because it was never made a priority to give me time to study during working hours because I had responsibilities that couldn’t fall to the wayside. I have not yet had the time to devote to taking S66 but intend to in Feb during our slow period. On numerous occasions I have expressed my desire to my two bosses (additional context they are married) to be fully registered and they are supportive, but no effort has been made to give me the time to do so like others. I am in some strange limbo where I am too integral to the everyday function of the company to be given time away from regular business but not important enough that they want to put me in a position to advance myself within the framework of the company.

My bosses talk about career path and progression to the entire team but never check in with me one on one. It feels like all my one-on-one interactions lately with my bosses are only calling my actions into question or some sort of correction I need to make but not necessarily disciplinary. Yet I am constantly being told thanks for my help, or for problem solving complex situations. My coworkers who have ‘higher rankings’ than me come to me daily with questions on regulations, processes, compliance, etc. I am someone who everyone goes to for help when the bosses are not available. I am really trying not to sound conceded, but I am damn good at my job. And yet no pay corrections, or title promotions in my time with the company. The last two years during my annual review I have requested a pay correction with evidence of my value to the company only to be told I am receiving a fair raise and my compensation is comparable to my position within the industry all in all it is estimated around $64K in total value and I feel with my years of experience my base salary should be at least $72K + benefits.

Our company is doing really well, and I truthfully love what I do and the people I work with but at what point do I say enough is enough? I feel I’ve reached a crossroads seeing little room for further opportunity, maybe things would look up if I got my 66 but the track record seems to tell me a different story, and the company has changed so much in these years it no longer feels quite like the small company I started for. The Atta boys and recognition I once received regularly do not come around but rarely anymore so even the emotional morale boosting has fallen to the wayside. I have decided to brush up on my resume and start to pursue interviews with other firms, companies, or industries altogether in anticipation and preparation for my end of year annual performance review. At the very least to provide concrete evidence of my worth and negotiate a higher salary with proof of job offers. I am fine with working in a corporate culture, but I want to be paid fairly for it. Am I asking too much, is the current job market even worth testing? Or have I been my own biggest detriment by my own complacency and being a team-player for too long?

1g5fkhb,What do I do about burnout,"I need help figuring out what to do about burnout. I have been feeling depressed, anxious and have lost the ability to feel pleasure in life due to being overwhelmed.

I am currently working a full time job with hybrid schedule. The office is an hour away and I take my dog to daycare when I go which adds about 15 minutes each way. Its 40 hours a week and 2 days are from home. With the commute its about 48 hours a week. 

I run a small art gallery with some friends and its very odd hours but id say it averages 4 hours of work a week. This is a passion project with no intention of profit but it feels more like work.

I also started a side gig with a friend that I truly enjoy but I have no experience in running a business and we currently make no money. Its about 15 hours a week. Id like to invest more time but Im pretty tired already and feel Id need a lot more time to really have an impact on the business. 

Im in a new relationship but i dont have much free time so I only see her once a week. Its hard to really feel connected to someone at this rate which bums me out even more. 

I own my home and have to do maintenance and cleaning (like everybody) and feel this takes up all my free time. I do go to the gym and try to make time for friends once a week but I cant really enjoy these things because I know I need to start preparing for the next bit of work. 

To me it feels like a series of never ending chores, just trying to keep my head up to make it to the next one. The few hours a week I do have I am so drained that I just waste them doomscrolling. The job that pays is the one I care about least so quitting seems like a bad idea but it also takes up the majority of my time. I feel so lost on what to do and have been terribly depressed. Therapy and medication have helped but it just allows me to fight through, it doesn’t bring any joy. 

Does anyone have any advice for how to handle this or have you been in a similar situation? Thanks in advance. ",94871,2,1.0,1,1729128654,2024-10-17 01:30:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g5fkhb/what_do_i_do_about_burnout/,10,2024

1g5f297,Feeling very scared regarding my future,"I have a master's degree and over five years of experience IT, focusing my career on Technical Support roles. I was recently laid off and have been struggling to land interviews.

I worked hard to progress within my previous company, but I was mostly unsuccessful due to post-COVID challenges and company downsizing. Recently, every job I look for is closely related to my past experience, but they all require specific experience with tools I haven’t used before. These tools aren’t complicated, and given my technical background, I know I can easily learn them on the job.

To improve my chances, I’ve been earning certifications to make myself more credible and boost my confidence when applying for jobs. I now have five or six certifications that should help me stand out. However, many of these jobs are asking for 5 to 10+ years of experience with the very tools I’m trying to certify in.

The certifications I’m pursuing aren’t easy, but it feels like the world doesn’t care about them. It only cares about experience. So I’m starting to wonder what the point of doing these courses is if companies aren’t going to hire me because I don’t have years of experience with that tool.

1g5f0lz,I Made a HUGE Mistake ,"Long story short I've been miserable on my $100K a year in-office job....""lean and mean"" work culture, high stress, long hours/overtime, bad work/life balance....I had been searching for a new job for over a year with almost no luck....the job market has been really bad. Finally an opportunity presented itself....a fully remote position in a brand new industry (non-profit) but there was a catch....it was a $35K paycut and I would've gone from $100K a year to $65K a year. Now I had that type of salary in the past so I knew I could get by but saving for a home or retirement was out of the question on that salary...and I am in my early 40s now so I need to start planning for the future....plus friends and family members thought I was insane for even considering taking such a steep paycut....ultimately I didn't take the job. Everybody said to stick it out a little longer where I'm at until I find something that pays a little closer to what I currently make.

Now I'm having serious regrets....I am more miserable than ever and I've even been calling in sick because I'm so burned out and I dread going into work each day.  I barely want to get out of bed in the morning and I feel like this isn't going to end well. I may end up with no job at the end of this....I should've went with my instincts and took the other job....maybe it could've been a stepping stone to something better in a new industry....

1g5dioa,What would be a good career transition for a mobile home park manager/maintenance employee?,"I've worked as a community manager/maintenance for 8 years. I quit during COVID and quickly found out that a wide variety of employers consider my skillset worthless(I was told this to my face during interviews). I bounced between a few temp jobs until I went crawling back to my old boss and he rehired me. Recently I've felt that I just hate every aspect of my job. I don't like playing babysitter to a bunch of tweakers. I can't stand the stress of being blamed when the park isn't at 100% occupancy. I absolutely hate the manual labor aspects of the job. It's extra stressful because my housing is provided by my employer, so if I quit or get fired then I'll be homeless.

&nbsp;

My typical manager duties are processing rental applications, answering the phones and responding to emails, processing rent payments, reading utility meters, preparing and signing leases, doing park inspections and writeups for rules violations, and preparing and distributing rent statements and newsletters.

&nbsp;

On the maintenance side of things, I pick up trash every day, do the landscaping including mowing, weedeating, leafblowing, trimming bushes and trees, spraying weeds, cleaning the bathrooms and laundry room, painting, doing emergency repairs for minor utility issues including water lines, sewer lines, and electrical. I've also helped with a variety of construction projects over the years doing things like tearing down mobilehomes and RVs, remodeling homes, building fences, fixing floors, replacing door frames, etc. Whenever my boss is in town we work 12 hour days doing whatever arbitrary project he invents to try to make the park more appealing. I'm not sure why I even bothered listing these duties since manual labor is absolutely what I want to stay away from.

I get free rent and utilities here on top of a decent salary, so I know I won't be able to make nearly as much money with an average unskilled job.

I feel trapped. I had a receptionist job that I loved except they made me work 60 hours a week and I got burnt out eventually because they wouldn't let me read or browse the internet on my down time.

Currently, I have three options on the table:

1. Join Foxconn as an FATP/MFG/LINE-ASST, earning around 22k per month. The work week is 6 days with rotational shifts. The job offers benefits like a two-way cab service and meals at a very low cost (5 INR per meal).

2. Pursue an M.Tech at a government college (JNTUA College of Engineering, Pulivendula) in Andhra Pradesh, which is 3 hours away from my hometown. There are no tuition fees since I secured a seat after clearing an entrance exam. However, I would need to dedicate 1-2 years before seeking a job.

3. Pursue an M.Tech at a private college (Madanapalle Institute of Technology and Sciences), which is only 10 minutes from my home. Again, no tuition fees are required since the M.Tech program is restarting after 5 years. This college has a better reputation than the government option and a strong track record for placements. There’s also a chance of getting an internal job with a stipend of 20k per month, but the catch is I can’t quit the course if I get an outside job during my studies.

1g5cpxa,Am I just wondering if the grass is greener?,"Hi everyone, looking for some advice as I'm struggling to figure out how I feel regarding a potential new role at the company I work for. Mid-30s, UK, been at the company for many years in a couple of different jobs, they've always treated me well and invested in me and I've always worked hard for them in return.

I'm pretty settled in my current role (other than a bit of imposter syndrome which I'm working on), salary is great, ticks a lot of boxes and from an overall career perspective it's something that I could do for a long time. However after some not insignificant health issues and general burn out, this year I've found myself struggling to get motivated, reprioritising how I want to spend some of my limited energy, and fundamentally questioning whether I really want to stick with my career long-term.

To complicate things further (although I fully acknowledge that it's a nice problem to have!) an opportunity to apply for a new internal role has unexpectedly come up which would be a good fit in terms of my experience and strengths. The hiring manager actually reached out to me to give me a heads up, and we discussed what the role is likely to entail which was useful.

I think most of my peers would view it as a bit of a step backwards in my career (backed up by the fact that it would be a \~20% pay cut, although still enough money for me) with fewer opportunities for progression and arguably marginally less job security. I think there would probably be a fairly even trade-off in terms of things I find challenging / frustrating and the things I (at least used to) enjoy, which is why I'm so on the fence ... if I was confident that I would definitely enjoy it more or it could pull me out of this slump, it'd be simple!

Ordinarily I'd say there's no harm in applying regardless, as even if I was offered the job it might be an easier decision either way and I wouldn't have to accept it, but given that it's an internal position I'm hesitating as I don't want to unnecessarily rock the boat or waste anyone's time. I would also want to speak to my current manager first to give them a heads up - while I have a good relationship with them, there is a lot of disruption and pressure in the team currently for various reasons (although as far as I can tell nothing that's likely to impact me directly) so I'm not sure how it would be received at the moment.

1g5cchd,What is the current state of lying on resumes for entry-level jobs?,"I'm 27 and have a bad history of work. Unemployed for almost 2 years now. Dropped out of college (twice). Have mostly worked cash gigs for people I grew up with- landscaping, snow plowing, construction, pizza delivery etc. Done a lot of doordash, worked at a smoke shop one summer, a valet another. Never built any relationships at any of these or have any connections left to vouch for me.

My last job was at a recreational dispensary and I loved it and thought I could work there forever. 8 months in I got diagnosed with an auto-immune disease and my lifestyle changed in a snap, I didn't have any doctors and was living by myself so I ended up crashing out. Quit the job a year in and burnt the bridge on the way out. I've done a lot of work on myself since then in getting support to make sure I don't crash out again.

Basically everything I have to say about myself is unverifiable and makes me look bad either way. If I was a human reading my resume I'd say this guy sounds like a bullshitter. I have gotten job offers for a mail room (that was last year) and then more recently Starbucks, Amazon delivery, and a moving company. But I said no because I really wanted to find a remote job. Now I'll do just about anything but don't want to limit myself just to starbucks or amazon

I'm sure many hirers would view working retail at a dispensary as my last job as a red flag and automatic nono. So why not just lie to make myself sound better? Why not fill in the gaps in my resume. Make up a name of a landscaping company and say I worked there 3 years. Why not just say I worked at Starbucks or amazon already. I'm not applying for jobs that require degrees or skills. I just want to give myself a chance to get an interview. I'm not the same person that my real resume shows.

1g5b70i,"Role keeps changing at a small company, and I'm frustrated.","Sorry for the massive essay - TL;DR at the end!

I currently work as an administrator for a small medical practice (not primary care and not MD’s, we are a specialty), and as you can imagine it’s hard out there to be a single point provider in the current US healthcare system. When I was hired, it was just the owner and I working the practice for a few months. The clinic was brand new and we were slow – working a lot on lead generation and establishing practices and policies for the company. I started out at the front, with every intention that I would move up with the practice as it grew.

I had left a very comfortable front desk job for this because I wanted something more fulfilling in a field I was passionate about, and felt strongly I had to put in the work and push to get further ahead and this would be an opportunity to build up and get out of a customer facing role. My boss is a ~unique~ individual and working with them has been really difficult for me from day 1. Without getting into too much, I don’t care for them as a person (not all bad, but it’s tough), they are very reactive, and put the clinic through constant changes that I struggle to keep up with in addition to a lot more.

It’s been a rough couple of years, due to various factors – some out of my owners control like issues with production staff, but many within that they can’t see their part in. I’m definitely the right hand at this clinic, a go-to person for our staff, and integral to key operations.

In the summer of last year, I began to break down. I was doing almost everything administratively and operationally, and hit a breaking point in dealing with our owner. Crying before work type stuff. We did have some bandwidth to hire a part time front desk, but she created more work for me at the end of the day and she had to be let go. Then our billing specialist needed to step back, so I took over verifying insurances in addition to my admin work, and was able to step away from the front once we got a great front desk member.

There ended up being changes with the front office and how my boss chose to go about implementing them was very unprofessional and I was extremely frustrated. At that time I felt that my time here had run it’s course. I am a person that does very well with lots of consistency, and I was honest that I didn’t think I had the mental or professional bandwidth to keep up with all the changes, the staffing issues, and constant reactivity to everything. I attempted to give my notice, owner panicked, we came to an agreement on some compromises and I chose to stay it out.

 There has been significant changes within the last 6 months to how we operate. We have been unable to generate enough leads to support the practice at the scale it is currently at and have been unable to motivate the front desk staff to “sell” to patients, so much so that that that task was taken from them. We reduced to one part time front desk, with the idea that providers would have to step it up and help out more in operations, with things like cleaning, checking in patients, etc. Of course that didn’t happen, and it falls on me to do that support even with my own tasks.

Then, not long ago, I was taken aside and told my role was changing and essentially to take it or leave it. Many of the operational things I was doing and had been doing was going to be removed from my plate, so I could full time answer phones and focus on marketing. I’m not a marketing professional but filled that need here from the beginning, and did what I could as best I could but did not feel it was appropriate for me as a full time role. The way it was it was presented to me felt like a slap in the face. It would also mean losing the concessions we had made to keep me prior. I again attempted to give notice, she claimed this was all a misunderstanding, freaked out, and it was quite rough that week. We ended up coming to an agreement in order to keep me, but I was really frustrated. I had spoken to several people in my life who were aware of my frustrations with my boss and clinic about what happened, and every single person told me to simply quit.

Now, we’re at a point where scaling back is inevitable. Despite being very busy myself with current tasks (as nothing I was doing prior came off, despite a “new position”, emphasis on different tasks, and assurance for help from the owner) we are likely going to have to lay off our Receptionist. My owner said this would put me back at the front, which I really do not want to do. I am a career administrative professional for 10+ years, and am in my 30’s and have been fighting to find a back office role for years. I find constant customer interactions draining, and remember what it was like when I was doing it all myself not long ago. This will also take away the things that had kept me previously, and there is no long term plan to get me away from the front desk.

Again, everyone close to me is saying not to do it and quit. I feel like some stuff at work you just have to deal with, but this feels excessive. The answer is always ""we have to do what we have to keep the practice running"" but it's me who has to change roles and pick up the slack. I let my boss know that is not really something I'm interested in and certainly wouldn't do it long term, but who knows what that means. I have no confidence that my work load will balance as the providers here have never listened to the owner when they are asked to step it up and help out.

I feel extremely guilty leaving someone who views me very positively when I know how greatly it will impact the clinic, and she did give me good opportunities. She has routinely said I am the only employee here worth their salt. Me leaving would change a lot and I don't know how they would proceed without the level of support I provide and that is what is holding me back. I suppose I'm looking for unbiased advice on how to handle this, or feedback that I'm not just being a baby about this. I know that's impossible to tell from a vagueish reddit post, but I did my best with my essay.

TL;DR: My role at a small company is continuously changing in directions I don't like, I don't care for my boss at all and have attempted to quit twice. Necessary changes would mean going from being back office support to back at the front desk, which is a backslide move in my career as well as losing perks. But I feel quilty leaving at a pivotal time and it feels like I'm ""abandoning"" my boss and that is how she will view it too. Looking for unbiased opinions on how to address this or if I am over reaching.",NicestTikiBar19,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1729115629,2024-10-16 21:53:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g5b70i/role_keeps_changing_at_a_small_company_and_im/,10,2024
1g5awzi,Agonizing over my decision. Is it worth changing companies for $78k to $100k salary? ,"I've been at my current company for about 4 years - 2 are with my current team. My core competencies are SQL, Data Viz tools like SQL, and some light automation / programming experience with Python, R, etc.

I love my boss and my team. They value me. My boss allowed me to relocate to be closer to family just as the company began to slam down RTO. I work extremely hard, have gotten good feedback and have grown quite a bit. I went from 0 SQL knowledge to really being able to run with ad-hoc. My one daily issue is my boss is a bottleneck. Everyone needs him. So as I'm trying to learn new tables, I'm frequently lost because vital considerations for my queries aren't accounted for because the only one who knows about them in the company is him. So can often feel like a deer in the headlights. My teammates feel the same.

What I hate is the corporate culture. New leadership came in and it's a lot. We have a town hall every three weeks. There's a lot of executives leaving, which I guess is to be expected. Benefits like remote work are gone and we get an email each week about some big new change. Every town hall there's some reason why we may or may not get our annual bonus payouts (I've never received my full one). To be honest, it's tiring. But also, I wonder how different it is elsewhere. I look aside from all of it because I do really appreciate my boss.

I just finished grad school - got a MS in Computer Science with a 3.8 GPA. I ended up not loving CS so I pivoted to Data Science, which I enjoyed. Those loans are coming due and will sap all the ""extra"" money I have. I make about $78k - I expect $80k come March. But as the first loans come due + how I've felt sort of underpaid relative to my new skills and education, I put myself out there on the market. I'd say interest has been strong.

Yesterday, I got an offer. 3.7 stars on Glassdoor, where the only concerns I walked away from were layoffs-related. I asked them about this and they said it was a new rule at a client's request, meaning they didn't think it was in the immediate line of fire of layoffs. But my company lays people off too. And the offer is to be a Senior Analyst for $100k. Standard benefits, unlimited PTO, 18 holidays, unlimited sick, some stock options.

Honestly, from a self-worth perspective, I needed this. Just felt nice to hit that benchmark, especially because I spent my entire 20s being lowballed. Now, I have some leverage - I'm not desperate to leave and I continue to have interviews lined up. I had two interviews with these folks- rapid fire panels and they seemed nice. Maybe less ""fun"" than my current team. A little older than me (I'm 29 - I got 40s - 50s vibes), a little more ""buttoned-up,"" but friendly. This is sort of the inverse of where I am now (more laid back, big company name, people take less to be there).

I'm an anxious over-thinker and wonder if I'm underselling this great opportunity. I think I'd have so many less sleepless nights knowing I can put a dent in my student loans and that my quality of life wouldn't suffer. But, I love my boss and my team. And maybe that's not healthy. I'm tired, feel underpaid, and feel there's a really bottleneck to be the analyst I need to be in my role.

It's just a big jump and I'd be starting over and leaving a place where I have a very good reputation. I've never discussed a promotion with them, but don't think it'd happen. Also, this is a fully remote role - which is #1 to me. No offices where I live, no risk of an issue, it's all in my paperwork. Other benefits align where I am now (although the current company is taking away unlimited PTO next year to an hours accrual system). I did ask this job who made me an offer $115k and they declined due to budget reasons. But they went out of their way to say the team thinks I'm excellent. Maybe I can offer part-time to my current employer?

ATLDR; few thoughts...

* Is the jump from $80k - $100k significant enough to start over? Am I really underpaid
* Is there an opportunity to offer my current company my services in a part-time role - just at least maintaining reporting I built out? They've tried to do this in the past with consultants we had on - could I do this for pocket change? Is it common?

Sorry, I know this is a lot. I'm just nervous. Nervous about negotiating salary, whether this is the right move (I think it's just nerves). I didn't get bad vibes from the call, it sounded like a lot of work but I do a lot of work now.

1g54dw8,When is it appropriate to quit your job without another lined up? ,"I am 29 and have been working for the same company for a few years now. The pay isn't great, and combined with my living expenses, it's been difficult to save. What savings I do have are mostly from contract work that paid higher in my mid 20s. It's not a great fit for me and I've been extremely depressed there. I'm not happy in the city where my job is located, either, and I've wanted to relocate for years now. Abusive partner held me back, and I was too lonely and sad and lazy to look for other jobs.

Over the summer, my now ex-boyfriend and ex-roommate physically assaulted me (not the first time, but the first time he left bruises). Then he threatened to destroy my face. So I left the house and stayed with my family, and took FMLA leave for the max time allowed while collecting disability benefits. I got a protective order and he moved out. 

My FMLA period is ending soon, and I have to decide whether to return to my house and job in that city (lonely, low pay, traumatic memories) or to resign, give my landlord 30 days notice, put my stuff in storage, move in with my mom temporarily, and effectively become unemployed. I'm working with a therapist and I may be eligible for longterm disability benefits, but that's up to the insurance company. 

If I go back to work, I know that I will be very sad and lonely. Plus, my ex would know where I live, and there's a chance he'd come back to hurt me. But I would have a job and insurance. I wouldn't have much mobility with minimal ability to save, and I'd be far away from my family for emotional support with limited time off to see them or interview for other jobs. 

If I move in with my mom and quit my job, I wouldn't be paying rent, so I'd be able to save up once I found a job. And in the interim, I would probably qualify for disability benefits. But I wouldn't have a job, and everyone tells you not to quit without another job lined up.

What should I do? In my heart of hearts, I think the right thing to do is to quit. But I don't want to hurt my career with a gap in my resume. Any advice would be greatly appreciated :(

ASD diagnosis at 12y old. IQ of around 120 in case anyone suspects I'm intellectually limited.

My career:

Age 18: Finished high school

Age 18-20: Attempted and failed terribly at higher education twice

Age 20-22: Lived as a NEET for 2 years due to depression (no formal diagnosis or treatment)

Age 22-23: Attempted a bachelor's degree for Applied IT, failed again after 1y (not as hard this time)

Age 23-25: Graduated with an associate's degree for programming (2y) flawlessly

Age 25-26: new job, fired after 1 month, 6-month gap, new job, fired after 1 month (last week)

After getting my degree I went to work at the firm I did my internship at. They said I was a pretty capable programmer and seemed enthousiastic to hire me. However I was exhausted and dealing with mental struggles during this job and got fired without warning after 1 month for 'bad attitude' and vague etiquette-related reasons. After a 6-month gap I got a tech-support adjacent job where I ALSO got fired after 1 month for not very dissimilar reasons (lack of driver's license played a role).

I want to get a decent career going but I can see that with my current profile I'm already seen as damaged goods. As of now I've never managed to cope with a full-time study or job AND perform sufficiently well at it. During those full-time jobs and studies, not getting 8hrs of sleep meant I was not able to focus and perform properly at all. But this was difficult to keep up due to long commute and other responsibilities. No license = public transport = total daily commute of 2-4hrs.

What should I do now? Most software dev applications I get rejected outright because they only want bachelor's or master's degrees. To avoid the exhaustion problem I'm thinking of looking for a part-time arrangement and just dealing with the lower standard of living but is that even something that employers want to consider for a software developer?

* **Family Business:** I have worked in my father’s business for about 3 years, managing sales and trade, making significant progress in both top and bottom lines. I serve as a general manager, overseeing daily activities.
* **NGO Work:** I am the head of research and analysis at a registered NGO.
* **Business Venture:** I co-founded a business research and consulting venture with a friend. Our venture has grown to span India and Europe, and we have completed over 10 projects/internships with AAA-rated companies valued at half a billion dollars.
* **Publications:** I have published two proprietary research articles on the global economy and the semiconductor industry.
* **Resume Highlights:** My resume includes 4 live projects, 2 social initiatives, and 6 internships, all coupled with strong letters of recommendation from well-established firms countrywide.
* **Internship:** Over the summer, I interned at a leading asset/wealth management firm for three months.
* **Academic Background:** In high school, I scored 93% and 97% in my ICSE and ISC exams, respectively. However, my college grades are around 6-7 CG due to strict marking and personal challenges, including the loss of three grandparents within 10 months last year, which led to severe depression.

Despite my academic challenges, I have focused on building a strong professional profile. My goal is to get into buy-side roles, preferably in asset management. I am determined to complete the CFA, FRM, and CAIA certifications, and eventually pursue an M7 MBA by the time I am 25-26. I aspire to join a BB firm by age 22.

My recent CFA setback has shaken my confidence. I tried to multitask and prepared for the exam with only 40 days of study, which I now realize was a mistake. I am committed to better preparing for my next attempt.

I am seeking specific advice on:

1. How can I recover from this setback and stay motivated for my next CFA Level 1 attempt?
2. Are my career aspirations of joining a BB firm and completing multiple certifications still realistic given my current situation of failure and disappointment?
3. What steps can I take to strengthen my profile and secure a role in Mumbai next year at a decent firm?

1g4xyeu,Is a career in Business Intelligence/Data Analytics a good option in Canada over the next few years?,"Hi everyone! I’m a 26-year-old male from Brazil (South America) with a degree in Production Engineering (similar to Industrial Engineering) and experience in Sales Operations, Risk Management, and Business Intelligence. My plan is to study in Canada with the main aim of securing a job and eventually settling there. I’ve been exploring programs in Business Intelligence/Data Analytics to apply for in 2026 or 2027.

That said, after chatting with others on this platform and going through various threads about the current IT job market in Canada, I’ve seen that many areas within IT are becoming overcrowded. Layoffs have been increasing, and the Canadian government recently announced that they intend to further restrict the number of international students entering the country next year. There’s also the issue of some colleges being labeled as ""diploma mills,"" which has raised concerns about whether pursuing BI or Data Analytics is a viable path, as landing a job might be quite tough.

Given all this, could anyone offer insights into whether there will still be demand for BI/Data Analytics roles in the coming years? If so, which colleges would you suggest for such programs?

And if this isn’t the best route, what other fields would better match my background in Production Engineering (or related areas) and offer better job prospects with less competition?

1g4xxw8,Misunderstood my Salary Rate from monthly to daily rate,"I'm currently working as  accounting staff in a company for more than 2 years. I've been promoted in a regular position during my 6 months of work and offered increase since I'm a minimum wage. Now, my company offered me an increase which is a good news for me since I'm a bread winner and my salary was never enough. However, when I was about to sign a contract for my salary adjustment, I found out that I was in daily rate while all this yrs I've thought I am on a monthly rate with paid day off and paid special holidays. The management informed me that we will follow  the contract I've signed upon regularization  and was force to sign the new contract which means agreeing that they will pay me in a daily rate with my new salary. 
One thing Im thankful about, is that they won't charge me for the days that I shouldn't be paid for a year. ( not my fault) 



I don't know what to feel right now, I'm so emotional and can't think straight. I also talked to my manager and he said that they can't do anything since I am in a daily rate before and they can't change it to monthly rate now and that I should be grateful instead that they give me increase( which Im so grateful)He also told me that if I'm not happy with what I'm doing, then I should resign. 

Thinking that it will be 2  months before Christmas and there will be lots of special holidays that I won't get paid anymore makes me  sad... Or I'm just being ungrateful as they said. 

What should I do now?  Should I stay or find other jobs even though it will pay me less. 

Please enlighten me.",rarebluediamond23,0,0.5,0,1729080969,2024-10-16 12:16:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g4xxw8/misunderstood_my_salary_rate_from_monthly_to/,10,2024
1g4xujb,"I have two job offers, both expect to start tomorrow. How do I navigate this?","I work in hospitality. I went for an interview at a place to work as a waitress, Employer 1 offered me the job and told me to start tomorrow. I accepted. 

However today I was offered a job as a manager in another place, Employer 2. This is closer to home. Offered me 75k AUD (negotiable, I may ask for 78k). They asked me to start tomorrow too.

So I texted the first employer and said 'I am sorry but was offered a manager position so I'll go with that'

Employer 1 replied 'I am very sorry, I was very excited for you to start. We are looking for a manager too if you want'. I told him 'ok let's talk about it'. In the morning Employer 1 will call me and discuss. It's not really an offer yet, but I imagine they will negotiate with me.

The issue here is that I committed to Employer 2 to work tomorrow night, and even if Employer 1 offer will be good, I still feel bad to drop Employer 2 just like that.

Employer 1: is more far from where I live, don't know the pay yet, the working hours may  be varied (mornings/afternoon/evenings)

Employer 2: closer to home, small team, 75k, working hours are pretty strict Tue to Sat every day from around 5pm to late (I assume 12am)

Employer 2 would be perfect if it wasn't for the absolutely strict working hours. Also I have to commit to either of them for several years because I am in Australia and I am European and I am hoping to get them to sponsor me. Both employers offer sponsorships to the right candidate/right role (manager usually).

What things should I evaluate to make this decision? ",givemeadayortwo,0,0.5,2,1729080666,2024-10-16 12:11:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g4xujb/i_have_two_job_offers_both_expect_to_start/,10,2024

1g4vrzk,Is an HBO Degree Valuable? Can It Lead to Opportunities in Big Tech Companies?,"Hey everyone,

I have some questions regarding the **Professional Bachelor's (HBO)** degrees offered by **hogeschools** and universities of applied sciences in countries like the **Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, UK, etc.** Specifically, I’m interested in the value of these degrees in fields like **Computer Science** and **Software Engineering**.

1. How valuable is an **HBO/Professional Bachelor's** degree in these fields? Is it considered a solid qualification for securing jobs in tech?
2. Can this degree lead to job opportunities at major tech companies like **Google** or **Amazon**?
3. When comparing an **HBO degree** to a **research-based degree**, what are the key differences regarding job opportunities?
4. Everyone talks about how easily and quickly you can find a job with an **HBO degree**, but what about the **quality of jobs**? Can someone with this degree work as a software engineer at top companies like **Google** or **Facebook**?
5. If I consider a **research-based Bachelor's degree** instead, would that be a better choice, and would I have better chances in the big tech companies?
6. If I want to pursue a **Master’s degree** after completing an HBO degree, what would be the pathway? Does obtaining a Master's significantly increase my chances of securing a desirable position in tech?

1g4vb2t,Needing career/study advice!,"Hello,

I am sorry for the long post. I just really need advise from somebody who has careeer in **academia, phd experience or who changed careers** etc.

I am writing as I graduated uni this year. Since then, I have been looking for a job. I studied Finance. Only job that is offered in area where I live is either accountant or assistant. However, I recently realized I do not want to be an accountant.

I have been devoted student for years and had a great marks. However, it also ruined my mental health a lot. I have been experiencing anxiety and panic attacks (it actually started strongly just after my final exams). During my final years of school, I was really looking forward to ending my school life, start a new chapter, find a job, earn money and after work have free time when I can finally have some hobbies and not think about school all the time. Yes, I think I was romanticizing it a lot, but it made me motivated enough to finish school.

I have a friend who studies completely different field. She started pursuing her Phd. She explained to me, that after she finishes her studies, she has sure place at her faculty as uni teacher. She is also very passionate about her field. She says something like that Phd is more worth it than a job, that it has a meaning and stuff and it is the best career choice.

With my career identity crisis, I am thinking if it was not a mistake pursuing Phd. My master thesis was very succesful and I now think I kind of enjoyed writing it. However, we have a whole free semester for it so I did not have much other commitments and could write comfortably at home. But before I started and also during it, I was stressed a lot of course. Actually, when I was writing a bachelor thesis, I had a terrible time and never wanted to do it again (but I think it was bad topic).

Now, I just do not know what to do with my life. I feel like only thing I can do with my specialization, that I would like is teaching, and that I cannot do without Phd. In my country, Phd is free, at least to a certain age (that I would probably pass if I started a year later), so this would not be a problem. But I do not think if I could do it mentally, if I could handle that many stress and would persist for so many years. I am also not sure, if I would really get a job in academia right away. And, none of my classmates from uni pursued Phd.

But at the same time, I am afraid that I spent so many years studying something in vain, just to forget it and that do some low paying job that you do not need uni for. I am also not sure how good is working as uni teacher? I can only see longer holidays and more money than I got even as accountant or assistant (at least where I live). It would be also prestigious.

Can somebody give me their experience?

I just do not know what to do.

1g4udcn,Burnt Out But I Enjoy My Coworkers,"I work as a clinical dietitian in a small hospital. 

  
I love the nurses, physical therapists, unit clerks, etc that I work with when I'm up on the floors. Since it's a smaller hospital, everyone is on a first name basis, everyone treats others well. I talk story when I'm charting at nurse stations, I've even become friends with a few people from other departments and have gone to a few BBQs, yoga classes, retirement parties, etc. 

  
However I don't like my own department. It's ALWAYS short staffed (in the almost 5 years I've been there, we've had a hand full of months where we've been fully staffed). Even when we're short staffed, It's still not truly enough staff to handle the workload. My patient load is usually 20-60 patients a day (typical workload for my position should be more like 8-12). I've made a lot of progress with drawing boundaries. I stopped voluntarily working 10 hour days. I stopped skipping lunch. I stopped eating lunch at my desk. I stopped bending over backwards to please people. But I think I'm still just burnt out. 

  
However, I'm still scared to leave. I keep thinking ""what if I can't make friends at a new job"" or ""what if its worse at a different job"" or ""what if I need to just have a better mindset and try to make this current job work""

  
I also had a lot of conflict with another staff member for the past year. I tried handling it on my own, didn't get anywhere. I asked my boss to get involved to help us find a resolution. 6 weeks later I asked my boss if there was any updates and she said she never even got around to asking my coworker to talk to her and since my coworker put in her resignation, she decided to just not even say anything to her (or me).

in case it’s relevant no i dont make those jokes to my manager because she doesn’t seem to like them very much. i also try to avoid making them or teasing my coworkers when she’s around in order to not give off the wrong impression or make her uncomfortable. everyone who teases is teased back if that makes sense. and lastly, to my knowledge i’m the only one who has been reported. up until this point i thought we were all friendly and just having a bit of fun while customers weren’t around.

1g4slv3,I was hired by a new company and put in my two weeks but now my current job is asking me to stay.,"So as the title states, I recently was hired by a new company and put in my two week notice. Shortly after, I was contacted by my supervisor trying to convince me to stay with the company. The reason I’m leaving my current job is because management kind of sucks. You see I’ve worked with this company a little over a year and in that time, things could have been better. Don’t get me wrong, I like the people there and I like what I do; however it’s gotten to a point where it feels like management doesn’t appreciate me and has retaliated against me. To explain, I have to go back about 8 months. 

So I work in ABA therapy and I had just completed the mandatory CPI training. On that same day, I witnessed a co-worker get rough with and unnecessarily physical their Client. All of which the training tells us not to do. I reported it to HR, where after filing the report, the next day I was called into the office where I was made to revise my statement to make it sound “less harsh”. A few days pass by and I am called into the office again to speak with HR and the director of the company where I had to explain what I witnessed. After I explained what happened, I was told in that meeting that maybe what I saw wasn’t I saw. Maybe I misinterpreted what happened and it was special training I wasn’t aware of.  I stood my ground and disagreed with everyone in the room. I explained that nowhere in the training does it say we can lift a Client half a foot off the ground by one arm and forcibly hold them in chair. The training explicitly tells us how to hold a Client and to only be physically when necessary, and that we under no circumstances restrain a Client in a chair; further more we can only restrain a Client as a last resort if the Client was being aggressive. The co-worker got upset with his Client and used unnecessary force because his Client wasn’t listening to him and wasn’t aggressive in any way.

After that meeting, Supervisors in the office were quiet around me or tried not to make conversation for a few days. Then my hours were cut. When I first started, I was working 35 hours a week, I was now doing 15 hours a week. When I asked my Supervisors to find me more cases for me to work on, they said they would find me more cases as soon as possible. 2 months pass by and they tell me they are still looking and having a difficult time finding a Clients I could work with. Another month passes and I ask the Supervisor about the status of finding me a case. The Supervisor tells me that they haven’t even started looking for a new case for me but now that they know I am available, they’ll start looking. So then I request to be made full time staff, the hiring manager says they will get the process started but to be aware that no full time positions for clinic and in-home sessions are available and that I will be transferred out to work in the schools. The hiring manager says for me to give it a week and come back with a response. A week passes and I state I want to be full time. Later that same day the hiring manager tells me they found me a Client in the clinic, and that it will bring my hours back to 40, but I have to remain part time, because as full time I can’t do school and clinic case; which is a lie because my co-workers do exactly that. 

When I started work as a full time employee, on my first day, I’m not given any info on my Client until that day and was not informed that my Client doesn’t come to school. When I contacted my supervisors, they had me wait anywhere from 3-4 hours a day at the school to find out that the Client was coming or not. Because of this I was t able to sub at any other schools. If the Client did come(1 or 2 days out of the week) they were aggressive. I would ask for support from my Supervisors, which would go ignored or my Supervisors would not come even after saying they would.  

I was reassigned to a new case because after complaining for 3 weeks to my Supervisors, I had to call the office to make them do something. With this case, I worked with another aggressive Client however communication wasn’t strong as my Supervisor communicated everything to my co-worker and the coworker had to relay the messages to me. On top of that, I was offered a raise but was never given it because as they explained it “it was only for when I subbed.” Then when I was working with the second Client, I was given a raise so long as I was working with that Client. I eventually asked to be reassigned because the Client was too aggressive and the caregivers weren’t doing anything the Supervisors were telling them to do. And it became apparent the caregivers kind of saw school as a way to ditch their kid for a few hours and saw me and my coworker as the guys that “fix” their kid without having to put any time or effort into maintaining the plan we had in place to help their kid.

Now with my current Client, my pay was cut back to my original pay  and my hours were once again cut. And now that I put in my resignation, my Supervisors are asking that I please stay. They are telling me they will give me a raise and keep me at the rate I was making with Client 2 and implementing new plans, be more on top of providing support, have more open communication, and increase my hours. And I guess I just feel done with it. I feel bad for wanting to leave, but the fact that it had to come to me leaving for them to do the things I was asking them to do since the beginning frustrates me.

The only reason I’m questioning to stay with the current company is because, the new one is basically by contract. So when summer vacation comes, I could be out of a job as the school decides after a year if they want to move forward with me each year. Yeah this new one offers more money and has health benefits but its the whole end of the school year thing that worries me, as I am not guaranteed to continue working there and I’ll be out of a job.  And the reason I bring this up here, is because I feel conflicted and don’t know what I should do.",Critical_Reference32,0,0.5,10,1729058548,2024-10-16 06:02:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g4slv3/i_was_hired_by_a_new_company_and_put_in_my_two/,10,2024

1g4s39a,Opportunity in AML investigations,"I'm looking for some advice on some seasoned professionals.

I'm a recent graduate with a bachelors in Criminology and Criminal Justice. I've been struggling to find my ideal employment.
See I, naively, got my degree with intentions to do investigations. l've always wanted to be FBI, CIA, NSA or some other federal agency. I'm open to other options, but I'm excellent at investigating, violent crime and criminal mentality. It's truly my passion.

That being said, there's a lot more to getting into investigation than I realized. My biggest issue is that nearly EVERYONE wants years of experience along with my degree. I just have a degree and haven't been able to find a job to sponsor clearance or just ya know give me a chance.

I even considered getting my Pl license, but I still need about 2,000 hours of experience with a degree.

I currently have a job in corrections, that I'm so very grateful for but I hate my job.  I make 50k a year or $24.38 annually. However it’s not how it was advertised and I have huge concerns about my safety, resident safety and just the facility overall. 

In general, I’ve never wanted to be teaching criminals, I want to catch them. I picked my degree because I genuinely love it.

I saw a job opening for an AML investigator (Financial Crime Compliance) entry level, and I'm just wondering would that help my cause to get some time in investigations? Or is that taking me into a different direction into a different field?

For the record it seems like people overall dislike the company, but if it can help further my skills for my field I’d do my best.

Any advice, thoughts or just words of wisdom would appreciated.

1g4rekb,Should I pursue horticulture?,"So basically ive wanted to study horticulture ever since I went into college but life happened and I ended up studying business and then dropping out. Im from puerto rico so horticulture here is a very small business, mostly gov funded but a very abandoned industry here none the less.

I had a bf who did data analysis and he taught me how to do it. I really enjoyed it and learned it quick. I saw that he worked from home and managed a few of those jobs, making great money and having a lot of free time. 
I wanted that and since I already knew how to do it I went back to school to study data. I thought well, I can do this for the rest of my life and not enjoy it but ill enjoy my free time. 

This was just not me. We broke up and a year laterand I hated data analytics. I took a break from college to figure everything out. I met my current bf and he has brought me back to my authentic self. He also has a passion for horticulture, and he does it amazingly. He has an incredible job that pays up to 35$ per hour doing soft landscaping. He takes care of flowers, bonsais, orchards ect. Mostly flower gardens of very wealthy people. He loves his job and he sends me pictures of his day to day and it makes me so happy for him! 

I decided I wanted to do that. I think im studying horticulture, but I want to make sure im going into this with all the knowledge I can gather. I also found this website https://www.publicgardens.org/jobs/ and theres more info about salaries and positions.

1g4qgv5,Why can’t I believe management when they say I’m doing well? Does it really sound like I’m on the right track after a little over a month at new job?,"


I know it sounds like a really stupid question. My anxiety is typically pretty bad, even worse when it comes to working & social interactions. Prior to this job, I worked in financial aid for ~2 yrs. It started out stressful but I ended up getting good feedback from mgmt/my metrics were apparently one of the better on the team. I sought new work due to the workload at the time & wanting better pay. Now I’m in my 6th week  & this is a school I’ve been trying to get into for a minute. 

I’ve trained with the mgr & supervisor, both have told me I’m doing well & I’m not even asking for feedback most of the time.  Mgr felt the need to let the whole team know that I was picking up fast when I was first  introduced to them. This job is more in depth vs the last job & she even told me that they only hire people with experience now bc of how much there is to it. I have SO many questions & just msg the supervisor a lot more than I’d like, too many unknowns. I have notes I took & check training resources first but still feel like I might need direction if I’m working something  brand new, especially if I didn’t work through an actual scenario before. 

The supervisor said that they expect me to ask a ton of questions, she gives me reassuring feedback but still corrects me when she checks certain things which makes me 2nd guess my capabilities. Am I being too hard on myself? Am I right to believe this job might not be a good fit for me? My mom made a comment the other day to “have no expectations” when it comes to this job, in the sense of just seeing where it goes. I know the common sense answer may be to have confidence but I have bad anxiety.

* I *could* ride it out, I have some savings and I could probably wait and fish for the right job with the right salary for a full year

* Or I could get to work right away, but that would mean signing up for a lower paying job that I am overqualified for.

1g4mput,What To Do,"I moved across the country in July and have had a hard time finding a position in my field of interest/degree (natural resources/environmental). After many applications and interviews, I finally got a job at a state park (temporary) about a month ago. However, I am really not enjoying this job for a number of reasons, mainly the long commute, and the job description does not at all match the ""work"" I am actually doing. About two weeks into this job (so about two weeks ago), I got an email back from a previous application I put in for a job that is still within my field as an environmental educator with much better all around work conditions and benefits. I have no qualms about taking this position over my current one. I interviewed today and they said I should hear back in 4-6 weeks. I reallllly want this one to work out!

Where my hang up comes, in my desperation to leave this job, I also put in an application for a specialty retail store. I have experience in this type of environment and thoroughly enjoyed the position, even though I worry that this job is not in my field of interest or align with my long term career goals. I have been invited to an interview at the store and am now hung up on whether I should continue pursuing this job even though I just interviewed for the position I would prefer. If I interview for the retail position and it goes well, I am sure I would get offered the job and hired pretty quickly. I would hate to start the job at the store and if I get offered the job I would prefer, quit shortly after. 

  
So basically, I would prefer either job over my current one, but don't want to start at the store and then quit shortly after if I get offered my top choice job. I also don't want to not interview at the store and then if I don't get the job I prefer, be stuck at my current job that I don't enjoy. I would appreciate any insight or advice people have to offer.

1g4m270,I am considering leaving a negative review online regarding my last employer. I have some concerns. Your thougts?,"The issue I am coming across here is that after I wrote out the review I realized it's pretty bad. I worked for the company for almost 8 years and I want to warn people what they might get themselves into at this place.

I also realized my review doesn't resemble anything I have seen online so I am not even sure if I am doing it right. My review is very long.

One major concern I have is future employers finding out about the review. I don't want future employers to be scared of hiring me. I know that job reviews are ""anonymous"" but reality doesn't work that way.

I am going to post my review below with a fake company name replacing the name of the actual company. Let me know what you think.

Thank you for your time.

  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
I worked for *shshshsh* in the Urithiru laboratory for almost 8 years. I have decided to leave a review detailing my experience to warn people of this place.

To save time try to imagine the most morally bankrupt people you have ever come across on social media sites. Now imagine working with those people. Welcome to *shshshsh*.

Some members of management do not have the maturity nor temperament to hold any sort of leadership position. If constant sexual innuendos doesn't bother you then imagine a supervisor secretly spying on and videotaping you after you get off from work. That happened to me.

Imagine thinking some of your coworkers are really good at their job just to later find out they have a tendency to tamper with their results to ensure their tests pass. Imagine watching a supervisor teach someone how to alter their test results just to watch that person get fired after getting caught. I watched all of this happen.

Imagine if one of the companies executives accidently lets you know that management in Urithiru had been lying about pay raises and had been unfairly issuing extra pay raises to a small group of people based entirely on favoritism instead of merit. Imagine that you decide to asks questions about this just to have a director neither confirm nor deny this but admit that an imbalance in employee pay does appear to exist. Imagine that the manager confirms directly to your face that this pay raise scandal did in fact happen and simply blames it on the old manager who had just quit about a month prior. It's not hard for me to imagine this. I was there.

Imagine a management team who actually understands and cares about safety, for only in your imagination will that exist at Urithiru. OSHA and ASHI have no meaning to the management team at the Urithiru lab. I know of two incidences where an employee spilled enough of a particular highly dangerous, cancer causing chemical (methylene chloride) on them that they should have used the emergency shower. Neither person did and instead opted to go home drenched in poison. Why? The emergency shower does not have a privacy curtain. It should be obvious to anyone that most people will be hesitant to strip down in front of their coworkers. I suggested a privacy curtain and it was dismissed with the excuse that management didn't believe anyone would ever use the shower regardless. Some reading this might know that the EPA back in April 2024 banned methylene chloride use in many scenarios. That is not the case at *shshshsh* at the time I left (August 2024).

Let's explore the eyewash station in this lab. The water for the eyewash station has so many minerals in it that many times it looks like skim milk when you turn it on. Imagine getting a chemical in your eyes and you go to the eyewash station just to have water mixed with a bunch of tiny rocks launched into your cornea. Also, I was the one who cleaned out the water line for the shower and eyewash station so their wouldn't be dangerous, stagnant water in the lines if either had to be used. I doubt the lines will ever be cleaned out again because 1) I'm the only one who knew we are supposed to do this and 2) nobody there has the work ethic nor physical strength to handle disposing of 15+ gallons of water continuously without spilling it. There is not a drain by the way so if you ever use the emergency shower you can expect to spill around 300 gallons of water all over the floor and about 7 gallons if you use the eyewash station. *Shshshsh* will provide you a mop to clean that water up with and they do have a wet floor sign.

As I said earlier I had worked for *shshshsh* for almost 8 years. I was terminated without warning because I reached out to HR regarding my manager. I had requested a transfer to a different shift to get away from my manager after she completely lost it one morning. First thing in the morning (8am) she charges up to me and begins yelling at me. In addition to being berated by her she also chose to insult me directly to my face while everyone in the lab stared on. She also insulted and made fun of me when I was in her office trying to explain to her why I was requesting a transfer. The manager suggested we speak to HR about this and I told her that I had already reached out to HR. The moment I said I had already reached out to HR the manager immediately kicked me out of the lab. I received a termination letter by email about a half hour later. No reason was given for my termination nor was a reason provided to the TWC (it took 5 weeks for *shshshsh* to respond to the TWC). TWC said I was terminated with no cause so I was thankfully approved for unemployment. I lost all my accrued PTO. I had to go to Reddit to find out how to access my 401K. It has been 46 days and no one from *shshshsh* has contacted me to provide me with any information regarding my termination.

Be careful ever working at this lab. The accolades *shshshsh* gives you mean nothing in regards to how they value you. I was the recipient of Employee of the Year, Employee of the Quarter, and countless ""*shshshsh* Dollars"" certificates. None of that mattered when the manager realized I wasn't going to tolerate harassment from her the same way others tolerated it in the past. Respect for others and oneself means a lot to me. You will not be shown the respect you deserve working at *shshshsh*.",PieIsPleasent,6,0.7400000095367432,40,1729036420,2024-10-15 23:53:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g4m270/i_am_considering_leaving_a_negative_review_online/,10,2024
1g4m0f2,Questions regarding job searching while in hostile workplace ,"It's been a good few years since I've had to job search. I am in a very toxic situation at my job that is taking it's toll on my mental and emotional health.

I am actually on medical leave right now due to the stress, and am trying to plan my next steps. I have a few weeks of leave left.

I have no degree (other than associate's) and am a programmer at a big name company. I am considering switching into the insurance field. I am fairly certain due to the PTSD from this job that I do not ever want to program again. What I am worried about is, if I return to work on my current team, is 'how will I job search'?

I am scared because there's so much stress to perform perfectly (nothing I ever do is good enough even though I deliver exactly what was requested of me) and that everything I do is under a microscope, that I won't have the time to job search (or quickly apply to jobs during the work day that come up - I work on site) come January when many jobs are posted. Accordingly, I have some questions:

(1) Due to this -- would it be wise to resign prior to January so I can job search effectively and land something? I could afford to do this financially. I am just worried that I am going to be spending so much time taking care of my mental and emotional health from the toxic environment that I'll struggle to land anything - that all of my time will end up being spent, taking care of myself.

(2) If you were me, would you quit cold turkey, or would you try to get part time employment lined up for while I am job searching?

(3) Is there a way to job search / get alerts about jobs so I could quickly apply to them, while I am working at my company, that I am not aware of?

(4) Is there a 'logic' to this (i.e. that jobs are posted at certain times of day)? I am just really worried as I want a remote position and am afraid that if I am not one of the first applicants, that I won't get the job... I see hundreds of people applying for stuff.

I’m just afraid I would take the opportunity away from someone who is interested in that career path and I don’t see any real value in me actually going.  There would be no pay increase for me increasing my skill.  No better schedule.  I would just be improving to do better work for my managers.  Don’t get me wrong I put a lot of pride into my work.

One thing that I liked in my university was studying mathematics and took about 9 elective courses in them and had decent performance. Should I start preparing for a master's degree in mathematics? The issue is that I am already 26 and I am scared what if it's too late and it ruins my life even further if that doesn't work out as well. My brain is already in a not working condition and what if it cant handle the later stresses. If I start preparing for masters, I will start it at around 27-28 at least, and after two years of masters I will realize whether I want to continue with math or not and by this time I will be 30.",StrictConfusion3565,2,1.0,0,1729028311,2024-10-15 21:38:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g4j6jd/at_26_i_am_realizing_i_chose_a_wrong_career_path/,10,2024

1g4ii7e,"In a fairly stable, well paid job, but I'm tired of the industry and want to give it all up","I've been in the same industry all my working life, 10 years. That time has been split over 2 employers. 


I work in a niche industry, with only a handful of companies working in this area. Options are very limited if I left this job to find another doing the same work, as I know of all the other companies and roles are limited.


I earn a decent salary, especially for my age and overall have a fair amount of freedom and responsibility. However I'm so tired of the company and the industry in general. I'd love to have my own business in the same area and have considered it a number of times, however the business partner I would do this with, is no longer an option for personal reasons. 
I'm tired of my current job and this potential business partner is currently a close colleague. I've lost all faith in them basically, I can't trust them and therefore the option of a business with them is over. 
Whilst I admit it's heavily tainting my enjoyment of my current role, if I remove this person in theory, I'm still not happy. 
It's demotivating other areas of my life and I'm seeking help for this, however the thought of packing everything up and starting a new mundane 9-5 is so tempting. My current job is stressful, with long days and never really having the ability to cut off from it all, even when on leave, it's not easy to step away. Realistically starting my own business in this industry doesn't solve this either, it just makes it worse. With the right business partner by my side I'd have attempted it, together, but like I've mentioned this is no longer an option.


Am I crazy to want to give up a 6 figure salary (in the UK) and want to live a mundane and repetitive life in a 9-5? I've not got a partner or dependants, but I'm fairly restricted to my current location due to family. So I can't pack up and start a new life somewhere new. The best I feel I can do is end this career, cut off the current friendships and people in my life and just go and work the 9-5 and keep myself to myself.",Jjz93z,2,1.0,1,1729026536,2024-10-15 21:08:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g4ii7e/in_a_fairly_stable_well_paid_job_but_im_tired_of/,10,2024

I have multiple calls and text with the in-house recruiter during this whole process. He kept me informed feedback after each interview, etc. with calls or text which I appreciate. He followed up after the in person meeting and said an offer should come this week. 
He then calls today, he did not get right to the point. He was asking me questions about overall how I felt the interview went again then he says he wanted to let me know ASAP that an offer was coming. But they wanna make sure they put the together the most competitive offer and he wants a video call tomorrow with him and the hiring manager to go over the offer.
It’s a quasi sales role and the hiring manager is a typical sales person. There was a lot of red flags of micromanage during the last interview.  I don’t think I’m taking I am taking the offer regarless of $, benefits don’t compare. Have you ever heard of telling a prospect an offer is coming but waiting 24 hours for the offer and then doing it via Zoom call with both hiring manager and recruiter? Weird right? Red flag?

It’s common in the type of work I do (crisis management) to constantly be getting pulled in different directions at the drop of a dime so I never get offended by this. Typically I would just say “oh no problem at all, I hope your day turns around” or something to that effect and move on.

However, I was interviewing for a role recently and the interviewer joined a few minutes late, with their camera off, and immediately apologized saying she’s having a rough day dealing with a crisis. I kinda lost my “interview mode” and talked to her like we wer already coworkers and said “oh jeez, no problem at all, would you prefer to reschedule this call? I understand how it can be sometimes.”

She seems really taken back by this. I couldn’t see her face because her camera was off but there was a decent pause and then she tells me “no no that’s not necessary you have my attention”

The interview went well, and I ended up getting an offer, but it felt weird to do in the moment and just kinda came out.

1g4ga66,How to pivot into the business side of my company? ,"I currently am working at a crane company where I largely help with payroll, some smaller tasks that help with billing (but no longer billing-I did at first and then there was restructuring after an employee was fired), and little things here and there on the operations side of things like getting agreements signed by customers, collecting insurance, etc. 

Right now I’m feeling very unfulfilled at my job and am worrying about my career path. I am 28 and before this was working in construction where I had a LOT of responsibilities working very loosely within my degree. I was managing an operation, essentially single handedly, that brought in millions of dollars. I had to leave that job to extreme toxicity, woman in construction type stuff getting screamed at day in day out. So I got a job in a construction adjacent company with equipment. Now I process payroll (which I HATE) and do bullshit things. My mental health is better overall, but now that things have calmed down, I’m looking how to pivot this into something marketable and career build able. 

I have always been good at managing. I’m very organized and (kinda) bossy, but always build great relationships. I’m also pretty good at finances and I love to make (theoretical) budgets for myself to see how I can manipulate my money, etc. I’m also very good at planning and coordination. 

With all that said, I think I would enjoy working in the business aspect of things in the company, working with money, profits, expenditures, and things of that nature. My one year is coming up in November and I’d like to organize an end of year review type of meeting and express what I would like to do with my career here. When originally hired, it was said that the company is expanding and I can create my own path, see what I’m good at, what I like, etc and go from there. Especially because this seems like the kind of company where there is no management plan and things of that nature. If I want that, I need to make it happen and I don’t want to waste my prime “career development years” removing time stamps from e tickets for billing. So I want to get that ball rolling after a year. 

I don’t know anything about finances or business (I have a science degree). Im looking for small tasks/ideas relating to business and/or finance that I could present to my manager that I could help with. I don’t want to go in empty handed and say “this is what I want make it work”, but rather, “this is what I have been researching, I have some ideas, do you think it’s possible I could start to have some responsibility within xyz”.  I’d love some advice and ideas if anyone could help me with that!

1g4g6c1,URGENT: Is this a really bad job offer? I don't think I've been given enough time to decide and that I've been lowballed (but I need some immediate money),"📍TLDR: So I'm a fresh grad from the Philippines and I graduated with a latin honor distinction, have an enormous amount of extra and co-curricular activities, internships, and all that stuff. I didn't get a job immediately (unemployed for about 4 months now) as I was burnout and depressed from things in my life.

📍ACTUAL STORY: As I was in the middle of fixing the typical requirements to apply for a job (I haven't not applied for anything). I suddenly got an offer from a legit tech company for an officer/supervisor position. Thrilled that I get such an offer at this state, I pursued it and got to the last round for interviews (I had 4 rounds of interviews and 2 exercises/tasks, one of which was super hard). 

🚩POSSIBLE RED FLAG (FOR ME): During the phone screening, the HR rep already asked me about my salary range. I tried refusing to answer as from what I learned, companies should be the first one to give a figure (I might be wrong) around the final round of interviews. However, I felt pressured to answered since they said that the company would be considering me.

On the day of my interview with the hiring manager, I was given ANOTHER opportunity for different officer/supervisor position as the current employee would be leaving soon. This was a more ""exclusive"" offer and wasn't posted as a listing in their hiring platforms.

I had my final interview today (Tuesday) by the company VP and I think what's important to note is that he asked me if I had any impending job offers. I answered honestly and said that I didn't have any other offers (since again, I didn't apply for anything).

AND YES I already know that the popular strategy is that I should be applying for multiple jobs but it's just not my style. I keep thinking about how our exams are incredibly challenging and i want to give my best, what if my deadlines coincide? Maybe I was unaware or naive or just tried to be honest idk but people told me that they used that information to see if I depended on their offer. I was told that it was to lowball me essentially because I'm not ""on demand"" (to which I didn't know until after the interview).

When I was given a verbal offer after the interview, I was honestly incredibly disappointed with the salary and benefits. For context, I was given Php 23,000 as basic with a ""KPI allowance"" with a roof range of Php 3,000 (let's say Php 26,000) if I performed well to which I don't like since the amount is dependent on the rating of the manager. Not that I wouldn't perform well, just that it's not a guarantee in my opinion. THEN imagine the deductibles such as SSS, Philhealth, Pag-ibig etc. (basically mandated govt health and insurances and all that). This now leaves me with around Php 20,000 - around Php 23,000 IF ONLY I would get the full allowance every month. I was also given only 1 emergency leave.

THEN, in the same discussion, they gave me a huge checklist of requirements to handle myself (since they're not gonna be the ones to process it for me) with a deadline of Friday THIS WEEK and that I'll Monday next week. This does not include the TIME I have to ACTUALLY REVIEW AND NEGOTIATE THE OFFER. They said that they'll send the offer within the day and they kinda did BUT it was sent by the evening (like 7PM) and THE ACTUAL JOB OFFER was missing from the email (I was expecting 3 documents but only got 2). I immediately reverted to ask for the job offer document and they haven't responded until now (3:30AM the next day as I'm writing this).

I think the offer is actually HORRIBLE, it pissed me off, and I don't have enough time to process and review literally ANYTHING (it's already Wednesday morning). Christ, the offer isn't even here yet. However, I need some money and my family is insisting that it's beyond minimum ranges and that I have to start somewhere. Is it worth the hassle?

I’m seeking some advice.  

I (25F) recently joined a new organisation and have exceeded my KPIs during both my 3-month probation and the subsequent 6 months. I've driven measurable impact across my projects too! 

So during my mid-year check-in, everything went well, and my manager expressed her satisfaction with my performance. I mentioned that I’m aiming to reach the ""next level"" by my first annual performance review, and we did agree on other projects I would be owning till then. But I've also noticed that the ""minimum"" promotion timeline of my predecessors and other colleagues are at least 2 years. 

Is this still a good sign / is 1 year plausible? 

Also, would it be beneficial to send a list of my measurable impacts (eg. the ways I've improved ad spend and workflow) so she can raise it to her boss?

I'm currently unemployed and have been looking for something quick just to last until the end of the year before hopefully finding a more permanent job in the beginning of next year. I've been struggling with the job search for a while, and will admit I have multiple versions of my resume tailored to different job types, some of which are more embellished than others to fit certain roles better and look a little more impressive. I only use the embellished versions when applying to local/non-corporate/personal jobs because it all matters less and those types of jobs never really dig too deep. I of course obviously always knew to only use 100% accurate info when applying to corporate positions because they obviously typically do super thorough background checks. 

Well, I messaged her and said I was interested, not knowing all the details or what company it was even for at the time, and sent her my resume over DM just to simply see if she thought i'd be a good fit at all. Because this was only a one month contract job and didn't seem to be associated with anything major, and this was all happening over a literal instagram story, the resume I sent over was just the first one I happened to have uploaded, and I didn't do any specific fine-tuning before sending it. Again, this was just over simple messages between someone I know personally in real life just to have her see if my resume matched the requirements at all, so I unfortunately didn't think too much about which exact resume version I was sending.  

Flash forward to now, it turns out this job actually is associated with a high level corporate company. They've already offered me the position, but are awaiting my background check to come back before finalizing everything. It's already been almost three weeks, and the background check apparently still hasn't come through, which seems kind of odd so I decided to do some research and figure out why it's taking so long and if other people have had the same issue. Unfortunately in my research I went back to my old messages with the friend and realized the resume I had casually sent her was a version with a bunch of embellishments. Nothing too crazy or blatant flat out lies, but some of my job titles are slightly altered to sound more professional and some of the start/end dates are changed, stuff like that. Meaning, the reason the background check is taking so long is most likely because they haven't been able to verify all the information listed on that version of the resume. It hadn't dawned on me till now, that I'm realizing they never actually had me submit a formal application after speaking with the hiring managers my friend connected me with, which means that the resume they've been going off of this whole time was the one I had first sent to my friend. Obviously in hindsight if I had known this was going to be a higher profile role and it was going to go down the way it did I would have been more careful in which version I had initially sent her. I know this mistake is all on me, but I had no idea this position was going to be a higher level corporate job, or that the resume I had initially sent her was going to be used as my 'official formal application' of sorts. At the end of the day the job was only going to last for a month anyway so it's not the end of the world, but I really could have used the money and job experience. Does anyone think there's any world where it might work out and I can potentially move forward with the position as normal or should I just cut my losses?

1g4dop9,"I tested the job market, came out with an offer, but have anxiety on next steps. Is this the right move?","I've been at my current company for about 4 years - 2 of which are with my current team. I was on a data analytics team, predominantly building out reporting but eventually got shifted to more of an ad-hoc analyst role. My core competencies are SQL, Data Viz tools like SQL, and some light automation / programming experience with Python, R, etc.

I love my boss and my team. And honestly, I like the people I work with. Everyone's typically friendly and having a nice boss is huge, for obvious reasons. They value me. They allowed me to relocate last year to be closer to family just as the company began to slam down RTO mandates. I work extremely hard, but have always gotten good feedback and feel I have grown quite a bit. My one issue with my day-to-day is my boss is a bottleneck. Everyone needs him all the time. So as I'm trying to learn new tables, do new ad-hoc requests, I'm frequently lost because 2-3 vital intricacies in my queries aren't accounted for because the only one who knows about them in the company is him So as I get better at SQL and all, I often feel like a deer in the headlights. My teammates have echoed the sentiment.

But what I really hate is the corporate culture. New leadership came in last year and it's a lot. We have a town hall every three weeks. There's a lot of executives funneling out, which I guess is to be expected with a new CEO. Benefits like remote work are gone for anyone who lives near an office and we get an email each week about some big new change. Every town hall there's some reason they'll explain why we may or may not get our annual bonus payouts (I've never received my full one in years). To be honest, it's tiring. But also, I wonder how different it is elsewhere. I look aside from all of it because I do really appreciate my boss.

Concurrently, I just finished grad school - got a Master's in Computer Science with a 3.7 GPA. I ended up not loving a lot of the true CS work so I pivoted all my electives to Data Science, which I enjoyed more. And those loans are coming due and there is no option for student loan forgiveness at this point, and I can't count on that. Right now, what my bill is (that I start paying next month) will sap all the ""extra"" money I have in my checks. I currently make about $78k. I don't have a ton of excess money - I also have other bills, including medical and some family support so it's not all that it seems. But as the first loans due date draws near and how I've felt sort of underpaid now relative to my new skills and education, I put myself out there on the market. I'd say interest has been strong given the market.

And today, I got an offer. I found a company with about 3.7 stars on Glassdoor, where the only concerns I walked away from were really layoffs-related. Which isn't nothing by any stretch - but my company lays people off too. I hadn't heard of them prior to applying, but they're reputable. And the offer is to be a Senior Analyst for $100k. All standard benefits, unlimited PTO, 18 holidays, unlimited sick, and some stock options. Honestly, from a self-worth perspective, I needed this. Just felt nice to hit that benchmark, especially because I spent my entire 20s being lowballed when I had no options. Now, I have some leverage - I'm not desperate to leave where I am and I continue to have interviews lined up. I had two interviews with these people - pretty rapid fire panels with all prospective team members and they seemed nice. Maybe less ""fun"" than my current team. They're a little older than me (I'm 29 - I got 40s - 50s vibes), a little more ""buttoned-up,"" but pretty friendly. I've typically worked in places that have good name value that people take less money to work for just so they can say they work for them. This is sort of the inverse. More of a quarter-zip / pullover vibe vs a ballcap and t-shirt like I'm used to. But for a lot of money, I'll do whatever anyone wants.

I'm a super-nervous, anxious over-thinker and I wonder if I'm underselling this great opportunity. I think I'd have so many less sleepless nights knowing I can seriously put a dent in my student loans and that my quality of life wouldn't suffer. But again, love my boss and my team - and maybe that's not healthy. I'm tired, feel very underpaid, and feel there's a really tough bottleneck to be the analyst I need to be in my role. It's just a big jump and I'd be starting over and leaving a place I left with some real equity. I've never discussed a promotion with them, but don't think it'd happen. Also, this is a fully remote role - which is #1 to me. No offices where I live, no risk of an issue, it's all in my paperwork. Other benefits align where I am now (although the current company is taking away unlimited PTO next year to an hours accrual system).

ATLDR; few thoughts...

* Is the jump from $80k - $100k significant enough to start over? Am I really underpaid
* Is there a way I can negotiate salary? I've never come from a place of leverage where I didn't need the job. If they offered me $115k, I'd leave on the spot, how can I ask about that? I feel like not being desperate kind of changes things.
* Is there an opportunity to offer my current company my services in a part-time role - just at least maintaining reporting I built out? They've tried to do this in the past with consultants we had on - could I do this for pocket change? Is it common?

Sorry, I know this is a lot. I'm just nervous. Nervous about negotiating salary, whether this is the right move (I think it's just nerves). I didn't get bad vibes from the call, it sounded like a lot of work but I do a lot of work now.

1g4dhjk,"Got let go while interviewing, how to handle or bring it up?","Hey all,

I was very dissatisfied with my job and burning out so had started interviewing. I had a few that were in progress when I got called into my boss's office and he told me I was being let go. Won't get into the details, but basically the company was falling behind on its deliverables (which didn't have anything to do with me), getting a lot of pressure from their board, and they decided to restructure. 

This happened on a Monday and they told me to wrap up whatever I was doing, leave notes for the person to whom my team was now rolling up to, hand in my laptop, then take the rest of the week off (confirmed that the last day on my discharge letter was that Friday).

So I keep interviewing, and that week since I technically still worked there, I didn't really think to bring it up at all. Now I'm wondering how to maneuver around this. I was told to not bother bringing it up unless they ask. But what constitutes asking? For example, if they ask, ""Why are you looking to leave your current role?"" Should I say then and there that I no longer work there? Should I speak in past tense and hope they pick up on it and leave it to them to follow up? 

Should I just say I no longer work there and leave it to them to follow up if they're interested, or should I go into some detail (i.e., ""The company as a whole was falling behind on deliverables and getting pressure from the board, so they decided to restructure and I was let go as a result"")?

1g4cz6o,"Hundreds of job applications, hundreds of rejections. Is it me or the state of the job market?","TL;DR: I'm frustrated by my job search and feel like I've done all I could do to stand out. What should I do?

I feel as though I'm reaching my breaking point when it comes to applying for jobs. I spent approximately four hours in the past four weeks interviewing for a communications role at a very reputable company. The role seemed very exciting, and I felt like I was a great candidate, but I was turned down. The recruiter and team was very quick to respond during the interview process, but once I was turned down and asked for feedback — radio silence. 

In the past two years, I've applied to hundreds of jobs (Close to 1,000). I haven't heard back from a majority of them, and the rest never went anywhere. I've encountered numerous interview projects, multiple rounds of interviews for one role, and a disappointingly large amount of ghosting. 

When I ask for feedback I either get told I was a perfect candidate and the role was competitive, or I'm given very general feedback that seems like such a small deciding factor. For example, I was turned down from one role because I didn't show up to the interview with a notebook. The hiring manager suggested I do that in the future to show interest in the role/company, even though I asked 10 questions about the role/company at the end of the interview, lol.

I've tried to improve the things I can control — optimizing my resume, networking, building a portfolio, learning new skills, etc. — but I feel like it's getting me nowhere.

For content, I hold a bachelors degree in communications, and I have roughly four years of marketing communications experience under my belt. When it comes to roles, I'm not very picky about the industry, location, or working arrangement, but I am searching for roles in the marketing/communications field(s) and do avoid roles at companies that have a bad Glassdoor rating (<3).

Unfortunately, my situation isn't unique. I've heard a version of my story happening to many different people. What are we doing wrong? Is there something we're not doing? Is the job market just terrible right now?

1g4auli,My supervisor attempted to change my performance metrics to justify extra work. Is this a red flag? ,"I started a new job earlier this year, but quickly realized my supervisor is a micromanager and perfectionist. She constantly volunteers our team for unnecessary tasks to impress leadership, like leading redundant meetings or rewriting agency messages that no one reads.

Recently, I checked my performance appraisal metrics and noticed I had already exceeded the required number of meetings for the year. During a team call, I brought this up, thinking it would mean we could ease up on the extra meetings. My supervisor seemed genuinely surprised and hadn’t realized how many meetings we were required to lead annually. Instead of acknowledging that we were already over the target, she suggested that the extra meetings would count as going “above and beyond,” which she repeatedly emphasized.

Then, she proposed something that really concerned me—she wanted to change the performance metrics to make it less specific. For example, instead of it saying “expected to lead 4 meetings annually”, it would be more vague to accommodate for more meetings. It felt like a move to make it seem like we weren’t going overboard, but to ensure we could continue to be overloaded with tasks. This didn’t sit right with me, especially because I know performance metrics are supposed to be clear and measurable. 

Thankfully, a coworker pointed out that any changes to the metrics would need approval from leadership and HR first, which made my supervisor back off. But the fact that she even suggested altering them to push us further feels shady to me. Can supervisors just change performance metrics like that? Or am I overthinking this?",AccurateTonight8430,35,0.9100000262260437,29,1729007198,2024-10-15 15:46:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g4auli/my_supervisor_attempted_to_change_my_performance/,10,2024
1g4aom3,Interview while newly employed,"Hello everyone,

I am hoping to seek some advice regarding a career I have just recently started. I have worked at my present job for about 7 months and was lucky enough to have gained employment before graduating. I had a few interviews during university with some of the potential employers asking me to speak with them closer to my graduation to see where things are. However, I received a job offer from my current employer that I had accepted as I wanted to ensure I would have a job as close to finishing school as possible.

Fast forward a few months, I received an email from one of the employers asking where I was in my educational journey. I informed them I had accepted a job offer with someone else, but would really like to remain in contact should another opportunity arise. The employer responded asking if I would be open to having another conversation as they felt I did very well in the interview and would be a great fit with their company. 

Therein lies my dilemma. I was very interested in working for my current employer and the one who has contacted me. I don't feel it would hurt if I were to have a meeting with the other potential employer to discuss the job and salary. However, if I were to find their offer compelling, I don't know if it wouldn't be professional or appropriate for me to accept another job after only working at my current one for less than a year. This is a career where I will still see my current employers at educational events (it is a healthcare setting) and don't know if I should be worried about that either.

1g4ah4v,Should I feel guilty that I didn’t stay late on a Friday?,"

So I signed on work a little late this morning, so I decided to stay about 30 minutes past my usual time to make up for it. Just as I’m about to log off my supervisor calls me to discuss a document that needed to be updated and sent to leadership. She asks if I have any plans for the evening (on a Friday) and tells me we need to finish this today because waiting until next week would be “pushing it.”

A few things really piss me off about this. First, she knew the deadline for this document all week. She knew when leadership needed it, yet she waited until the last minute, just as I’m about to clock out, to make it seem urgent. There’s even a holiday on Monday, so I told her I’d be happy to take care of it first thing Tuesday morning. She then tried to insist that it had to be done today, but said she’d “just do it for me” since I couldn’t stay late which felt passive aggressive.

What makes this even more infuriating is that I checked my email, and it turns out she knew what needed to be updated as early as 11 AM that morning because I had been cc'd on emails all day. She’d even had directors reaching out throughout the week asking when the document would be ready. The fact that she waited until I was about to log off to bring this up is maddening. And the kicker? The document isn’t officially due for another week and a half.

She tried to guilt-trip me by saying we’d be cutting it close if I waited until Tuesday, but that’s ridiculous. It's a Friday before a holiday, and all the people who need to review and approve this document before it even gets to leadership aren’t even online. Nothing is going to get done until Tuesday regardless, so why make it seem like such an emergency now?

She started off the call by trying to make it seem like the task was super simple and that she “started doing it and noticed how simple it was”, but I know what’s involved—it would’ve kept me online for at least another hour. And this isn’t the first time she’s pulled something like this. It’s maybe the third time she’s tried to get me to stay late on a Friday for something that turns out not to be an emergency at all. I feel like she’s just trying to be proactive and look good in front of leadership, but I have no interest in going “above and beyond” like that for this job, especially outside of work hours.

I’m glad I stood my ground, but I still feel a little guilty because, yes, we might be cutting it close, but she’s the supervisor, and she’s known about this task for over a week. But I also feel like this is a result of her poor time management, not mine. I’ve been trying to set boundaries because she’s gotten too comfortable pulling these last-minute stunts on a Friday, but she makes it hard when she plays the “it’s urgent” card to try to get me to stay late.

Am I being unreasonable here? How do I hold these boundaries without feeling guilty every time she pulls something like this?",AccurateTonight8430,0,0.5,1,1729006261,2024-10-15 15:31:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g4ah4v/should_i_feel_guilty_that_i_didnt_stay_late_on_a/,10,2024

From international development to renewables: career advice?","Hello everyone!

 **Summary:** I have a background in International Development, where I've worked on various issues. After a period of unemployment, I joined a civil engineering company in the renewable energy sector six months ago. Now, I want to fully transition to the renewable energy industry. Although my experience in this sector has been somewhat indirect, I'm seeking advice on making a successful career shift. My goal is to apply the skills I gained in International Development—such as advocacy, communication, stakeholder engagement, and event organization—to a role in renewable energy. 

**Longer version:** I’m originally from Europe, where I studied International Relations in Geneva. My career began in the MENA region, focusing on democracy promotion and socio-economic development (event management, and stakeholder engagement). I also briefly consulted on elections in Sub-Saharan Africa, working on research. After moving to the U.S., I spent a year with a civil rights organization, where I managed a research project and a fellowship program. Following that, I collaborated with an NGO focused on poverty alleviation, mainly in business development.

Six months ago, I transitioned into a role as a general manager at a small civil engineering company involved in the renewable energy sector. My responsibilities include business development, operations, and communications. While I've gained valuable insights into the renewable project development process and the key stakeholders involved, my experience in the sector is somewhat indirect. My current company designs structures for renewable energy projects, but we’re not deeply engaged in the renewable energy work itself. Moreover, the company's long-term potential for me is limited, as I am not an engineer and my role is primarily administrative and focused on communications.

I’m now considering how I can make a more meaningful transition into the renewable energy sector, particularly within an EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) company or an organization focused on renewable energy promotion. I’d like to leverage my background in international development—especially my skills in advocacy, communication, stakeholder engagement, and regional knowledge—but I feel unsure about the concrete steps to take in this transition. I'm seeking advice from those who have successfully navigated similar career shifts or know individuals with unconventional backgrounds who found their way into the renewables sector.

1g485e5,Are hard skills overrated?,"I don’t understand the obsession with hard skills. Unless you’re a doctor or building bridges, these days, most people can do pretty much anything with online guidance — especially in so called knowledge work. I just left an engineering firm where most of my job was plugging holes left by incompetent managers. If you’d asked me what specific skills I’ve picked up, I would say none. But my tasks were varied and complex; if I needed to program a script, I would learn what I needed, implement the solution and hopefully never think about it again. I performed risk analysis, research, hardware repair, purchased equipment etc. but I wouldn’t say these are “skills” that I have, just products of sheer necessity. If I’d had to do anything else short of landing a rocket, I’m confident I would have figured it out. This leaves me in a strange position of seemingly having an endless list of skills to cite and none whatsoever. But then I think of people with so-called “hard skills” and I wonder, are they actually solving problems or just doing the same thing every day? Because in my mind “proficient at X” means whatever you’re doing, a computer can do — because it’s predictable and quantifiable, otherwise you wouldn’t be an expert. In my mind, an expert is a brain in a tank you can go to for all the answers. Well, we have that now with the internet.

Is it just a matter of onboarding and speed?

1g47vwg,"Cannot tolerate my job's excessive hourly expectations, but I can't find a new job","I am no longer happy with my current job and I have not been able to find another job for about 6 months.

My company has placed unrealistic expectations on me to be available 24/7. About every 4 weeks, I am expected to answer a pager at any time for one week (Yes, this is a 24/7 duty for one week). I'm extremely unhappy because I am not paid extra for this. I am a salaried employee, so the company can get away with this.

I've been absolutely exhausted and have not been able to have time to apply to other jobs because of this. I've sent out \~500 applications in the past 6 months and received one response that did not proceed.

At this point, I'm seriously considering just no longer answering the pages outside of normal working hours or maybe not overnight anymore. Unfortunately, I am resorting to once again being in a position of saying ""*Is the company seriously going to terminate me for not answering pages between 12AM-7AM?*"" In my defense, we have meetings regarding these pages that continue to go with no attendance and no support. About 75% of the people who are expected to show up at these meetings never show up. I am expected to be responsible for certain issues that do not even belong to me anymore.

When this situation with the paging first started, I got a second job that was overnight to compensate for the fact that my first job was not paying me extra for overnights.

The recruiter is using a company email, same as everyone else I've interviewed with. They all have a linkedin profile with verified working experience at said company, but I guess they could've spoofed the addresses. I've checked the e-mail header and it checks out. What other checks can I run?

1g45osy,22(almost 23) have no idea on what career path to take UK,"Hi, im 22 male from the UK having real trouble figuring out what to do and feel like l've wasted a lot of time doing nothing and I’ve finally decided to take action and find out what I want to actually do with my life 

At the moment I work as a Bus Driver which I enjoy for the most part but the career progression isn't something I'm interested in as it's mostly coach driving which would require me to be away from home for short periods of time which I'm not fond of.

My experience prior to this is retail jobs and working as a painter and decorator after completely my Level 2 painting and decorating at college.

I've just missed this years apprenticeships schemes which ended just a few weeks ago, and an apprenticeship is what I would like the most.

At the moment I have a job opportunity with the bus company I'm with called a 'trade up' which would allow me to become a bus engineer, they start recruiting around march next year. I like this idea because it means I won't have wasted the past year of my life here and it could be a good way to progress. The only thing that worries me is I don't think I'm suited to be an engineer, and after looking at a bunch of posts of how they are underpaid, job hopping and having to complete higher level of degrees, it just looks like a complicated career choice 

Other than that I'm looking at carpentry or electrician apprenticeships as I'm interested in these the most, even if I have to start out as a labourer first to get some experience.

1g44kzs,My team earn more than me,"Hello, I (36m) manage a team of 11 engineers. I was brought in a year ago and it is my first time as a manager. It's been a tough year and a steep learning curve but overall I get the impression the company is happy with me  and my performance so far. My boss is the engineering director and he isn't much of a manager and spends a lot of his time in meetings or on the road to customers etc.
So I'm left at home with the baby so to speak.
Due to us closing our 2nd factory early this year a number of my team had to start travelling to our original factory around an hour away from where they all live. They were given enormous travel compensation packages between £6-8k per year increases to stop them from leaving. Of course this has caused issues with motivation and management as they now have wages beyond anything they could achieve anywhere else in the same role.
I started on 45k and was given an uplifting of 1.8k in July which I am very grateful for. However from January until July I was on less than around 5 of my team and now with the uplift I am on less than 2 and one designer is on almost the same.
In any other company none of these people would anything near their line manager but as I'm new and not got the experience I've not felt that my worth is above £50k yet. However due to what the team is on I feel I've no other choice. It doesn't bother me from a direct award for my work point of view but knowing my team who have vastly less responsibilities than I do are earning the same or more for less stressful work is really bothering me. 
Any advice on how to go forward? I've booked a meeting in next Monday asking for a yearly review even if this is informal I can gauge what they think and the likelihood of getting an uplift. 
To replace me a candidate would be asking mid £50ks and then the agency fees etc. ",DDBKAHUNA,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1728988484,2024-10-15 10:34:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g44kzs/my_team_earn_more_than_me/,10,2024

1g44ds1,Advice on starting in a new industry?,"I recently started a new role with zero knowledge and experience in the industry I am in. A previous colleague asked me to apply as they wanted to work with me and train me, so they assured me I didn't have to worry that I didn't have any experience in the work we'd be doing.

It's been a little over a month and I have mainly been shadowing my boss to meetings with clients. While I understand the nature of the business and the role on a surface level, there is no time to give me hands-on training on the internal and technical processes of the company. All the seniors in a similar role as mine are loaded with projects and meetings, most especially my boss who hired me.

I want to give the work a chance because I am really open to growing and learning. However, there is no one who can really teach or train me at this point and I just feel like I'm floating right now. It's been a little over a month since I joined, and it feels so heavy for me that I am unable to make any major contributions to the company. It makes me feel like what they're paying me is going to waste. In addition, I can feel the rest of the members on our team slightly judging that I am not as loaded in terms of projects as them. Moreover, they all seem to be the type who make work their lives. I am not into that lifestyle anymore, as I prioritize work-life balance above everything else.

1g4383n,Leaving a job after 2 months?,"Hi all, you’ve probably had these posts come up often but I am completely stumped and would like some advice.

Recently I just started a full time admin and this is my second month into the job, and to be quite frank i hate it. For context, I recently had a performance review not actually about my performance but about mainly about my attitude and how my colleagues perceived me which i thought was quite strange. No good things were said in the review other than, i’m doing an okay job but that I’m very abrupt (i can understand that I can be but i don’t do it on purpose) and it is a huge shift from me working in hospitality to a full time 9-5 at a desk. After that performance review the vibe and atmosphere has changed towards me almost i can’t really pin point it, it’s almost as if it’s just become a toxic workplace and becoming cliquey. Whenever i try to do small talk with the people i work with, whether that being interested in what they’re doing, asking them questions about the stuff they’ve told me about it’s just very blunt and nothing about me then they turn around and expand on the conversation that i asked them about with someone else (such a small thing i’m aware). A few examples include: being left out of conversations, the room is completely quiet when i walk in etc. It’s actually making me feel like crap majority of the time, i’m aware that work isn’t meant to be for friends or whatever but something like that is actually so heartbreaking. I’m not too sure if this is a ploy for them to make me leave out of my own will instead of letting me go, but it may be me just overthinking it.

I’m thinking about potentially leaving this job because I can’t lie it’s actually affecting my mental health a fair bit and feel like it’s just getting toxic and i quite frankly hate it. I don’t even like the job itself at all. 

Since it’s only been two months at the job, do i just stick it out? or leave the job as soon as i find a new one? And the other thing is how would i go about it? and if i find another job do i put this current job on my CV and just classify that it was a FTC (it wasn’t) or just leave it out?

Need to understand whether I should switch from a fairly stable job with a good pay but working with a micromanager and has no growth prospects vs. a Seed stage startup with a leadership role and a slight paycut (since equity is only paper money at this point) YoE: 14

Context: I have started a job about 5 months ago with a product company offering flexible work but my manager is too immature and always micromanages which is making me uncomfortable and adding stress though the work though the work itself is NOT so stressful

I feel like punching in his face till he bleeds to death! I carry so much frustration and look for an excuse to not work by applying sick leaves etc.

The daily stand up meetings which take up my first half of the day make me feel enslaved and feeling I'm in a shithile I cannot get out of.

Even if this guy is on leave, he just keeps following up on every damn thing constantly and that's adding up to my frustration

I have been looking out and found an offer from a seed funded startup in a senior leadership role with similar payment except the stocks which is just paper money until the company goes public

I'm here seeking advice, success stories, anything to help me figure out how I'm going to pull off achieving my dream.
First the backstory,
I (31 F) am the provider for my family and I love being the provider. I'm a mom and a CT technologist. I've always wanted to ultimately be in sonography but when I applied to college at age 23 (and nieve) the school told me that I had to complete the radiography program (xray) before I even had a chance to get into the sonography program. Half way through radiography I found out that wasn't true at all. Just a scheme to get more money it seems. I've been in my field now for going on 5 years and I'm ready to take my career in a new direction (sonography).
Here's the problem, sonography school is essentially a full time job on its own. Being the provider, I don't have a choice but to maintain a full time job to pay the bills. 
I honestly can't see how doing both could work without giving up being there for my child and that's non negotiable. I take pride in the mother I am above anything.

I work extremely hard, but have always gotten good feedback and feel I have grown quite a bit. My one issue with my day-to-day is my boss is a bottleneck. Everyone needs him all the time. So as I'm trying to learn new tables, do new ad-hoc requests, I'm frequently lost because 2-3 vital intricacies in my queries aren't accounted for because the only one who knows about them in the company is him So as I get better at SQL and all, I often feel like a deer in the headlights. My teammates have echoed the sentiment.

But what I really hate is the corporate culture.  New leadership came in last year and it's a lot. We have a town hall every three weeks. There's a lot of executives funneling out, which I guess is to be expected with a new CEO. Benefits like remote work are gone for anyone who lives near an office and we get an email each week about some big new change. Every town hall there's some reason they'll explain why we may or may not get our annual bonus payouts (I've never received my full one in years). To be honest, it's tiring. But also, I wonder how different it is elsewhere. I look aside from all of it because I do really appreciate my boss. 

Concurrently, I just finished grad school - got a Master's in Computer Science with a 3.7 GPA. I ended up not loving a lot of the true CS work so I pivoted all my electives to Data Science, which I enjoyed more. And those loans are coming due and there is no option for student loan forgiveness at this point, and I can't count on that. Right now, what my bill is (that I start paying next month) will sap all the ""extra"" money I have in my checks. I currently make about $78k. I don't have a ton of excess money - I also have other bills, including medical and some family support so it's not all that it seems. But as the first loans due date draws near and how I've felt sort of underpaid now relative to my new skills and education, I put myself out there on the market. I'd say interest has been strong given the market. 

And today, I got an offer. I found a company with about 3.7 stars on Glassdoor, where the only concerns I walked away from were really layoffs-related. Which isn't nothing by any stretch - but my company lays people off too. I hadn't heard of them prior to applying, but they're reputable. And the offer is to be a Senior Analyst for $100k. All standard benefits, unlimited PTO, 18 holidays, unlimited sick, and some stock options. Honestly, from a self-worth perspective, I needed this. Just felt nice to hit that benchmark, especially because I spent my entire 20s being lowballed when I had no options. Now, I have some leverage - I'm not desperate to leave where I am and I continue to have interviews lined up. I had two interviews with these people - pretty rapid fire panels with all prospective team members and they seemed nice. Maybe less ""fun"" than my current team. They're a little older than me (I'm 29 - I got 40s - 50s vibes), a little more ""buttoned-up,"" but pretty friendly. I've typically worked in places that have good name value that people take less money to work for just so they can say they work for them. This is sort of the inverse. More of a quarter-zip / pullover vibe vs a ballcap and t-shirt like I'm used to. But for a lot of money, I'll do whatever anyone wants. 

I'm a super-nervous, anxious over-thinker and I wonder if I'm underselling this great opportunity. I think I'd have so many less sleepless nights knowing I can seriously put a dent in my student loans and that my quality of life wouldn't suffer. But again, love my boss and my team - and maybe that's not healthy. I'm tired, feel very underpaid, and feel there's a really tough bottleneck to be the analyst I need to be in my role. It's just a big jump and I'd be starting over and leaving a place I left with some real equity. I've never discussed a promotion with them, but don't think it'd happen. Also, this is a fully remote role - which is #1 to me. No offices where I live, no risk of an issue, it's all in my paperwork. Other benefits align where I am now (although the current company is taking away unlimited PTO next year to an hours accrual system). 

ATLDR;  few thoughts...

* Is the jump from $80k - $100k significant enough to start over? Am I really underpaid
* Is there a way I can negotiate salary? I've never come from a place of leverage where I didn't need the job. If they offered me $115k, I'd leave on the spot, how can I ask about that? I feel like not being desperate kind of changes things. 
* Is there an opportunity to offer my current company my services in a part-time role - just at least maintaining reporting I built out? They've tried to do this in the past with consultants we had on - could I do this for pocket change? Is it common?

Sorry, I know this is a lot. I'm just nervous. Nervous about negotiating salary, whether this is the right move (I think it's just nerves). I didn't get bad vibes from the call, it sounded like a lot of work but I do a lot of work now.

1g3z23g,I’m going crazy ,"Losing my mind right now.

So recently I started my senior year of high school in a public school. (Recently moved from a small private school with shitty.. everything, to a regular public school for my final year in high school) And now that I’m this far in my life, not only am I super confused, but I’m also so scared because I have little to no idea of what the hell I am supposed to be doing.

To make this clear I’m 17 and most people already got something figured out, but I’m over here with just a dream of double majoring in finances and accounting because I heard it paid well and it sits right with I’m interested in. But the complicated part is the following: 
1. I do not know what to expect or do to even start college life after high school.
2. I would LOVE. A full ride for a 4 year college but to be completely honest, I don’t know how to make that happen either! It’s not like I’m the dumbest kid ever either but, like stated before, I didn’t have much diversity my whole life till now, so now I’m freaking out realizing that I should’ve been doing AP and honor classes.
3. I have somewhat an idea of what college I wish to go to but all the numbers drive me crazy, and I’ve always been ok with numbers because they never seemed scary, but since I don’t know anything about how student loans or scholarships even work, I fear for my life of what those numbers even mean.

So in conclusion, if anyone knows how to basically dummy down all the regular stuff I’m supposed to know by now for me, I’d appreciate it. Because no amounts of YouTube videos or school counselors help (I DONT EVEN KNOW HOW SCHOOL COUNSELORS WORK EITHER)!!
If it’s worth anything my gpa is around 3.2 I’ve passed every class and school year my whole life B and A grades, and all my SAT were slightly above average and recently my state exams were also passing. 

I’m just so lost lmao, please send help.

1g3xm6t,"Mechanical Engineering - Should I accept a job that I like, but might not directly open up other opportunities?","So, I recently graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Mechatronics in 2024. I have had two prior internships at a defense contractor, and I found that everyone around me was doing like 0.01% of an interesting design tasks and it was mostly just administrative work. I know not all office jobs are like that, but it really discouraged me from working in a company where I knew I would spend four hours a day watching the clock. In college I was in an engineering club where we designed and manufactured an electric vehicle. I really enjoyed working in a small, dynamic team environment and doing actual mechanical design not just menial administrative work.

Fast forward, I graduated and have a job offer from a company that does van retrofits. I really like the company structure and the people that work there and the work I would be doing. It's a small group of \~10 people. In this job I would be spending around 70% doing journeyman/manufacturing and 30% doing product design. I think I would be gaining valuable skills and be challenged and would enjoy the job.

However,

1. It doesn't pay that well (50k a year in a city in California)
2. I'm worried it might not put me on a path towards more ""official"", ""fancy"", ""big boy"" engineering jobs.

So, basically my question for all of you lovely engineers is how much do things like job title and working in a role where I am doing 100% design work matter in my early career. Am I over thinking this? Or do you think there is value in trying to break into a larger industry like HVAC or automotive or semiconductor fab.

Pre-edit:

1. My expenses are relatively low because I don't really eat out, live with my girlfriend, etc. So I can support myself and still save money making 50k, but I would like to eventually make more than 50k a year because I might one day want to own a gold fish",jar_jar_blinks98,1,1.0,1,1728959721,2024-10-15 02:35:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g3xm6t/mechanical_engineering_should_i_accept_a_job_that/,10,2024
1g3xc4y,Am I in a position to negotiate?,"Hello everyone. This is my first post ever, so I apologize if the information is all over the place. I recently interviewed for a position and was offered a full time job upon graduation. I am currently in my senior year of college. The salary I was offered is 75k in MCOL city. I want to know if I'm in a position to negotiate my base salary up to 85k. According to glassdoor, it seems like the average total pay for this position in the last two years has been around 83,000-84,000. Here are the qualifications for the job:

* Bachelor’s degree in business, preferably *accounting* or *finance*, with a minimum 2.75 GPA
* **6+** hours of accounting or equivalent graduate-level coursework
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills
* Strong organizational and time management skills
* Previous banking experience and knowledge of bank products
* Proficient in Microsoft applications
* **Additional Preferred Skills:**
* GPA of 3.0 or better in your major
* Undergraduate or graduate coursework emphasizing financial statement analysis
* 9+ hours of Accounting, including Intermediate Accounting I, or equivalent graduate level Accounting, or financial analysis

I will graduate with a **two** bachelor's, one in *Finance*, and one in *Accounting*. As you can see in the job posting, they prefer students with either one of my majors, but I'm coming in with the knowledge of both. By the time I graduate, I'll have taken **20**+ credit hours in accounting coursework. I believe I have above-average written and verbal communication skills. I also have good organizational and time management skills. I did a credit analyst internship recently, so I also have banking experience and knowledge of what a bank's products are. I've used Microsoft applications consistently throughout college, especially word and excel, so I think I'm good there as well.

My reasoning for possibly being in a position to negotiate stems from the fact that I exceed many of the qualifications required by this role. I also have a great track record of academic achievements. I have a good GPA and have made Dean's and President's list multiple times. I'd also like to mention that the interview process was pretty tough, so them extending me an offer a day after interviewing me tells me that they saw something in me. My question is, would you say that I'm in a position to negotiate? I think I am, but since this is my first job offer straight out of college, I am unsure as to how I should approach this. I've typed out what I want to say to the hiring manager when we communicate, since I only have until Friday to either accept/reject the offer.",OnceHeartless,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1728958833,2024-10-15 02:20:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g3xc4y/am_i_in_a_position_to_negotiate/,10,2024

1g3wzy1,Stay or Go,"

I apologize this may be long, I’ve been dwelling on this for a while… I originally posted this in r/WorkAdvice
For some context, I work at a home care agency and had completed six years last Thursday. I’ve played many roles since I started, and I recently had to question my position. When I had signed up, I was originally going to be a home health aide however the patient I was going to care for went elsewhere and I quickly became the Field Intake Coordinator and was given one of the company cars the third day of employment. I was the Field Intake Coordinator for the first two years and then became a Sales Case Worker, bringing in cases and basically meeting/exceeding my sales quota. There were some inconsistencies with the positions, but I took it as opportunities and had no issues.

Last year in April, the company got bought out and all of the original higher-ups as well as the owner basically left or just been quiet. Before this takeover happened, I had been promoted to the Sales Team Supervisor. January of this year, the Sales Team Manager quit, and I was automatically promoted to this role. However, they “couldn’t give me the title officially” due to the fact that they did not expect him to leave and upper management wasn’t looking to hire people right now and were laying off employees, which included 4 of the Sales Caseworkers due to performance. 

Due to the lack of staff, I diligently worked both roles of being the Sales Team Manager, and also making sure I bring in my sales quota as a Sales Caseworker. Over time, I became overwhelmed with both roles and I had brought it up multiple times if the roles were supposed to be separated due to the fact that the previous Sales Team Manager did not have to also meet his quota even despite lack of staff however it fell on deaf ears.

In August, they had hired a new employee which was introduced to me as a Sales Caseworker however, she was managed by the Business Development Manager, so I did not have to go over her training and she did not have to report to me. In September, approximately four weeks of silence after her hire, she made a mistake to which I told her the procedures and protocols of said mistake. We promptly had a sales meeting brought about by the Coordination Department Manager, which included that Coordination Manager, me, the Sales Caseworkers and her- it excludes the upper management as it was supposed to be a regular meeting between the two departments. We had regular discussions until it came to light that she was hired to specifically replace me and then proceeded to tell off the other sales team caseworkers 
(that have been working with me for years) what their job and responsibilities were and they became just as confused as I was.

Obviously upset, I messaged my immediate supervisors and managers to shed light on this. They did not respond right away and told me to resume my role as usual. Three weeks go by as the replacement happily “co-managed” the team as the uppers allowed it and during this time, one of my senior Sales caseworker left the company due to the inconsistencies as well as the replacement stealing her cases multiple times throughout the month of September; I had brought that up as well to which the replacement dismissed it as just her doing business and the uppers did nothing.

 They finally got back to me last Thursday and stated that they “promoted” her to replace me to lessen the burden of the roles and responsibilities of being the Sales Team Manager as a resolution to my previous inquiries about having both roles. They stated to me that I will be a Sales Caseworker so I could just bring in my quota  as I was the one of the few that managed to consistently bring new leads for them amongst the chaos of the new changes ( the changes made it difficult to bring new cases in and a lot of patients and home health aides were upset and chose to go elsewhere). They figured I would be happy with this position as they cannot give me the original position of the Field Intake Coordinator and I was already doing sales. None of their statements and the timing made any sense because the replacement stated that she was hired since August to have my role specifically, but they stated to me that they recently decided in September that it would be best for her to take my role. I asked them why did it take them so long and they apologized for the lack of communication as they didn’t know what role would fit me best which I found funny because they did not consult with me at all until that moment. I was not pleased with the response I got and told them that I would not want to be a Sales Caseworker due to the inconsistencies however, I was interested in possibly growing with the company in other departments. They stated that the only available position was Sales and it would a miracle that there would be another position available because the other positions were currently going through the on boarding process. 

On Friday I received a call stating that they had a position open in the HR Department and that they will be talking to me Tuesday (tomorrow) regarding this role.

Now, which brings this question … the senior sales caseworker that had left, went to another company and told me that they had an opening for me and would love to interview me. I am hurt that the company I’ve worked so hard for seems to disregard my efforts and I am finding myself leaning towards this offer however, it is not a guarantee that I will get this position.. 

Should I still find out what my current company is offering me in the HR Department? Or hold off until I have the interview with the new company? 

I am so sorry in advance for any confusing content, my mind has been in shambles for months and it’s been the stressing me more so in the past couple weeks. I appreciate any insight I can receive.

1g3wzsl,Engineering - What Circumstance Lead You to Ask for a Raise / Change in Title? ,"Degree: BS Mechanical Engineering (2.5 YOE)

Job Title: Manufacturing Process Engineer (7 months at current company)

Salary: 80K (Southern California)

Job Circumstance: Currently I am 1 of 4 engineers at my company 1 of 2 on the production site (2 are off site and don't get any face-to-face with the production team). My job description is to develop processes for the company and so far I have been asked to make 2 and I have completed 2. To be honest it's not my dream job but I really enjoy all other aspects of my role.

For instance: we have recently purchased a 3D printer and I have gotten that operational and now has lead to a current running total of 10 shop aid requests. This is something that I really enjoy doing as it's a lot of working with production, designing, and testing my designs with production. Additionally, my company has offered to send me to a local community college to learn hands-on CNC machining since this is a big aspect of our company and we are currently without a machinist.

For my situation, do you believe it is worth asking for a raise to better compensate me for my recent increase of work load (since 3 weeks ago 2 onsite engineers have left the company), or a change in title to ""Tool Engineer"" to better align my career goals and interests. Or should I wait until the company stabilizes from the loss of the 2 engineers and a new financial year begins?

Work guides, SOPs, overall ideas of that role C wants in their work and I’ve been given nothing. What should I do? 

I’m super overwhelmed, I’ve essentially had 3 roles in less than 8 months. I’m pretty flexible but I need training of some kind and doing crappy work and have someone edit it is my idea of training. 

This role also doesn’t generally go to people that are contracts with limited experience like this so it seems they are unprepared to break it down for trainees like us (in one of several contracts that was moved to this role).

I am 22, I’ve worked in the homeless field since I was 18, I want to change my career but I’m not sure how or to what.
My interests are video games, I love chess, psychology and true crime, but I’m burnt out from working with homeless people, and people in general, I’m autistic so it’s a strange path for me to have taken but I found it interesting and the psychology aspect was intriguing. But I end up being socially and emotionally burnt out too often to see this as a life long job despite me being honestly good at it, any ideas or any people who had been in a similar situation?

Are there any outlets that cover how to work in corporate? Some questions I'd love ideas on:

* How to mentally and emotionally handle the difficulties of corporate work?
   * understanding that a lot of work done is kinda pointless.
* How to get promoted/ raises?
* How to work well with others (and not rock the boat in a bad way)?
* Insight into leadership decisions and how to use this to my advantage?

Worked my way up to a Senior Tax Analyst position within 18 months, and stayed there for almost 9 years. Earlier this year I took a new job at an HR & Tax consulting firm as a Tax Consultant. Unlike my last job this job was remote, extremely flexible, and came with a 67% bump in hourly rate. Only downside being, now I was paid in billable hours instead of scheduled hours. It was great for a while, I was consistently getting 35-40 hours a week, management assured me that it always stays like that. It was going good until the firm was bought out and the work started drying up. From getting 35-40, it went to 25, 16, now I’m lucky to break 5. Recently my manager also started to target me, accused me of inflated billing, billing and not complete the work. I was able to provide documentation to prove my work, but she finds something new every other day and I spend hours taking screenshots and writing down explanations. I’ve been applying around but only being here 7 months and with the current job market I’m not having any luck. On top of that the job is not even paying me enough to cover the deductions, and I’m having to write them a check to cover the premiums. 

I’ve never been fired, or actually job searched before. I was recruited for the first job, and this firm also recruited me.

Now with my manager keep targeting me I’m thinking it might be better to quit before they fire me, that way I can have a clean record. But I’m also worried that quitting without a job lined up may make it harder on the job search.

So the question is, what should I do? 

I’d appreciate any advice, this has been going on for 2.5 months now, and the stress is killing me. ",karalis007,1,1.0,0,1728950736,2024-10-15 00:05:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g3uop4/how_bad_would_being_unemployed_hurt_my_job_search/,10,2024

Some qualities I do want - busy but some slow days here and there, insurance, good pay, personal interactions, critical thinking, working in a team, but also being able to do my own thing, good work-life balance. Some qualities I do not want - 9-5, same thing over and over again, no potential for growth, taking work home. 

I have worked in healthcare before as a CNA during Covid which I enjoyed, but got burnt out doing work and school while dealing with mental health issues.

Currently, I work in an elementary school as a para for 4th and 5th math and science and honestly dread going to work. I'm learning that waking up to go to work EVERY SINGLE DAY is just not something I want to do. Plus the pay is real bad. Like real bad. 

I keep tossing between going back to nursing school or just seeing teaching through, but I feel like my mind changes almost daily.

—my position at my org is secure, but I have concerns about the viability of the org long term. 
—I believe I could be successful in either, but have more interest in data.

so this ""trainer"" of mine got so offended this morning that he immediately went and told our boss who convened a meeting with me, the ""trainer,"" our boss, and my bosses boss. 4 of us.

from the get-go it felt like it was a 3 on 1. the ""trainer"" kept harping on safety safety safety BUT as a guise for micro-managing.

trainer emphasized my ""status"" as a ""trainee"" multiple times which i think was a ploy to gain leverage and to make himself bew viewed as the superior who can do no wrong.

he twisted my words and said ""your body language and demeanor today said ""dont talk to me."" im like, well did i say that? no. so why are you pretending thats what i said (he definitely misquoted by several times in the meeting).

my whole thing is this: if you arte training someone to do a task, you shut the fuck up after a certain number of times directing them how to do it, ***to see if they, for themselves, can actually do it***. wild concept right?

and this is my biggest gripe: he tried to compare apples to oranges, the entire time.

he would say ""i HAVE to monitor you and look over your shoulder"" which is VERY different than preempting every single mouse-click i make for months on end. those are in no way the same things. i had to correct him 3 times that i am NOT talking about ""being monitored"" - i am talking about you having enough patience to STFU long enough to have some autonomy.

anytime he made a point, my boss would jump in and back him up. so that right there tells me everything i need to know. 

the ONLY good point was that my bosses boss ended up saying ""so it sounds like we need to give you more autonomy and discretion"" and a few more things along those lines. ive never heard a boss be that understanding. but he was also the same guy that hinted at not wanting to get HR involved which is of course a low-key way of saying we might shit-can you over this.

oh and another note: i told the ""trainer"" that you might have 14 years or 30 or whatever in this profession but that doesnt mean you know how to teach worth a lick to which he said ""woww.....wowwwwwww.....""

i said look, i have a master's, ive taught high school which means i probably know a thing or two about *teaching* people, and the ""trainer"" immediately fired back with ""ok and im microsoft blah blah blah certified"" like whaaaat?

all in all, it's time to go.

1g3t7d1,Alone in the office… Again. Seeking advice for when boss doesn’t come to work.,"Somebody. Anybody. Please, have any of you ever experienced your bosses just…. Not come in to work? I need advice. 

I work for a small professional company (2 bosses (owners), and a few other employees.

Because we are small, we have pretty flexible time allowances, meaning we can work from home if we feel sick, leave early to take an appointment, etc. I do enjoy the work culture. But that’s if everyone is actually at work.

For the past 6 months or so, my office has been plagued by supervisory miscommunication and absenteeism. They’ll leave early, come in late, and seemingly make any excuse to just.. not be there. Like something super important will come up and they’ve gotta go. Recently for example, my bosses never came in in the morning, and it took my other coworker to investigate the matter to tell us they weren’t coming in and were both taking the day off. 

Since we are a small company we all naturally wear a lot of hats; but when clients call us and ask to speak to boss 1 or boss 2, I really don’t know what to tell them because 80% of the time they are unavailable.

When they are in the office, they talk about how much they have to do and how stressed they are and how behind they are on everything.

I get it.. it’s literally their own business. Sometimes personal lives get crazy and lead to disruptions in work life. But as a chronic issue where stuff is happening a few times a week, it’s been really hard to stay motivated when the people I’m supposed to be looking up to can’t even show up for their employees, let alone tell them they’re not going to be there.

Maybe I’m too high strung and can’t stand a “flexible, healthy environment,” but the lack of consistency and communication is killing me and my work ethic. 

Has anyone had any experiences similar to mine? I’m feeling lost and somewhat frustrated. And, I feel if I communicate this I’ll just be shooting myself in the foot. TIA.

1g3svly,Career Advice - Property,"Hey Reddit fam,

 I’d love your advice on my current situation.

I work in Commercial Property Management, managing offices in Melbourne CBD. I started as an Assistant Property Manager for a year before transitioning to a Valuations/Research Analyst/ role at a reputable international real estate consultant/advisor for 2.5 years. I thoroughly enjoyed the advisory realm. However, I recently returned to property management in April this year after receiving a $25K salary increase, something my previous employer could not offer.

When I started in April, I managed a personal portfolio of 4 office buildings (circa 15,248 sqm) but also assisted the asset manager with 7 additional buildings.

Recently, my employer was appointed to manage a large CBD complex of around 51,000 sqm of office space, and I’ve been handed the reigns alongside a senior property manager.

I completed my 6-month probation with flying colors a couple of weeks ago. I haven't received a salary increase despite my expanded role and responsibilities. While I understand it’s only been 6 months (I was not expecting a raise based on the probation), I feel that my performance and the increased portfolio size warrant a discussion at the minimum.

**Question:**

If you were in my position, would you wait the full 12 months for a rise, or would you push for an increase based on performance and the substantial increase in responsibilities?

FYI – I make $94K package, which is considered below market for commercial property managers. Virtually no bonuses on lease renewals as well.

1g3s7dn,Am I employable in Northern California even though I have terrible work history?,"Hello, I have decided to start my life over again and to get a fresh start. I current live in Texas but am looking for a new start in Northern California. Here is my situation. My work history began when I was living in Arizona in 2019. First job I had, I was fired after 2.5 weeks because I left my post when I was supposed to be in training. The second job I had, I was fired after 11 months because I was dishonest and lied about completing my training and the company received multiple complaints about me being counterproductive with my work. They claimed I committed fraud when I falsely signed off on trainings. In addition, I was not meeting deadlines and submitting paperwork in months late. The third and fourth jobs I had, I didn't get fired, but I felt like I was forced to resign because I was about to get fired. The third job, it was because I submitted my paperwork late overall and was a little counterproductive. The fourth job, I was caught not following company rules by a coworker and she reported me to our supervisor. They almost set up a termination meeting too after being written up twice. I decided to resign. Aside from those jobs, I was in three internships, left all three of them on bad terms. The first one was again for being counterproductive. The second one I completed, but left on bad terms and was written up in the process for not following procedures and going against my supervisor's instructions. The third one, I was doing well in, but due to family reasons, I needed to move to Texas and just left right in the middle of the internship. So I have been out of a stable job since May 2023. Every job I apply to now, I am rejected. I got some interviews, some went really well, was still rejected. Not only that, but I was put on all of these employer's, ""Do No Hire"" list. The only offers I got were with Amazon because it was one of those instant offer side gigs, a crappy part time hotel job at a hotel that was under major renovations and I would have had to work in a super noisy environment, It paid $12 an hour. Lowes because they hire anyone ($15 an hour), and this company where literally all the employees are immigrants (not saying the company). All except this most recent one were only part time offers. With Amazon, I stopped showing up and eventually resigned. I am re-hireable with them thank goodness. With Lowes, I would not show up, or come in late, had a really bad attitude about the job because I knew I didn't belong there, and with this current job, I only showed up once, but never came back. That employer is so abusive, I'm never going back.

My resume shows both my jobs and internships under the work section. It looks like I never spent so much time at any employer. The longest was 1 year and 6 months. It shows so many inconsistencies. It looks like a big red flag when you look at it. I don't have any good references either. It is the city I live in. Every time I apply for a good job, I'm rejected. Even a Starbucks job sent me a formal rejection letter. Is my work history really this bad? I also would apply in other States and I got better responses. In this Texas city I live in, I burnt all my bridges, and I want to move.

With this said, what are employers in The Bay Area looking for in a resume? I only have history with one employer there. They once almost interviewed me, then rejected me right after asking for my availability. It was strange. It was like, ""when are you available?"" Then I got, ""thank you very much for your application, but we are moving forward, and you were not selected."" Do you think maybe they called my past employers to ask about me? I still have a high chance in The Bay Area for employment. I choose Northern California because I want a fresh start. San Diego is my second choice, but I'd rather live in San Jose. I am planning on taking an instant hire warehouse job temporarily as a way to live there until I find what I want.

Prior to this, I worked as an English Teacher for 9 years and a high school Librarian/Yearbook Advisor for 4. My degrees are in English Teaching with a minor in School Library and a master's in Creative Writing. For the past 15 months, I've been responsible for the advertising revenue for a local paper, amongst many other roles for this newspaper. We are slowly transitioning from print to digital and I don't think the company has a future and I don't particularly like selling advertising. Despite this, I'm making more money now than I was teaching (in the 60,000-70,000 range). This job has also given me a good level of freedom.

Feeling their was no future in my current role, I applied for the job of purchasing specialist at our local university. They have been calling my references this week after a solid interview. I think it would be a good fit for me and wouldn't involve sales. It's obviously not like teaching, which I wanted to get out of, and it is with a stable organization. The problem is that is pays $27 an hour so I'm looking at a 10,000 per year pay decrease. It will definitely have better benefits and retirement, but I have no idea about pay raises over time. Also, this job has a 6-month probationary period and then I can work full-time remote.

My boss at my current job sounds like they want to keep in some capacity outside of sales and pay me a similar salary, but it just feels like an unstable organization that is constantly in flux.

1g3s4pf,Top Values In Your Career?,"If you could rewind the hands of time, what would you prioritize while building your career? There are a few different things you can optimize for, with different pro's/con's and tradeoffs for each. One of the worst things in life is to accomplish your goals and realize you wasted time pursuing the wrong things. Overly simplistic here, but I see 3 main things you can optimize for in your career.

Optimizing for wealth > Working 80 hours a week to chase a tech IPO or investment banking - potentially buy back your time later in life. Most will probably trash on this, but there are undeniably benefits IF it works out. The con's are you might find your work completely meaningless/soul-sucking, or spend 10+ years doing this for it to NOT work out.

Optimizing for meaning/fulfillment in your work > working as a therapist/guidance counselor or for a non-profit, for example. Sacrificing income, and thus lifestyle and freedom. Able to be proud of yourself/your life's work.

Optimizing for freedom > Location freedom, time freedom, flexibility. Typically self-employed/business owner. Becoming a freelance computer programmer, working remote and only working 9 months a year let's say. Or being a small business owner (a few specific businesses meet this criteria, most absolutely do not provide more flexibility than you'd get as a W2 employee).

I know it's not an 'either or' amongst these things, but I'm curious how you'd rank these: Income. Meaning. Lifestyle. ",Consistent-Ride-3258,1,1.0,1,1728943473,2024-10-14 22:04:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g3s4pf/top_values_in_your_career/,10,2024
1g3ricp,"Unemployed for 3+ months, don’t know what to do","Hey all, I need some advice on what do forward. I’m a 25M who graduated from Software Engineering last year. Got layed off from a consulting position back in July after little more than a year in the company. 

This is my first time being unemployed and by God is it stressful. I’ve been trying to keep optimistic. Keeping track of job applications, circling back after a couple of weeks, but alas not a SINGLE callback or interview. 

After the first month I opted on looking for a job outside my degree (honestly something that I could see that can sustain me economically for the foreseeable future until I can find something that fits), but living in a college town seems to be hurting me than most, as most places are looking for students. It’s been more than 3 months and still nothing. 

Around mid-September I decided pursuing a career in the Video Game Industry. As an already established Soft. Eng., over the past month I’ve been doing small video game prototypes to showcase my skills and build a portfolio. Plan on hopefully have a complete game for March 2025 for a conference near by. 

The problem is, my unemployment will run out soon enough leaving me with no income and no way to sustain myself unless I move back to my parent’s home. Making a whole mess of my career and relationship. 

Should I just give up on trying to pursue a career in gaming and focus on just being an IT professional?",Alphomega_,1,1.0,0,1728941829,2024-10-14 21:37:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g3ricp/unemployed_for_3_months_dont_know_what_to_do/,10,2024

1g3qccz,Resigned with immediate effect today - advice reg reference + laptop reset and return,"I resigned with immediate effect today.

Def a toxic workplace, a cult, but they see me as a problem.

They have given me a phone number I should be able to contact for a reference in the future/when I need it. I'm wondering, should I ask/push already now to receive some form of reference that confirms I've been working there between these dates that I have? How often are references asked for in the UK in 2024? And should I ensure or try for it to go via me so I can read them before I send anything further?

It is possible I would receive a bad reference, as I've had a lot of absence due to a diagnosed illness that required surgery recently plus less than a year ago, and the company hasn't been supportive. They've been gaslighting me more or less throughout and this has impacted my motivation (but I've still performed my job to a really high level - gradually I guess it was just apparent I wasn't a follower of the cult anymore).

For that reason, I guess the best strategy would be to get a document that confirms I've worked there, but no comments on anything else as I know it wouldn't be fair - am I thinking right about this? Or is that in itself very telling to a future employer?

Secondly, should I factory reset the laptop before I return it? I've deleted personal rant notes etc (which I know shouldn't be written on a work laptop in the first place) but I can't seem to delete all the slack conversations or other data. Aside from my frustration with the company, its leaders' and the average colleague's apparent incompetence (which I've expressed in some messages to work friends throughout the years) I have nothing to hide.

1g3px4y,Delayed my notice period and now have to work two jobs for a month: help!,"Writing this in despair and fear. 

I started a new position in August but found it boring. The week after, I got a call from a bigger company abroad that offered me a position starting November. I was sure I wanted to take on this opportunity and signed the contract. 

In the meantime, I stayed in my current employer because I had bills to pay and couldn't afford myself to stay unemployed for three months. Overtime, I started liking my current job and felt comfortable there. I realized that the pay is actually nice and the colleagues are cool. I started doubting my choice and changed my mind a thousand times. I even liked the job duties. 

Ultimately, I decided to respect the committment I took towards the new employer and resigned on the first days of October. Where I live, the notice period shall be given before the 30th of the month, otherwise you need to work for a full calendar month. The manager told me that I can have the flexibility to finish all tasks for November and that I do not need to respect the 9-5 working times.

I am worried for two main things:
1. Both of my contracts have an exclusivity clause and it could lead to a conflict of interest.

2. Even if none of them find out, I wonder: what will happen with my mental health? How can i prove myself during the probationary period in my new job when I have to work the nights/weekends for my old one?

I am terrified and have no idea what to do. Tried to push back the start date of the new job , but unsuccessfully. I was afraid to say the reason because I thought they could just rescind. Now I really think I shouldn't take on the new job and ask politely my manager to stay. I know I f--- up and want to get out of the mess.

I graduated nine months ago and completed two internships—one in WordPress and another in PHP Laravel development—as well as a cybersecurity bootcamp. After a long wait, I received two job offers:

The first is a paid cybersecurity internship lasting 1-2 months, with the potential for a full-time position if I perform well. They assured me that I would receive support and monitoring during this time.

The second offer is for a web development position, but the hiring manager emphasized that the role requires two years of experience. He asked if I could guarantee that my work would be equivalent to that of someone with two years of experience, as I would be the first employee in the newly formed web development team. He mentioned that I wouldn't receive assistance and would need to rely on myself to learn quickly.

I explained my internships and courses, and he said he would review my GitHub and get back to me. However, I immediately regretted this decision.

I’m torn between accepting the web development position and taking a chance on myself, or sticking with the cybersecurity internship.

I have a younger brother. He will start his bachelor's when I finish mine. I am tired being a burden to my family and this is another reason i want to start earning, so that they can focus on his college and fees, and they don't worry about me.

Got an offer that is $4/hour ($26) with an increase of an additional $1 per hour pending a good 90 day review ($27) to go back to doing dimensional inspection. 

At the NDT company I’m only making $22 because I started as a trainee though in the interview was told I’d be at $30 by time I made it to my level 2 certification (who knows how long). I recently passed my level 1 exams 2 weeks ago which is supposed to yield me a $3 raise but I have still yet to see that and I’m getting antsy as the only reason I accepted is because of the promised raises. 

In this case would yall make the switch? Admittedly this last year I’ve done a lot of job hopping (4 jobs within 1 year) and this will have to be somewhere I stick for awhile if I do make the leap.

1g3ocn4,"Going back to school, I have a few ideas of what I want and no idea where to go from here. ","I went to community college for one year about 4 years ago. I moved away, and then moved back home, so the plan is to go back to the community college, and I still have no clue what it is I really want to do. I have ideas, I had ideas, but I'm not 100% sure. I was doing a transfer program where you do the pre-req type classes at the community college and then you transfer to a 4 year after that. 

I had planned on going into teaching, but after seeing what teachers are going through currently... I don't think that's something I can handle. 

The teaching plan, what was my main plan, went out the window. I've worked retail for the last few years and in some ways, I didn't entirely *hate* it. I wouldn't want to work as a cashier for forever though, I worked at Walmart before I moved, and I was able to go from just being on a register to going to the customer service desk where there's a little more variety of things to do. We dealt with Western Union/Money gram money receiving/sending, cashing checks, loading/unloading cards, people paying their bills or child support, as well as doing returns/exchanges, and things like that. I didn't hate the money handling, I'm alright with dealing with customers. I had decent coworkers and managers, so it wasn't the absolute worst. 

I thought maybe getting into a librarian-ish type job would be cool, I've looked into it, I don't hate what I've seen or read about it. When I was in high school, I had a class that made me and another student like ""assistants"" and we did anything other than checking people's books out, the one thing we couldn't do. Helping students with papers, finding relevant resources, teaching how or what to cite in their cited sources page, helping create lessons/give ideas for lessons when classes were in the library. It'd be much different than that, but I have *some* idea of school library stuff. 

One thing I have no clue what to do with is cleaning. I love cleaning, although I don't know what to do with it, or where to go from that. I thought maybe it could be like, a side-gig, but I'm clueless there. 

I think my main thing I like to help people? I don't want to do anything medical though, I'm not into any of that. I like helping people learn, or understand a process they're not familiar with, or problem solve. Which surprisingly happened a lot in retail, with register quirks, problems with sending/receiving money, problems with applying for the credit card, or problems with the app people had when they weren't familiar with it and I was. Or helping by cleaning, when I lived with my MIL I did a decent amount of house cleaning and absolutely loved doing it. 

Whenever I look into it and try to make a concrete plan, I go in circles and overwhelm myself. I need advice for where to go from here, what careers or jobs to look into.

The company I am most excited about reached out asking me to provide what bonus and long term incentive money I am walking away from as they draw up an offer.  Obviously this money no longer exists.   Furthermore, in previous conversations the HR manager mentioned she could get me a sign on bonus to offset the compensation difference between my salary and what they are able to pay. 

So I previously made $235k with a 35% cash bonus. This job pays $195k with a 30% cash bonus.  So just salary and bonus it’s about a $50k pay cut.  I do have screenshots of the $350k in stock I had previously- but it feels wrong to use that.  I do not know what the LTI percentage is for the new company yet but there is LTI. Previously it was 50% that vested after 3 years.  All other benefits are comparable between the two companies.  

I keep toying with coming clean but I run the chance of losing all leverage - and truly I need a sign on to be able to make this work with my finances… but nowhere close to the amount of the stock and bonus Ive lost.   I’m trying to figure out how to reframe the conversation from bonus and stock to overall employment negotiation based on my market value (which for other companies I’ve spoken to is between $215 and $260k).  

How would you approach??

1g3n135,"Feeling stuck, need career advice","Hi, I am a 24-year-old male currently working as a Systems Engineer at Shell, an energy and petroleum company. I graduated in 2023 with a [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) degree in Computer Science. I interned at Amazon for six months but didn’t receive a PPO due to headcount and vacancy issues. I joined Shell in August 2023.

The team I initially joined didn’t have any substantial work, and I was essentially sitting idle for almost a year. Then, my role was impacted, and I had to start looking for a new one. I tried searching both internally and externally, but most HRs ghosted me after the final round, citing reasons like the position being on hold or other vague explanations.

Eventually, I took another job at Shell in a different team. This new team, which I joined just last week, is more operations-focused. They handle maintaining Shell's sites' security, working with networking, hosting, ServiceNow tickets, on-calls, etc. However, I want to work more on the development side, and now I feel stuck in this operations role.

It's been about a year since the start of my career, and I feel like I haven’t accomplished much. Should I stay in this role for another year, learn what they are doing, and try to pick up some work? Or should I start actively looking for opportunities outside?

I'm also concerned about the future. If I’m impacted again, will I be able to find similar roles outside of Shell? Are the skills I’m learning here valuable enough to help me secure a job elsewhere? What should i do please give me some advice.",sk__S,1,1.0,2,1728930728,2024-10-14 18:32:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g3n135/feeling_stuck_need_career_advice/,10,2024
1g3mkhc,Companies contacting past employer?,"Some quick backstory: I currently work at a bank, and my experience has been terrible, so I am putting in my two weeks this week. Part of the reason why my experience was so bad is because of my manager. He is trying to get me fired and has been trying ever since I started this role. (I know because he has told other people at work that this is what he is trying to do and word has gotten back to me.) It's also just so painfully obvious in the way that he treats me and speaks to me vs the other people on my team. I think that it's gotten to a point where it's a personal problem for him and it's no longer just based on my performance. I genuinely believe he wants me to fail and kick me to the curb because it will be satisfying to him. He has also put me on a coaching plan last week (6 months into the role), which means that I have a month before I am written up. So I'm trying to quit on my own terms before that happens.

Anyway, now I'm applying to other roles now outside of my current firm, some are other banks, and I have already got a few interviews lined up. However, it just occurred to me that the companies I'm interviewing for will likely reach out to my past employer. Will they reach out to my current manager and what will they ask him? I'm worried he's going to answer any questions that they ask in a way to ruin my chances of getting employed anywhere else. Clearly I'm very unfamiliar with the way that this process works, so please someone spell it out to me.

1g3mj2e,Quitting my job: how many weeks' notice should I give if I dislike the company?,"After 9–10 months of searching, I've just secured an offer at another company. I've been wanting to leave my current company for over a year, but thought it best to wait to quit until I've secured something else (I've been at this company for 3 years). The reason for wanting to leave mainly comes down to benefits. I am an American working for a London-based company, and while my London colleagues enjoy 28 days of annual leave, generous parental leave, paid workplace events, etc., my benefits don't amount to half of that; e.g., 15 days of PTO and no pat leave.

I'd raised the benefits and work-life discrepancy three times, asking for the US benefits to be more equitable with the UK benefits since I work with the same London-based team every single day. Maybe that's an unfair ask of me — and it's probably true that their reluctance to extend similar benefits to me in the US has made me a bit bitter. Anyway, when quitting, their policy (In London) is to give at least 4 weeks' notice. In the US it's standard to give 2 weeks' notice. In a private conversation with my manager — who knew I was searching for another job — he asked that when I do leave, I give him/the company at least 4 weeks' notice. I love my manager and he's not the reason I'm leaving, but I also feel like if my company couldn't bother to extend me equitable benefits why should I adhere to the UK standard and give them 4+ weeks notice? Am I just being bitter? More context: I'm a senior-level employee in marketing (M, 37). I'm also just excited to start my new job.

1g3ke59,How can I ask for a raise and do I even deserve to ask for one?,"Hey everyone! I’m thinking about asking for a 5% raise, which would be about $300 more a month, and it would make a huge difference for me. I’ve never asked for a raise before, and I’m not sure if I deserve one, so I wanted to get some feedback.

I work as a landscape architect at a smaller firm in a metroplex, and here are my accomplishments from the past year:

	•	Licensed Landscape Architect: This adds value to the firm by expanding our services (signing off on projects, legal compliance).
	•	Acquired Zoo Project: I’m managing a zoo project that could turn into a paid venture(it was pro bono but they’ve asked to meet to start doing a phased implementation )been great for marketing and involves multi-disciplinary collaboration.
	•	Coordinated with the City: Successfully worked with the city to solve a client issue, which boosted my client management skills and helped our firm’s reputation.
	•	Built Strong Relationships: I’ve developed good rapport with city reviewers in multiple cities, which has helped streamline project approvals.
	•	Lead Designer for landscape Nursery that was used as a positive example in my college class: A design I created was used as a successful nursery layout in a class, which showcased my innovation and real-world application.
	•	ASLA Leadership Role: My ASLA State position reflects my commitment to the profession and brings recognition to the firm.
	•	Recognized by City  for Environmental Graphics: My work was even mentioned for a potential award, which adds to the firm’s prestige.
	•	Registered for Irrigation License: I’m on track to get my irrigation license in February, adding more qualifications to our firm’s services.
	•	Back in School for Horticulture Management: I’m pursuing an associate’s degree to bring an even stronger background and skill set to the company.
	•	Training Interns: I’ve been training interns (we pay each of them more than double what I’m asking for with this raise), which strengthens the firm’s future workforce.

I love working here, I just need a little more compensation. So, 1) do you think I have a case for asking for a small raise? 2) How should I go about asking for it?

The reason I’m hesitant is I totally could think of things to improve on too! Like I know I’m not the perfect employee and I could do even more!

If you don't ask you probably won't get a raise or a promotion.,"With end of year reviews coming up, I figured I would put this PSA out there. You need to ask your boss for a raise if you want one. If you don't ask for one, you probably won't get it. That's just the reality.

I have 15 years experience managing engineering teams, and most companies have a similar end of year process. The execs give the VPS and Directors a budget for raises and promotions.

Then the VPs and Directors consider how to dole out the budget. And very frequently, we consider who we want to reward and retain. If someone has told me they want a raise, and I want to retain them, I will give them the raise. If someone has never mentioned compensation, then I assume they're good with their salary and they're not getting a raise. If they never mentioned wanting a promo, guess what... they're not getting a promo. Someone who asked for a promo is getting it instead.

So at your end of year review, tell your boss what you want. We're not mind readers, and we're trying to balance many people wanting many things. If you don't say what you want, then nobody knows what you want.",tellsonestory,0,0.5,12,1728922036,2024-10-14 16:07:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g3jgpc/psa_ask_for_a_raise_at_your_end_of_year_review_if/,10,2024

I’ll preface by saying I accepted the position out of necessity so it pays lower than my last 2 positions.

Over the last 2-3 weeks or so Finance has been very delayed with cutting checks, we process immigration paperwork so we get new checks cut daily. About 2-3 weeks ago Finance started getting delayed when cutting checks, at first it was only half an hour but it’s progressed to 1-2 hours late and has consistently been this late everyday.

When I started the company provided lunch every Thursday and last week they indefinitely suspended it stating a desire to “cut discretionary spending” which didn’t sound bad at first but they also fired our Office Manager the same day they suspended the lunches.

They’ve also begun putting a limit on overtime and stated they may cut it all together. 

I’m not really familiar with signs of a company losing revenue with the exception of if payroll starts getting delayed which hasn’t happened yet.

1g3hbpm,Best ways to communicate burn out with manager?,"Hi! I’m a Digital Communications Manager at a large global company and am beyond burned out. It’s really a digital marketing role despite it being advertised as a communications role with some marketing elements. I’ve only been with this company for six months.

My role is a new one for the company, and prior to me starting, everything I do was split up with everyone on the team kind of chipping in anyway they could. There is a Communications Manager who had a bulk of the responsibilities but she has no real marketing experience and already had her own work, so some of the digital initiatives had to take a backseat.

The scope of my role is:
* Social Media
* Digital Ads/PPC
* Email Marketing
* Website and SEO
* Influencer Program

I created this strong strategy deck for 2024-2025 but also have to execute a portion of it because we have a lean team for digital. We have one person dedicated to the web and one marketing projects person who helps out with a little bit of everything but is not specialized. I’m starting to drown because everyone assume if it’s an initiative that exists on the internet, it falls in my court.

And while I’m not missing deadlines, I’m not able to dive deep into any of these areas and can’t do any of the initiatives I think we need to be doing because there are a few core things that absolutely need to get done. It’s making it so moving the needle on digital is next to impossible, and I don’t think my boss understands that I have like 2-3 jobs wrapped up in my one role.

Some people on the team have tried to alert him and be like “this aspect of digital is a full time job and she’s got a million other things going on…” but I don’t think he gets it. He did say he will look at getting a coordinator for me and the Communications Manager but it sounds like this would be a shared person and the other manager genuinely does not need the help. She has told me she’s ahead of her work now that she only had her job to do and not part of hers and mine, which is great but not if we have to share one resource. I’m used to having a whole team dedicated to email, one or two social people, one web person, etc.

Any tips for communicating this with my manager? Anyone else been in the situation?

I think it’s quite common for digital marketing managers to have multiple jobs wrapped into their one role but I just can’t do it anymore. This is kind of a survival job for me, too. I loved my last role but the company went bankrupt and this job was my best offer and was a pay raise.

I've studied and been obsessed with fashion since I was 12 years old and im 32 now so my knowledge is pretty crazy I'd say.

I'd like to take some courses maybe on it? Because I know an insane amount of cool fashion brands and styles from all price ranges but I don't know much about the fashion business especially about being an actual stylist.

I think I also need to learn even more brands that aren't my personal taste. But to me that's pretty easy cuz that's just google and instagram. I also know obviously I need to learn about even more styles and be ready and prepared to mold my skills to a lot of people's different personal tastes.

1g3gury,Did I make things worse for myself?,"I (26f) transitioned from one field to another but am doing similar work. I'm struggling with the new terminology, processes, and understanding how this industry operates. My boss has been running things from the start and is very laid-back, which sometimes leads to changing priorities or expectations, making it feel like I'm chasing a moving target. This has added to my adjustment challenges, although I do like my new job and boss. A good example being I had taken most of the day to handle a personal emergency, and put in PTO for it. My boss was frustrated and said I did not need to do that. This has happened a few times for different amounts of time/reasons. I asked what the expectation was for using PTO and only then I recieved a clear cut answer on what the expectation was moving forward. I was originally just going by company guidelines, but the way my boss handles it is much more flexible. They said “I only manage adults”, which to me, if the expectation wasn’t clearly set how would I have known not to request the time? I set aside time to discuss all of my roadblocks with my boss, emphasizing that it wasn't due to their management style or the job itself, but my difficulty in adjusting (coming from a black-and-white industry with a micromanager boss). We're usually informal, and I felt comfortable discussing anything, but since our conversation, things feel different—less joking, more one-word replies. I'm worried I might have insulted them or made them think I'm not equipped for the job. Did I make a mistake by addressing my challenges or discussing what I need from my boss to be more successful?

1g3fusk,Can you give me some insight into investing in a Digital Marketing career at 30?,"Hi everyone,

Posting this to ask for some advice: I'm almost 30 yo, I have a masters degree in sports and Physical Education and I'm also a licensed soccer coach. Currently I work onboard cruise ships running sports activities but that career is coming to an end as I'm looking to start a more settled life in Canada, as I'm looking to move there next year.

I've been looking into new careers to start and invest and I've been looking at Digital Marketing as something that is getting my attention, as it looks very interesting from my point of view.  
I have no prior education related to it neither the skills or knowledge in the area but I consider myself a very hard working and fast learner person that puts a lot of effort into everything. I also feel like any computer work and skills would be ""easy"" (don't get me wrong, I know that nothing is easy and given) for me to learn. I'm focused on putting a lot of time and self learning on the table for me to accomplish this goal.

I like the idea of combining some creativity and analysing how the markets work and everything around it, and I feel that even to a minimum maybe, some of the skills from my prior education and work experience could be transferrable and helpful to a career like this.

Would like some advice into knowing if there's a road for me at almost 30 yo or if it is too late. If so, what would be a starting point to getting into this area and maybe a couple steps to start and grow in the area from scratch?  
Any success stories from cases similar to mine would also be appreciated.

I’m 28 and have 10 years of experience working various jobs in higher ed, but the lack of upward mobility and crap pay along with a lot of other factors has left a bad taste in my mouth, but I’m not sure where I can go from here. I have a master’s in Educational Psychology, and currently I work as a Project Coordinator for our academic advising department, which is about half front desk secretarial work, and half data entry, student tracking and event planning. 

I took an open position as an advisor for a few months until we could fill the position and realized the work didn’t really suit me, and was way too much extra stress for just a dollar more, but it still glad I explored that pathway. Previous jobs I’ve held have been a number of Research assisting positions at different universities, interning in our DEI office, I also worked as a teaching assistant, and still my longest position I’ve held was my work in Student Leadership Development and Cultural Awareness Programming Assistant in which I planned for events, write and hosted personal development workshops, and coordinated a student mentoring program.

1g3dcbj,Should I join the military ,"
I live in London so it would be the paratroopers if I do since I like heights and it seems the most exciting to me. But on the outside it would seem strange a person like me joining the army. I'm 22 years old, I have a mum dad sister and loving girlfriend who wants to marry me. But on the inside. I feel so incompetent in every aspect of my life. My girlfriend and I joined the police force at the same time and I thought it was the best job in the world. But I wasn't good at it and always made mistakes which lead to me being fired. She's still in the job which makes it very hard sometimes as I hear about her going to these crazy interesting operations of all sorts or just her say to say work where she is doing all of these amazing incredible things at work which makes me regret and relive the guilt over and over again. It's not healthy at all and I feel like I can't move on. I want to be a competent person, and I feel like a way to do that would be to join the military and learn things that will help me all throughout my life. And maybe after my 4 years service and I can join the police force again which is my dream job but actually be a competent officer which is all I want. But how unfair is this to my girlfriend who I would have to leave even though she hasn't done anything wrong at all. Or my parents who've worked more than they have been capable of immigrating to this country to give me a good life. I want to retire them, not leave them alone to keep working despite their old age. I'm very conflicted and I'm really unsure what to do. I feel like I've wasted the 4 years after school doing dead end jobs. If I joined at 18 I would be out by now and a competent person who has experienced the world but I'm 22 with nothing to be proud of at all.

1g3czus,Seeking advice: should I distance myself from my director after a damaging evaluation?,"I'm working in the IT department of a pretty big company. We had a reorganisation recently, and I made the mistake to communicate, to my new boss, that I was unhappy of my current position. As a form of retaliation (I can't think of anything different) he gave me a mediocre scoring in the yearly evaluation, telling me that I'm ""one of the best in the team, but not someone to count on"". Do you think it could be safer to take distance from this director (I can move in another position, which could also give me the possibility to change my responsibilities). I feel like in these situations the relationship can be forever compromised.

I work in the IT department of a fairly large company that recently went through a reorganization. In a one-on-one with my new boss, I openly shared that I was feeling unsatisfied with my current role, because I was basically demoted. Unfortunately, this seems to have backfired. During my yearly evaluation, my boss gave me a mediocre rating, despite telling me that I’m ""one of the best on the team, but not someone to rely on.""

It feels like this was a form of retaliation for voicing my concerns, though I can't be entirely sure. Now, I’m considering whether it’s safer to distance myself from this director. I have the opportunity to move to another position within the company, which would also allow me to shift my responsibilities. I’m worried that the relationship with my current boss may be permanently damaged, and staying in this role could hinder my growth.

Honestly, getting a marketing degree with a specialization in professional selling and sales management seemed like a great idea at first. I thought it would open up so many doors and lead to a lucrative career. But now, I regret it. The job market is saturated with marketing graduates, making it incredibly competitive to land a decent job. Plus, the roles I do find often come with unrealistic sales targets and immense pressure. The constant hustle to meet quotas and the lack of job security are draining. I feel like I invested so much time and money into this degree, only to end up in a field where the stress outweighs the rewards. It's frustrating to see other degrees leading to more stable and fulfilling careers.

1g3atvz,"Am I (M21) building a good career for myself?
","Hey! I (21M) struggled a lot with figuring out my carreer path and I think I finally found something I enjoy - but I'm wondering, is what I'm doing enough to build a career? Am I on the right path? Will I be able to achieve my goals?

Keeping it short - In 2020, I graduated in High School with a associate degree in IT. I'm an certified IT technician. And with full honesty, I hated 90% of that course. I only did it because my parentes asked me to and at the time I still struggled with over pleasing them. But I recognize that a few skills I've learned, like graphic design tools and apps, a little bit about UX/UI and overall Things like fast-typing and knowlodge in various operating systems, are very importante and cool to have!

I struggled with a depression episode after high school, one I was struggling with suicide thoughts for many reasons, one being loneliness and other one being my professional future. I always dreamnt with working as a writer, producer and/or diretor for TV/movie industry. I didn't follow this path but I started looking for things I enjoy/would enjoy doing and that could pay enough to give me some financial estability (I live in the biggest city of Brazil).

I was always a very shy kid who found comfort and escapism in media. I've decided to give myself a chance and challenge myself a little. So I started a bachelor major in Communications with Emphasis on Advertising and Marketing. I started college with two thoughts: One - Advertising will be a great course to challenge myself, I'll have to work in group, take leadership roles, do presentations in front of class, etc. This will certaintly help me be more confidente and communicative. And two - Communications is one of the few courses I think I can attend 4 years without dropping college. Filmmaking became more of an hobbie (I do have a few classes of filmmaking in college, in fact, I'll shoot a short documentary this semester).  

I'm on 6º from 8º period and I took two internships jobs. One at my own college, as a creative internship on the very own Advertising Bachelor's course Experimental Agency. And another one as Creative Director and Planner on the marketing department of an online jewelry store.

I'm doing things like:

Content/Trends Research, Content Planning for Social Media, Content Marketing, Market Research, Strategy, Branding, I'm directing models/actors on photoshoots and fashion films, References research for the brand, Production, Advertising Campaing planning, Analysis results and Supervisionising the visual material produced for social media/website.

And I started to fell in love with Social Media Marketing. So much I'm considering starting an graduate course on Digital Marketing as soon I graduate in Advertising. I want to keep learning more about what I already do, I want to Learn UX/UI and I want to Learn paid traffic as well. I've also heard about Inbound Marketing but have no idea what that is. 

Next year I'll only need to write my final paper to graduate during the entire year, so I'm thinking about transfering to the online classes from my college (it's way cheaper and same diploma!) and start some course of 6 months, 1 year (do you guys have any suggestions on what this course could be????)

Besides college, I sign up for paid a 5 week Digital Marketing course on the best university of my country and am doing a few courses on Coursera, also attending to lectures. I even did a professional Linkedin/Portfolio Photoshoot. But my biggest struggle is netwoking. I do have contact with talented and people working in amazing companies. But only a handful.

A few of my dreams include getting a job in another country, travelling to a few countries, being stable to build a family and getting carrer experience to - in a decade and a half, or so - take a qualification course to become a university professor and teach students bout communications, another huge dream of mine.

I also speak English fluently - learned by myself by interacting with fandoms in foruns and with lyrics from musics from my emo phase.

Is it normal to put something on record before speaking with them?

1g39kiv,Just got a job and not sure if I should show up,"So for context, I am a recent college graduate who just moved back home.

After job hunting for 2-3 months I finally got hired (doesn't pay great at all but its in the field I want to grow in). The problem is I just got a license and I don't have my own car... And due to the schedule, my parents can't drive me to work. My parents don't trust me with driving their car to work and recently it has become apparent that they don't want me to drive their car at all. We also don't have a lot of money so a car accident would be detrimental to all of us. After hearing their distrust I'm starting to doubt myself as well.

**So my question is should I tell my employer that I can't work here and back out last second? Should I only be applying to remote jobs or jobs that my parents can drive me to?**

It would suck to quit an offer so last minute, especially because it took so long to find a job. But at the same time, the pay isn't great so it's not like I am missing out on much. *It would probably take 3 months for me to buy a car at this rate.*",TypicalFloridaMan,1,1.0,4,1728886645,2024-10-14 06:17:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g39kiv/just_got_a_job_and_not_sure_if_i_should_show_up/,10,2024

1g3868h,What should I major in as an aspiring Pharmacist?,"Hello all, My name is Adrian. I am currently a high school senior currently applying early to colleges.

I am aiming to be a Pharmacist and am trying to set myself up with a solid undergraduate education. I consider myself a fairly versed student as far as my education. The math/science courses I have thus far taken that I would view as concerning pharmaceutical studies are Biology Honors, Geometry Honors, Algebra Honors, AICE Environmental Science, Pre-Calculus Honors, Forensic Science, Chemistry Honors, and I am currently taking AP Biology as well as Calculus Honors.

My biggest concern is in majoring in biology which I had my heart set on for a little bit now due to my interest in the subject as well as the direct correlation it has to my desired career. The problem with biology is that it is highly regarded as one of the hardest majors, though I most definitely see myself as capable (as I am a firm believer that I can do anything I put my mind to), I wonder if I am setting myself up for an unnecessarily stressful undergraduate life. My second choice is to major in psychology which is another longstanding interest that I have had (specifically forensic psychology) and then taking the classes necessary for pharmacy school.

I guess what I need clarity on is:

1. Is majoring in Biology as hard as it is chalked up to be?
2. Does majoring in Biology seem reasonable/feasible for me given the courses I've taken (feel free to ask follow-up questions regarding specific grades, my GPA, etc.)?
3. If you are familiar with pharmacists who majored in Biology how important is it for success in Pharmacy school as far as preparedness (I imagine it isn't integral to success, but did they have a significant edge over those who didn't)?

1g383rn,There’s always someone cheaper waiting for your job. 5-myths driving the feeling of infallibility among Corporate workers?,"In corporate life, we have been conditioned to believe that depth of experience, certifications and seniority is valued and a knowledge of the systems and processes will ensure you enjoy a long tenure in an organization.

There is a grain of truth to it. The depth of experience certainly matters and productivity rises with hands on experience.

However, we tend to ignore the fact that more junior techies, who are eager and willing can be nearly as productive. Tech executives realize that in many cases, junior resources  who are paid less and have a lower cost to the company can keep the engines of operation running just fine.

  
Here are a five myths that drive the thinking of infallibility among corporate workers

1. Only I know where the skeletons are buried – Experienced techies may have learnt the hard way how to keep the complex operations running. ... But
2. I have a strong relationships with the business – this is certainly a strength and business partnering skills are an invaluable asset. ... Yet
3. I have X (2-5-10) years in this role and can move changes and updates at a lightning speed. Agility is certainly an asset when it comes to system upgrades and updates... still
4. The CEO/CxO/HR said the company is doing good and no layoffs are planned. Such statements are generally a ‘point in time’ perspective’, not a promise!
5. I am an MVP and got “employee of the month” or CxO award several times. Such an award is great recognition among peers and a credible testament to your skills. ... yet

When I took the position I was told that there would be some days here and there that would require long hours which I was fine with however in the 11 months I've been  there I've noticed that it seems like the expectation is for us to work atleast 10+ hours daily to keep up with the demands of the company, I am also held liable for issues that occur on the days that I am off as we do not technically have business days. ( I handle employee relations.) This has led to severe burnout and has greatly impacted my mental health.

One week later I'm sitting in my directors office with my director and manager and I'm issued a performance document which renders me ineligible to transfer to another department. This felt like insult to injury so I requested to take a personal leave to get my mental health back to a state where I could perform my job function as needed, I requested 30 days. After 2 days my director called me and told me that the workload was too heavy and that he was willing to give me a week off to handle what I needed to handle and then I would need to come back however a week is not enough time to see my provider, get on medication, get used to that medication, get into therapy, etc...

First for PE is finance the only major you can take to get there or are there others?

Second what math will you take for the first 4 years in college?

What schools are the best for the major? I heard connections are really important so I would like to start looking my gpa is a 3.6

I live in the east coast of the USA 

But in 9th grade I didn’t really try so will that count a lot?

What extra classes should I start taking?
So I have the best chances to get into a good school.

Is private equity draining?

I heard the hours can some times be 80 hrs a week, is there a job like PE that doesn’t take as much of my personal time but has around the same salary?

After school what math is usually used daily in PE?

1g32u63,Put on a pre-PIP. Can I exit with severance instead of resigning?,"I work at a tech company with late night 8 PM meetings to coordinate with China, which has led to burnout. I took FMLA mental health leave and, when I returned, I got permanent WFH accommodation approved through HR due to my long commute and a disability. However, my Chinese manager was upset that I went through HR instead of informing her first, which caused tension. The environment has become toxic, and she is now micromanaging me, making unreasonable demands, and has put me on a pre-PIP.

In contrast, I had a supportive US-based manager prior to this who gave me positive performance reviews, and I even received a bonus.

1g324st,I'm lost in life I need help. can you help me? ,"

I'm currently in a nursing school I'm expected to graduate in DEC 2025. I'm unsure if I'm heading in the right direction. I'm 28 years old, I've worked a lot of jobs growing up as a young adult. My first job was at burger king at 17, then I worked retail adidas, Nike, Express, at time I was currently going to school, but I got burned out and did my first big mistake dropped out of school as i was unsure on what I wanted to do. I continue to work until around 21 -22 years old. a friend of mind offered to make a business with me. We made a business that trained children the fundamental of sport, here things starting to look up because I thought I found a way out of the matrix. We did well but i made a mistake and I didn't leverage myself to be a partner with him and here he took advantage of this. He used our friendship as guise to use me as any employee and sold me on how the company grows we would grow. The company did grow and we worked in schools, private communities and eventually a warehouse. Sadly, my pay didn't increase or any ownership instead, I did all the field work, train new talent and handle all the stuff he didn't want too. After 4! years i quit, mind you he was driving a Mercedes Amg, living in a luxury apartment, and acting as he made it in life. while I was trying to make ends meet. I lived with my mother still and I took a second job in amazon to leverage myself more while working at his company. i had many conversations with him and quickly realized he had put me in corner and i could not leverage myself for better pay. so I became a process manager at amazon but I was burnout from both jobs, I had starting to smoke weed to cope with pain I felt in the factory. I quickly, realized that I needed to change. I had spent two years working in factory, one of those years i was working with my scumbag friend in the sports business. My life was going nowhere. I decided to clean myself up, and stop smoking weed, I started going back to school when I was around 26-27. At this point I hit another roadblock, I had no idea what I was going to do, I was originally a health care major because of the stability and pay. I was pursing a PA position. A lot of my classes were sciences classes, I decided to purse exercise science but quickly realized the pay and stability wasn't worth it. I decided to purse nursing instead. At this point you can imagine my PTSD with employers, friends with business ideas, the whole system we live in. I left amazon because I was burned out after 2 -3 years. I stayed in school and managed to get to the core classes of nursing which is where I am now. I just turned 28 years old and I never felt more scared for my life. I never imagined I would be here at my age still trying figure things out. I'm unemployed right now its been around 3-4 months, ive been scared to get back out there but still studying because its my only lifeline. I've researched and considered many thing trades like plumber, electrical, hvac, wielder. I ve considered going into sales and real estate loan officer. I've considered other degrees outside of healthcare. I considered different ways to invest in my future. I chose nursing because of the stability and being able to work as nurse practioner one day. I'm 28 and this is the most scared I have ever been in my life, I find myself more stuck in the system than ever before. I also need to find some type of work while I'm in school and the market is terrible right now. If I can go back I think would ve done electrical engineering, but i don't want to lose anymore time.   

I just need some guidance and honestly I cant really trust anybody out there anymore. I fear I will burn out again and be in a deeper hole than before, I'm not sure where to turn too, Only God can help me now.

1g31sxf,"""Your job is what I say your job is""  Am I in the wrong?","I will keep this short, I got in a argument with all 3 managers after refusing to do one thing.

I work in a big food corner in a supermarket, pizzas, hot foods and sandwiches with only 3 people running it for 13.25$ a hour. (Including me)

To make sure everything stays clean, we split responsibilities as decided by the lead who we will call John.

John leaves at 5:00, sometimes staying to 5:30 if needed, and cleans sandwich station and pizza station down before leaving.

Then the 7:00pm person, usually me, cuts meat backups that we are low on in the Deli, clean the back table, soups area nearby and the self serve for the hot foods.

Then the actual closer, 8pm person, has left the top and bottom of all 4 tables, clean the grill and fryer, sweep the floor, do the little bit of dishes we have and clean the hot case where we also serve other hot food.


On this day, I was the closer. The lead John tells me to cut some stuff tonight. I was confused and said isn't that Marks job (the 7:00pm person of that day) and John says in a weird tone ""Yeah tell Mark that.""

So I thought he was joking and said no. Why would I do more work instead of split the work evenly with my co-worker, he is there too.

(In my head, the closer already has tons to do and I didn't think I would be able to get it done at the end of the night + having to deal with the deli people complaining I'm there since most slicers are closed drives me crazy)

The manager Paul comes over and tells me why I told John no, I try to explain but he just said Maybe John thinks Mark the 7:00pm person isn't good for cutting and just tells me to do what John says and I said no I already have alot of work but he doesn't listen.

Eventually the big guy, manager of all the delis in the company (I thought he was just the store manager at the time) calls me in the office. Let's call him Roger.

Roger asks why I refused to do something two people told me to do. I try to explain how things are organized but he cuts me off, saying my job is what my job says it is.

Saying if I read the employee manual I would know this. (I have read it, it definitely does not say that)

At this point I am done trying to articulate what the issue is and am simply saying it isn't my job because I'm overloaded with work and this doesn't match the way we have done things for months.

He sends me home, I try to protest that screws over Mark, the 7:00pm person as they have to close but he sent me anyways. 

Am I in the wrong here? What do I do? Few days later I got written up about it and they talked to John but I still feel like John gives me too much work as he is giving me tasks while giving none to my co workers sometimes.

My job expectations have changed on a near monthly basis over the last several months. They’re a terrible company, but. I’ve made myself indisposable.

I did a job interview for a similar role, but for more pay annually, and my day to day will be a lot easier. They seem like great guys, and I think overall the job itself would be much better.

My hesitation comes from the fact that I’ve experience layoffs in the last 3 years, and this company is a newer company.

I wanted to include as much detail as I could in the most factual way possible. Please give me your genuine advice. I think this is a well thought out plan but I don't want to set myself up for failure.

(Note: I'm posting this to a lot of subs, I want to get as many perspectives as possible)

I (19M) am finishing up my first year of Bcom with accounting focus and I want to switch programs.

I'm realizing that I only picked my major because I got perfect scores in math/economics in high school and I wanted to make money, but the only reason I actually enjoyed those subjects was because of my incredible teachers. Now that I'm taking them in uni, I absolutely hate them.

I dislike the environment at my business school, most of my profs sound borderline narcissistic and morally questionable. Most students are either alcoholic rich kids or finance bros (we got branded shot glasses during orientation week if that says anything about the culture). We also had a guest speaker basically explain to us how to commit tax fraud and get away with it the other day. I suck at science though, so I'm not interested in most STEM programs.

I have undiagnosed ADHD and depression that I'm in the process of getting diagnosed but it's going to take another year at least. It makes it really hard for me to work on anything that I don't have a special interest in. I've procrastinated studying for multiple classes because of that and even failed one. My grades are okay, but I'm miserable. The only course I have a 98% in right now is Japanese, but that's because it's one of my special interests (not a weeaboo, I'm just half Japanese but never learned the language).

I thought I would be able to push through in uni because business is the ""easy"" major and do my hobbies on the side with all my supposed free time, but I've been stuck doing nothing but hate my classes, procrastinate, get subpar grades, repeat. I don't have time for the things that make me happy anymore and frankly, I can't picture myself working as an accountant anymore either.

So, sob story over—I can already hear the sea of ""humanities are useless"" comments I'm going to get—I want to switch to interdisciplinary studies with a double major in music studies and world languages and cultures (mostly Japanese) with a minor in management.

Why?

1. I was in a music program in high school and I a) know I'm good at it and b) am endlessly passionate about it. I was in 3 ensembles at a time, I played with over 10 orchestras in my city (some youth groups, others intergenerational) and had the highest historical average at my school. I've won several competitions and gotten money from my school to buy myself a better instrument. My first job was teaching drums, guitar and piano. I was told to audition for big music schools but I fell for the ""nothing but STEM/business will ever make you money"" mindset. Even when I disliked my conductors, I still held on to my love of playing, composing, arranging, teaching, etc. I haven't done any of that in over a year and boy do I miss it.

2. I mentioned Japanese already, it's something I have a genuine passion for. Ignoring the job opportunities I'll mention later, it'll allow me to understand my heritage and talk to extended family.

3. The first year courses I took in business will lead to my management minor, so I won't be wasting any money/time.

Money isn't an issue for now, I'm not in the US so tuition isn't crazy high, I live in a different ""first world"" country if that's important. My parents have worked super hard to save enough money to support me through uni and I live at home. I'm truly grateful for that. They actually prefer me staying home once I graduate as well, though I'd rather not (immigrant parents if you couldn't tell haha).

Not sure if it's important either, but I can't have/don't want kids. I only want a job good enough to support myself, my retirement and maybe a partner in the future.

The plan:

I believe anyone can get a good job with ANY degree as long as they know how to market themselves.

Once I get on ADHD medication, I will hopefully be able to push through on things I enjoy less but am still good at. I'm planning on getting online certifications while in school for things like coding, project management or data analytics.

I have connections to someone who works at a renowned arts center in my city. I'll try my hardest to get an internship there.

I've had several social media accounts for different things over the years (music, video essays, sewing, fan accounts) where I had between 5k and 50k followers per account. I still have one that's growing today even though I'm not active on it because of school. I know a few tricks to getting the instagram algorithm to pick up my content.

My dad is big in the dance scene where I live. He does monthly socials and gives classes that I manage almost everything for since he also works a full time job. I'm gaining more experience in event planning and social media through that.

After I graduate, I plan on getting a 1 year college certificate in event management to solidify my knowledge.

With all of that, I could, in theory, work for arts centres, orchestras, music festivals or instrument manufacturers (particularly the Yamaha Corporation in Japan). I could teach music and/or Japanese. I could even not use either of those and just be an executive assistant somewhere.

Listing some more options I've thought of: music marketing, data analyst for arts organizations, international relations coordinator for NGOs or exchange programs based in Japan, administration jobs, content creator, music tour coordinators for Japanese musicians (I would love to work for lamp, mol-74 or any classical musician one day), wedding or corporate event planner, corporate cultural trainer for businesses involved in international trade, etc. etc. etc.

I also know the importance of using Linkedin to my advantage. I make connections with people at my school on there and I know to reach out to people who work for companies I want to work for, or people who work in positions I'm hoping for.

All of that being said, please let me know if this is stupid or if you think this could work. Should I go for it?

TL;DR: I’m 19M finishing my first year in a Bcom program but hate it. I want to switch to interdisciplinary studies double majoring in music and Japanese as I’m passionate about both. My Bcom experience would go to a management minor. I believe I can build a successful career in arts/education/administration despite concerns about my this ""useless"" degree. I have a plan that includes gaining certifications, internships, and leveraging social media for networking.

1g2w55p,Is miscommunication a red flag at my new job?,"Hi everyone, I’m a new grad who just started their first corporate job two months ago. I’m starting to get a little concerned about the miscommunication and lack of training at my new job. I’m wondering if this is normal or a red flag. My boss is located in another state. He told that me the people in higher positions at my office would know everything and tell me what needs to be done. 

So a few examples of the miscommunication is I was told that I’d have fridays off when I travel and get back on a thursday. Only for me to find out I have to fly back home on friday evenings when I travel. 

Another example is I was told by the coworker with the most experience that I could leave early the day before I’d have to shadow people at another location. He also said when I was done shadowing them I could go back home and didn’t have to go back to the office. (Mind you this was the coworker my boss told me would know everything) I wasn’t given any clarification on what day to go, how long I should be there, etc by my boss and was told to figure out the details with the people I was shadowing which I did. Only for my boss to tell me AFTER that he never said that and doesn’t know why I was told that. Though he himself never gave me any details and I mentioned all of this in our meeting. He also said that someone I was shadowing told him that I asked them to let me leave early even though I never did. They insisted that we were done for the day even when I told them multiple times I was fine with staying longer. 

When it comes to training there’s hardly been any. I’ve been shown the software but there’s no guides, no videos, nothing in terms of what I’m supposed to do. I’m just expected to figure it out as I go along but considering this is my first corporate job it feels like I’m doomed to fail if there’s no clear outline of what’s expected from me on a day to day basis. I’m just really worried that it’s going to get worse, especially since there’s already been an instance of someone lying about something I’ve said. I’m really worried cause I’ve always taken my work serious (when I worked fast food and retail) and I don’t want this miscommunication to be used against me or cause me to make mistakes in the future. 

My friends and family have told me to log things I’ve been told and talk to my boss about him telling me things he wants me to do directly and ask for as much detail as possible. I’m not sure if it’s good advice or if there’s additional measures I should take.",marianarenee,1,1.0,5,1728843757,2024-10-13 18:22:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g2w55p/is_miscommunication_a_red_flag_at_my_new_job/,10,2024
1g2w2dz,College or $70K Job?,"Hi all.

I am a sophomore undergrad at a large public state uni. I am majoring in psychology, planning to do a masters afterwards. I am $40,000 in student loan debt, 1st gen immigrant so I lacked any connections or paths to a career except college. I would like to stay in college but that would mean taking out more loans every year, putting me further in debt until I land a job after graduating (likely to do a masters). 

*I have recently landed an opportunity to get a position at a mental health institution as a policy analyst.*

* The pay is $70,000 before taxes, $53,000 after. I live in a medium COL area. 
* Total yearly expenses $25000 not including tuition. Tuition is an added 16k/yr.

I would have to put college on hold or take all my classes online part time for the foreseeable future in order to work this job full-time. I would also likely have to wait many years to go back to college in order to not have to worry about a constant cycle of debt - I plan to use my income to pay down my loans ASAP and save up for future.

**The reason I'm considering not taking the job:**

I would have to work at least 2-3 years to be able to pay off my loans. I would also likely not have a degree at this point, meaning that furthering my career would likely become more difficult. I do believe that this would be a great opportunity to get my foot in the door, however, I am worried that this is a trojan horse. If I jump on this  opportunity, I may see myself eventually job-less and degree-less with no net-worth. 

I would appreciate any advice.

1g2uphb,"Layoff coming, should I cancel upcoming my paternity leave?","My company recently announced layoff in the coming month, nobody has any detail yet. 
They had a round of layoff beginning of 2024 and a low performer with 9 years of seniority was let go from my team of 14.

I recently had a baby in February 2024, initially I took 5 weeks off after birth of my child and I have upcoming paternity leave for 2 months to take my kid back to Asia to see family end of the year.

I joined the company ~ 2 years ago and there are 14 people on my team. I’m not the most recent hire since there were 2 more people joined after me. I’m 37 so I brought in 10+ years of experience but that probably means I’m on the higher side of pay band. In terms of performance, I would say I’m in the middle maybe towards the lower end this year due to my paternity leave earlier in the year and upcoming leave, therefore, some of the project were given to others since I’ll be taking 2 month off. But I never got any negative feedback from my manager on my work. My manager absolutely supported me using all my paternity leave as this is part of my benefit.

There were 2 others on my team recently had baby as well, they both did take their paternity leave (one of them is the only virtual person on the team).

I guess my question is, how likely am I getting let go? 

Should I cancel my paternity leave? I know legally, it shouldn’t be a factor but in reality will it be an important factor for the company to decide who will be let go? 

This is my dream job, and my heart hurt when I think about the possibility that I might get let go. ",Aviator_0504,0,0.4000000059604645,7,1728839958,2024-10-13 17:19:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g2uphb/layoff_coming_should_i_cancel_upcoming_my/,10,2024
1g2ubkw,Stay put or go for the career change?,"Help choose my next career path

TL;DR: engineering (civil or electrical), accounting, computer science, or stay put at current job that’ll cap out around $95k in approx 10 years with benefits / DB pension. 

So ive been incredibly bored/unsatisfied with my current career path. I live in Ontario Canada, am 26 with a bachelors degree in business management. I only pursued that degree as I had no clue what I truly wanted to do with my life right out of high school and had friends do it so figured why not.

I’ve been in my current job for almost 4 years now since graduating university, and currently make $73k (started at $55k). This job is in the public sector, so DB pension, benefits, and hybrid work. It also has great work life balance. The issue is that the pay isn’t great long term, I’ll cap out at around $95k-$100k in about 10 years time. $100k is excellent pay, however I hate the work, I don’t find it interesting, and the management is terrible. So I’ve been seriously debating going back to school to either specialize or make a career change.

Option 1: this would likely be the option that would be “easiest” or “fastest”. I sort of enjoyed the accounting courses I did during my degree, so I’ve considered taking the remaining courses to be eligible for my CPA and looking for a new job to start my hours. Accounting is in demand, however I’ve heard horror stories about the low pay here in Canada so that is a concern. However I’d be able to get a job almost anywhere. 

Option 2: Computer Science, I’ve been a hobby programmer for awhile and enjoy technology. I minored in information technology which would make the computer science degree a bit faster (around 3 years of full time study).  I could also transfer internally to my companies IT dept where the salaries go much higher and the work becomes more interesting. 

Option 3: this is the option I find the most interesting, however would be the longest road. Civil or electrical engineering. 

Option 4: stay put and suck it up, it’s just a job anyways. I’ve got hobbies outside of work. 

I should also note, for any education I would be pursuing it part time, 2-3 courses per semester. I’m aware that it will take significantly longer, and my evenings and weekends will be busy for a long time but I’m more than willing.

1g2u7ra,Crossroads,"
Situation: I’ve been working for a Fortune 500 company for about 12 years. I came into the company in relatively high regard, built a solid reputation and have a good amount of responsibility. I’d say I’m relatively happy in my role but am still ambitious and hope to advance within the company. 

Several of my colleagues and peers have been promoted around me. My career seems somewhat stagnant but I consistently receive positive feedback and solid performance reviews. I’ve tried to get insights on what I need to do to advance. This summer I enrolled in an executive presence and influence class to help pinpoint development areas. The class was not cheap and was bankrolled by my company. 

This past week I had my first opportunity to present to the top leadership team within my function. The team consists of several of my former peers who have been promoted and several of my current and former managers. I was give little guidance on what to present, other than the review was not intended to be a deep technical review but was a talent exposure opportunity. 

I intentionally formatted the review to showcase the skills I had acquired during my summer training course. I felt the review went well. Afterward I summarized the meeting minutes and outcomes of the review in an email to the leadership team. Additionally, I created a short 6 question, multiple choice survey that asked for feedback on the skills I was showcasing from my training. I titled the subject line of the email “meeting minutes and development feedback”

Sadly, not one member of the 11 person leadership team responded to the survey. I feel like this is a terrible sign. The company often openly talks about investing in their people’s development. Perhaps I’m overreacting, but I believe it’s time to look for a new job.

1g2u0r9,I'm Lost and Losing Faith ,"Hi. I'm not sure where else to go so I thought maybe I'd ask for some advice on here. I'm sorry it's long 🙁 

I'm 32. I have a veterinary technology degree and am currently working as a vet tech, but if we're being honest I don't care much for it. I love animals; I've built a good portion of my life around them (grooming experience, have a farm, have worked in animal shelters and doggy day cares, etc), but being a RVT is boring to me. 

My days are filled with owners who won't listen to medical advise for their animals but get upset with you for not fixing them. The majority of what I do is draw blood, trim nails, take x-rays, etc. It's boring. The dogs usually are fighting back. I don't  blame them, but it makes for a harder day. And when it's not boring it's heart breaking. 18 year old dogs that are actively dying; their owners sobbing over them while they struggle to breath. Then you have to walk into the next room and pretend you didn't just witness the saddest fucking thing ever. 

It seems like anything animal based doesn't pay worth a damn (outside of being an actual veterinarian, and even that's a crapshoot); I'm constantly trying to find a livable wage as well as a job that will keep me mentally stimulated. I simply can not handle a job where my brain isn't being used. 

At this point I'm feeling extremely hopeless. I'm thinking I just need to walk away from the animal field. I have plenty of my own at home; maybe I don't need to base my career off it. But the thing is I became a RVT because I didn't know what else to do. I hit 24 and knew I needed some sort of education under my belt. I've always had animals, always loved them, so it seemed like if nothing else it'd teach me some beneficial skills for my own animals. 

I still don't know what to do and I'm starting to have mild panic attacks over it. Everything else in my life is good; I know this anxiety is stemming from feeling lost career-wise. I didn't grow up dreaming of a big wedding with 2 kids and the white fence; I wanted to do something fulfilling for myself and others. I wanted to make a difference. And here I am, useless as tits on a boar and I feel like I'm running out of time to make a change. I just want to know what I want so I can pursue it head on. I'm frustrated and frankly scared. 

I know no one can tell me what I want. I'm not sure why I'm posting. I think I just needed to tell it to someone. Thanks for reading if you made it this far, and sorry for the rambling. I'm just trying to sort my feelings and figure things out.

1g2tfry,What to do after my engineering bachelors?,"I'm 21,F, final year Computer Science engineering student from an average college from India, currently in my 7th semester. Recently, I received two job offers from on-campus placements, one from a WITCH company for 4 LPA, and another from a bank for a Software Engineer role at around 8.5 LPA. I’m also actively applying for off-campus opportunities. My family is middle-class, so if I plan to pursue higher studies abroad, I’ll likely need to rely on a loan and scholarships. I’m confused about whether I should start working right away or pursue higher studies immediately.

My parents have always told me and still say, that they would support any decision I take.

Some reasons why I chose to focus on placements/jobs:

1. I don’t want to take on a large financial burden for my parents if I pursue a master’s degree now. My goal was to work for a couple of years, save up, and finance at least 50% of my higher education.
2. My parents are very very strict. Earning my own money and potentially moving out would give me some independence. Even during my master’s studies abroad, if I finance my education I can maintain that independence.
3. I’m not sure where my interests lie. While I’m good at coding, I don’t feel passionate about it. I see myself leaning towards project management or business administration, but I want to work for a few years to gain experience and figure out where my true interests are.
4. Several seniors and friends (with siblings/cousins who have done higher studies) have suggested that gaining at least two years of work experience before pursuing a master’s makes you a better candidate, both for the master’s itself and for job opportunities afterward. I’ve also heard that some people who pursued higher education immediately after graduation are struggling to find jobs.
5. Work experience is required in many MBA and management courses.

Recently, my mother has started insisting that I focus on higher studies instead of taking up a job and it's so frustrating. She believes that this is the age to study and not work, and that once I start working, it'll be a pain to return to university for a master’s degree. While both of my parents fully support my career and education, I also suspect there’s an expectation regarding marriage. My family has traditional views on arranged marriages, and they may want me to ""settle down"" by 25. If I work for a few years and then do masters, by the time I want to marry, I'll be nearing my 30's and that's another tragedy.

However, it feels like my mom doesn’t understand how much effort it takes to prepare for higher studies abroad. I don't even have a passport right now (its expired) and I haven’t even started preparing for exams like GRE, TOEFL, or IELTS, and most application deadlines are approaching in December. If I had known earlier, I would’ve spent more time preparing for higher studies instead of placements. I’ve tried explaining this to her, but she always tells me about one of her friends who also went abroad last minute and they managed to, so why cant I?

Another thing is, my BTech was done in a very average Tier 3 college. I want my masters to be from a Tier 1, if done in India maybe from an IIM or IIT, and if abroad then Ivy League or something of that level. Hence I don't want to rush things and I want to take it slow step by step.

**My main questions:**

1. Should I accept the bank offer and work for a couple of years, and then going for my master’s?
2. Or should I listen to my mother and attempt to go abroad for higher studies right now?
3. If I take the job, how difficult would it be to transition back into university for a master’s degree? Would it be challenging to return to the work after completing my master’s?
4. If I decide to go for higher studies immediately, what would that process look like, especially given my current lack of preparation?",altalt_1402,1,1.0,7,1728836621,2024-10-13 16:23:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g2tfry/what_to_do_after_my_engineering_bachelors/,10,2024

Also, I love the work that I do, just hate the people and the environment. I am severely underpaid, overworked, overall miserable here. 

for more insight why I hate it here, I was given 17 PTO days when I first started, I used 13/17 due to me continuously getting sick(we don’t get sick days), in which later on they decided to change the policy and make it so I was supposed to accrue 17 days after being there a year, and then went onto making me negative in PTO to “pay them back for using PTO I should not have had”. I ended up being negative about 6 days and wasn’t able to use PTO for a long time.

Only slight concerns are that the industry I work in can be pretty well connected, however where I’m coming from is a smaller company compared to the other big dogs in the field. 

But overall, pls share your experiences in quitting without notice or with notice, I’d like to have insight.

And yes - I have a job lined up. :)",kiwilena,1,0.6700000166893005,12,1728836300,2024-10-13 16:18:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g2tbfl/should_i_give_my_job_a_notice_im_quitting/,10,2024
1g2sptr,Seeking career advice for a former dancer,"Hi there! I'm reaching out for some advice, guidance, or even just a friendly chat. I’m a 38-year-old woman, originally from Shanghai, China. I moved to Australia on my own at the age of 15, completed high school here, and went on to study a Bachelor of Nursing for two years. However, I decided to leave that path due to the culture and politics within the medical environment. Working in a nursing home during my placement, I felt deeply empathetic towards the elderly patients and became disillusioned by the often cold-hearted approach of the staff. I didn’t want to become desensitized to the needs of people under the pressure of the medical profession.

While at university, I worked a variety of jobs to improve my English and support myself. I started as a glass cleaner, then moved on to roles as a PR girl and a bartender. Unfortunately, after experiencing harassment at work and a lack of stable hours, I left those positions. That’s when I found work as a waitress at one of Australia’s most famous gentleman’s clubs. It was an unexpected turn, but I made great money, improved my English, and found myself surrounded by supportive management and colleagues. The environment, where many of the staff were LGBTQ+, felt welcoming and fun. 

After 2.5 years of waitressing, I transitioned to dancing, encouraged by management and friends. The pay was better, and as a relatively attractive Asian woman, I fit the role. With time, I trained hard, and with the help of more experienced friends, I became a showgirl. Soon after, I gained some fame within the industry and worked as a dancer for 10 years. Throughout my career, I formed strong connections with clients, many of whom treated me like a trusted friend. I loved listening to people’s stories, engaging in deep conversations, and giving advice when needed.

Eventually, I left dancing when my partner and I moved to a new city. I tried working in different clubs but didn’t feel the same connection. Then, 8 years ago, I became pregnant unexpectedly, and we decided to start our family. Since then, I’ve been mostly focused on being a mom. 

Three years ago, I trained as a domestic cleaner and worked for 18 months until I had to stop due to my father’s illness. I traveled between Australia and Shanghai frequently to be with him before he passed away. Unfortunately, my employer needed someone more stable and had to let me go. Afterward, I tried starting my own cleaning business, and while I had a few loyal clients, I struggled to find reliable staff when I injured my back. Despite offering competitive wages, it was difficult to maintain the business, so I had to let it go.

I’ve now been unemployed for six months, and I’m at a crossroads. I want to start working again, but I’m unsure which career path suits me best. I’ve received offers in hospitality, but I’m looking for something more stable, ideally a 9-5 job so I can balance work with my son’s school schedule. The challenge is, I don’t have many qualifications or experience outside of cleaning. 

I love communicating with people and consider myself a quick learner. I’ve applied for roles in sales and customer relations, but I haven’t heard back, and I wonder if it’s because of my age or my non-traditional background. I’m feeling a bit lost and confused about my future. 

If anyone has advice, suggestions, or a similar story to share, I would be so grateful to hear from you. I’m eager to find a fulfilling career that aligns with my skills and lifestyle. Thank you for taking the time to read my story!

1g2s9nt,Help me prepare declining an offer. ,"I had 3 interviews with a company - 2 virtual and 1 in person where we had to each travel 2 hours to meet half way.
At first the job seemed great. I’ve been in industry 22 years. The role is work from home same title as I have now but a little more sales based.  Really enjoyed all the interviews and the in person hiring manager said I wish we hired you a month sooner. So I’m pretty sure an officer is coming this week. 
Hers pros and cons of new and current job:
Current job-
Pro’s: 
Pension (totally employer funded, will be vested next year so if I leave now I lose it).  Very little travel maybe 1 overnight per year for all-in meeting, and handful of local appts per year, wfh so flexible so easy and wonderful boss and co workers. Fortune 100 Big company so could have opportunity for growth. Bonus’s are good. 100% paid short term disability.  (I’m getting older so thinking this maybe important down the road)
Cons: Big company where they have layoffs each year it seems. I thought I was about to be laid off that is why I applied elsewhere. My territory is not profitably so could be in jeopardy in future.
New company: still large company but not Fortune 500, small enough to have exposure to higher management, new to my territory so I would be driving growth and it was be amazing growth. Great opportunity to be part of a success story and add that to my resume. Everyone so nice really seems like a great culture. 401k same as current 
Possibly $10-15k increase is salary. (That’s 10-15% increase so is it really noticeable) 
Cons; No pension, no short term disability (option to purchase it but would only pay out max 70%), id be walking away from my current pension that I have $12k in after 2 years that was totally employer contributed (1 more year im vested and I can keep but obviously it stop being funded by current employer when I leave). Way more travel and no company car, because it’s new to territory I’d be out on road soliciting my clients but then wfh to do actual work. They reimburse for miles but thinking in this economy and with gas and car prices not worth it. Bonus about the same but paid 2x a year (so prob less tax implication) but would have to wait a year to be eligible. 

I have made up my mind I’m going to stay put. If feel even if it was $20k more not worth giving up the benefits I have now. Plus my job is low stress right now I’m safe for now from layoffs. And the real reason I don’t know if I want to work harder for not a big increase in pay. My kids are middle school and high school so they still need me and I can come and go as I please now. Here’s some other red flags that came up from the in person interview.
Hiring manager quotes: “I work so many hours so you don’t have to”. “Job is flexible but better answer your phone if you do step away” “I don’t have a dog because the job is too demanding” “we have 2 people sitting in another state but we need 12” I asked how over worked are they she said “very overworked but everyone loves their job”. She also new to region so I can tell she is trying to impress her boss by hiring people who can make the territory a success. Of course nothing wrong with that but I’m not ready for that type of pressure right now.  The position is for people to sit in areas around region so I think they really need someone where I am. This is blinding them to the fact that the position is more sales that I’m used and more sales than I want. Basically all but desperate to get someone in my area.  I am 90% qualified but now desperate are they? Hard to tell. 

When the offer comes in how much detail should I give when declining? 

“Thank you and team for time. I enjoyed learning about the company opportunities and aspirations. After thoughtful reflection, I’ve decided that now is not the right time for me to make a change. I have great respect for [Company Name], and I hope we may cross paths again in the future. Thank you again for your time and the opportunity to interview with your team.”

I personally feel bad how much time like 5 of them invested in interviewing me. They are even reimbursing me for miles for traveling to meeting for in person I feel terrible that I don’t want the job.

TLDR: company spent a lot of time interviewing me. I think I’ll get an offer but want to prepare the most respectful decline. Looking for advice.

1g2rinf,Has anybody declined a job offer on a higher salary due to location?,"I’m in a situation where I’m a new graduate and just started my new job on £28k, with the aim of increasing to mid 30’s over the next year. My first job lasted 5 months due to exceptionally poor management, absolutely no training (required for legal purposes), and it was massively negatively affecting my mental health. 

I’ve now been offered the same role at a different company for £39k, but this is in Bristol, so the higher salary reflects a higher cost of living and higher house prices. 

I’m currently living at home whilst my girlfriend and I are both saving for our first home with the aim to purchase in 3-4 years. Both of these jobs are therefore requiring a 1 hour commute each way, just in opposite directions. We have had a discussion and a look at house prices in/around Bristol, and have agreed that not only can we not afford a nice house within those areas, but we simply wouldn’t like to live there. On the other hand, houses near my current job are over £100k cheaper to buy compared to Bristol etc. 

This would also therefore be my third job within just this job alone, and since I’m just starting my career, I’m worried that this will negatively affect my future. This is especially the case because if we aren’t looking to buy around the Bristol area, this would probably require another job move. However, jobs are very scarce and there are only 2 other companies that would possibly be hiring. 

Would it be wise to reject this job offer even though I would be on £11k more? For the simple reason of it not being a long term job solution, and me being considered a job hopper? Has anybody else had experience with something similar?

1g2qefz,Assistant property manager wanting to move to PM position for a luxury high rise. ,"I’ve been an APM for over a year now, I manage 3 properties totaling a bit over 400 units. I’m incredibly ambitious and would like to get a PM position. I’ve found a company I’d like to work for and they have multiple PM positions open but I don’t know if they’ll take me with my limited experience.

To back me up: 
- I do have my own small side business that I started almost 10 years ago.
- My regional manager was very quick to agree to write me a recommendation letter and when asked if they thought our CFO would write one she said yes. 
- In my first 5 months of working there I had increased occupancy by at least 20%
- I have several glowing reviews from residents and prospects alike, some of which stated the only reason they gave a good review was because of me
- When classes open back up next year I plan to try for my CAM
- I have a certificate in Leasing Consulting 
- I have been in some form of management for over 5 years 

Do you think this would be enough to get me in? I would also like to add that the company I want to go with covers luxury homes and all of my current properties are just regular apartments for I’d say middle to lower class.

1g2psa8,"Neuroscience masters, grad medicine to pursue psychiatry, or bps conversion to study for psychologist?","
Hi,

This may be a long read but please offer some advice if you have it, because I am getting headaches deciding what I should pursue.

I graduated last year with a 2.1 in Biomedical Science from Newcastle University. Currently I am just working an admin type job to save up for further study, however I cannot decide which path to commit.

I have a huge passion for the mind and mental illnesses and addictions. Whether it be how addictions happen, how we can help people with them, the underlying mechanisms, etc .. (same with mental illnesses)

I suppose my absolute dream is to be a psychiatrist. As I would be able to prescribe medication and I suppose get a greater understanding of the more biological side opposed to clinical psychology. However, I do love speaking to people and having that patient interaction and really understanding how I can help. I suppose my greatest strength in life is I am very empathetic and understanding and caring. I am interested in neuro as I really enjoy research and also writing papers on my research. If I were to enter research and academia, I would quite enjoy teaching in universities too alongside doing my research. However, with this there is a risk I may not secure funding, or perhaps even have to conduct research on topics I am not particularly interested in.

I live in the UK and I know, whatever route I decide to pursue WILL be challenging and require commitment - but when I am committed to something I do what it takes. My problem is I am just indecisive and often change my mind a lot because I worry that what I am choosing won’t be the right decision. 

So I suppose my options are:

A) apply to do a masters in neuroscience starting September 2025, which then requires a 3 year PHD after if I want to be qualified to conduct research

B) apply for a BPS conversion course for psychology starting next September. Then potentially do a masters and the further unpaid experience and 2 year programme to become a clinical psychologist (I have heard it is very competitive too)

C) apply for post grad medicine next September , which would require UCAT and a wholeeee lot of luck, considering grad med is EXTREMELY competitive. Bear in mind I wouldn’t be starting the 4 year graduate entry until September 2026… then graduating in 2030 when I am 28 - and then having to do further 5 years for psychiatry. 

My dream is to help people and just learn about the mind and have to think hmm ok what is the best option here. That is why my dream is psychiatry. You only live once and I have always had it in my mind I can’t do this (mainly due to my mum doubting me - but she just wants the best for me) but then what if?? 

Please give me some advice. Thank you so much :)

1g2o8zs,Feeling Lost in My First Dev Job—Is Programming Really for Me?,"I’m 22 years old, living in Indonesia with a monthly cost of living around $405. I haven’t graduated yet—I’m expecting to finish my degree in January 2025. Right now, I’m working as an Associate Android Developer on a 6-month contract, earning $385 a month, which means I’ve had to really compress my expenses.

When I first joined the company, I was excited about the opportunity to learn and grow as a developer. However, things have changed, and I’m starting to feel lost. My Android lead left the company, and now I don’t have anyone with decision-making authority to discuss or guide me through my tasks. I do talk to my senior, but they can’t provide much feedback or help with my work.

On top of that, my company recently changed the work arrangement for associates from a hybrid model (2 days at the office) to full-time in the office, which has added more pressure. Now, I often find myself having to contact my manager directly for issues, but it’s difficult to get clear direction.

Career growth at the company doesn’t seem promising either. One of my seniors, who has two years of experience, is only making $635 a month. That has me questioning if there’s room for me to advance here.

Lately, I’ve been wondering whether programming is really for me, or if it’s just the situation I’m in that’s making me doubt my path. I’ve realized I might be more interested in something managerial or related to solving real-world problems, like in business or strategy.",Fragrant-Nail-8413,1,1.0,2,1728821487,2024-10-13 12:11:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g2o8zs/feeling_lost_in_my_first_dev_jobis_programming/,10,2024

1g2mwak,Should I just quit?,"Hello Reddit, I just wanted to share my story and I need your advice or thoughts. 

I've been a graphic designer for about 10 years now and 2.5 years ago I got hired at a small marketing agency after been unemployed for 2 years during COVID times. I worked freelance during the COVID period, and I still wish I could've kept more of my clients to make a steady living each month because I enjoyed it. 

I admit that the first year and a half working here despite some ""minor"" grievances was alright, but since November I felt that my boss has turned for far worse. I have my own office and was flexible when I can come in and leave work and I could occasionally work from home. However I felt that this gave them the right to give me unpaid overtime or sometimes message me and give me tasks during the weekends. While I was okay with this initially, I felt that this became an ongoing pattern and that I had to be available for them 24/7. 

Since I've been here I've been also forced to work tasks outside my job description and I've always been happy to help out with anything my boss needed but this started being outright exploitive. It started from doing homework for her children, cutting paper with scalpel, measuring whole rooms for architects, measuring walls... to outright manual labor like moving furniture, pallets with promotional material during a conference, moving heavy water jugs after I dislocated my shoulder etc... Despite trying my best to be productive and help out at this company, one of her close coworkers and manager felt he had the right to randomly spout insults and verbal abuse at me whenever he felt like it, even once threatened that he would get me fired, so I had to endure that until the end of December when he thankfully left to work at a different company. 

First time I had a pay rise was in November 2022 and only because I think my boss was forced to give us all a raise due to some legal stuff. 2 years after I haven't had another pay rise at all. My paycheck is below average for a graphic designer and just when I wanted to ask about that I had an accident which left me with an immobilized arm in April. I was on a sick leave for one month, and that didn't stop them from contacting me about doing tasks. I told them several times that my arm is currently immobilized in a splint and I refused to do any work for them. Afterwards I was repeatedly guilt tripped by my colleagues on why it takes me so long to recover or how dare I had an accident during a busy period. I was told that I had to at least try coming in to work with my immobilized arm and help out. Still to this day I have to constantly defend the fact that I was in pain and could barely move my whole arm, let alone do any work on the computer. 

3 days after new year, my boss suddenly informs me that I have to relocate my office to the downstairs space because she wanted one of the upstairs rooms to be used as living quarters for an overseas worker. Despite it being a shared office area, she insisted on someone living there. I was then required to move heavy furniture between the offices for two days, and even got flak from one of her lackey's because I wanted to go home at 4pm. Like ""how dare you want to go home you have to go help your colleagues with the move...""... 

Then in May after my sick leave, she changed my working hours from 8-4 to 9-5 for the reason that I have to be ""flexible"" for them, but that didn't stop them from messaging me with work at 8am or after 5pm. I didn't even get any prior notice or she didn't even discuss with me if I had any plans after 4pm, she just told me from tomorrow you are working 9-5. There was nothing I could do but accept and sign the work contract again. 

Working with her and her daughter is an experience on its own. Some days you sit at work doing nothing, and other days they throw so much work at you that they start arguing among themselves who will use you at the moment. Almost every project or design we work on is either delayed or worked on with unpaid overtime. The boss would either change everything the last minute or give you even more stuff to add - sometimes we have to try read her mind to see what she wants because it's extremely rare that she comes to the office and tells us in person what she wants. All of our (mis)communication is online and it leaves us with a lot of questions or changes sometimes that you never know if you are doing anything right or wrong. They frequently refuse any of my suggestions, I threw color theory and design techniques out the window just to make them happy and I can go home. 

One of my biggest grievances is being messaged at 4:30 p.m. when I’m supposed to finish with my work day at 5 p.m. (before this was 3:30pm when I was working until 4pm). I wouldn't mind ""flexible"" working hours if I was officially allowed to work from home or I can have free days without them taking it out on you. When I want to work from home I would get negative comments from my colleagues, one of them even suggested that they should dock my pay because I worked from home when they were renovating the office. Even if my boss allowed it, two weeks ago she called me and was very cynical about it, like ""Is there a reason why you are not in the office right now?"" even after working on a Saturday. There is really no reason for me to be in the office all day especially when 80% of the time all work is done through online communication. 

My breaking point was last week when my boss writes to me if I know how to work text animations for a video. I told her from the example she sent that task is usually for someone that has experience with After Effects and works as a motion designer, usually in the video industry. Also that they should ask someone with experience in video/multimedia to help her with this task. I know for a fact that she outsources work to other professionals too, so it took me by surprise when she asked me about that. However she started insisting that I should ""Try"" to work on this animation ""Go find a tutorial, I need this done soon"" even though I repeatedly told her I have no experience with the program. I told her that in my contract I am hired as a 'Graphic Designer' and I have no prior experience with After Effects or professional video editing and this is the first time I hear I am supposed to work on this. 

10 minutes later she calls me to ask ""What's the problem?"". I kept trying to explain that it's a job that a motion designer could do for her in a short time and that she should consult one to help her out for future projects. However she wouldn't take no for an answer, she insisted how the world was going forward, how I should just drop everything and go find a tutorial right away or go on a course. I told her ""Then fine, pay for my course. You suddenly spring this on me without consulting me if I have any free time or if I currently want to learn After Effects, especially now when Christmas is coming and I know we are going to be swamped with work. These courses take a long time to do.""... Then she got even more angry with me telling me ""This is the first and last time you talk to me this way..."" I finally snapped and told her ""well fine I am going to quit then..."" 



Since November any kind of task they send me I feel extremely angry and anxious to the point I started resenting being a designer or just working in general. It put me in a difficult position with my anxiety that I ended up going to the psychiatrist at the end of last year. It took me 3 months to finally stop being depressed and now it's happening again... I scheduled to go see a psychiatrist again because I feel overwhelmed with this job.

1g2mpiv,It’s too people-ee out there…,"I have been taking care of others for the better part of 30 years and I have nothing left…family, friends, clients, strangers…always willing to help and I’m on empty. I simply don’t care to cater to others anymore. Being at this point in life is not good while semi-actively trying to seek employment. Semi-actively meaning I’m always looking and researching jobs but never apply because I know at this stage of life I don’t have the energy to meet certain requirements for “this” job. Am I qualified? Absolutely! Do I care enough to impress others? Nope! I know myself(too well) at this stage of adulthood. I thought taking a short sabbatical might re-energize me and help me focus, but that hasn’t been the case. I know I need to find something in the next few months but have this longing dread I’m going to end up back in similar positions I’ve had in the past. For those of you who got burned out or got tired of taking care of people, what career change did you make? I’m not naive to think there’s a job out there where you don’t have to cater to people, but what options am I not seeing? Salary range is flexible. Any true online jobs or remote jobs hiring that you’ve had success with? I have two degrees, managerial experience, and a plethora of life experience that has been beneficial in every position I’ve ever held…and I’m also good at golf. (Golf jobs are incredibly low paying). Not sure how golf skills apply to a job hunt, but it’s always a good idea to list strengths. 😎

1g2jb3f,Career ladder worth it?,"Guys I feel like I need advice from more experienced people than me.

Considering that I am 31 years old and therefore should know where I want to go with my career I am quite clueless.

I am about to switch jobs and I have different offerings to my disposal. Some of them will most likely promote my career (better salary, development opportunities etc.) and also some that are on the simpler side.

I was never concerned climbing the career ladder. I love my free time and spending it with my loved once. 

On the one hand I am concerned that I will be overwhelmed with to much responsibility, pressure etc. and take my work with home (which I am prone to). On the other hand I feel like missing out on an experience and an opportunity to learn more about myself if I go for the more basic job.

1g2in18,Please help me with my future!!!! I need Psychologists/Dentists to answer. I need a wise person with good advice!!!! CareerAdvice ,"I’m a third year undergraduate student (age 20) currently majoring in Human Biology, but I’ve realized that I absolutely dislike everything stem related. I struggle with physics, chemistry, and math, and my GPA reflects that. For the past two years, I’ve been on the pre-med track, unsure of what I truly want to do with my life, and I’ve been hesitant to change my major.

I’m looking for a stable and rewarding career, especially since I’ve invested a lot of money in my education. Initially, I considered switching to Global Health B.S. because the courses seemed more manageable if I wanted to do pre-dental. I've thought about pursuing dental school, but I’m now questioning whether that’s truly my passion. The thought of graduating with $300K in debt and having no guarantee of success in dental school is daunting, especially since I lack shadowing or volunteering experience after switching from pre-med to pre-dental last spring.

The biggest challenge I face is not knowing what I’m passionate about. If I change my major to Global Health, I worry that I’ll end up with a degree that may not lead to good job prospects, and I’m uncertain about my ability to pass the science courses I dislike so much. I often find myself frustrated, watching other students who seem so passionate about their fields, like neurobiology, physics, and computer science. As a junior, I feel lost, and my low GPA adds to my anxiety. It feels like time is running out, and if I don’t make a change soon, I'll fall even deeper into this hole I've dug. Last spring and this past summer I have been doing good in my classes trying to raise my gpa but those are GH type classes. I need to save my grades asap!!!

I’m scared that continuing down this path will lead to more academic failure, yet I’m also afraid to change my major. The only subject that genuinely interests me is psychology. I enjoy watching true crime documentaries and movies about people with mental health disorders, and I find it fascinating to understand how the brain influences behavior and how the environment can shape a person (I know thats kinda weird but its a hobby haha). I’m also interested in learning about various mental health disorders.

However, I feel at a dead end. My family is trying to help, but their advice is confusing. One relative encourages me to switch to psychology with a specialization in social psychology, while another argues that psychology is a useless degree. He believes I should pursue something like computer science or political science for better job prospects after undergrad, but I’ve told him that I struggle with STEM subjects. Despite my efforts to study, I still perform poorly. He believes I've spend too much money on school to switch to something that doesn't guarantee me a good job and is a ""useless degree"". 

I also wouldn't even be able to switch to something like comp sci because it's a capped major.

I’ve heard that psychology degrees don’t guarantee job security, which is scary to be honest. I’ve considered graduate school, but I’m uncertain about the career options available. I want a degree that is respected and offers a good career without leaving me in significant debt, especially since I’m paying for my education primarily through FAFSA with no help from family. I've heard that if I want to pursue anything in psychology, the schooling is 8-12 years which is a little disheartening because I don't want to be in school my whole life. I care more about having a stable life and a great work-life balance. 

I’m particularly interested in careers within psychology, such as clinical psychology, neuropsychology, or forensic psychology. I also like a mix of law and psychology, and I’ve even thought about becoming a university psychologist.

Despite my interests, I feel discouraged and struggle to believe in myself. These past two years have been challenging, and while I try to remind myself that I’m capable, I fear that I won’t find success in the future. Ultimately, I want to learn a skill that will lead to a fulfilling and stable career.

  
Please help me, I just need an honest outside view on my situation and want to see what you guys think I should do.

1g2i2uo,Jobs with comfortable income that I can work while traveling abroad,"I’m 21 in my freshman year of college pursuing a software developing degree. I went that way because my priority is getting a job that will support my lifestyle of wanting to travel abroad longer-term. I am beginning to question if I should pursue a different job title other than software engineer/dev because it has been, and is projected to remain, very very competitive even for the best of the best, and I worry I won’t be able to land a job. 

What jobs come to mind that would be good for me? My only checklist is:
- ability to not be tied down to a geographical location
- decent job demand
- at least around 60k salary (or however much would allow me to just be comfortable and not have to super strictly budget/worry about bills)

and that’s it. I don’t care about potential for upward growth because it will almost certainly not be my permanent career, my passion is in the psych field (likely therapist) and I see myself going into that long term, but I want to spend some years (anywhere between 7-12 years depending on different factors) enjoying the sights of the world freely before settling down.

1g2hso4,Not sure what to do…,"I could use a little advice (and maybe some good vibes) as I’m facing a pretty tough career decision. I’ve been teaching high school English for a while now, and it’s been incredibly rewarding. I currently earn a base pay of $48,000 per year, but I take on an Extended Classroom role that brings it up to about $72,000. While that extra pay has been helpful, it comes with a ton of stress and drama—think super long days, managing extra student loads, and feeling like there’s always more work than time to do it. Sometimes it feels like I need to clone myself just to keep up with everything.

Recently, I’ve been presented with a chance to work full-time for a remote company that I’ve been freelancing with on the side. The job would pay between $70,000 and $80,000 per year, and I’d get a $250/month stipend to help cover the cost of private insurance. The hours vary throughout the year: I’d work 40 hours per week from July to December, and 32 hours per week from January to June. It’s 100% remote, so I’d have way more flexibility than I do now, but it would also mean stepping away from the classroom, which is a huge part of my identity.

I’m torn because I love teaching, but the extended role has been a lot to handle, and I know the new opportunity could give me more balance in my life. At the same time, it’s hard to think about walking away from something that has been such a big part of who I am.

1g2he9r,Throwaway: Career Advice ,"Hello Reddit! This is my first time using this platform for advice so please bare with me if the format or organization of this post is incorrect or difficult to read. I am in need of career advice as a I am a recent grad. For most of my life I wanted to be a physician and during college I did everything I could to prepare applying to medical school. I obtained 2 science related degrees and did 2 years working as clinical research assistant. However, for the first 2 years of undergrad, it was very difficult finding experience working in healthcare. I still wanted some working experience , so I actually ended up spending summers working in a remote corporate position and part-time during the school years. Having these internships led me to obtain other corporate internships in biotech in my later years of college. Given that I was overloading classes every semester and studying for very difficult exams during the course of each semester, I realized that I was not very happy and I missed out on having a college experience. I also realized that overworking has impacted my health mentally and physically. Even though I have a strong passion for medicine, I felt incredibly burnt out before my journey could even begin. There are more factors to take into consideration. For one thing, because I went to a school far away from my home, I couldn’t spend time with family except for holidays. As a result, I missed out on important events in my family. What has made this quite impactful for me is that my parents are quite young yet my time with them is relatively unpredictable due to both having illnesses that affect their longevity (10 years or less). This has in turn affected my emotional well being as the longer I spend living far away from them the less time I have with them on this planet. 

Becoming a physician has always been my goal since high school and while I was academically thriving, the rest my life wasn’t and I was only in undergrad. Working in biotech made me reconsider everything I knew about healthcare and fields that exist beyond medicine. So, I decided to hold out on applying to medical school. Instead I decided to get a job in senior year that could give me more work/life balance (at least more than a medical student would have). 

Given my experience, I was able to find a job in banking. I started working at this job last year. This job is still far away from home but I was hoping that with it would have the flexibility to spend more time with my family with less stress of undergrad and exams. However, I have to come to realize that is not the case. Although my work can be done completely remotely, since we are living in a post- Covid world, my employers want me to work in person as much as possible. I do work hybrid but even asking to work remotely for a week during Christmas or thanksgiving is frowned upon. Our PTO is standard and I have generally used it for holidays and sick days (unfortunately). In addition, I have found that I have no longer enjoy the work that I am doing because it isn’t remotely healthcare related. Additionally, I am also having issues with a toxic corporate environment that has now led me to have anxiety every day coming into work. I have been trying to find jobs since the beginning of this year (especially closer to home) but as anyone knows the job market sucks. Because I would prefer to work in healthcare consulting or biotech, I was thinking about going back to school and preparing to apply. I was thinking about getting my mba (paired with a masters in chem/bio) or going to law school focusing in intellectual property law, medical law, or patent law. I understand law school might put me in a bind where I would be overworking and not spending time with loved ones but I’ve realized if I don’t spend time with my family, I’m unhappy and If I’m unambitiously not passionate about my job or career, I am also unhappy. 

I understand this is a lot. I think I really need advice on where I should go next and focus on long term and short term. Right now, I’m still prepping for exams I need to apply to grad programs and still applying for jobs. I really don’t know what I’m doing and I feel like I’m doing everything wrong and making mistakes.

1g2ghu3,Move from Management to Engineering role?,"Hello everyone,

I’m 29 years old and hold a bachelor’s degree in Materials Engineering. Right after graduating, I joined company A as a trainee Production Supervisor, where I stayed for 2.5 years before moving to company B, where I currently work in the same role.

Being a supervisor has its advantages, like being closer to strategic company decisions and having more visibility within the management and director levels. However, the role also comes with a heavier workload, longer hours, and greater responsibilities. (Interestingly, the starting salary for a supervisor is lower than that of an engineer, though over time they tend to equalize.)

Recently, I noticed an internal job opening for an Engineering II position. This caught my attention because, from my perspective, it could offer a higher salary and better work-life balance.

As a supervisor, I feel the role gives me a broader skill set, as I need to balance both technical and people-management skills, while engineers often focus on one or the other. Additionally, looking at the career paths of our current directors, many started as supervisors before becoming managers and, eventually, directors (one of them even began as an engineer before transitioning to supervision).

Despite this, I have some reservations. I’ve only been in my current role for 1 year and 3 months, and I’m concerned about being perceived as someone who jumps from one thing to another. Additionally, with a significant issue currently affecting the production area (which wasn’t caused by me but is within my scope of responsibility), I worry that leaving now might give the impression that I’m quitting in the face of challenges.

I am afraid to making a u-turn in my career, despite the short-term benefits and the potential long-term impact on my career trajectory. I’d greatly appreciate any advice or insights you might have.

Thank you!",operatorsof,2,1.0,1,1728788819,2024-10-13 03:06:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g2ghu3/move_from_management_to_engineering_role/,10,2024

Should they even have the right to keep an eye on their employees outside of work?,"I totally understand it from a point-of-view that companies should fire employees if they expressed racial slurs, hate comments, harmful posts, sharing confidential company information on social media but is it even right for companies to keep an eye on an employee's personal social media in the first place? That they should ""represent the company at all times"" even outside of work hours? Isn't the rule an ethical issue by itself? 

Like I've read stories of a man tagged in a Facebook photo where he was with his group of friends and it just so happens there were beers on the table and he was fired by his company for it because it ""seemingly showed/implied"" he was an alcoholic/hard drinker.

Another story was girl who had a photo of herself in a beach wearing a bikini and she was fired for it by her company because it was ""provocative"" ""lewd"" ""misrepresented the company"" even though its the appropriate swimwear for her to wear at a beach? Like what did her higher ups expect from her? To wear a shirt and jeans at the beach?? (ಠ⁠_⁠ಠ)

These firings...they're not even entirely related on an employee's job performance at work yet they were fired for it? Isn't this unfair?

I have this old classmate who took down all of her social media to detox herself digitally (and to not risk cases like those shared above) yet the workplace she's in insisted she have a social media account just so they could keep tabs on her and what she does online.

After a rough day and after working in the nursing for almost 2 years, I cannot fucking stand psych patients anymore. The fucking consistent bitching and whining, the angry at their wife, their husband, their kids, their whole fucking life while in the meantime trying to make yours a living hell. 

However I'm afraid I won't even like the general public either. I was thinking about going hard and attempting to specialize in dermatology to avoid these fuckers taking hero doses of fentanyl before admitting in my care. God damn I hate the FUCKING people even thinking about it. 

I don't know dude. All these careers don't look good either. Marketing? Business? Supply chain management? All of these to be a corporate cuck and shell out cash for major corporations. Tech?? Good luck. You might hit 10 years as a senior software dev or UX designer and get let go and be looking for a job for the next two years. 

What the fuck else is there???? I'm not talking about some niche career or starting off in Public Relations as some grunt working for 15 years to break 6 figs. Fuck that. I'm making 78k. I start out as a Data analyst? Making prob a solid 60k. I'd be a fucking fool.

1g2cg6j,Salary to Hourly “Demotion”,"I’m in Maine. My employer blindsided me with a demotion on one of my scheduled shifts last week. 

I have been a salaried worker for 3 plus years, salary minimum in our state is $844 weekly, however since we get paid biweekly I had a $1688 salary. This equates to roughly $21 and change hourly, however with this quote on quote “demotion” I will be making $18 and change. I have reached out to question when this change takes affect and what changes there will be to my job title but those have been met with no response. As far as I understand my job duties have expanded to two locations, am now responsible for my own travel and am not guaranteed my 40hrs of employment. Bear in mind this is a company where the customer comes first and although hourly employees are entitled to an unpaid break we may not always get one due to customer demand.

I have recently read through the salaried employees section via the Maine.gov website and learned that salaried employees starting in 2025 would legally be required to be paid at $1128 per week which would mean in my current employment would be at least $2256 biweekly.

I strongly believe this demotion was a result of the mandated uptick in wages but I want to know if I have any way/any case to pursue here for a wrongful demotion.

1g2c1ug,Gap Year - Entry-Level Jobs for a desperate situations.,"Hey.

I just graduated, and  already racked up debt, for various reasons. Include that with the tuition I am going to be paying next year, and I am in desperate need for money.

 To put it frankly, I want a well-paying job that does not require a college degree or diploma. Right now, I am working as a minimum wage cashier and it just is not paying enough for me to make any serious dent on anything.

  
It does not matter to me if it is gritty, or off-shore, or physically demanding. It can be harsh work, I'm young and I am willing to sufffer for a bit to make a bag rather than stay comfortable at my home town. Especially with how bad things are right now.

Cons: not challenging, I don't want to care for people in this way anymore, exposure to disguisting smells and bodily fluids including people's bowel movements, constant interruptions to workflow with hundreds of alarms constantly going off per hour, call lights, phone calls, family members asking to take the patient to the bathroom, bed alarms, chair alarms, no room for career advancement (I reached my ceilling of pay).

So since like middle school I kinda decided that I would do something in the medical field, just not exactly what. But, as Ive gotten older I've realized that in undergrad I would need to take classes such as math and chemistry which I literally SUCK so bad at. Because of that, I started to look into law since it matches my skillset more as I am really good in English and reading. Ive been able to have shadowing opportunities in both, and I will say that I like medicine a little better (and I would be able to work with kids which is something that I want) but I wouldn't mind working in law, its not something that I hate. The thing is, yes I like medicine, but I'm not sure if I want to heavily and severely struggle in my undergrad courses for it, potentially ruining my gpa, rather than doing something that I know I have talents in. But the thing is with law, like if I had to write a ""why law?"" essay I wouldn't know what to write other than it matches my skillsets, which I feel like isn't good because yes, its just a job at the end of the day but I feel like I need to have a personal basis of SOME as to why I want to go into to it but I don't really.

That Sr. PM was promoted internally to a different business unit within 4 months of my start date and I was tapped to be their replacement. 

It has not been smooth. They haven't backfilled another PM for my spot. I'm doing my best to get mentorship on project financials from others at the company HQ 500 miles away via Teams. I have 2 (remote) directors that are now riding my ass but don't understand the day to day and who are useless with ""leaning in"" to do any real work. 

I'm reaching a point where I may point out that this mega project is understaffed and I didn't sign up to be the only PM. 

 This pace and workload isn't sustainable. My old boss who I adore offered me my old job back, but it would mean a $30k pay cut (100k to 70k) and his hands are tied on upping that. I still think highly of the company I work for, but I didn't sign up to do 2 jobs, get zero help, and have my ass ridden for not being up to speed on the Sr. PM role.

- retired USAF, went to work as a civilian not long after

- get treated like im absolutely dumb as fuck because the profession is known to have a huge ego problem and people power-tripping which i did not know beforehand

- my ""shift lead"" who im paired with is the worst of the worst

- this guy legit talks about anything any time he can to make himself sound superior

- in the past three months, not one time, while hes been sitting there, has he ACTUALLY sat there quiet while i have made a serious of 9-10 mouse clicks , albeit critical to system operations, to see if i can do it on my own, or waited to talk until he saw something out of the ordinary

- in other words, he preempts every single click with verbal direction, every single time, every single click, which is low key insulting and completely undermines the POINT of the ""training"" which we all know is to get me able to work a shift *on my own*

- imagine having your trainer never shut their trap to find out if you can do something *by yourself*

- numerous times ive had to sternly tell him I GOT IT and then he realizes he needs to STFU

- sometimes he even tells other people ""if i get on a rant man just tell me to shut up""

- the other day, in an effort to talk about something, anything, he randomly brought up   
medication and then proceeded to get out all 7 of his prescriptions and  plopped them down on the table in front of 3 others and went on a tangent about how ne needs them

- he commonly talks about how he has $0 in his bank account

- & he commonly gloats, every single day, about he's basically the best to ever get in this line of work. to say he's massively delusional is an understatement. 

- due to a lack of personnel, theres no way to get off of his shift anytime soon (within two years).

Anyways, so I have always been told by my family and best friend I was good at putting outfits together, accordinating them, I have a thing for anything aesthetic. But im not passionate about fashion that much, nor designing them, I just love giving ideas and seeing what can go with what and sometimes I do it naturally. I have learned about personal stylist only days or weeks ago and I have asked my best friend if she sees me doing something like this and she said yes (i even picked a niche and problems that vould be solved with this), but I have multiple issues:

- I followed an influencer and stylist called Lauren Messiah, she's pretty famous and she said in person styling must be done before to get into virtual styling,  the thing is I have multiple health and mental issues that makes it impossible for me to get a normal job or even a licence so im looking for anything partly remote. 

- I live in a country side of France so this job isn't well known and I would have to work for a company but they're not so many here so I need to move (which I cant) 

- I have been looking at graphic design too but apparently its hard to find a job, and AI will eventually take over in the future so I don't see it as my ultimate career path.

1g258t9,Airline Pilot Considering a CS Degree in Spare Time,"...errrrrr hey folks, this is your captain speaking.

I'm looking for a bit of context and advice. I've been working in aviation for a few years and am currently at a large airline in the US. It's a fantastic job and I love it. I'm in my late 20's and the career path I'm on is a good one. I have significant free time, getting many days off as well as long layovers out on the road, so I've been thinking about doing something with that time.

A few years back I completed most of the Launch School curriculum, a solid software engineering program where I learned the basics from the bottom up. The flying career took priority and I haven't opened a code editor for a few years now. I miss really using my brain. I've been looking at getting a bachelor's in CS at somewhere like WGU. I think with transfers from my degree, a BS in Geology, and the tactical plans I've seen, I could get it done in about a year. The thought of relearning math and new-to-me languages is exciting.

I'm looking to get three things out of it: 1) A fantastic line on my resume to help me stand out for my dream airline job. 2) Establish a solid backup career, do some freelance work in my spare time, and potentially fully transition out of aviation if the right opportunity comes up, or my current industry tanks. 3) Just get back into the joy learning and working towards a goal.

I know the industry isn't that easy to break into right now, but I'm happy where I am, so I'm okay with that given the macro trend for the field is significantly positive. I also suspect I could find a niche given my background, would y'all agree?

So, what am I not seeing or considering? And what other programs might be good to consider as well?

The scope creep of my job has been eating at me for a few months now. I'm not sleeping well, I'm taking calls at all hours of the day/night/weekends, I always feel like I'm falling behind, I'm not taking care of my physical or mental health, my personal relationships with friends and family are failing, I can never be fully present doing anything, and I'm just not enjoying life anymore. 

I'm in the IT/informatics sect of the healthcare industry that allows me to earn more than what I went to school for and let's me work from home. I earn ~130K with 4 weeks PTO and decent benefits, and for a company with good opportunities for advancement. 

If I go back to a job role I originally studied and still maintain my certifications for, I'd earn about ~80K a year, would not be able to WFH, and would have few/no opportunities for advancement unless I went into management. 

I'm a DINK in a MCOL area, so I save about 40% of my income currently into retirement accounts. I really like the financial position this role has put me in - I'm on track for an early retirement if everything stays constant. I want to stay with my current company and get vested in my base-level pension in January, so I really want to find ways to make this work. I want to combat my burnout and regain the work/life balance I once had. 

But part of me thinks it's appealing to just go back to the role I originally studied for, push buttons for 8 hours a day, and then leave without taking work home with me. I'd be a low cog in the machine, but I'd at least have more bandwidth to enjoy life again. Am I crazy to consider this? 

How have you combated burnout and set healthy boundaries to regain a good work/life balance?

1g24oxp,Working for a small company,"I work at a small company where I’ve noticed most people seem to dislike me, despite my efforts to be friendly and professional. I'm reserved, don’t gossip, and don’t engage that much in small talk because it makes me uncomfortable. Early on, a direct coworker made it clear they didn’t like me. They barely interacted with me and complained to my manager about trivial things, like how I ask questions or my smell. This person is friends with both the manager and the owner, so their complaints led to frequent meetings where I always felt at a disadvantage.

The gossip spread, and my other coworkers started to distance themselves. I wasn’t invited to outings, and when I asked why, they either got offended or brushed it off as something I imagined. During a business trip, I commented on not being in many photos, and my employer took it as me blaming them, telling me I was ""crazy"" and should seek help.

When I couldn’t attend a non-work-related business trip, my employer was upset, despite me giving a month's notice. Their cold attitude continued. More recently, my direct coworkers in my department planned events and brought food to the office, but didn’t invite me to eat with them, even though I was right there. I got upset and sent a message to confront them, which escalated things.

We eventually had a meeting where they explained: 1) I’m not their friend, 2) they’re not obligated to invite me, 3) I should’ve asked to join, and 4) the exclusion wasn’t intentional. I apologized for blaming them, but the situation only made me feel more excluded. People can't be forced, but this does damage the teamwork morale. Nor did me blaming them make that improve the situation.

I understand coworkers don’t have to be friends, but in this small company where most people are close, it’s tough feeling like an outsider. If this were a larger company, I think these social issues wouldn’t be an issue. This company inhibits a working culture where everyone tries to be their friend and most people within my company gossip a lot. I could be sharing personal information with my manager, and they would tell my coworkers. Already happened to me a few times.

I decided to quit putting any energy into my attempts to connect with my coworkers and I continue to focus on my work. I have my social life outside of work too.

Has anyone else experienced something similar?

1g24ix7,Yes – It is Ethical to Lie in Interviews,"We need to stop believing that ethics in business are the same as ethics in your personal life. Executives do not treat it that way - and neither should we. 



Why do people get so offended by the prospect of lying in an interview? I’ve seen people propose lying on other subs, and “the mob” just gangs up on that person - using the word “fraud”, telling them they’re going to jail, talking about this supposed “HR blacklist” (which, btw, does anyone actually believe that HR is competent and coordinated enough to make a blacklist work?). Talking about this subject just brings out the worst reactions in people, because we think it’s the same as cheating or lying to your spouse… but it’s not at all. This is just business.



I believe everyone should lie, and there are ways to cover up in the subsequent background check if needed. No, lying will not “end your career”, and it could get you a job if everyone else is lying already… which this article below details evidence on.  



Look out for yourselves people!

1g242uu,Signs of mental abuse from a boss,"Hello, and thank you for listening.

I have worked for a company for 2 1/2 years. My boss singles me out. I am one to speak out and not let one walk all over me. She obviously doesn't like the fact that I do speak up and I am emotionally exhausted in dealing with her and even going to work. I have bipolar type 2 and ADHD as well. I am dealing with it well in my opinion since I am medicated, but it affects me so badly. 

Two employees of hers have quit due to feeling sick thinking about coming to work and dealing with her. The aren't the type to speak up. I only know why they quit because I asked them. I never thought I was in a situation with an abusive boss, but I am so sick of it and yesterday I came to the realization that she is probably abusive and it's not just me. She always says I am insubordinate and I have to watch everything I say in fear that she will say it's another insubordinate action. I have been written up twice in one day for the same thing when I was far from insubordinate on the second write up and was also suspended without pay for three days at that time. 

What are the signs of a mentally abusive boss in your experience and what can I do about it? 

It's really affecting me mentally and starting to affect my work. I feel like I can't speak up anymore for fear of being fired and I need the money. I've applied to other jobs, but have had no luck. I need to line one up before I do something like quit, but it's getting to the point that I can't stand even going in to work. 

I plan on doing something about it, but the retaliation has me putting it off.

Our global team in Spain has similar roles on them and there is a social media manager who is claiming to only do strategy work go forward. My boss tried presenting me as doing more execution work - which would be a huge demotion since I’m supervisor level and the work is more for a coordinator or specialist entry level. 

TLDR: What leverage do I have in this situation? I’ve been with the company 8 years. Have made it crystal clear i want growth and leadership progression and now they are trying to stick me with junior level tasks since the social coordinator role in Spain got laid off so now trying to give it to me on top of other responsibilities.

1g21fo9,Shared inbox with emails showing in deleted archive but also visible in the Completed folder,"This is going to be long- sorry lol. For context, I work in AP at a very large company. I’ve only been at this job for a little over 2 months. 8 people have been in my position in the last 2.5 years; 3 people have been fired and 5 quit. And I see why. The manager of our team is insufferable and micro-manages every little thing. The work load is extremely heavy and there’s not ever enough time in the day to get everything done. Apparently my company is notorious about letting people go with no warning, so needless to say, I have felt a tremendous amount of pressure to prove myself. I feel like I’m under a microscope 24/7. 


Myself and one other lady are charge of a shared inbox but 4 other people also have access to this inbox. Yesterday it was found that I missed posting an invoice that came to this shared inbox. One of my team members who is in a senior position found this email with the invoice in the deleted folder of the shared inbox. A few minutes later, our team manager and our team got onto a group call. All of us on the call have access to this shared inbox. She immediately started yelling at myself and my other team member accusing us of deleting emails. She had the senior team member share her screen and showed hundreds, if not thousands, of emails in the deleted archive. The weird thing is that all of the emails she was showing were relatively recent, like August-present day. The rule of thumb for our inbox is that once an email has been either processed or sent elsewhere, we mark it as Complete and move it to the completed folder. That way we can still go back and reference it, but it doesn’t contribute to the overall number of emails in the inbox- which my manager is very very strict on. The emails that were being shown as to be in the deleted archive were also visible in the Completed folder. I went and looked on my computer, and I only saw 7 emails in the deleted folder of the shared inbox, all of which were from July before I was hired. 

My manager and the other senior member were very aggressive in how they spoke to us and accused of of lying. She wanted us to “fess up” to who has been deleting the emails. She said that this will blow up and that we should never delete emails under any circumstance. Which I understand. No one has explicitly told me that at my company, but I feel that it’s common sense so I never deleted anything in the shared inbox. 

Myself and my other team member defended ourselves and staunchly denied deleting anything. My manager said this was an opportunity she was giving us to be honest and if that neither of us confessed, her next step would be to go to IT to pull the audit log and see who’s been deleting things. I brought up that we would have never deleted anything because we constantly have to go back in the Completed folder and reference things. It’s all stuff that we need on a daily basis - why on earth would we delete it?!? 

After I got home, I logged onto my laptop to double check my deleted folder on the shared inbox. I found all of my correspondence about the missed invoice from earlier that day in the deleted folder. I know for a fact I did not delete them. I left the office right after our meeting was over and didn’t get out my laptop until much later that night. How would I have deleted those emails that I need?! 

I’m now convinced that I’m going to be fired. My mistake of missing an invoice is what brought this whole deleted email thing to light. My 90 day review is coming up on 11/5 and I don’t have a good feeling about it. Does anyone have any insight on what could be happening with this shared inbox? How could my team member pull up the deleted archive, but everything in that archive is showing in the Completed folder? How is that even possible? How could my emails have been deleted after I left the office?

1g21e8s,How to make my sister understand this??," I'm 22M, a BCom grad, been working in sales for 2 years. Right now, I'm prepping for CFA Level 1 and planning to do an MBA later. We come from a lower middle-class family-mom works in a garment factory, dad's a driver both didn't go to school, and together they make about 35k a month. 

They somehow managed to send me to a decent college, and I'm doing my best to make the most of it. I've got a younger sister in her second year of BCom, and I've been trying to push her to think seriously about her future. I keep talking, scolding, even begging her to focus on her career, but she's just not getting it. I know how tough the job market is, especially for commerce grads, and honestly, we don't learn any real skills in college.

 I've been trying to guide her, showing her different options and telling her to explore a bit, try new things before it's too late. I've wanted to do CFA for the last 3 years but couldn't afford it back then. So, I worked in sales, saved up, and now I'm finally going for it. 

I don't want to be stuck in the same lower-middle-class cycle-I want to raise my family's situation. If my sister could also step up and be more ambitious, we'd be in a much better place.

I'm  a 21-year-old male from India, recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Psychology top of my class. I'm now in my first semester of a Master's in Psychology, but I’m uncertain about continuing in this field due to the effort required versus the pay. My dream is to move to the USA or another first-world country for a better standard of living. I planned to pursue a Ph.D.  in usa after master's, but the competitiveness of clinical psych Ph.D. programs in the USA and the lack of research experience in India do not make me an ideal candidate for those programs.

I've been struggling in my Master's, feeling that the syllabus is repetitive from my Bachelor's. I'm wondering if it's more of a country issue than a subject issue. I'm considering switching fields since I want to earn a decent living, not necessarily become super rich, but enough to afford what I need and live in a first world country.

I also have an interest in computer science, with some experience in R and Python. Considering the job market, I'm unsure if an MS in CS would be a viable path. I’m open to suggestions on switching career paths to the USA while ensuring a decent living and happiness.

Additionally, my undergraduate degree was three years, which is an issue since most US universities require a four-year degree. Any advice on how to navigate this would be greatly appreciated.

All of this has been weighing on me very heavily lately, and so I'm very confused. I really do love psychology, but I don't know if it's worth the effort. I feel like I’m all over the place right now, and it’s very confusing.

1g1yqis,Making mistakes at work ,"So I have anxiety which contributes to me being extremely sensitive and a people pleaser. Ive been working at my job for a little under 2 months and I try really hard to do a good job but feel like I constantly fuck up. Every morning the supervisors put in the group chat what we did wrong during close and since I close the store 70% of the time I feel like I’m the one constantly being called out. Most of the times it’s little things like leaving a dirty cloth out but honestly those messages being the first thing I see every morning sucks. Yesterday was a shitty shift I got really unlucky and managed to snap a key in the lock for the storeroom, so we had to buy a new one. Then later I managed to lose $20 and the receipt doing the store shopping. I didn’t want to get in trouble for losing money so I just replaced the $20 with my own money and didn’t tell anyone. But I did have to message about losing the receipt into the work group chat. I said “I lost the receipt but wrote down the total cost so I could do payout on the till, so that’s all fine”. (I was trying to tell my supervisor that I tried to fix the problem) but that obviously wasn’t good enough because my boss replied to me (tagging me in the message) “it’s not all fine no receipt means no gst back”. And that message made me feel like  shit. I Was kinda humiliated because the boss never messages and of course he has to reply to a mistake I made. I’m just overreacting but he worded it kinda rude. It’s not like I threw the receipt away it was in a wallet, which fell on the floor, and then someone stole.

1g1xuic,"Please give advice: My manager has delayed my compensation and title change for over 6 months, despite assuring me it’s justified based on my performance and experience. He blames bureaucracy and claims he’ll follow up with leadership or HR, but never follows through. What should I do?","**apologies for the long thread. It’s a combo of venting and laying out the situation to get your views on specific situations or ways to move forward. 

Summary of below is basically just what the title of the post says. 
* What should I have done differently? 
* What should I do now, am I SOL? 
* How do I not have resentment towards my manager and others if I don’t get a title change, salary increase?

Additional context: 
I started this job in January 2023 and immediately took on a variety of different tasks and complex projects in ways that adds significant efficiencies and value to the company, specifically its internal processes & mechanisms to achieve strategic initiatives. 

Because of this, combined with my pleasant attitude & willingness to assist in complex or difficult tasks, I received great marks on my mid-year and year-end 2023 performance reviews and received exceeds expectations throughout the evaluation for my mid-year 2024 review. 

Based on the performance reviews and daily tasks/ responsibilities, my manager, and I agreed that my current position does not sufficiently capture all of my duties and that a title change should and will take place to accurately describe what I do at the company. Additionally, we agreed that my salary should increase to align with market compensation for the new title. 

This conversation happened in March, and as I’ve been told, prompted a drafting of my job responsibilities to compare my duties and daily tasks to job title descriptions to identify what my new title should be. From there HR would collaborate with my manager to decide on the title and salary. This conversation between my manager and HR was said to have happened in March and led my manager to state the  change in title and salary is expected to be completed in several months, at the latest changes should be approved and incorporated by June. 

Since June, my manager and I discuss the topic once or twice a week. The conversation is always me reiterating the need to get this done, him assuring me that he’ll follow up with relevant personnel & get back to me. 

In May, I was told that the review process has completely changed and needs to be communicated and approved by leadership (his boss), have the head of HR sign off on the proposed changes and then it needs to be approved by a review board. So we’re not really making any progress as there are now more layers of bureaucracy to go through. I’m frustrated but taking it in stride. We now have to get his boss to approve, the head of HR to approve and a board to approve. 

My manager says that he presented the case to his boss and they’ve aligned on the new position title and salary. But now the issue is getting the head of HR to provide any info to us & getting the review in front of the final review board. We work with the head of HR quite a bit & my manager definitely has had the opportunity to bring it up during their one-on-one meetings. I’m constantly hounding him to address it with them and he just never does. He always says he forgot or something else took priority given its urgency or some excuse to not address it although it’s been several months. After we get HR to sign off we then have to go to the board so we hit a bottleneck before we’re even at the final step in the process. 

To try and light the smallest of fires under his ass, I insisted we have his boss take the lead with HR because he has more influence with global leadership and the FTE compensation review process. I further suggested that I handle the matter and more than willing to facilitate and discuss with his boss and HR to lighten his list of tasks to complete. But he has always been staunchly against me discussing this with HR or his boss since the beginning and strongly expresses that all communications go through him and all proposals for title change remain unknown until it is actually processed. 

I don’t reach out because of how serious he has expressed I don’t communicate with any of the relevant parties regarding the subject and he again assures me that he’ll make it a point to talk to him sometime in the day. Or course the workday flys by & he doesn’t get to talk to this boss about it. The next day my managers boss leaves town around 3pm, and I really explain to him how important it is to discuss with his boss if I’m not able to in order to get this addressed. The conversation is pretty direct and honest with me explaining to him how important it is to me that we don’t let this slip by the way side. He is sure that he’ll talk to his boss before he leaves. The next day comes and I’m pestering the hell out of him to talk to his boss about it and he says he will, “ I have a meeting with him in 10 mins,” etc. and he goes into his meeting and when he comes back there has been no convo with his boss about the topic and he believes a convo doesn’t need to happen because we’re just waiting on HR’s response and then the boards review and hopefully it’s approval. 

Now it is October and we are still waiting on HR. He continues to say he’ll talk to HR almost on a weekly basis and he never does. It being October is an issue because we have started our 2025 budget forecast worksheets for the region, and a lot of the data used in our models are the exact figures for compensation for each employee for end of year 2024. The comp is used to calculate est. for 2025 costs based off of salary increase assumptions pushed down to us by global leadership. 

The budget for 2025 is due at the end of October and the yearly forecast typically dictates how we track and evaluate the year so when it’s done it’s basically written in stone & generally used as a baseline for employees compensation costs. Unless explicitly review, approved & manually entered into the budget, my salary will be calculated with the assumptions from leadership and title and salary will reflect no change. If that happens, I’ll feel as if I don’t have any respect at this company. I don’t know how my manager and his manager agree that a position change and salary increase are necessary and it doesn’t happen and impacts my attitude and confidence in my position because they were too busy or because I’m an after thought. 

So please give me advice as to how I can go about getting this taken care of.
* What should I have done differently? 
* What should I do now, am I SOL? 
* How do I not have resentment towards my manager and others if I don’t get a title change, salary increase?

1g1xqxt,Between a rock & hard place … advice needed,"Been at my company about 8 years. Came from a previous company, (with the same boss), where I was doing the same work. Did 5 years there. 
My career goal is to be dept Director & I’ve made that known. In my current role, I’m told by my boss that his vision is that I am the Director, IN A FEW YEARS.  I recently asked about the direction I’m headed in and I was reminded that my last “big” raise was not long ago - 2 years ago. I only got this raise because I  was very underpaid & when a recruiter came along, I took a chance. When I gave notice to quit, my current employer made me a decent offer to stay, and so I did. To justify the increase, my title wasn’t changed, they simply added “Senior” to it.  I’ve been pretty happy since. I basically run the department - it was built from scratch when I got there so I know all of the ins and outs. For a long time, it’s been my boss (exec level) and myself. I have created many processes & I have lots of industry specific knowledge. I get along well with my boss, & it’s a remote role, which works for me.
I was recently approached by a family member that heads HR at his company. There is a manager (possibly director) position available to which they believe I can be great at. When looking at my resume & the posting, they align well. The salary would be 40k more than what I’m making now (& it’s also remote), BUT it’s a whole different industry! I don’t have a business degree so I’m scared of taking chances - always have been.  This new company, like mine, is a growing company however, they retain, invest & promote their employees. I’m in my mid 40’s & single, so I have to be careful with whatever decision I make.

1g1x4p8,Is my boss disrespectful or am I overreacting? ,"I have just started a new job 3 months back at a relatively junior position. The work is generally fine, and the colleagues are very nice people. I have realised that I don’t enjoy working with my manager but I chalked it up to me being new and a matter of getting used to their managing style. 

Recently, I worked on a project where a colleague suggested I consult certain stakeholders for feedback on my manager’s instructions. Following this, I reached out to the stakeholders. However, my manager was upset that I hadn’t confirmed with them first, as their intent was for only a different stakeholder (which is the manager of the stakeholders I reach out to) to review. This led to a tense call where I was berated for not verifying the process and for following the colleague’s guidance. My manager made some comments that i felt was really unneeded and not helpful (e.g why am i still making such a basic mistake when I already have some working experience, why am I following my colleagues’ guidance when they are not my manager, and should they then hold my colleague accountable for giving me wrong instructions in a sarcastic tone). There were also subtle digs at my competency level. They also threatened to just drop this project and not showcase it. 

Honestly, I felt that it was just a case of miscommunication and it was easily rectifiable. There was no need to go that extent. I also felt disrespected but I’m not sure whether I’m overreacting.

So I go ahead and make the adjustments they want to see, but they are never enough - and on top of that, they always compare me with coworkers and that pisses me off so much.

1g1t6su,Boss asks me to find a volunteer rep from our larger team to join a cross functional side project task force. What would you do?,"Myself and 3 peers on a team of 30+ were invited to a short notice special task force meeting by a senior leader in another function. The context for the invite was that 1 rep from our org should join and commit to continued involvement. No management on our team was cc’d. 

The problem is the group of us are overextended and covering for others on parental leave. There’s little political capital  to be gained from this type of side project, also. We talk and decide to email our manager to see how they’d like to proceed given the situation and suggest they open to the larger team or take to the other managers on the larger team to find someone. 

Manager emails back encouraging me to share with our larger team of 30+ and that someone may volunteer. We all know how that would play out. 

I don’t see a good outcome from this suggestion. Frankly, this kind of team delegation is management’s job so our team can execute efficiently. Reaching out to our larger team as someone not in a talent management role with an “opportunity” for a savior comes across as shirking off work and is just a bad approach politically. If no one responds, I have to go back to manager and ask that they find someone else.

How would you approach?

1g1sca5,23 feeling lost and no direction again,"I entered university right after high school, without a clear plan or sense of direction. I wasn’t a strong student—much of my attention was consumed by video games, and as an introvert, I struggled to connect with college life. My first semester ended poorly, with a 1.78 GPA, which placed me on academic probation.

In March 2020, when COVID hit, my life was turned upside down. At just 18 years old, I lost my mother—my only parent—and the grief was devastating. I felt trapped in a web of guilt, sadness, and confusion. I moved in with relatives on my mother’s side, even though they hadn’t always been on good terms with her. They took me in, likely out of sympathy, but despite their help, I felt isolated and disconnected.

As I tried to navigate the grief, I fell into unhealthy habits. I started smoking weed and drinking with my cousins, which only made things worse, and eventually, I began doing these things on my own. I kept enrolling in college courses, but I would consistently drop out, unable to stay committed. I lied to my relatives about still being in school, and I frequently changed majors because I had no real direction. For two years, I drifted, working part-time in dead-end warehouse jobs, feeling stuck and without purpose.

In the summer of 2022, I traveled to the Philippines for the first time without my mom. It was an emotional trip—being around family members who shared memories of her helped me reflect deeply on my life. The experience gave me a glimpse of hope and clarity about the path I was on. However, shortly after returning, I got injured, leaving me unable to work from August to November 2022. That felt like rock bottom—not working, not going to school, and feeling completely stuck.

During that time, a relative from my dad's side in Houston reached out and offered me a chance to move in with them. In June 2023, I decided to take that opportunity, hoping a change of environment would help me get a fresh start. I moved to Houston, enrolled in community college, and eventually transferred to university. It felt like a new chapter after so many lost years. My goal was to finish my degree, experience college life, meet new people, and become more social.

Now that I’ve settled into university, I’m noticing the same unhealthy patterns creeping back in. My cousins in Houston share some of the same habits as those I left behind, and it's been affecting me negatively. I’ve lost motivation and discipline, and as a result, I’m failing two out of my four classes this semester, with no way to recover. I initially pursued a business degree, thinking I was interested in it, but now I’m questioning whether it's the right path for me. To add to the stress, I recently overheard my relatives talking about wanting me to move out, so it’s clear I’ll need to find a new place soon.

Right now, I feel like I’m back where I started, just in different circumstances. I’m beginning to think I had a misguided view of college, believing it was the right path for me. I feel out of place and not meant to be here. I’m seriously reconsidering whether I should stay in school or explore more practical options like trades. I’ve already tried joining the military, but due to health reasons, several branches denied me.

I want to move out and live independently, but with my current experience and working only minimum-wage jobs—like my current warehouse position—I’d barely be able to get by. Even if I managed to move out, I would still need to pursue a career that could offer financial stability. I’m feeling stuck and uncertain about my next steps. Should I continue with school, take out loans, and keep pushing forward since I’ve made it this far? Or should I take a step back, work full-time, save up until I can afford to move out, and then reassess my future?

1g1s5cp,Be kind and supportive of your coworkers who are experiencing difficult time. Invest and you can reap the rewards.  ,"Tech industry has had a few rough years. When my colleagues got laid off, I would reach out. And for those I worked closely with, I'd volunteer to write them linkedin endrosements. I crafted all endorsements with my heart and soul, often spending hours for one endrosement, documenting what they accomplished and what the colleague helped me with ( hate those non-sense rub-each-other's back endorsements).   

Many years ago when I was laid off, very few of my coworkers reached out to me, including many that I had selflessly devoted significant time to help. I was hurt and did not quite understand why people were so cold and transactional. I climbed ladder hard, currently an executive VP managing a 200+ org in a prominent company,  and suddenly I got a lot of linkedin connection requests, messages, and even direct ask for me to consider giving them a job, because that former company just had a mass layoff. Again, I do not quite understand how people could be so transactional. 

Be kind and supportive. When a coworker is laid off, sending a simple linkedin message can mean a lot. Invest a few minutes of your time; it shows you care. Remember, genuine connections shouldn’t be solely for your own benefit.

1g1qpuy,The opportunity cost of your 20’s ,"Hi all! I’m not sure this is the correct subreddit, so please let me know if you recommend I post this elsewhere. 

Straight out of high school I got a job as an administrator. The company I work for is small, and the owner is known for being deceitful and often times exploitative. He will use and abuse you- but give you a 5k bonus afterwards because he “felt like it”. It is mentally taxing. But also hard to walk away from so much money at 22 years old. 
There are several examples I could provide, some being: 
- took back a job offer I had already been given, stating it was “too much” 
- did not fire an employee I made a sexual assault complaint towards
- doesn’t reply to any of my emails for approval. Gets mad at me for not meeting deadlines 
 - pays me less than the employees that report to me (openly admits it is due to my age) 
The list goes on. 

This job is not preparing me for any career path I am interested in. I’m a full time student and this job leaves me with plenty of time to complete my schoolwork. However. 

I’ve found another career I am interested in exploring, and it would be excellent relevant experience for my degree. My partner, who is my age, easily makes enough to support both of us and then some. (My money is usually put towards vacations or emergency money. I can count on one hand the times we have had to dip into my account) however I am pretty nervous to “rely” on a partner. I’ve always really liked knowing I would be able to rent a place on my own if it was a necessity. 
When accounting for stipends I would be taking a $14/hour pay cut. That is TERRIFYING. 
(For context, I live in CA. Cost of living is HIGH) 

But, I know this relevant experience would look incredible upon completing my education. I also know I would feel a sense of purpose and pride in my work. (Which I do not feel now). 

My question: Has anybody ever walked away from a job with great pay, in pursuit of long term gain? Did it work out okay? Do you have any advice? 

I apologize for the long post! Any advice is greatly appreciated. Happy Friday y’all. (: ",NationalWar118,1,1.0,0,1728701224,2024-10-12 02:47:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g1qpuy/the_opportunity_cost_of_your_20s/,10,2024

While searching for a thesis topic, I came across machine learning and AI. A few years ago, I was involved in competitive programming, so I have some knowledge of C++, data structures, and basic algorithms like BFS and DFS. I recently learned the basics of Python and am currently taking an online machine learning course. I find data science, ML & AI more interesting than civil engineering.

I am considering pursuing a master’s degree in either data science or AI after completing my bachelor's. However, I have seen many posts on Reddit about the CS job market not being in a good state, with fresh graduates complaining about an oversupply of candidates. On the other hand, recruiters mention that while there are many applicants, the number of qualified candidates is still low.

Now I am a bit confused. I’m unsure whether I should stick with civil engineering, despite not having much passion for it, given the competitive CS job market, or if I should pursue a master’s in data science or AI and give it a try. I also don't have much insight into the civil engineering job market.

I would appreciate your advice on this situation. Thank you in advance.

1g1phko,Stay at new job or go back to old job,"
I’ve been at my new job for a three months but I find myself wondering if I did the right thing.

I learned my old job is hiring a replacement for me and I’m wondering if I should reach out to them. 

My biggest concern is burning this new bridge and the instability and future of my old company over the next 20 years 

New job:
There’s drama which I haven’t had in many years. 
Benefits coverage aren’t as good as my old job. 
On-site only M-F


Old job: 
been with them for 15 years
Good PTO and holidays 
WFH full time
Instability with job retention/layoffs

Reddit, what should I take into consideration?
Questions to ask myself? What would you do? 

Thanks in advance.

1g1omkl,Expectations for Salary increases and when to leave,"I am mid career (late 30s early 40s) working in tech for a large(5,000+ person) publicly traded consulting firm in the US. I joined the firm over 3 years ago after working 10 years in industry. Upon my hire I negotiated a 30% increase in my compensation. Overall I’ve adjusted well to consulting, enjoy the work, and my performance metrics are good. 

Anyway, this is 3rd year this firm is not providing any type of compensation increases either for COL or performance based. I’m not stressing too much since I got such a significant increase but of course it means less as the years pass. This company performs well on the market and has a good reputation.

I’ve asked why no increases and was told by management the company simply isn’t providing increases… no extra explanation provided even when pressed. This company performs well on the market, wins multi-million dollar contracts and has a good reputation. 

I asked my 10 other colleagues if they also are not receiving increases and they all had the same experience except for one who got promoted.

So at what point does one decide they are not being valued anymore for the work they perform? Is it time to move on? Is lack of compensation increases standard practice for consulting firms with employees hopping every couple years?",LovesBacon50,4,0.8399999737739563,8,1728694093,2024-10-12 00:48:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g1omkl/expectations_for_salary_increases_and_when_to/,10,2024
1g1olkd,Help! Negotiation after receiving offer,"I just received a job offer lower than what I was expecting. I fit the qualifications perfectly (almost too perfectly!) and the recruiter mentioned they have been trying to fill this position for months. 

When the hourly rate was first mentioned to me, (during initial phone screen), she gave me a number right in the middle of the posted range. I asked about negotiating and she said the higher end of the range was for ""internal hires"". I was hoping that after talking with the team and finding out I'm a perfect fit, I would have been offered a higher rate. This is a mid to senior level role. When the recruiter called to let me know she was sending me an offer letter, it was the same mentioned in the initial phone screen. I was genuinely excited and thanked her for the news, and in the chaos I just sort of panicked and didn't ask to negotiate.

Would it be seen negatively if I reach out now asking to negotiate? 

Something like ""Hi \_\_\_\_, so after reviewing the offer further, I wanted to reach out to see if there was any wiggle room on the hourly rate? I know you initially mentioned the higher end of the range was for internal hires. After meeting with the team and learning more about the role, I think my varied experience in \_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_ mean I bring unique and valuable skills to the team.""

1g1kjbd,"I accepted a job promotion, and now I regret it. ","So, I’m in a bit of a pickle and would love some advice or insights from anyone who has been in a similar situation.

I currently work remotely for a company, and mine is the only remote position. A few months ago, the company offered me a manager position onsite in Albania, with a salary more than double my current pay. I turned it down because I didn’t want to relocate. Then, two months later, they offered me the same position again but with an even higher salary—almost triple what I’m making now. Again, I said no because I didn’t want to move to Albania.

Fast forward to last week: I started thinking that maybe I was being too picky, and I reached out to ask if the position was still open. They told me it was filled but offered a similar high-paying role, still requiring relocation to Albania. Without giving it much thought, I said yes, and I ended up signing the job proposal within an hour.

Now, I’m supposed to move to Albania in two weeks. After finally doing some research on the country, I’m honestly not thrilled about it, and I’m having serious second thoughts. I know I should’ve done my homework before jumping into this, but here we are.

The worst part? I was the one who reached out to them for this position after turning it down twice. I realize this is a serious role, and I can't just treat it like a game where I can back out whenever. But at the same time, I’m really unsure about making this move. I’m considering asking them to let me stay in my current position, but I’m worried about how that’ll come across.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do? How would you handle this situation? Is it worth trying to stick with my current remote role, or do I just bite the bullet and move? I’d appreciate any advice or experiences you can share!

1g1jx13,When should I hand in my notice? ,"So I have a bit of a complicated situation and I'm hoping someone can give me some advice. 

I am currently working for a start up. I am responsible for the marketing and design but really do a little bit of everything. (Important note: a lot of the things that I do especially design related, I am the only person who can do them because nobody else has Adobe and this is the program we use for all our design) 

Most of the people are nice and generally the work is ok but there are just a lot of different reasons why I think it's time for me to quit. Main one being that I'm just overloaded and overwhelmed. 

I planned a trip for 5 weeks in late Feb with my boyfriend to Brazil. Originally I was going to work a week or two from Brazil (because I work remotely anyway) but since I decided to quit I thought it would be best to hand in my notice so that my last day is just before the trip. I was planning to hand in my notice at the end of November because that would give them enough time to find my replacement. (I have to give two months notice so if I tell them just before Christmas break that really only gives them like a month and a half) 

Now where things get tricky ... 

My therapist advised me to raise my concerns with my boss anyway because I have nothing to loose. So I did and he was very understanding and now wants to employ someone part time to help with the workload. 

So now I feel bad because if he will employ someone part time now and then basically in a month he will have to start looking for a full time replacement then it will be bad no? 

My question is should I just tell him now that I plan on quitting anyway? 

I want to be fair to them because their not bad people but I need to leave because this place just stresses me out. But again these are not the only reasons.

I recently left my previous company after being with them for nearly two years—primarily as an intern for a year, followed by a brief full-time role. During my internship, I consistently received positive feedback and was eager to transition to a permanent position, which took longer than expected due (5 months I know this was a major red flag but I was desperate for a job)to internal delays. While I did miss a few non-mandatory meetings for medical reasons, I wasn’t given any formal warnings about attendance. Ultimately, despite my increasing workload and initiative, I was let go unexpectedly. My former manager even left before me, saying I should leave too when I was still an intern. Now, I’m focused on moving forward and leveraging my real work experience to apply for new roles. My question is should I play it off I’ve been working (insert full time position title) the last two years instead of including majority of it I was just an intern? I feel very worried as I’ve never been fired before and also I was fired after such a brief amount of time. I suspect it was extremely poor management as they fired my coworker one week before me.

1g1hzfv,No response from previous employer ,"Was working as a freelance contractor for over a year now. My goal was to get a contract for a full time position that would require a lot of traveling. I got brought back on to help prep for their new season but I was in a serious dilemma because my gf doesn’t approve of it. So I told my manager unless I’m given a contract, I wouldn’t be able to stay with the company. He mentioned the boss was gonna be in the following week to see how I do (basically my shot at getting full time position) I completely froze. I also had committed to work a few projects with other companies. Few days later, it all hit me that I just turned down my dream job because my gf didn’t approve of it. So I emailed the boss back apologizing for my absence that week, how much I value the company, and how much I’ve done for the company, and everything I’ve learned. I also messaged the manager going more into personal details , and emphasizing that wasn’t thinking straight and had to get out of the relationship I was in that was psychological affecting me. I Literally ended my 4- year relationship because I truly felt like I was manipulated into leaving the company, and I don’t want to stay with a partner resenting them for having given up a really big opportunity for me in my career field. I’ve had to give up a lot of aspirations of mine and parts of my life for this person and it all hit me at once that I made the worst decision of my life
I’ve seen a few posts saying go for “Hail Mary” and call or show up. But it seems a bit invasive. They have a high turnover rate because the job can be physically demanding and there’s no guarantee for any of the temporary hires they’ll be brought on for full time roles, and right now they have ongoing hiring for a few full time positions. They’ve called me back to work 3 times in the past year & I currently have the most experience with the company out of that group of new hires by a huge margin. If anyone has been in this position before, how did you handle it? Did you call or show up? Im hoping the new temporary hires don’t work out and they call me back. They know im good at my work but im afraid their trust in me is completely broken

1g1hlrg,"Cut my internship short, advice on moving forward? ","Hi, so bear with me as I have a bit of a long-winded background to my situation:

I recently graduated this summer with a masters in medical sciences a focus in medical informatics. The summer prior (2023) I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship to work at a company abroad in Germany as a data science intern while finishing up my thesis. I had originally specified to the scholarship organization that I could only stay for a max 3 months in order to return home in time to complete my defense, but a month before the start, I was told by the manager that there was a miscommunication with HR, and I would need to remain an extra month to meet internship length regulations for non-European students. Since I had already arranged lodging and flights (the department at this company refused to assist in any way with housing or flights), I agreed to the new end dates since it was too late to change everything without incurring costs out of my budget. Once I arrived, I mention this to the manager who says he'll see about speaking to HR in a month to figure out an alternative for me and the other student I came with (who also had to cut their own internship short for a different reason). I figured we would cross that bridge when I got there.

The internship ended up not being a great fit. The department didn't have anything concrete setup for us to work on and couldn't explain what it was exactly they were trying to accomplish. The type of work also ended up being not relevant to my field of studies. That being said, I also did not work as hard as could have while there, I will admit. I asked my academic advisor again if I can remain an extra month abroad, but they pressured me to return to finish my defense on time. So I bring up speaking to HR about ending the internship early again to my manager. He looks concerned and states that this is the first time he's hearing about this and it would be difficult to get this past HR. Wonderful. Eventually after going through possible workarounds with him, including potentially continuing to work from home with a borrowed company laptop, he speaks to HR about the matter, and me and the other student  end up being asked to submit a letter to prematurely end our internships. My manager, who has been utterly dismissive of me up to this point, warns me doing this will ""close the door on returning to this company"". 

Despite this, I knew I wanted to stay at the company, but within their North American division in different department that I think is more related to my field and would be closer to my family. After returning home, I reached out on LinkedIn to a possible lead in said department with a positive referral by a different manager who I had worked more closely with. I get a response from this lead, interviewed, and get told they would be excited to work with me, they just need to bring it up to their own boss. After 2 weeks I check back in with them, and they assure me they haven't forgotten about me. After that exchange, I've gotten no responses despite reaching out one more occasion on LinkedIn. I'm worried I may have come off as a bit too desperate.

I've been applying for jobs as data scientist/data analyst in the interim but haven't gotten other leads as the market is very competitive now. I'm currently unemployed and looking to enter the a biotech/diagnostics industry, but I am really struggling to get any interviews. Have I completely fumbled my shot at ever working for this company? Any advice would be much appreciated.

1g1gqht,Help Deciding Between Fields of Chemistry?,"

Good day everyone, 

I am currently a 15 year old student in Year 10 who is preparing for my IGCSES in 2026. Ever since last year, I didn’t really know what I wanted to do with my life but I met a teacher. She was really strict and forced us to study days on end at such a low level (grade 9) using IGCSE questions in our mocks. This made me interested more especially within the theoretical side of chem. She taught us about the atom, reactions, thermodynamics and reaction rates and trends. I found it fun and exciting. 

Now, I don’t know if I will continue to find it fun but I have genuinely never had a subject interest me more. Only studied with her for 2-3 months but I was genuinely interested. Now, I’m in a new school and a new curriculum and I wanna figure out what to do. 

I’d just like to state that I have done some basic research on fields of chemistry. The ones that stick out to me the most are Chemical Engineering and Physical Engineering. I don’t know if I’ve done enough research but both seem to suit what I like within chemistry. Physical for its theories and studying the atom and reaction based fundamentals which I was inspired by. Chemical Engineering more or so by its lucrative pay plus high demand. 

Also, I am not very good at mathematics. We took algebra and more basic algebra topics. Now, I may not be particularly great at them but I am willing to put in the effort and time to study in depth and take additional classes and more hours to learn. Physics also interest me and I know these 3 subjects will play big roles in whatever I choose. 

I want something that will excite me, something to be passionate about. I like Chemistry, if those lessons count as a core of chemistry. Who knows if I’ll switch careers upside down but I want something stable, good payment and science. 

 If any of you can advise me, I would really appreciate it. Thank you all. ",Admirable_Call2739,2,1.0,0,1728671628,2024-10-11 18:33:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g1gqht/help_deciding_between_fields_of_chemistry/,10,2024
1g1ggi5,Challenges in Team Leadership and Assertiveness,"Hi,

I’m currently a team leader, which is just below the manager level in my company. My responsibilities involve leading projects, designing their framework, and building financial models.

I don’t like being bossy; I prefer listening to different perspectives to get the best results. I try to be kind and tolerant with my team members, but I feel like this might make me seem weak. I’ve been reflecting on this recently.

During meetings with partners and managers, there’s an analyst who often interrupts me and tries to make himself look important. It’s frustrating, but I’m unsure how to handle this.

Another issue is when someone suggests something that doesn’t make sense. I usually respond with ""maybe"" or ""it could be"" because I don’t want to discourage them. However, they tend to persist with these bad ideas. I try to politely point out why their approach is wrong, but we end up wasting a lot of time.

Do you have any suggestions? I’m new to leading teams and could use a lot of advice.

1g1gfce,Need advice please! ,"TL;DR

Need to understand whether I should switch from a fairly stable job with a good payment but micromanager and no growth prospects vs. a Seed stage startup with a leadership role and a slight paycut (since equity is only paper money at this point) YoE: 14

I have started a job about 5 months ago with a product company offering flexible work but my manager is too immature and always micromabages which is making me uncomfortable and adding stress though the work is NOT so stressful

I feel like punching in his face till he bleeds to death! I carry so much frustration 

I have been looking out and found an offer from a seed funded startup in a senior leadership role with similar payment except the stocks which is just paper money until the company goes public

I'm.in a dilemma and have been unable to make decisions of late.

1g1gbal,"Have 5 yrs experience in IT, but I feel not good enough to get new job.","I have 5 years of experience. In those 5 years I made a bunch of mistakes as a developer.

Until the last 2 years, where I felt a bit confident in myself and the way I handle new rising code problems, but not  as good as  a 5 years developer good.

Now, Im looking for a new job opportunity and I find myself  doing one of these senarios: applying to 5yrs positions where the interviewer tells me that they need someone more knowlegable( know more tools that the ones I had worked with or the ones Im cutrently learning) and ""mature"" than me( Really one of them told me they need a mature developer and it made me so shocked). Or I apply for entry level from 0 to 3yrs and they tell me they are looking for freshers or they'll think about it. But no feedback received from them later.

To be frank, I feel like I have 5 years on paper but inside me I feel like I only have 2years that Iam proud of. I currently work hard on learning new things and put to practice what I learned so far to increase my confidence. But man, in each interview I feel like Im not fit for the job and not good enough.

1g1g09d,Getting into a C-level or VP role,"Throwaway account for ... reasons.

I am senior in my career. The last two FTE roles I had, I was ""promoted"" within the position but without the pay and title. This happened to me earlier in my career as well when I was kind of dumb and didn't ask for the raise and title. But the last two FTE roles, I did ask, and was told no. The last role even told me they would never make the position a Director level. And then when I left, they opened up the role as a VP role. 

After that last experience, I decided to open up my own company and work as a contractor making MUCH better money that I did in any FTE role. Not only that, I staffed people in my company as well. The company quickly grew to over $1M in revenue in 5 years. The entrepreneurship experience was amazing because not only did I have my own skills in my field, but I now crossed multiple industries and had the experience of running a company and all that comes with it: business development, recruiting, client management, the list goes on and on. As the company grew to over $1M, I was also billable at at least 40 hours a week. 

It was a recipe for burnout though and I am ready to get back into the workforce. I am looking at COO roles or VP or Director roles within companies. And there is rejection everywhere. The only way I am to be considered for a position, it seems, is if I directly held that exact title position before. And I haven't. I've done the work of VP-level. I've consulted to many C-levels as they've worked through business challenges. My network is pretty good and I ask for introductions to C-levels whenever possible. 

But still, I'm not considered for any roles. I am wondering if I just give my own company another shot and sit there. There is easily another $1-3M I can probably squeeze out of it if I muster the energy. I just... don't really have the energy for that. 

Where do I go from here?

1g1fomn,When did you know it was time to move on? ,"
I don’t know if I’m burned out or just unhappy and unfulfilled. It’s likely a little bit of both. I’m a petroleum engineer and have been in that industry, upstream and downstream, for 15 years now. 

The various positions I’ve held have always required a ton of travel/away from home time. I had a kid early in college and missed a lot of him growing up from always being in the road. Since Covid I have married and had a daughter. She’s now 18m. It’s tough thinking I’ll miss so much of her growing up too. I’ve been feeling like it’s time for a change. 

My wife has been very supportive. She’s stated whether I want to go back to school or do something as simple as real estate, she just wants me to be happy. The thought of going back to school was enticing for a fleeting moment. But I realized that would be at least a couple years of not earning like I am now. And going the medical route, I’d likely end up in another situation where I’m just overworking and not finding the life balance I’m looking for. Real Estate is an interesting field, but a massive gamble considering 90% of people fail at it. And of the 10% who do make it, only about 20% are hugely successful. 

I’m nearly 38. When I chose this career path, I pretty well assumed I’d be a career minded person forever. Work and money would always come first. But now, that’s not quite the case. Those of you who changed careers midlife, when did you know it was time? How did you know? What was your transition and are you happier now?

My mind tried to convince me wanting a change at my age isn’t practical. But I just don’t feel the passion for this work that I once did.

1g1fkli,"Mom doesn’t get the job hunt struggle, and I’m losing hope","I’m 27 (M), did my BCA-MCA(Masters in Computer Applications), but while studying I understood that I am not enjoying coding, networking, and database work. I chose computer science in high school(+1,+2) because my cousins did, and somehow made the admission for MCA and made it through. During the degree, I found UI design and development interesting, but I had no clue it could be a career. I was also not aware of internships or how to get those.

After graduating in 2020, I couldn’t land a job because I was terrible at aptitude tests. One of my cousins through his contact got me an internship which focused on Automation and ML, I hated it and found the work culture to be very toxic and i resigned from there within 2 days. COVID hit, and I ended up staying home for a year. Before leaving for the UK to do an MBA (basically just to escape home), I tried writing IBPS and SSC exams, but I didn’t study for them and obviously didn’t clear them.

I spent two years in the UK trying to apply for jobs with my MCA (cause I knew being a fresher MBA wont land me in a job, I was not intrested but i still tried applying for some management jobs but no luck), did some front-end projects, but nothing worked out. That’s when I discovered UI/UX design, took an online certification course (started it when i was in the UK, finished it after coming to India), and came back to India. Since then, I’ve built a portfolio (which i also started when i was i the UK), did some case studies, but a year has passed and I still haven’t landed an internship, let alone a job.

Now my mom nags me (which she always does. Cant blame her, I Know) to “just go drop off CVs at companies”—like that’s going to work. She doesn’t get how tough things are right now. She doesn't understand the job market. She is working in a public sector bank. I feel like I’m sinking. My confidence is gone, and I’m thinking about going back to studying for government exams (like IBPS or SSC) and giving it a real shot this time. But honestly, I’m anxious and confused. I don’t know if I should stick to UI/UX or give up and prepare for those exams.

Is anyone else stuck in this limbo? How do you deal with the pressure when nothing seems to be going your way?

Ironically I posted earlier this week about a conversation I had with my manger making me think I wasn’t getting promoted.

As fate would have it, that very same day I was approached by leadership to potentially take a new role to help grow a strategic account. It would include a promotion but the work would more or less be the same as what I’m doing now. My guess is that it would come with a 10-15% increase but a lot more visibility and tougher hours. 

Initially I felt excited but the more I think about it the work doesn’t excite me and the experience would be things that I’ve already accomplished in my career. My excitement is purely based on ego I think. 

My gut is telling me that I should leverage the better title into something else outside the company but I’m concerned it’ll look bad to leave so soon after a promotion. I also don’t want to turn the promotion down as I’m sure it’ll black ball me in the future.

I recently had a virtual interview with the hiring manager for a new position this past week and during the interview he liked speaking with me and invited me to an onsite interview to view the facility and discuss the roll. That tour happened yesterday and it went great and it lasted the whole hour that it was scheduled. I would say the tour went very well and I was engaged and the hiring manager was engaged also. At the very end we started to talk about our personal lives and we had some things in common. When the interview was over we shook hands and he mentioned that the recruiting team would reach out to me about next steps. I said great and that hopefully I get to work along side him, I even sent him a thank you text about the tour since he gave me his personal cell. Now I am nervous as heck that I am not gonna get the Job because I haven't heard from the company in a day. I know I am overreacting  but the thing is that the interviewing process has been so quick. I applied for the job on Monday in the afternoon and latter that evening I get a DM from the hiring manager asking to schedule an interview. So have the interview that next day and then I have this onsite interview with him. I guess since it has been a fast turn around for everything I was expecting to hear back from recruiting quickly. Is this a bad sign that I am no longer being considered for the job? I would also say that I am anxious because this is big opportunity for me to leave my toxic job also?

1g1dv64,Tired of being cheap labor,"I work on marketing for US based companies, but I do so remotely from Mexico or as part of their local subsidiary. Pay is good in my local currency, and for them I’m cheap, so win-win right? Well, no.

I hit the ceiling and most likely won’t move further up unless I can emigrate (not my favorite path). I have the same age and work experience as my manager, but I’m stuck in this technical position because of my residence/citizenship. Feel like a perfectly trained monkey to push buttons. I have no say in budgeting, strategy, markets, etc. Just post them ads.

4-5 years ago I worked for a couple national startups (saas and fintech/investment banking) on a higher role, managing the entire marketing team, working on budgets directly with the CFO/CEO, presenting to shareholders… but companies projects were short lived, paid little (seed round) and didn’t weight in my resume. Now I work for a bigger US (fintech) and while there’s room to grow, no foreigner is offered senior positions. 

Any job search for which I qualify is the same: technical positions, nothing in leadership not even mid senior. Did I made a mistake taking the startup path?

I’m a 30-year-old guy who has always loved College Football (CFB), but I made some wrong choices when I was younger and ended up going in a different direction.

1g1di22,"I was offered a 25% increase in pay position, but I'm hesitant because my current company is the definition of flexibility but are not paying me enough","I work in finance and the company I work for now is my first. I joined them as an intern earning crumbs, then after university they gave me an entry-level salary. Fast forward a year later with my attention 100% going into my job, I basically transformed it and made it a complex project management/finance position with a touch of IT. I obviously asked them to gave me a raise given how significantly different my current role has become, and they gave me a measly 12% increase (6% merit, 6% actual increase), and they basically said take it or leave it. Given I had no further options at the time, I just bit the bullet, told them to take off many extra stuff I was doing and to let me focus on what's important, and my manager was more than happy to take my Power BI templates and projects/work and adopt it as part of his routine, asking for my help every once in a while.

It's a frustrating situation, they know it, I know it, but I'd lie to say that it doesn't come with its perks. Basically, 0 micro-management from my boss, I work with EU partners who are such a delight, and they don't give 2 shits if I work from home or show up at the office. They give a a decent cafeteria bonus, private health insurance, non-biding working hours, no tense tracking of work or anything, and I can confidently say it's a part-time job with a full-time pay.

But I just finished interviewing with another company this week who aren't as flexible, and they made me this offer, and I still haven't brought it up to my managers. The new position is basically a step-down from what I do, still finance-focused, but it is more on the administrative side. It could be more work for sure, but it's much easier in complexity. But I'm hesitant especially after reading reviews on the company that they have a strict 4-days at the office policy, no private health insurance, and a few other stuff. 

TL;DR: should I give up my comfy job and take a job that's potentially less convenient for a 25% increase?

I’d like to preface this by saying I have never in my whole working life (nearly 10 years) had a promotion or been offered a promotion.. I’ve been at my current company for over 6 years and at least in the last couple of years really been excelling in my role and also performing tasks that are at least 1 if not 2 job roles above my own. 
So when I had my performance review, I came to the table with a lot of evidence and facts as to why I believe I deserve a promotion/pay rise. However the main reaction I got from my manager was “I wasn’t on your salary when I was your age” or “it took me nearly 10 years to get a promotion at this company” and just generally a lot of resistance but nothing that seemed to be actually relevant…They seemed extremely annoyed at me for asking and I’ve felt really really rubbish about it since - felt like I should never have asked which surely isn’t right ☹️ Wondering what others thoughts are on this?

1g1bmdj,How much of a bullet did I dodge?,"I seriously need a job, but I pretty much sabotaged the only good lead I've had in a while by listing my concerns about the job. I went to an interview and had an overwhelming sense of dread surrounding the position.

First interview round with a couple people on-site:

-Company hiring a second person for a position to help one person's workload.

-Interviewer emphasis on, exact words, 'heavy workload' and difficulty in catching mistakes from a department

-Two people were out once and the interviewers were talking about how backlogged they got. The boss talked about taking on others work so they don't work too much. The boss LOOKED stressed out and tired just talking about it. 

-Talk of some overtime to meet deadlines was expected, which I had a feeling was a lot of overtime since they made it very clear they were short staffed. 

-They talked about mistakes being made by a department so they created a report system that would alert them when a singular person made a percentage of mistakes.

-The position would frequently help other departments and would take on more work in the future. And they said they were looking to hire a floater to help departments as needed. I've never heard of a floater job before.

-At no point did the interviewers say anything positive about working at the company other than saying 'we collaborate and help each other' to an ad nauseam amount. 

Second interview with someone on zoom who could't make the first one:

-Interviewer began by asking how I felt about a different job title but they had no details on that job. I said I was confused since they were going to have me do work on that content anyway. This interviewer shrugged and said they were just interviewing me about the position I applied to and heard the previous interviewers talking about it. I began listing my concerns I developed from the first interview and they started trying to talk over me and seemed very unhappy and jumped to asking if I 'wanted this job but not at this company'. At that point I just agreed with them and they shut off the call in a terse manner. 

I concluded the company takes on too much work for the amount of employees they have, which is stressing out employees and causing them to make mistakes. And the company's response is to develop a way to track mistakes to punish employees while begrudgingly hiring some people, but at not near enough pay. 

I feel like I dodged a bullet but I feel guilty for not just nodding and smiling and probably getting an offer.  ",Alterception,10,0.8199999928474426,9,1728658290,2024-10-11 14:51:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g1bmdj/how_much_of_a_bullet_did_i_dodge/,10,2024

I have 9 years experience in the property sector in sales but I have never been in a role which is similar to the one I am talking about. I also have bad ADHD and I am extremely unorganised, my 9 years of experience have resulted in me having about 8 different jobs and not performing well in the majority of them, I have the knowledge I just struggle to keep myself in check however I am working on it. 

The pay for this role is also amazing..the OTE is £200,000+. 

The lady is really keen to meet me, we had a good chat on the phone and she and asked if I have ever managed anyone which I sort of have but only for a couple of months but not to the degree I made out..

1 - Business development at fever (tech startup focising on events and experiences). The job would involve setting up new partnerships to add to their repertoire on their app/portal. This company seems at first glance like a better place to work in terms of benefits and stuff like WFH, etc. The job itself is something similar to what I've done before (sales) which I wasn't a super fan of.

2 - Strategy Analyst at Gobravo. This is a fintech company that basically works in debt relief of individuals. Job would involve more data driven work like analysing KPIs, establishing goals, etc. This company seems more challenging in terms of working extra hours (unpaid) and fully RTO. HOWEVER, although I'm not exactly sure about strategy analysis, I DO know it's not sales, which I know I'm not very passionate about.

Furthermore, I wonder whether one might be better than the other in terms of opportunities after. I don't think I'll work in either of them for a long time.

I’m 23, a recent graduate with a bachelor’s degree in Sports and Recreational Management and a master’s in Business Administration. My background is in sales, marketing, and recreational planning. Right now, I’m applying to my first real jobs while working as a bartender and living at home, making decent money and saving by not paying rent. I have 1-2 years of experience in sports sales and marketing and am looking to get back into the industry, but after applying to 20+ jobs over the past month, I’ve had no luck so far.

Recently, I got a job offer from a startup sports sales and marketing company. The role seems interesting and could provide valuable experience, but it’s a 1.5-hour commute each way, and the pay is only about 30k. That means I might need to look for housing closer to work. On top of that, I still need to cover costs like my car, student loans, etc. Should I take this job even though it doesn’t pay much, or keep searching? Worried about hopping on the first opportunity I get and regretting it.

Here are the other career paths I’m considering:

1.	Sports Sales for a Pro Team – I love sports, but the pay isn’t great, and I’m not 100% sure how good I am at sales yet.
2.	Sports Marketing – This is something I’m passionate about and have an educational background in, but the pay is even lower than sports sales.
3.	Athletic Director – I’m interested in this, but I currently lack experience in compliance and education, which would make it hard to break into. The pay in education also isn’t amazing.
4.	Sales in a Different Industry – I’ve been reached out to by sales managers from other industries where the pay seems much better. It could be an easier transition with just as much opportunity as sports sales, but I’m less passionate about it.

Ultimately, I’m trying to find a balance between doing something that I will enjoy, making money now, and setting myself up to make money in the future. Leaning towards sales in some way as I think it best suits my skill set and future desires, but I’d love to hear what you would do in my position or if anyone has been in a similar situation.

1g13u54,Seeking Career Advice as a New Mechanical Engineer,"
Hi everyone,

I'm a 23-year-old mechanical engineer who started my first job six months ago at a firm doing Revit work for HVAC and Plumbing. While I appreciate the opportunity, I find that I’m not really enjoying this role. Unfortunately, it was the only offer I received after graduating.

Currently, I'm studying for the FE exam and trying to determine the best path to advance my career. I'm considering a few options, including pursuing an MBA or potentially switching to a software-focused role within engineering. However, I'm feeling a bit lost and unsure of what direction to take.

I'm reaching out to see if anyone has insights on:

1. Skills that are in high demand in the engineering field.
2. The value of an MBA in mechanical engineering.
3. Switching to software engineering/using coding as a mechanical engineer.
4. Any other advice or experiences you'd like to share that might help me navigate this transition.

Thank you in advance for your help!

1g13ohq,"Transitioning from Product Marketing to Product Management. Stick with current team, or find a new one? ","TL;DR - stick with what's comfortable/stable, or take a chance on a new team with more ambiguity and potential upside?

At a large tech company for 4 years now, have been a consistent top performer in my current role (PMM). Expressed interest in transitioning to a PM focused role (and have successfully delivered on every relevant project that's popped up). Overall my manager/skip are supportive and have tried carving out more opportunities. We have mutual trust and I'm given a lot of autonomy.

My org encompasses four distinct business units each with federated marketing/sales/ops teams. I am apart of one such unit/team. Unfortunately while my team is great, our LOB has basically flat growth projected thru 2026, whereas other business lines are projected for much more growth.

There is no dedicated product function because we don't have dedicated dev resources (tech product/eng teams sit in a different org). Our new leader has decided to implement a central product/bizdev team to liason between our four business units and the product/eng teams. So we don't own a roadmap per se, but work to more efficiently articulate requirements, debate tradeoffs, and hold partner teams accountable for delivery.

I have been tapped for that role, but it comes with a lot of ambiguity, and ""special projects"" teams like this can be pretty hit or miss (in this economy?). I also know that the four different business leads do not like this approach as they currently maintain relationships independently, so defining scope of this new team is contentious/political.

My current boss/skip know that I have this opp, and offered to change my title and shift scope so that I can effectively be the PM for my business unit. 

My ego tells me to join the new central team. It does have a lot of potential upside (and risk), given that I'd be sitting across 4 vs 1 business unit. I am close to a promotion, and this team could give me the right portfolio of work to do so.

On the other hand, my current team has demonstrated that they want to invest in me, and flexing into a different role on the same team feels like a good chance to focus on learning one vs multiple new things (new role vs role + business). I also generally like the people more on my current team. My boss has communicated that this will give me the appropriate scope for promotion.

I don't know what to do, but I'm leaning toward sticking with my current team. Curious for other perspectives.

1g12z6h,Choosing uni for nutrition and dietetics ,"Hello, I am an international student and going to apply for Australia University on 2025. I would like to study nutrition and dietetics, aspiring to become dietitian. 

From my research, there is only some of the bachelor programs of nutrition and dietetics. In fact there is more choices of bachelor in nutrition and science, then continuing the further education with master of nutrition and dietetics for around 2 years. 

I am worrying the reputation of university, as well as the amount of fee. For example, whether I should go in University of Newcastle for 4 years nutrition and dietetics or university of Sydney for 3 years of bachelors of science then master. Apparently, the ranking of usyd is higher than another. But it definitely saves money too. How about other reputations of Wollongong, QUT, Flinders, Griffith? Those are also some of the university providing bachelor of nutrition and dietetics for international students. 

Do you guys have any recommendations to me, I will appreciate it! Thank you! ",chlll_,1,1.0,0,1728625911,2024-10-11 05:51:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g12z6h/choosing_uni_for_nutrition_and_dietetics/,10,2024
1g12jes,How should I continue this situation?,"Long story short, and without giving away many details.

A co worker that im forced to work with very closely(talking in a small space for 40 hours a week 1 on 1) recently snapped at me. When I say snapped I mean over something incredibly small and meaningless at the end of the day. Seems to have a somewhat temper problem. This person is recently new, and started off as a strong co worker. But after a couple months turned into someone that shows up 10-20 minutes late almost consistently. They also aren’t very susceptible to feedback or improvements. I’m talking I would set hey you messed up on this, you should approach it this way in a very calm manner. They would then reply with “it’s not that big of a deal” or “don’t tell me what to do” recently they snapped on me big time wich leaves me to believe they have a temperament problem.

Long story short, since then I’ve kept convos on a need to be basis with them. AKA only talk to them about work related things or basically flat out ignore them if it is not works related. You can see how this translates into an uncomfortable situation when you work with a person so closely. 

I’ve thought about bringing this up with my boss, but i genuinely don’t think it will improve the situation at all, if anything will just make it more tense. 

My question is, is this unprofessional on my end to keep up this behavior? Or is there a better approach I should take? I in don’t want to extend relationships with this person past a “hey good morning” or “are you finished with that project yet”. I also don’t want it to seem as if I’m bullying or anything. And for anyone asking, no I don’t think confronting this person with this will do any good. They are definitely the type to not see how they are the problem or accept any ownership.

1g0zx2l,Weird escalation of a medium sized problem,"So I work in healthcare as staff and yesterday I forgot to alert my colleagues and management about an issue I discovered with a narcotic. 
I’m not the one who handled the narcotic but I’m the one who discovered the issue and responsible to report so it can be investigated.

I was exhausted and went home.


Today I got a call from a random cell number -around noon and a text.  I was in the car coming from a doctors appointment and I don’t answer random numbers- I also got a text shortly after but unknown numbers go to a different folder in my iPhone and I didnt see it right away when I got home. 
Later I found out this call was from a semi-managerial level colleague/coworker I’ll call “Anna”.

Shortly after arriving home before looking sr my phone at all for the last hour, I see a call from the director of my dept. this person is 2 manager/supervisors above me, the big boss.  I answered and was asked to call Anna back. Something like “I’m sorry for calling on your day back, Anna left you a voicemail and text , if you could call back that would be very beneficial”. 

I immediately knew what it was about and called Anna. Very quick call, cleared up what I knew of the situation. 

Upon looking at my phone log Anna called **30 minutes exactly** before my big boss called. In the past I would have gotten an email an mayyybe a call to my work phone.  I don’t recall big boss getting involved at all in the past if I Ieft out information on a narcotic discrepancy.  I don’t know where calling me at home , texting me, and then not giving me an hour to respond before the director is involved came from. 

I was  really taken aback. I text Anna back after the call saying sorry I missed the text as I didn’t see it in the unknown number folder. I also asked if big boss was cc’d on an email about the matter because it was strange for her to  call.
 

Anna did not bother to respond to me.


I’ll be back at work tomorrow and plan to email Anna to get clarity on the protocol for finding and reporting the narcotic issue and how to avoid a rapid escalation like this in the future. I wanna be careful about wording it but I want a boundary to be made clear. 


Tl Dr 
a new low level lead/ manager called me on my day off about a semi-serious but common issue/mistake I made. And escalated the matter to the highest position in my department.

This is my first time posting here, and I’m feeling a bit lost. I’m looking to change careers, but while I know I need to move on from my current role, I’m unsure of what direction to take.

I’ve been teaching in public schools for the past 6 to 7 years. Before that, I worked as a freelance theatrical designer and technician, and I’ve also dabbled in sales management, HR, and the non-profit sector—though much of that work was unpaid, focusing on managing volunteers and hospitality for events.

Given my background, I’m struggling to transition out of education and the arts, which feel so niche with specific job boards and cultures. Whenever I explore more traditional job markets, I find it overwhelming. I know I have the skills to succeed in various roles, but I'm unsure how to present myself effectively to potential employers.

What advice do you have for someone who knows they need a change? How can I successfully navigate such a significant career shift? I’m eager to learn, work hard, and find a stable position with growth opportunities.

For reference I’m the only person in my family to go to college so i’m kind of struggling with no advice from my family and what better way to get advice than from a stranger. 
I’m 21,  currently a scrub tech student doing clinicals 2x per week. I’m in my second to last semester before I graduate, then i’ll be receiving my associates of science again (I had to take some pre reqs and accidentally got my associates before) now i’m just in the program waiting to take the exam to become a CST. I want to get my bachelors in healthcare administration because i’ve come to realize I might want to work on the business side of healthcare or possibly work for HR in the hospital. There’s a healthcare administration bachelor’s degree program that is starting sometime around November this year and i’m at a loss. Would it be wise of me to start taking the online classes to get my bachelors in healthcare administration (2 years/96 weeks)  or should I wait until I become a CST? 

P.S: would it be better to major in business administration or healthcare administration? 

*thank you to those who take the time to read this 🫶🏼*

1g0vaot,Need to make a change after 20 years....,"So I'll try and keep this brief:

I am nearing being 50 in a couple of years. For the past 20 years I have been working as a graphic designer in a design/printing firm in a small town. Sadly the business has slowly started to go downhill, and the business is now at a point where the owner does not know if he can continue with it. The main factor is the business is MAJORLY in debt, and it is causing major health problems for the owner. He constantly says that he wants to sell it, that he doesn't want to run the business anymore, how it's slowly killing him, etc. He actually has half jokingly asked ME if I do not want to buy the business, as I have been there the longest, but, due to the business being in so much debt, and so many machines being either old/out of order, this would obviously be a bad idea. Another option would be for me to open my OWN print shop in town, but that would mean taking out a loan from a bank and starting from scratch. Another option would be to move to another town, and work for another, similar business, as there isn't anything available here at the moment. Out of desperation I have started learning an online English teaching course a month ago, as many friends have told me it's a viable option for an extra/another career to make more money. I have yet to finish it, so have no idea if that will pan out to [anything.So](http://anything.So), now I have to decide what exactly I need to do, as my parents are actually STILL helping me out financially right now, and I know this can't go on forever and I need to go out on my own. Just, I do not know which path to take sadly....",MrCageCat,2,1.0,2,1728600074,2024-10-10 22:41:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g0vaot/need_to_make_a_change_after_20_years/,10,2024
1g0v2km,Mechanical engineer to Project Management.,"Hey,

So, I have a master's degree in mechanical engineering and worked for two years as a designer and quality engineer at a sheet metal company in Victoria, Australia. I had to quit because of some personal stuff.

Now that I'm back on the job hunt, I've been trying to land an engineering role for the past six months, but no luck. But I've noticed that there are a lot of project coordinator positions open.

I'm thinking about switching to project management. Do you think that's a good idea? Has anyone you know done it and been successful?

1g0uu1y,Graduating in December ,"Hi everyone!

I’m currently 22 and I will be graduating with a bachelors degree in finance by December of this year. I’ve always had the most interest in the finance field but I’m not exactly set on a specific job that I want. I do love the automotive field though so if I had a job in that it would be ideal but I’m willing to do anything really. I’m just wondering what are some jobs/positions that you guys would recommend straight out of college. I’m located in Michigan so if there are some companies you could even recommend too that would be great. I’m currently making 40k/yr so anything a bit higher than that would be nice.

1g0urvu,How much will not working with other experienced devs hold me back?,"I’m a developer at a retail company, writing code daily. Over the years, I feel like my skills have improved a lot, but the development quality at my company is lacking. Last week, I helped debug a colleague's Lambda function, and the code was pretty bad; no debugger, poor function organization, no unit tests, and tons of global state. This guy is supposedly 'THE guy' for development here, but it was clear he was struggling with basic best practices.

I often look at open-source projects and think, ‘This is how it should be done,’ but I don’t have the time to contribute to open-source myself. Most of my coworkers only grasp basic imperative programming and OOP, with no real understanding of debugging, unit testing, CICD, or more advanced topics. And management doesn't push for better practices since, technically, the code works.

I worry that without more skilled devs around me, my growth will stall. In my previous role at a small startup, devs were always learning from each other. I miss that collaborative learning environment.

1g0uqgu,Job culture vs Paycut,"I need advice. I make $120k working from home for a medical device company, but the culture is toxic. I’m the only woman in my department, and the engineers often speak down to me. When I travel to our San Francisco office, no one helps or shows up to my meetings.

I’ve been offered a similar job with a $47k pay cut. My husband thinks I should stay because my salary gives us a comfortable lifestyle. Last time I took a pay cut, I got depressed because most of my money went to bills and almost drained my savings trying to stay afloat. The new job does have career growth opportunities, but I’m unsure what the salary increase would be with a promotion. I’d be doing the same job with the same title.

1g0u5g2,Physician vs Lawyer,"Good morning, all!
I am reaching out with a question that I have struggled with for years. I joined the military after college because I could not decide between becoming a physician or a lawyer, and now my time in the military is ending and I would like to request your insight and your experiences as it could help me reach a decision about which path to take. I have worked with various mentors on this and I am interested in any financial, personality, or career perspectives and assistance you think might be helpful. 

Background 
My wife and I came from poor backgrounds and we are the first to finish school in our families so I cannot remove the economic considerations from my career choice. I have the opportunity to attend a middle of the pack medical school or a law school at the top of the rankings and I’m confident that either would lead to great career opportunities. I have the ability to leave both medical school or law school debt free due to my post 9/11 GI Bill that pays for tuition and living expenses. We have a year of living expenses saved up, I have a respectable amount in my federal TSP, minimal undergraduate debt left, and almost half of our mortgage is paid off. My wife works a few days a month now after our first baby. 

Goals
Personal: My wife and I have been together for over a decade and we have a baby with one more coming before I begin school. I will prioritize time with them and will select a career that gives me the ability to do so. This is in part due to spending so much time away during my military career and also because our parents weren’t around that much and as a result I am much less concerned with extravagant income as I am being a present husband and father. We will homeschool our children and I want to ensure my wife never has to work outside the home again unless she wants to. We intend to return to the general vicinity of our hometown in rural Southern Appalachia (more medical, less law opportunities) where we own a home but are willing to move for opportunities that fit our goals, ideally within our home state of Georgia or nearby areas. I’m not interested in living in a city long-term as we live on farmland and we love the rural life and farm living.
Professional goals: my penultimate goal is to be in elected office. I have a deep desire to solve the social, political, and diplomatic problems of our time after my own upbringing and my time abroad in service. I’ve decided that this is the path with the greatest input on where our country goes and I’m deeply unhappy with those presently running the show.

Interests
Law: I am interested in clerkships, government, or academic work. I would find great meaning as a law professor due to shadowing professors and my own teaching experience in the military. I have interest in constitutional law and political philosophy. I have no desire to be in big law or that type of work.
Medicine: I love solving problems and seeing the results. I began and ended undergrad as a pre-med and it was my primary academic interest in that time frame. I have shadowed many physicians and I would find personal meaning in most every specialty but am not particularly attached to any one.

Personality
Goal oriented, confident, driven, extroverted. 
Law school would be an enriching personal and professional environment for me, while medical school would be a slog. 

Concerns
—While I would find personal fulfillment in both, I feel I would make a good doctor but a great lawyer.
—Law would give me the opportunity to impact society in a big way. Medicine would give me the opportunity to impact individuals in a big way.
—Medicine would give me the ability to make a fantastic salary even while working part time or a standard week on/week off schedule. This would help me meet my personal goals to homeschool our children and be present for my family. Law of the types I have interest in would provide a respectable salary on a more typical work schedule. 
—I would graduate medical or law school in my early 30’s. Law gives me the ability to begin my career 3-6 years earlier than if I went through a medical residency and potential fellowship afterward. I’d begin my law career in my early 30’s and potentially begin practicing medicine around 40.


What should I take into consideration that I’m missing? 

What path would you recommend I take and what would you do in my situation? 

What helped you decide on a career path?

1g0txa6,Career Crossroads,"Hopefully I am posting in the right sub.  I am at a career crossroads.  

Background on me: Just got my Electrical Engineering degree, currently a network engineer, previously spent 5 years in a NOC and 3 as a Network engineer for a very large ISP.  Have a couple of technical certifications.

I have two job offers, both are 6 figures salaries:

1. Google Fiber NOC Engineer pays about 20K more a year.  Have to commute an hour and it is a job I can do easily because I have experience with all the equipment they use and with my 5 years working in a NOC.  Friend works there and says I well qualified for the job.

2. Cybersecurity Analyst for a local utility company. Pays less but it is 15 minutes from my house, 20 with traffic.  This would be me breaking into cybersecurity for the first time and I have always had an interest in cybersecurity.

I am torn between the two jobs, Google for the obvious reason: more money and it is Google.  I am leaning more towards the cybersecurity because breaking into the field is difficult, I would work with the substations network and SCADA which aligns well with my EE degree and I feel there would be more upward movement in this career if I were to leave the company in the future.  

Can I get some pros and cons especially from those that started in networking and moved to cybersecurity.  Any advice, tips would be appreciated.

1g0qhpg,"Partner might return to post secondary for a career switch, I’m unsure it’s the right choice","My partner is looking to make a career switch; he currently works in the food & beverage industry and is mainly motivated by his desire to earn more money (who isn’t?) with the goal to be at around the $100k+ salary range.

He has an undergraduate arts degree from 10 years ago. He is very objectively interested in AI, and has applied for a graduate program for a masters in AI management in Toronto. The program is an accelerated 1 year and would cost approximately $100k (tuition and housing as we live in BC). He has no prior related experience in tech or computer science. 

I don’t feel this is a wise choice as AI is still relatively new in most industries (this, he feels, is worth capitalizing on) and, based on his lack of related experience previously, I have a hard time seeing how he will land a job over others who may have more related work and educational experience in tech than him. I am really nervous about this and wish he would pick something more “stable” or “guaranteed” with its job prospects upon graduation, like a skilled trade. He is a smart guy and currently works with his hands, so I worry how happy he would be making the change to a desk job. I want to be supportive but my confidence in this particular program is pretty low….There don’t seem to be a ton of stats about employment rates and where grads are employed. I have seen that 76% of the students in the 2023 program were international students.

Would really love some outside perspective if this educational commitment would be worth the investment - and the likelihood of landing a job back in BC upon graduation?

1g0q0xj,"30 y/o male. I've worked in retail for about 15 years. I'm now in management but wanting to leave retail. What jobs can I realistically transition to? UK, details inside.","I've worked in retail ever since leaving school. I've worked in mostly supermarkets this entire time but have dabbled in other stores, but always retail. I've worked every role there is and generally pride myself as a hard worker. Having done everything and wanting to progress, I've recently transition into management the last year but it's just not for me.   
  
The pay is okay at around 30k, but work doesn't stay at work. I'm supposed to be working 36-40 hour weeks but realistically, with hours from home included, I'm probably closer to 60. I have no work life balance and am constantly thinking about work and the pressures that come with it. I manage the online department which is just another level of stress because of the risk and time pressures involved.   
  
I'm not enjoying it, I don't think it's for me and I'm wanting to see what options I have for leaving retail for something entirely new. Problem is, I don't have any relevant qualifications or degrees, I don't know any trades and outside of my hard-working attitude, willingness to be flexible and learn, I don't have much to offer. 

So what realistically are my natural career path choices at this point? I'm looking for a job where work stays at work, mostly. I'm okay with working a little extra, but I usually do this by choice when I feel the job can be done better or I have something to add. I like to take pride in my work and organization and tend to do more than is asked in this regard. 

I'm hoping to make a career jump that has some form of progression. A pay cut is expected from my position, but I'd like to have options with whatever I jump to, to progress and earn if I choose to. I'm concerned that since I've only ever done retail, that I'm kind of stuck with retail. I'm not sure what kind of careers are available to me, or where the best places are to look, outside of Indeed, for finding entry level positions or jobs that offering training.

Any help or guidance would be amazing. I'd like to start fresh and work my way up with something I feel I'd enjoy more than retail.

1g0mw05,Should I apologize to the people I hurt 10 years ago?,"When I was 24 I cheated on my first girlfriend who I met back in high school. That was a 10-year-long relationship from when we were both 14. During the final years of our relationship, I was not even a decent partner to her I basically begged to be a better partner so she would stay, and then I ended up going back to my old ways. Not only that, but I also had a falling out with friends from my college years. I won't go into detail but my personality was just the worst and I did bad things. They forgave me, and then I do bad things again.

In the end, I ended up with nobody I was a mess and full of guilt and other emotions I couldn't properly process for everything that I said and did to those people. But I had to turn my life around. I decided I wanted to do better and finally sought help. Took a long time and lots of therapy then I was diagnosed with BPD. Did a lot of things to improve my life made friends again got married and life has been great ever since.

But there have been moments where I suddenly think of them. A small piece of guilt is still there and it does eat me up inside. I wonder if it's even right to try and reach out and apologize. One reason is that I feel like it would be selfish to do so. They wanted nothing to do with me anymore after that and I understand wanting to live life in peace away from toxic people, another reason I don't want to maybe bring out trauma, and finally I never ever want to use my BPD (borderline personality disorder) as an excuse for shitty behavior but in this instance, it's the only way I can explain why I was such a dickhead in my mid 20s.

1g0mlei,"Employer completely ignoring me, what do I do","I'm here looking for some advice, and its a lengthy story but I'll try to include all the details in hopes someone can just give me some input on my situation. 

  
I interviewed with a remote company earlier this year and got the job. Upon getting the job, I was called and informed they were merging/being bought out by another company and before I even started was offered more money. Yay. So when I started, we were under new ownership right off the bat. The company offers a specific kind of service, and our job was to vet the leads that were coming to make sure we could work with them before a sales person would have their consultation. I mostly worked with texts, which was a relief being that I had worked in call centers in the past and hated it. 

  
So one day we all come in on a Monday, and suddenly, all of us are locked out of our work including our managers, even they were in the dark. Finally we get a call from higher ups who tell us they had a meeting over the weekend to axe our department, but will be transitioning everyone to a new department where we will now try to call all of our former clients and beg them to sign up for a program that will encourage them to refer people they know to our services. So I told my manager if we're calling all day anyways, I'll just go to sales, it's what I did in the past before this job anyways, and from the start I planned to go to sales eventually, but I wanted the steady pace and hourly paycheck for a while before going back into sales. My manager says they will help me to get there. 

  
Meanwhile during all of this, we have never been given an offer letter for our new jobs, which seems incredibly wrong, as they are now trying to enforce quotas for us, but we don't even have an offical offer letter? Anyways, 2 months of me asking my manger ""hows the transfer to sales going?"" All I ever get is, ""Let me ask around and get back to you"", nothing has happened. I even applied to the company on my own through their website. No one calls me, no one wants to interview me about it, I'm hearing nothing at all. So I put in an HR request, and ask that they update me on my application. Even HR is ignoring me now. And the worse part is in 2 months, we ran out of former clients to call, we are dried out, so its only a matter of time now before they probably lay us all off or something else. What can I even do? My manager isn't getting me anywhere, HR is ignoring me, the application went completely through with no acknowledgement, and I fear for my job and I can't imagine finding another job right now the way it is. 

Sorry for how long winded this is, but hoping someone can tell me what I can do, I feel like im in an illegitmate position without us even having an offer letter still, and if I don't make my way into the sales department, I fear I'll be let go due to the lack of need for our department and I'm in enough financial trouble as it is with some personal factors.

1g0lswo,Is A Massive Career/Education Change A Bad Idea For Me At 27?,"Hello all,

I am a 27 year old guy in Canada having a career crisis.

I have my bachelor’s and master’s degrees and I currently work in legal tech. My background is in Data Science & Finance, that will be relevant later.

I have it pretty good – I make $100k/year, I work fully remote, I have unlimited time off, I work maybe 2 hours/day – the list goes on. But, I don’t have a sense of fulfilment whatsoever. I don’t feel like I’ve done enough, and I worry that I have a ceiling for my earning potential.

Years ago, I expressed interest in pursuing law to my ex girlfriend. Specifically, I was interested in anything to do with data privacy/security and patents in the tech world. As the world becomes further driven by algorithms, I thought it would be incredibly interesting to pursue law in that area – whether it be the data feeding them or the innovative ideas driven by them. She told me it would take too much time and cost too much money, plus we would spend less time together – evidently, I opted to not pursue it.

Fast forward to now, I am beginning to get tired of my job. It is very monotonous and truly doesn’t bring me a sense of fulfilment. I have recently investigated law school again; however, I can’t help but feel as though it’s incredibly late to be starting. I would be beginning my first year of law school at 28 years old. Moreover, I likely couldn’t juggle my job with studying and classes. 

I have enough money saved to pay for the schooling and my current girlfriend has one semester left of law school – so the support is there. I just don’t know if the payoff is there. I have plenty of upward trajectory in my company accompanied by earning potential, but there is certainly a hard ceiling around $150,000. In law, I could very easily hit $250,000 within 5 years of practice – but that would be 8 years from now and I would be 35(!!) years old. 

I understand this could be perceived as word vomit but thank you for following along.

After doing research on executives who were caught lying - and we found three high profile cases where senior executives went years without getting caught, or only got caught because some coworker had it out for them (CEO of Yahoo). 

There are three high profile cases that I found - the former CEO of Yahoo, former CEO of Radioshack, and the former CEO of Bausch & Lomb. What happened to them after they were caught? They got a slap on the wrist (but sometimes fired); but either way went on with a very successful career. No one went to jail for fraud lol.

1g0l1bz,Help me please I'm lost,"So... I’m currently 12 months into a period of unemployment. I have an MA in Politics and History and worked in local government in London for two years after graduating. The job was part of a graduate training programme aimed at preparing us for senior positions in local government.

I didn’t enjoy the work—it felt inefficient and soulless. After a tough break-up and being evicted, I chose not to continue the job when my contract ended and moved back home from London. Given the circumstances and my dissatisfaction with the work, it felt like the right move at the time.

I started reflecting on other career options and landed on either data analysis or law, since career changes into law are quite common in the UK. Data analysis didn’t go anywhere for me, as I hadn't got a quantitative background. However, I managed to secure an internship at a highly competitive international law firm in April 2024, after applying to about five other firms.

After the internship, the firm invited me back in January 2025 for a final assessment before potentially offering me a position to train as a commercial solicitor. I feel much better with this career path—it’s efficient, intellectually stimulating, and well-paid.

Since the internship, I’ve spent my time traveling and occasionally applying for jobs as a fallback plan, in case I don’t secure the role in January. (I’ve sent roughly 200 applications in the last six months.) I’m anxious about failing in January and being left with no job. But I also recognize that this legal opportunity is incredibly valuable, and I’m wondering if I should spend the next few months boosting my chances by taking legal courses or applying to other law firms—if one firm sees potential in me, perhaps others will too.

On the other hand, I’m questioning if leaving local government was a mistake. Maybe there are better opportunities there given my degree and experience. Should I suck it up and return to local government instead of chasing law?

To complicate things, I’m living at my mum’s house in the middle of nowhere, and our relationship is strained at times.

**My dilemma is this:** I don’t know how I should spend the next few months before the January assessment. Should I go all-in on law? Should I focus on returning to local government? Or maybe a hybrid approach?

I’m feeling really lost and confused, constantly changing my mind, and I don’t want to end up failing on all fronts. I feel I messed my life up big and there's too much going on and too much to choose from.

1g0ktyi,Salary Negotiation Gone Wrong,"I’ve always believed in negotiating job offers (even if it was good) and it has worked well for me. In my latest job, I got a 10% increase just by negotiating. Employers rarely withdraw offers after a lengthy selection process; the worst they usually say is they can’t raise it more than a certain percentage (if ever).

Recently, I received a good offer from a potential employer after five interviews up to C-levels, but I’ve interviewed for similar roles offering 25-50% more (keeping in mine that all are considered from the higher end of the market). After I got my job offer, I told the recruiter that they were my top choice, but their offer was significantly lower than others. I didn’t need a match, just to close the gap a bit as I don't want to join only to renegotiate shortly after with an offer and potentially leave just for the sake of money. She said she could get me a higher salary but needed to check with the team for the 25% increase.

1g0kdu6,Getting let go in 6 months with bonus pay at the end,"Hi everyone, I don't have anything in writing at the moment, but this was discussed in person with multiple bosses.

  
Basically I need to move away and have to work remotely. I let them know this last month, and I was recently informed that if I come into office for the remaining year, I can work remotely from Jan to Mar 31 2025. However, my ""position will be terminated"" afterwards. If I do continue working until Mar 31, then they will have a bonus of $10K for me as some kind of thank you for being a long time employee (almost 4 years, 2nd employee hired outside of the bosses). 

  
Is there anything I need to be wary of? Position terminated, does this mean I can't sign up for unemployment? Maybe I should ask for a bigger bonus, but then what's to stop them from letting me go before March 31?",Tarento,3,1.0,2,1728571243,2024-10-10 14:40:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g0kdu6/getting_let_go_in_6_months_with_bonus_pay_at_the/,10,2024
1g0k7i3,Property Developer or Interior Design,"I am 26M working as a senior sales executive in a property developer. I make a decent salary + Comission. However, there is no job security with my current role. If I don’t close a customer in the next 2 months, I would be laid off. 

I am offered a sales and marketing role in an interior design company with the same salary package however the commission is a lot more since some projects cost millions. In this company, I would be the only person doing this role and it is more of a hunter role (look for leads) instead of the harvester role (receiving leads) I currently have in the property developer company. 

I have never been in a business development role before and I was thinking to try my hand at it. As I am still relatively young, I would like to develop my network base and connect with more professionals, and I am thinking the interior design role would help me to achieve this as they mainly do commercial projects. The client database I have with the property developer job is purely on individuals and not businesses. So it could be a better choice in the long run. 

Something on my mind is if this interior design role is a step down from my current role and that possibly the workload would be more demanding since it requires both marketing and sales. Extra context: in the developer job I only sell one product and it gets a bit monotonous and boring since I know the product already. For the interior design company, I would be able to work on different projects depending on the clients brand and budget.

For some context, i don’t (cannot) do interior design, I will only need to sell the interior design company to commercial businesses and they have an impressive list brands and corporations under their portfolio. It could be an easy sell. I have a bachelors in International business management and a masters in marketing. I have been in my current company for about 8 months. Previously, I was only in marketing roles. This job offered to me would be a mix of the two, also since it is a somewhat small company, they merge the two.  

Any advise/feedback on this would be greatly appreciated.

1g0jucs,Thought I was making a good choice until I read around.,"Hey there, 31M here.   


Basically im an idiot who took too long to figure out themselves and what they wanted to do and made all the wrong choices I feel to get there and now im not so sure what to do.

After graduating high school with like a 3.4 which i thought was alright, I noticed all my friends and such going into colleges and what not, but I was afraid to go to college myself when i learned just how expensive it was, worried about things like choosing the wrong career to pursue, never being able to pay off the debt, or failing college. So i started working dead end jobs thinking I was ever going to get anywhere, worked restaurants, retail, a call center place, a delivery/catering place trying to become a fleet manager, none of them worked out as i could never move up due to positions not being available, failed promises of more positions opening, someone retiring, etc etc.

I work at walmart now as a 3rd shift stocker, its simple mind numbing work that pays. . . well poorly to say the least, but i realized my whole life I always loved tinkering with computers and such in my free time so this year I started a certificate program with Google to get into I.T, which i was absolutely enjoying. Then i started reading on the I.T career reddits just to sort of get a grasp of what everyone is discussing, where the field is and such. Honestly regret doing that because im seeing people with degrees, labs, minor experience from previous jobs that let them do very basic IT stuff, and they still cannot land entry level jobs that pay around 40kish. Or i am finding out that companies overhired during covid and now things are incredibly over saturated, or that companies are letting go of a lot of IT people and are now outsourcing their stuff to 3rd party companies who pay even less. I finally figured out what I want to do and am kicking myself for not going to college and dont even know if the certificate im working on is going to get me anywhere. I just need advice as someone who feels really lost, i know there's not really a direct answer for this or anything, im not 100% fully in on IT, im open to other things like Data analysis, coding, networking, cloud engineering. I just thought the IT stuff would be a good entry but dont know what to do and i dont want to die on the walmart floor later in my life. Id just like to have a better paying job so i can start enjoying life more and go out and do things I wanna do, see places I wanna see, be able to live just a little more comfortably is all.",zandy2872,2,1.0,10,1728569789,2024-10-10 14:16:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g0jucs/thought_i_was_making_a_good_choice_until_i_read/,10,2024

1g0i681,Unrecognized role with colleagues and consequences,"Hi, first post on reddit, so sorry for any netiquette or reddiquette mistake.

Needed and long background
I work as project manager in a medium company. I'm the first project manager ever, so people struggle to understand my role.
My responsible (K) is the engineering manager, which is the responsible of the technical engineers whose projects are coordinated by me.
The company has grown pretty quickly and now they need structure, which is why I was hired. That and the 40+ projects that need attention.
I started asking and giving weekly updates to the technical department, quality, production, purchasing, planning, marketing, customers, suppliers... The technical manager is not aware of my colleagues activity and allows them to behave however they want.  Honestly, he was nearly fired during the Great Resignations because a lot of his people resigned, so he never says anything to his guys or others.
He usually asks me to behave as his second or a manager, asking me to fight his pairs instead of him, but never backs me up.

All his guys are extremely prickly and cannot deal with the idea of mistaking anything. Example: A does something wrong. B does something right. If I praise B in front of A as example, B goes mad because he would never do anything wrong. Correct, I have offended the praised one.

Also, one of his guys (J) started to show difficulties. This guy is pretty anxious and  few mobths ago exhibited difficulties in every kind of task, even repeating the task, explaining you the status of the activities or reading emails. He was in panic. At first, we helped. I supported him so much that I started micromanage him. Now it's clearly weaponized incompetence. This guy usually misbehaves when facing any tiny smack to his image, so in his mind saying he doesn't know how to do something makes him safe from error. It happened a lot of time, and he usually gives me unproper comments. 

So finally. Yesterday J noticed an issue on his project. I showed him that it was well reported and in the last meeting minute it was asked the supplier to avoid improvements, therefore he should have called the supplier to update him. He rejected since it was implied. So usual stuff. First, we looked into his email folder to show him that there was plenty of documentation of the problem where it was explicitly said to not take care of the problem. Then he said that I made a mistake in the minute and that I should avoid writing wrong stuff ""without running by him"". Well, as per my habit, I share the minutes during the meeting on the screen, so that they can be corrected in real time. Also, he was free to answer my emails with corrections. Then, the bomb. ""It's not my fault if you can't do your job"".
I got mad. I told him that at the next episode, we would have gone to HR.

He went to cry to the boss, the boss had us talking, said some useless bullshit like ""Amal be more patient"" (and no address  to his behaviour since ""he's not our mother"") and I felt again unrecognized. 

I would really  appreciate feedback and suggestions. I'm sure I'm doing something  wrong since the office would crash without me, but I'm not properly recognised. (Outside, my effort is well known)

1g0hri7,I'm being pigeonholed at my job and I don't know what to do anymore. How should I handle this? ,"I am a government worker who conducts annual inspections for the county I work in.  

There was a lot of job reassignments happening at work after my boss agreed that different people should focus on different work items. This resulted in me being assigned to one program. Willingly, I took on the task of three different employees' workload in this program and worked on getting all of their districts caught to November's workload because that's as far ahead as my boss wants us to work in.  

Long story short, I was able to get all three district to November and when asking my boss what to do, she said she doesn't know. I asked if I can help out in another program of some sort and she said no. The problem is that I have met the qualifications of being promoted to senior, but because we are governmentally funded there was no budget for promotion. They are changing the way they are promoting seniors now with the new wave of hires  basically saying we need to be a lead in a program. That's fine by me, but the problem is that the division that I got hired in on basically had all the senior inspectors be situated in all of the programs that we do and I'm just here doing the grunt work. I've already asked my boss what more I can do to get promoted and she hasn't really given a clear path on becoming a senior.  When I told her I needed more work to be done she gave the task of organizing paperwork for the other inspectors so they know which programs that they have to follow up on. Which is fine because it's work I guess but it's not leading me to anything new. 

I'm at a point now too where I feel like my boss doesn't really what me to take over any other programs.  It's upsetting because I'm seeing other inspectors that got hired around me being able to do so much more than I am who would be the clear favorite to get the promotion first resulting in diminishing next fiscal year's budget making me wait longer. How should I handle this situation?

1g0g2ad,Should I tell my boss why I'm quitting?,"I submitted my notice recently and only told my supervisor that I'm leaving due to the difficult work schedule, which is partially the truth. The whole truth however is that this is the most toxic place I've ever worked. I've only been here for five months and it has taken such a toll on my mental health. I was sexually harassed for months and, for the first time in my life, I complained to HR. To the company's credit, they apparently instilled holy fear into the rest of my team because from then on everyone was professional and no one mentioned anything about my complaint.

However - the two people that I share an office with are the most draining people I have ever been made to work with. There are irresolvable differences between them and myself and I cannot continue. I've even debated abandoning this job without working my remaining two weeks because I feel so hopeless when I wake up in the morning knowing that I have to spend eight hours with them. They are ignorant and petty and extremely vengeful. They constantly speak inappropriately about our supervisors and our facility. I've held my tongue simply because I don't want to be involved, but I know they'd be fired if my manager heard the things they've said about her (in the office, mind you, not in private off-site). 

Perhaps the worst thing is that they constantly attempt to take advantage of me and have me do their jobs. Earlier this week was one of the worst days I've had with them. I was slammed with work and the two of them had the audacity to ask me to do their core job functions while they sat at their desks doing coloring pages. Being a pushover, I did, but it only strengthened my contempt for them. I have absolutely no idea how my predecessor functioned in this office for as long as he did, but there is no way any reasonable person can work with these two long-term.

1g0faj2,how to deal with vile and aggressive coworker in a small group,"i work in an extremely small school program. excluding my director and myself theres onlt three other day to day staff. so five of us in total, and one seasonal highschooler who comes and helps.

tldr; this 50yo woman i work with is insane and openly disrespects me in front of kids, staff, and our boss.she also openly attacks our boss in front of children, calls me derogatory names and outright harasses me. my boss has not done nything about it so far and i doubt she ever will because hr wont let her and also my boss is doing shady money laundering and doesnt want to involve any higher ups.

to set the stage; 
ive worked there for 3 years with/under this one woman. we both watch the younger children, but it's been more of ME doing all of the work. i watch the kids, im often forced to run activities, i do ALL the cleaning, transport, and time management, i do almost all between-staff communication and im the one who works with higher ups during meetings.

despite all of this im paid the least out of everyone by a good $10.  i also have 6hrs less pto than them. my director noticed i was doing a lot of work this summer when the woman i usually work with was absent.

 usually this woman is always trash talking me to my boss with straight up lies about how im a slacker, so my boss saw first hand that i actually do almost all the work for this program. she offered me the same title as the woman i work with and gave me my own group to run. she also gave me a stellar yearly review and two of the slackers (including the woman i work with) got dragged through the mud. 

since this review this woman (who i will refer to as P from now on) is even more genuinely crazy than she was before (shes a certified stalker btw just to give you a full picture) because shes jealous and hates literally any criticism


Lately P goes against any and everything i say and every rule i set up. if i say its time to come inside? 'no no, ten more minutes'. if i say it's the end of the day 'no no, ten more minutes', if i say 'clean this table 'she turns around and threatens to send the kids to the office with a write up if they  clean the table i told them. i tell the kids to stay out of the water and stop throwing rocks, a SCHOOL RULE, and she waits until my back is turned to let them outside and brings them right to the water. even did this after TWO OTHER PEOLE, INCLUDING OUR B O S S told her to stop.

every single person that works with us in the school has complained about her multiple times.

one of the other activitiy leaders does an end of day activity and because P intentionally keeps the kids up to half an hour later than she should (only releasing them right before the buses arrive) shes complained to our boss multiple times just this past week. yesterday our boss had to go in and literally start cleaning for her and forcing her to stop. AND SHE STILL DIDNT. 

shes blown up at my boss IN FRONT OF KIDS and even involced said kids in her petty arguments. one of her review criticisms was she gives the kids copius amounts of sugar. she does.
 she gives them handfuls of candy every day as bribes to play her boring ass games. she once brought in an entire cake 'just because' and then did nothing to clean up after. she regularly brings in peeps to make 'edible playdough'aka melted marshmallows with even more powdered sugar mixed in.

 so one day the teachers give kids a single lollipop and she blew up. ""THE TEACHER GAVE YOU CANDY TODAY RIGHT?' she asked every kid that in a fit of mania then continued to yell at our boss 'SO THE TEACHERS GET TO BUT I GET DOCKED POINTS ON MY REVIEW?!?!?! BLAH BLAH BLAH"" me and another coworker walked out with our director t the end of the day and told her 'hey, p's behavior back there was completely unprofessional and inappropriate"" and she just sighed and didnt know what to do.

Ive kept my mouth shut on a lot of things but lately its coming to a head

last year P openly called me a bitch because i was joking with the highschool seasonal employee saying 'i have senoritiy over you that means you have to go clean it up'. me and said employee just looked at her like 'what the actual fuck' and just left the room straight up

shes openly made derogatory jokes about me in front of the director, at one point saying 'if anyones clueless its you"" after, again, i made a joke to someone else. once again, i just looked at her like 'what the fuck' 

there was one instance where i had been cleaning for over half an hour, literally half an hour earlier than i needed to. the moment i sat down she started snarling ar me about how lazy i am and im a slacker and i dont do anything. luckily one of my coworkers was there and defended me but P was still glaring at me the whole day. 

my boss herself is at the receiving end of all of this and has never written up this woman

im seriously tempted to go to our new hr department but she would know i was the one who reported her, and we have such a small group already. 

i just dont know what to do. 'talk it out, set boundaries.' is not going to help either becauss this woman has no respect, no compassion for other people, and no sense of responsibility or accountability. she openly yells at her boss and does all of this shit in front of our boss, who is scared of her and cant fire her because hr has her beliving if someone has any disability they cant be fired for any reason. 


genuinely what do i do at this point besides going to my boss to report every single thing she does (i only went to my boss YESTERDAY for the very first time about this)

1g0eptg,In wich field i should invest my time in?,"Hi,

I'm struggling to make a concrete decision about which creative field to invest my time in. When I was younger, I used to play guitar and wanted to pursue a career in music (or something related to it). However, life changed my plans, and I ended up studying graphic design, which I also enjoyed. During my studies and shortly after, I worked as a graphic designer in a small advertising agency/print shop. After two years in that job, I feel like I burned out professionally (I know how that sounds), and now I can’t stand the sight of posters, flyers, business cards, etc. Currently, I’m working in e-commerce with some graphic design work on the side, and I see it as my temporary “career retirement.” During my studies and work, I also spent my free time training in this field, but I can’t bring myself to keep pursuing it. After everything, I realized there’s no point in doing something solely for career purposes.

At this point, I’d like to either learn to draw (I’m still secretly hoping that if I return to graphic design or another creative field, it could be very useful) or go back to learning an instrument and creating music mainly for myself, as I realize there’s a very slim chance of breaking through or making money from it. I’d like to hear others’ perspectives on my dilemma.",Gruesson,1,1.0,2,1728551826,2024-10-10 09:17:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g0eptg/in_wich_field_i_should_invest_my_time_in/,10,2024
1g0eio9,[Florida] [Texas] question,"Previous employer won’t pay PTO (69.55 hours)….

Hey everyone, I’m in a bit of a situation and could really use some advice. I worked for a Transportation in Jacksonville, FL. 80% of the company was sold to ECHO Transportation (aka Echo AFC, TBL Corp, Echo Charters & Tours AFC out of Houston, TX). Since the new company took over in January there's been nothing but issues. I was wrongfully terminated & now they won’t pay me for the 69.55 hours of pto I accrued prior to January. And to make matters worse, and following advice, I began researching the company. They have a history of legal troubles (claims) including labor violations, wrongfully terminated employees, not paying creditors, discriminatory practices, etc.

I also went through what I believe was unfair and discriminatory treatment from the operations manager, Luis. I’ve got proof—witness statements, text messages, emails, the whole bit. So I’m thinking about filing a claim for that as well. He created a toxic, hostile work environment and is running the Jacksonville location into the ground. Similar to two of his previous companies.

Has anyone dealt with something like this before? Is it smart to file a claim for the unpaid wages and the discrimination when the company already has pending lawsuits? I just want to make sure I’m going about this the right way.

Would love any advice or insights—thanks in advance!

Update: I met with an attorney. I would still love to hear any and all advice. Thank you!

While I’ve become comfortable in the job, I feel stuck and hesitant to leave my comfort zone. I recently pushed myself to attend an apprenticeship interview and was accepted, but now I’m unsure about what the future holds. Part of me considers progressing at Woolworths, possibly into a management role. However, I’ve seen team members who’ve been here for 30+ years without much progression, despite knowing the ins, and outs of the department. I don't want to ask them why they haven’t progressed, as it might come off as rude or get into their personal business. I'm good at my job, and can learn quickly, often working across multiple departments, but I fear that if I stay, I might end up in the same position years down the line and regret not taking bigger risks during these prime years.

1g0d51d,Career Switch from Marketing to Computer Science - should I do an MSc CS Conversion course?,"Hi everyone,

I'm considering applying to MSc Computer Science (Conversion) courses in Europe. With my arts/marketing background, I need advice on how to get into a good-ranked university and build my career. I'm doing courses and looking for an internship to improve my profile for CS.

Background:

I am a Marketing professional now thinking about switching my career to get into core computer science. I did my undergrad in Journalism and Mass Comm with an 83% score and then did my MBA in Marketing & Finance from a Tier-1 B-school in India with a 2:1 score by UK standards. Post MBA, I have 27 months of work-ex doing Global Marketing for a US-based tech company.

I was always interested in Computer Science but couldn't develop it because of a lack of options in my environment and I ended up getting into Marketing. But I've been unhappy at my job for a long while and I feel that I finally want to pursue my passion and get into CS. To reassure my interest, I have done a couple of coding courses (python, C++, and AI) online and I've truly enjoyed them.

Need suggestions and advice on how to get in. If you or someone you know has successfully switched to cs from an arts background, I'd love to connect and have a chat.

I have been in software field for more than 8 years now. I have worked with many companies before. No matter which company I choose, I feel everyone around me is frustrated with their jobs. It's the same thing everywhere working on frustrating legacy softwares or working on adjustments and nothing exciting. Sometimes it's just the fear of getting laid off, fear of not getting promoted. Don't even feel like anyone is working enjoying anything. 
I feel like people are doing jobs especially software development in MNC just for the sake of money putting a fake face on the outside and nothing else feels interesting here.
Sometimes I wonder why did I even study engineering. I genuinely loved engineering and used to be amazing by how we humans have created all these things but somehow I feel all the software development jobs became so mundane these days. I used to be exciting about things during my initial years. Where did it go?
There is no real satisfaction anymore. Sometimes feeling lost.
Am I the only one who is feeling this? Or am I missing something. Am I thinking the right way?

Tldr: looking how to use this experience to my advantage

I was interviewed in May for an administrative assistant title. In the job description it did say it was a ""wearer of all hats."" It asked to manipulate flyers, use wordpress, is tech savvy, post on social media, interact with sponsors and volunteers. 

I was interviewed and hired. This was for a music organization that was founded by an 80s musician in my city. I was excited to join as I loved their mission. However in the last month real issues began to arise. 

I started getting asked to do IT tasks that were completely left field. Such as coding to fix an email issue and uploading a new SSL certificate to our site. I started getting nitpicked on how I got things done. She didn't like that my copy for socials wasn't ""simple and concise."" She said that me asking another outside colleage (stakeholder) for her feedback on the design I did was defiant as she is ""not your boss. I am your boss."" 

I said this in my other posts but she didn't like that I was ""focused"" on these lists I made for all the projects I did and claim that I couldn't handle a ""fast-paced environment.""

Well I was fired for making her feel ""frustrated"" because she has ""been here for 20 years, I know how things work."" And I was quickly replaced by the former employee before me.

This former employee left a couple months ago (due to personal reasons) and came back asking to be still involved. She would frequently visit and talk to my boss. With everything going on I started having my suspicions that I was set up to fail. 

So I was let go. Anyhow I was incredibly angry when I made the discovery of the REAL reason I was fired.

However, it has always been a dream to be a part of either FBI or secret services. Deep down i thought switching to Psychology will help me pave my way into Fbi or something. 

I’m too loud, curious and rebellious for a girl. Never afraid to start a fight when necessary. I can never get enough of cars, guns and horses. Always wanted a career in action because with time, i get bored of repetitive tasks. This was just an insight to what kind of a person i am and why I look forward to being a part of the forces.

1g0a5mx,stay at new job or return to old team?,"TLDR: current job pays less and has more expenses but more independence. another job opportunity at an old workplace has higher pay and closer to home but most likely unfulfilling. want to negotiate current job wage to match old workplace wage.


I started this temporary new job that lasts 6 months, and am currently on my 4th month employment. after the 6 months are up, it's very likely that I'll get promoted to a higher position with better pay ($20 -> $23). coworkers are awesome and I've been learning a lot of practical skills but the work itself is physically straining and I have to wake up super early in the morning. I also have to pay rent ($1000/mo) to live in the area along with other expenses but I'm pretty frugal

part of me is anxious about staying at this job though due to my parents urging me to earn more money. I have a possible job opportunity at my old workplace that's mostly lab work, pays about $27/hr and I could live with my parents. my team there was fun to be around. the only issue is that I don't feel like I would be as fulfilled with the work as it's tedious and I'm afraid I'd get bored and won't be able to build new skills since I'll just be in a lab all day mixing chemicals. the living environment at home is also slightly stressful but it would save me a lot of money. I also hate being in the city that my old workplace is located at.

I'm having trouble deciding the best option. I could try to negotiate a higher wage once I get promoted to match the wage of my old workplace. 

I'm mostly anxious that my mental health will tank if I go back to my old workplace and live at home. despite the fact that I'm exhausted by my current job, I'm happy here. but I'm aware that choosing my old workplace would be the ""smarter"" option",sourspaghetty,1,1.0,0,1728531930,2024-10-10 03:45:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g0a5mx/stay_at_new_job_or_return_to_old_team/,10,2024

1g08pth,A media project to help myself and friends be recognised.,"Dear r/careeradvice if theres a more relevant subreddit for my query I'd appreciate any suggestions.  
For reference I'm 28, I have a logistics, sales, construction and manufacturing background with a bit of management. I also Did about 1 year as a volunteer radio presenter and loved it.

Friends I grew up and myself, I've noticed have underlying media skills, and I want to make a project so we can be recognised and not get caught up in odd jobs to get by.

This is very early planning basically brainstorming, I'm still to meet with the team for our first instance regarding this project.

I have gone through many ideas, and I think I've found us a good project. There is an influential figure in our city who is known locally by many but has had little media coverage, despite being a local hero.

I figured if we can interview him, this would be a significant and very worth while first project for our team.

I want some advice and please let me know if you notice problems I'm not foreseeing, I pray for a mentor, to guide me as I come from a construction logistics and management background, but was always a ""creative"" person at heart. Similar story for my mentioned friends. I know how to manage a project, but media is new waters for me. 

Out of the three of us, we're all witty and enjoy a bit of everything from history, art, music, architecture.  
All of us have bits of media experience, I've done radio, another has produced a film before so forth.  
So I feel like it would be a team of 3 smart people who could individually take on their own projects, but we all have a similar sense of humour which I think is the real gold to be found if we collaborate.

I have some points I'd like advice on:

- Is interviewing this local figure a big step for a first project. Would we be better dipping into smaller things first like little podcasts etc?

- I feel like I have writers block when I try to think of any entertainment ideas opposed to media. I just imagine generic videos where we talk about our interests? but who would watch that?

- I'm planning to study film production, and im hoping this can help on my application to film school as well as being a rewarding experience for our team, possibly worth running with on its own. 

- Another idea is we could interview local artists, musicians etc. But I have no idea how I would ""theme us"" around that. How would that be branded?

Appreciate anyone who has some supportive advice, and constructive criticism alike.  
I'd also love to hear any stories other people have please feel welcome to share.

Also I'm in Sydney, Australia. If you're aware of resources to help someone like me, or a good company to introduce myself to, please let me know any ideas.",uberlux,1,1.0,0,1728527025,2024-10-10 02:23:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g08pth/a_media_project_to_help_myself_and_friends_be/,10,2024
1g081qh,Will Compensation Scale with Location?,"I've currently been looking for some new opportunities, especially in a more lively area like a fairly major city.  However, something that has been bothering me is regarding the salary ranges.  I know that employers have always banked on the fact that people are willing to live on less for the opportunity to live in the big city, but there's a difference between taking a bit of a cut in real terms versus getting paid effectively half.

For example, I found a job in Newton, MA that pays anywhere from $100-150k.  That same exact job, at the exact same company is also listed in Troy, NY, paying $100-140k.  The difference?  A median apartment in Troy is only $1400, versus $3300 in Newton.  Home prices are even more extreme.  The typical home in Troy is about $250-300k.  In Newton, a typical home is a staggering $1.5-2 million.  These are both senior professional engineering jobs involving mission critical environments.

I feel like it wasn't always this way; typically if you went to a big city, you effectively ""made it"" and were going to be rewarded commensurately.  Now, it effectively feels like a major financial punishment for most careers.  When you factor in the huge increases in the stock market and home prices over the past few years, the difference gets even more massive once compounding is factored in.

I think what has happened is that certain professions became so successful that they have essentially crowded out the less prestigious employers and professions.  I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I'm sure there is a much larger gap between the average doctor, lawyer, or tech professional in these two areas.  Not to mention that the elite medical and law schools in Boston are producing a far higher proportion of doctors and lawyers making much more than average.

1g064or,Irrational/childish CEO.,"I’m trying to figure out if I’m overreacting here.

I joined this company four years ago as a product development engineer, tasked with taking over the day-to-day design and development work from the CEO. Since then, I’ve been promoted to Engineering Manager, and now the CEO only comes in a couple of times a month.

The issue is, when he does show up, he seems to have no respect for anyone. He often accuses the team of doing nothing, treats people like they’re incompetent, and sometimes even throws tantrums like a spoiled child.

Eventually, after we prove that we’re on top of things, he becomes overly apologetic and full of compliments. But it feels hollow, because the same cycle repeats itself a few weeks or months later.

Is this unreasonable behavior, or is it just something I need to learn to live with?",spencerthejones,3,1.0,4,1728518954,2024-10-10 00:09:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g064or/irrationalchildish_ceo/,10,2024

1g05831,Scheduling Fears,"I just finished my first week at a job with an abnormal schedule. It is a 24/7 365 operation in which I work:  
  
Sunday 6AM-6PM (remote)  
Monday 6-6  
Tuesday 6-6  
Every other Wednesday 6-6

I only worked Tuesday and Wednesday this week and am pretty tired. So my first question is: would you take this schedule? Will I get used to it? Am I being a baby by being uneasy about it?

I also learned today that every 6 months there is a bidding for scheduling, so there is a small chance that I get moved to overnight shift. We currently have 2 people who really like the overnight shifts, however a good handful of the people I have met spent time on the overnight shift, so I am scared something will change and that I will be doing it for up to several months.  
  
I was not told this in the interview process, and I did not consider it, and I am honestly not willing to do that at all. Would it be appropriate to tell my boss that at any point? Or if it does happen do I just need to suck it up? An overnight schedule would tank my mental health but so would unemployment. I am scared and have not been eating much these last two days with this schedule change. Any advice would be helpful.

1g04lwl,Feel stuck after quick promotion,"I [27M] started at my tech company as a sales ops analyst at age 22. A little over a year and a half into that job, my manager resigned, and I was promoted to her role as a result. This gave me the manager/lead title and compensation after only having essentially 2 years of work experience. The problem is, nothing has changed since then. For the past 3 years I’ve had no title change and no compensation increases outside of inflation bumps. I am the lead/highest level of my team and therefore leadership has no reason to promote me to director level or give me a raise.

Because of this, I’ve been trying to find a new job, but director level roles ask for 8+ years of experience and I’m not really close to that. If I wanted to move laterally into my same role at a different company, the compensation is the same or worse, so it doesn’t feel like it’s worth losing my current setup.

1g03yr4,Help - More money or better QoL?,"I am at a bit of a crossroads in my career. Some history:

I left a company I had been with 13 years to try something fresh with a new organization just up the road (same industry). The new job paid the same salary but with a significant reduction in work load/responsibilities. This worked for me as we have two young children at home and spending more time at home was a priority for this year.

I have been contacted by my old company essentially begging me to return. In the brief meeting I had with the old management team last week they left it at “what is it going to take to bring you back?”

I have enjoyed my position with the new company but I am positive I could secure a 50% salary increase as well as a title promotion by returning back to the old company. The caveat with me returning to the old company is that the ownership and management group is sketchy at best. They continually made labour cuts that directly affected my work and ability to carry out my duties. The new company’s ownership and management is rock solid and I have 100% faith in their abilities and trust they would have my best interests in mind. 

Basically for anyone that has been in a similar position: Did you end up regretting taking the payday and accepting a tougher environment versus the comfier position? 

I am mid thirties with two kids so the extra $$$ would be helpful but not life changing.

1g03gmt,Want to move up but management is useless ,"I went to the Navy straight out of high school. Once I got out I bounced around from job to job mainly doing customer service work whether it be retail or call center work. In July of 2022 my best friend of 20 years calls me and asks me if I would like to come and be a maintenance man at a college apartment complex. Having never done such work I was apprehensive, but the job was closer to home and more money so I took the job. By the time Christmas came around our 4 man crew became 2 (my buddy and I), which also meant we were without a supervisor. I encouraged my friend to apply for the job nc he was having money issues at the time and the worst they could say was no. He lacks self confidence on an astounding level so he wasn't even going to apply. Ultimately he got the job and over the next year we finally built back to a 4 man crew. Since that time he has become the laziest mf I've ever seen. He barely leaves the shop, me or the other guys on the crew have to constantly remind him of tasks that need to be done or followed up on. It's to the point where aside from making phone calls to vendors(which is rare) I do about 95% of his job. The other guys in the shop and myself have tried talking to him about this in multiple ways from jokingly, to passive aggressive, to being very blunt. We recently got a new property manager and thought that perhaps we could talk to her about the issues without completely throwing him under the bus. She said she would talk to him, but we have seen no improvement. The PM has her own issues, she has alienated the entire office staff due to her incompetence regarding the basics of her job. So now I have my 2 immediate supervisors that are basically worthless. I applied for a job at a different apartment complex and my friend threw the biggest hissy fit. Everyone in the office and the maintenance crew tell me that his job should be mine, and had I been at the company long enough I would have applied but I was basically a month shy. The supervisor above my 2 immediate sups doesn't seem to care about any of us. She was at the property recently and the maintenance crew requested a 1 on 1 with her to voice our concerns, but she couldn't be bothered to spare a few minutes. I want to take courses at a local community College or trade school so that I can expand my skill base, but I have questions about it and have no clue who to talk to. I have sent an email to HR so that maybe they can point me in the right direction. I really enjoy the work I do, and the company isn't terrible but it feels like I'm going to be treading water until my friend messes up enough to get fired or the PM pisses him off and he quits. My single income gets my family and I by but we do have help from family. I don't want to live the rest of my life that way. What should I do.

TLDR: I work with my best friend of 20 yrs who has become increasingly useless. Management is no help. I want to further my career but I don't know where to start.",inkdngauged,0,0.5,0,1728511365,2024-10-09 22:02:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g03gmt/want_to_move_up_but_management_is_useless/,10,2024
1g02mrc,"Looking back, how would you have made the most out of the first few years of your career?","I thought this could be an interesting topic for discussion. Some of the more obvious pieces of advice might be to ask a lot of questions, stay curious, and be open to learning. I recently had a conversation with a senior developer who's also a good friend, and I mentioned something along the lines of, 'In 5 years, I don’t want to look back and feel like I’ve coasted along, just being average.' He shared that he had similar feelings when he was starting out in his career.

For context, I’m a junior full-stack developer with about one year of experience at a large global company. That said, I think this topic could apply to anyone in the early stages of their career, no matter the role or industry. So, if you were asked for advice on how to maximize the first few years in the workforce, what would you say? What are some strategies or lessons you wish you had known earlier, or habits that helped you accelerate your progress and avoid getting stuck in that 'coasting' phase?

1g011hk,"Advice for a HighSchooler - Mech, Elec, or something else?","Hello all! I'm a HS senior hoping to go abroad for university. As you can tell from the title, I cannot choose what branch of engineering to pursue. I've done my due diligence in research from exploring career paths through internships, to reddit, ChatGPT, advice from parents and professors and much more. Still, I'm unable to make a firm decision because most advice I've gotten though helpful, is not fit for my specific situation. My purpose of writing this is to get a community opinion and advice on the best course of action for my situation. 

I love maths and physics and the problem solving aspect and especially the getting the right aspect is really appealing to me. I idolise people like Tesla and Einstein and dream of (i know this is cheezy) creating meaningful change in a way that is not forgotten and is of help to people. Due to cultural boundaries, I cannot pursue Physics for bachelor's. 

The next best thing is engineering and for me it boils down to mainly two fields: Mechanical and Electrical. I've ignored more specific degrees like mechatronics and engineering physics since a lot of people have advised me to do something general and stay away from 'filler or distraction degrees'. For this route, my goal is innovation and creation. I am impressed by, and idolise people like StuffMadeHere, Mark Rober, (writing robot, auto score hoop, robowars) and other similar engineering youtubers which bring their ideas to life. I want to do something similar, something creative, and something inspiring. I know that life isn't all unicorns and rainbows and understand that in a lot of jobs I won't be able to do stuff but it's more about which field gives me a greater ability. I do want to make great money and can see myself starting a venture/startup of my own.

Some more background: I get bored very easily of one thing; I'm the kinda guy who wants to become a scientist one month, and a boxer the other; I wanna do something where I be happy to go to work everyday (i get bad days/weeks are inevitable but u get the point)

Main Pros of each I've found: 
(EE) Electrical allows me to possibly go to grad school for physics which I might do if I like research in college . I've heard it's easier to learn parts of ME than Electrical. Electrical has better money. Using electronics to build small robots or ideas sounds so fun and I seriously think that material science and chemistry in mech sounds soo boring.

(ME) When studying physics, though I do adequately well on both areas, I find mechanics easier and funner while electrical goes over my head the first time sometimes. Esp gauss' law I was Clueless.Though, that may be because of relative exposure. A lot of the things MarkRober/StuffMadeHere do requires good mech knowledge. I also love CAD and 3D printing sounds so cool.

Sorry, I know this is a long read I appreciate if you read it fully. I'm still just in highschool and this decision is pretty big. I know I can always switch but a general direction is comforting. Any advice, words of motivation, or comments would be appreciated.

1g00f2o,How to move internally without burning a bridge?,"For context, I started my job in December 2023. The manager who hired me was demoted in February and there was a temporary manager for our location until a permanent manager was hired. During this time, I worked really well alongside the temp manager and she told me that if a position ever opened up at her location (she was managing ours and hers at the time), I should apply because I am good at what I do.

Fast forward to now, temp manager/new boss and I have been discussing this change seriously and I just applied today to the position that opened up at her location. However, my current boss (the permanent manager that was hired in March), tends to be emotional. She is nice but she is hard to work with and is not a leader. I have to beg her to call back customers or get her to do managerial work that I don’t have authorization to do. I’m constantly apologizing to customers for work she says she will do and doesn’t. She will hide in her office to avoid people/work. It makes me and the company look really bad, but she seems like she doesn’t think this is an issue.

Often, my coworkers and I cannot speak to her candidly about things. Another coworker of mine stood up to her about how my boss takes vacation during all the holidays and how this means we cannot do so if the vacation is already taken. She gave up half of them to us when my coworker told her boss, but she put them all back later thinking we wouldn’t notice. She also gets nit-picky about time cards to people who stand up to her, changing them to less time.

I could go on about my current boss but this is the issue: I have applied for this job but HR says I need to discuss this with her before they can move forward with my application. My new boss says that if even my current boss doesn’t approve, they can transfer me anyway. Also, I wouldn’t start until early December.

Current boss has a tendency to retaliate. I don’t challenge her because I like to be on her good side but she has no idea she is about to lose me. She likes me because I do her work for her and I make her look good at her job. I’m nervous as fuck for this discussion I have to have with her because she knows she’s about to lose a really good employee and her location has people constantly leaving.

My new boss says just say the new job is closer to home and this would be good for my work-life balance. But old boss I know will try to pry for info and won’t let me go easy.

**How can I highlight my accounting experience when applying for these roles?** I want to make sure my resume showcases my strengths and the transferable skills I’ve gained.

**Any tips for networking in the forensic accounting community?** I’d love to connect with professionals who are already in the field, do you recommend any particular platforms or events?

1fzzzt6,Am I Slow? How Do I manage At Work?,"I started a job last week Monday. Spent Monday and Tuesday days doing standard company employee welcome training , and Wednesday being trained on the actual job itself. On Thursday I was given 10 tasks and asked to complete them all. I set about it but progress was slow as I would regularly need to ask questions, ask for help and ask questions on what to do (which I believe is normal on what was basically my first day accomplishing any tasks). 

That afternoon, my manager asked to see me in the meeting room and berated me for being too slow, asking why it was taking me so long to progress the tasks. She said that other people would have completed the tasks she asked for in 1 hour and couldn't understand why it was taking me so long. I explained that I was still learning and completely new to the system and the processes. She basically said that if I didn't improve i would be let go. I was devastated. I did manage to finish the tasks by the end of the day, but I've been discouraged ever since. 

I've been trying hard to get better at it since, I've been staying later to finish work and although I've made slight progress I still find myself getting very confused at certain points and needing to ask questions which inevitably slows the process. Some days I am able to get through many of the tasks, however today I wasn't able to do anything at all due to again feeling confused at certain points and needing clarity. It almost seems like I start the task and forget/ get confused about what I'm doing in the middle of it and then have to start all over again. 

I know some of this is partly due to me being new at the job, but I also wonder why I keep getting so confused so often. I wonder if it may be rooted in some cognitive impairment I have, a friend suggested that I may have ADHD. Other than that, perhaps it could just be that perhaps I am just too slow for the job? It has happened in other jobs where I've been told off for being too slow. So I'm not sure what to do. I want to stay and see how or if things improve, but I'm also wondering if I should just call it quits now ? What should I do?",Puzzleheaded-Key9419,2,1.0,0,1728502435,2024-10-09 19:33:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fzzzt6/am_i_slow_how_do_i_manage_at_work/,10,2024

Despite making a garbage salary I invested most of it and made a decent amount from ""side hustles"" that I invested. I currently make about 1100/month pretty much passively and have over a 100k in smp that I don't touch.

1fzz7x0,"Laid off from JP Morgan. Nightmarish next 6 months. End of my rope, I need advice ","I'm running out of answers and am honestly getting pretty terrified here. Spring up at 5am in existential dread levels of terrified. A little bit about me. I spent my early career in commission based sales jobs before running a pretty large team. I had a fair amount of money saved, so I started taking classes at the local community college in my mid-20's, then transferred into an ivy league. Accruing significant debt by doing so.

Post graduation, I got a job at JP Morgan after about 6 months of intense interviewing. Attained my series 7 and 66, then got laid off with about half my team due to redundancy after 1 year. I got significant interest in the first few months of 2024... Fast forward to two months into interviewing, I had two final round interviews back-to-back on the same Friday with Blackrock and Citi. I would have happily taken either, slightly preferring the Blackrock position. I ultimately did not get either; the feedback being that I didn't bring the same energy to each final round. Which I so crushingly regret at this point in time. Having two good options on the table gave me an indifference that killed my locked-in, selling myself for the position mentality bc like a dumb dumb I felt like I was shopping between two good options.

The interest dried up from big banks and institutions in early summer, so I took a position at a boutique broker-dealer to ride out the slow hiring season, planning to full-time resume my search in September when budgets opened back up. I won't go into too great of detail here, but what I planned to be a somewhat breezy holdover period turned into an absolute nightmare experience. The boss, maybe smelling out that I didn't have a long-term interest at firm, straight up starting to fuck with me. My colleagues reassured me that I was doing well and how I was head and shoulders above the last guy who only lasted a month. That said, the constant taunts, threats and toxicity made me constantly fearful. One random day, I was called in the big bosses office and ""we had some issues"".. Being that I asked for training on a specific task, then went ""under"" this other toxic boss by asking another one of my superiors for training on it. Long story short, I put in my two weeks right there. Feeling that I didn't want to risk another firing/layoff on my U5. Which I did thankfully avoid.

I really need some advice. I changed my last toxic position on linkedin/ my cv as contract, and started sending them out en masse again to very little success. Now, I'm just so doubtful and paranoid with how my resume is being perceived... ""laid off desperate job hopper""

I don't know how to combat this label without taking off this last position from my cv, which would then open up a 6 month gap on my resume and really highlight that I was laid off from JP. Which I've read is also a resume killer. I don't know what to do, feeling like I'm at a crossroads where I may have already screwed the pooch. Please if anyone has any advice, similar experience, what happens next? Will the big institutions ever look at me again? Should I take this last job off my cv, if it's already listed on my U5? I'd really appreciate some help here.",Anoneyms,2,1.0,1,1728500480,2024-10-09 19:01:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fzz7x0/laid_off_from_jp_morgan_nightmarish_next_6_months/,10,2024
1fzynoj,Lost and need guidance ,"Subject: Feeling Lost and Need Guidance

Hi everyone,

I’m Mithun, a final-year mechanical engineering student, and honestly, I’m feeling a bit lost right now. I’m unsure about which path to take after graduation, and with only six months left until I graduate, I’m struggling to make a decision. Here are the options I’m considering:

Pursue higher studies in Mechanical Engineering (Core) in Germany or other countries

Pursue higher studies in Mechanical Engineering (Core) in India

Pursue an MBA (in India or abroad)

Join the Merchant Navy

Work in a tech or non-tech startup

Start my own business

My Dilemma:
I’m passionate about entrepreneurship and feel like working in a startup could help me understand how businesses operate. But the reason I hesitate to start my own business is that I don’t have a team or partners to work on my idea with.

Additionally, I’m facing confusion about skills. I’m a mechanical engineer, but I see a lot of talk around AI, data science, and tech-related fields. This gives me serious FOMO, and I’m worried about not staying industry relevant if I don’t learn these skills. However, the time required to master these fields feels overwhelming, so I haven’t taken any steps to learn them yet.

Where I Need Help:

Skill Prioritization: Which skills should I focus on over the next six months to stay relevant in the industry? Should I focus on AI, data analytics, or something else?
Resources: Can you suggest beginner-to-advanced resources I could use to upskill in these areas?
Future Relevance: Will AI engineering, data analytics, or similar fields still be in demand over the coming years?
I know my questions are all over the place, but that’s because I’m genuinely confused. I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts and advice.

Thank you,
Mithun",Material-Goal7735,1,1.0,0,1728499047,2024-10-09 18:37:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fzynoj/lost_and_need_guidance/,10,2024

1fzyepc,Recover from toxic manager,"Hi there, I was recently let go during my probation period from a **very** toxic workplace. A measure of just how toxic it was: HR asked me out for drinks immediately after they fired me (literally as they were following me collect my things and escorting me from the building) so they could congratulate me on no longer having to work there. When during this meetup I said I ""joked"" like I had just left an abusive relationship, HR said that in upper mangement there were ""jokes"" about my former boss that ""her leadership style is 'toxic boyfriend'"" and that she has pushed numerous employees out before me. I also learened that all the managers hate each other and are plotting to undercut each other and to get each other fired.

Yeah, it was that bad. I've never been any place like this in my entire career.

I have a pretty good lead at another institution fortunately. I've talked to other former bosses and colleagues who all think it would be a great job for me. A person I used to manage has recommended me to the hiring manager. I also recently reviewed my LinkedIn page, and have a lot of good recommendations from reportees, clients, and managers there. This all gives me a bit of a confidence boost. 

But I am worried about how it will be to work in a new environment now. I try not to let ""Toxic Boyfriend"" impact my selfworth but she did directly insult my competance almost every day for six months. Like, if I didn't do a task the way she wanted during the first 6 weeks of the job, she would imply that I had lied and deceived her during my application. ""Well in your interview you could do blah blah blah, I guess I was mistaken about you."" If I voiced a concern, (for example, difficulty understanding the company hierarchy) she would act empathetic in the meeting (if she permitted me to have one with her at all) and then mention it later as an example of my incompetence, since if I was a good fit for the company I would have simply understood it. If I asked for clarification on a task to avoid making a mistake, she would scream at me and belittle me if she did find a mistake. (Even though the reason I sought her feedback was to make sure the end product was done correctly.)

I'm now afraid that I can no longer gage what is an appropriate relationship between an employee and a manager. Just the thought of asking my manager for help, or voicing a need for clarity, now fills me with anxiety that I would be giving them ""ammunition"" against me. But I've never been one to work totally without help or support. I've always been relatively autonomous once I've been onboarded, but I do need to be onboarded. I've always felt like I needed to feel confident in my abilities and tasks in order to do well at my job, and so long as I feel secure I can do a good job. But in my most recent experience my confidence was attacked systematically for months and I am not sure I can deliver.

Is there a professional way to ask for things like 1:1 meetings and regular feedback from a manager, without coming across as unprofessional or demanding? Is there a professional way to mention concerns or confusion to to a manager, that won't make me look weak or foolish? How will I overcome my anxiety and not let my past experiences jeopardize a new job or cause me to be over-vigilant?

And then on top of all of that I’d be making half my current salary when I’m done.

1fzxupu,“Too green” and radio silence…,"2 years postgrad. 

I’m currently temping at a local nonprofit, and a few weeks in, I saw a role I felt I’d be great at. Tons of relevant research experience, my minor was relevant, and years of experience, even if in undergrad. Even my manager encouraged me to apply and told the hiring team about me before I even considered it, feeling that I would be a great fit. 

2 months go by and nothing. Finally, the manager of that role (A) pulls me aside and tell me they decided to go with someone they already had temping because they felt she already understood the program and how to scale it. That they wanted me to have more on the grounds experience. I’m like okay cool, and I really appreciated her letting me know. I could tell she wasn’t fully comfortable giving me the news but I assured her it was appreciated. 

While I also felt it was weird because I didn’t get the guaranteed internal interview I thought was standard, the role clearly wasn’t meant for me. Fair enough. But then my coworker told me they had known for a while, and HR advised the manager, A, not to say anything to me. They said  I was too green.

I’m both motivated and bothered by that comment. I know the power I bring, and sure they should have expertise in hiring candidates. But why not just let me know months ago rather than seeing me weekly and saying nada? I don’t want to hold a grudge because the company is great. But that rubbed me the wrong way. No interview and radio silence, I would have appreciated the decency considering I’m an internal candidate 😭

1fzxryv,They are playing with the payrise,"

Hi all,

For context I was fired in April. Since then I looked for all jobs 8 hours a day until a landed in my actual job at June.

I think I saturated the market and there is recession and not many job offers right now so I decided to stand still here for at least 6 month -1 year because, counting my actual job I was at my first job 6 months (due to temporary contract), where I was fired I was there for 1 year and 4 months and here I'm from June.

Also there is a big inflation at my country so the salary I accepted at June is no longer enough, I know they are paying 200k more in other companies but once again since I had many interviews I need to cool off. 

Therefore, many of my work mates left for other companies. And they decided that since I'm the one that stayed, give me a payrise so I don't leave. I told them, they reduce it a little. They told me they accepted it, and now it could be on danger because finance told them OK but since it's out of the budget they will discuss it later. 

I'm afraid how will play it out, or what to say. I'm torn between asking to keep the original payrise and no review during I don't know how many months or reduce it a little so I can have more regular reviews. Or if I'm just being naive, be here so I don't look like a job hopper and find a new job.

I started as a part timer with a minimum wage of RM 10 per hour and my salary would be around RM1,800 to RM2,000 if I worked more hours (12 hour shifts). I got promoted to full timer around 8 months ago and my salary went up to RM2,200 basic including commission in total would be around RM2,700 to RM 4,000 (depends on monthly store target) with some other benefits like medical coverage, annual leaves, 6 paid off days within a month, EPF and etc. I live with my parents still, not studying yet as I'm still saving up money, and I do not have any debts as of now except minor phone bill and transport expenses around RM 80 in total. It can be tiring having to wake up 2-3 hours early to wait for the bus and wait for the train. For context, my bus comes at every 30min interval and I have to switch to two trains to get to my workplace. 

Example, if my shift starts at 8:30am I will have to be awake by 6:30am and be at the bus stop by 7:00am and reach the station by 7:30am. Then once my shift ends at 6 I will only reach home around 8pm and sometimes I will have an afternoon shift which ends at 11pm and I will reach home around 1am and the next day is morning shift so I would only be getting around 4 hour sleep which is really detrimental. 

 So my question is, should I find a job that's nearer to my house? I was thinking of working at a chill cafe near my place but only downside is I would be starting working for hours again like a part timer and my salary will decreased around RM1,800 to RM2,000. However I was thinking, that way I could use the extra 2-3 hours that I used to spend on waiting for the bus or train instead to go gym or work on my side hustle that'll be making extra money and also studies. There's also a gym 2mins away for the cafe and library, so I could easily get access and focus on going to gym and library to study unlike now which I have no time at all. I would really appreciate your opinion on this as someone with more experience than me, and I also apologise if there's any grammar or spelling mistake. Thank you!

1fzwezw,Feeling discouraged with my career and job? ,"What to do with my career and job as I’m feeling discouraged? 

Feeling discouraged with career and job

Hello all, I (25F) has been working as an engineer the past 2.5 years. This was my first corporate job out of college, and when I started I was struggling heavily with my mental health. I was dealing with anxiety, and also my manager at the time wasn’t supportive of my growth? 

When I started I had intense anxiety about my interactions with others and really excelling at my role. I’m usually a high achiever so I like to excel. When I started this job it was not related at all to what I studied in college. This role was more so related to IT but I studied a different type of engineering in school. 

When I began the positon, I asked my manager at the time to get trained on the softwares we use since they are proprietary and they don’t have any resources online to learn it. She said there were classes available but the teacher wasn’t very good, and that since my colleague that is a SME on the software learned by shadowing, I should learn it the way he did too. But I did not have any prior experience with IT, software, etc coming into the positon. My SME colleague did have some familiarity with computers and such before coming into the positon. I asked my manager to take the class 3 times and she denied me every time. I have tried to learn through shadowing but I felt so incompetent. I felt like my coworkers felt the same about me as well. I was extremely discouraged. My manager told me that I should consider other departments if this is not a good fit for me, and it hurt me to know that she really wasn’t supporting me. 

She eventually did leave the company. I did get a new manager who is much nicer. But it has been a struggle the past few years. I have tried learning by shadowing but I learn much better through classes, especially on subjects I have no context on. I have felt like my coworker have seen me as incompetent which further discouraged me. I really really did try my best. I stayed after late, I asked for help, they put me and my new colleague at the time on a project that was my first time leading. And we both had to figure things out. I had to bring her up to speed and train her while trying to get this project released. I eventually got so burnt out and my mental health got pretty bad. By doctor approved me for medical leave to help my mental and physical health because I lost weight, I couldn’t sleep and I wasn’t eating. 

I have been tired. I have tried applying for other jobs but I have not been successful. I know I should have left earlier but my mental health was so bad, I was depressed and anxious for over a year. I have tried to take better care of myself in recent months. And after my medical leave I really tried to cut back how much effort I put in my job. I have tried not to stay too late after. 

I have also really grown to dislike some of my team. It hurts when you try your best with what you know but it’s still not enough, your still incompetent in there eyes and I’ve just had enough. I feel stuck. I try to do my best but honestly I’ve grown very tired and apathetic of this job. I don’t really like interacting with them as it seems like I’m just a burden to the team. I’ve been the only woman on the team for about 2 years and I felt extremely isolated for a while. I had another manager on the team try to say a negative remark about my age and our director had to stop her. I don’t know why I was treated this way when since I began, I really really tired my best to be kind to everyone, do my best, ask questions and help them. And now I just grown to dislike people in general after working here. I feel hurt. I never tried to say anything disrespectful to anyone but yet I’m still treated like a burden or that I’m unwanted. 

We have had new colleagues join the team after me and they just seem to be thriving. It has made me feel worse about myself like I’m not good enough for this positon. I just wish I got more support when I started. In retrospect I felt like it was unreasonable for them to make me a SME on a software that I only learned about through shadowing. I never really had a foundation. But then I question if I should be able to learn and thrive that was because my other colleague seem to be fine. Even the newer ones 

This jobs has made me question is engineering is even the right path for me. I really just need some guidance as I’ve been trying to apply for jobs, but I’ve just been exhausted genuinely. I have a 40 min to an hour commute each day do and from this job and by the time I make it home I’m tired. 

I am ready to make a job or career change if needed. I never really allowed myself to explore other careers growing up as I wanted to be an engineer since I was a kid. But now I am really rethinking if that path is for me. I don’t know if I dislike engineering because of my experience here, or because I just don’t like it.

1fzvpmz,Making the decision between two different Jobs.,"I am a senior at a Big 10 University and have found myself in a difficult predicament. This past summer I interned at a Big 4 accounting firm doing consulting and received and accepted a return offer in the NYC office. However, I have still been applying to companies and have found another job that I have been interviewing for and have really found an interest in it(more than the Big 4 job). They are a commercial bank that is primarily out of the South East of the US. Moving down south would be a big jump because I feel like I will be missing out on the connections I would make in NYC and would have to restart my life down south. Additionally, I would be changing from consulting to a Wealth Management Rotational program. I have been attracted to WM due to its mixture of relationship management and financial analysis. While I do not have an offer from this bank they have hinted at being a top candidate for the position. 

What should I do in this situation? I would want to move to Charlotte later on in my career due to its more laid back lifestyle but I am not sure if it is too early. Also, I do not know if renegging my full time offer in a Big 4 will come back to bite me late on.

1fzvfvc,Am I getting the run around at work? ,"Wanted to get some additional thoughts on whether you all think I’m getting the run around in terms of potential promotions as we get close to the end of the year. As someone who’s been in those people conversations before I have my own thoughts, but don’t wanna assume. 

For context, I think my boss and bosses boss have had me on a shortlist for a promotion for the past year. Transparently I’m probably over qualified for my role but because my role requires a few days on-site, I’m not as easy to replace. 

I’ve gotten glowing performance reviews and in several metrics I’m lapping nearly everyone else in the department. That being said, in one particular metric I’m struggling compared to others. Because these results are mainly out of our control they are typically not weighted as heavily.

Recently however my manager is starting to focus on them and I believe he’s gently trying to prep me for being let down. My guess is upper management is being hyper critical on promotions and my direct leaders are worried about me jumping ship. 

Naturally I’m going to push over the next few months to improve but this changing of the goalposts feels like a cheap way to rationalize not giving out promotions.

Should I start looking for other opportunities now or wait to see how it plays out?

1fzv92m,"Looking into a career switch in the UK, but feel like I’ve dug myself into a hole, can anyone suggest which careers my skills would be transferable into?","


Hi everyone, just some background I’m 27, earn about £50k and work in university fundraising. 

I’m basically in compliance and regulatory role, and I’m regularly trusted with some pretty important and confidential stuff, I like to think I’ve made good progress compared to other colleagues around my age. 

Some of my responsibilities include: enforcing and advising on our policies and regulations; reviewing, advising, editing and sometimes writing agreements for donations in the tens of millions; creating budgets; working across teams in finance and legal to communicate policies; working on multiple projects including automating a whole load of processes that I used to have to do manually and creating tax efficient giving vehicles in other countries; and conducting regulatory training sessions for my dept (over 90 people). 

I like to think my experience is quite valuable but talking with recruiters and redditors it’s been described as “golden handcuffs” where I have great experience for university fundraising but, as I want to switch careers into something I enjoy more, it’s not hugely relevant. 

I’m pretty open about which career I switch into, I’ve been considering law but im not totally convinced and a lot of people have advised against it. So basically is there anything that strikes you that you think I could do and do well? I’d like a bit of a pay rise if I’m honest, but my main driver is a solid career, with good progression and where I’ll be learning new things constantly. 

I feel like I’ve learnt all there is to know in my current role and I’m stagnating at the moment, but it seems like it’s not a hugely ambitious sector overall, at least in my experience, and I’ve been shot down multiple times when suggesting new, more senior roles for myself, which i don’t love. 

Feel free to message me if you’d like to know more about what I do! Just don’t want to make it super obvious on this post for obvious reasons!

1fzuunp,Got an offer! Need some input! ,"Hi all, I could use some advice!

I recently got an offer from a well-known company, but the salary is about $8K lower than what I'm currently making. That said, it's still in the six-figure range, and the position is a ""Lead"" role in a business function like Finance, Procurement, or Operations. It's an individual contributor role, but there's room for growth.

**Current Job:**

* No room for growth
* The company isn’t doing too well operationally/financially
* I’m in the office 4 days a week, which I’m not loving
* My boss is great, which makes the job more enjoyable

**New Offer:**

* Very stable and financially strong company
* Fully remote, but I'd have to travel to HQ occasionally (a short flight, so not a big deal)
* Salary is $8K lower, but I’d save on commuting costs (gas, car wear, meals, etc.)
* The job is in a different industry that I've always wanted to explore. I have only been in one industry my whole career.

Two important things to note: I finished chemotherapy earlier this year and realized I really don’t enjoy being in the office as much as I used to. Also, I’m in a long-distance relationship, so this remote position could give me more flexibility to visit my girlfriend or even move closer to her.

I tried negotiating, but they wouldn’t budge on the salary, even though they admitted it was within their budget. There’s no sign-on bonus either, which was a bit of a letdown. However, Glassdoor reviews for the company are fantastic, especially considering its size.

I quit my internship before they even assigned me a supervisor (who was going to be remote and not affiliated with the placement).

1fztyd9,Low paid social worker ,"I am a social worker with an MSW, currently doing counseling. I went into this career for the passion I have to help others. However, passion doesn’t pay the bills and we have been conditioned to do everything for the passion we have, for the poor people we work with, etc. I am tired of this. I was already doing counseling before getting my masters and was only given $1 when I received my masters as “my responsibilities didn’t change”. Then, my job wanted me to do an accreditation and gave me a small percent extra while I trained. However, they never told me how much I would be making when I would get the accreditation even after I asked multiple times. This accreditation will change my responsibilities significantly, includes more liabilities and I will have my title as counselor and another title for that accreditation. Since I am about to get it, they just got back to me saying they will increase my pay $1 extra an hour and the reason is “that’s what they pay for extra degrees and accreditations”. However that’s not what they told me when I got my masters. I am beyond upset and considering not applying for the accreditation. When I brought it up to my supervisor, she made it seem like I am $$$ hungry. Although, yes, I want more money, I want it because all the added responsibilities. I rather stay with my old pay and old responsibilities, rather than doing more for no extra $$$$ on the name of “helping others”, while the top leaders makes bank at my company

This also brings me to the point that I would like to leave this field, do tech, finance, it is hard to feel passion for the work when you are underpaid and growing professionally (masters and accreditation) doesn’t mean anything for the people I work for.

1fzttlb, In need of guidance - Starting the 3D modeling journey ,"Hello,

I wanted to ask if what I'm thinking is a good idea since my thoughts always seem to be scattered somewhere.

I'm thinking of quitting my call center job, where I work around 10 h a day for not a lot of pay, to pursue my passions and dreams for 3D modeling and eventually either making it the movie/gaming industry. Having to sit in front of a monitor, doing mentally exhausting work for 10 h and then afterwards finding time to spend to learn 3D would destroy my health, which I don't have the luxury to do anymore. I'm 25 and a loser as well. I kinda even started working in the call center because i quit on my aspirations as an artist. ( a person too)

Recently, I've been going to therapy and fixing my life, one step at a time and regained some confidence to start pursuing 3D again. I am not totally new to 3D and always dreamed to be able to work it on a professional level.

So my thoughts were to either find a more physically active job and work for less hours. Sure the pay wouldn't be great but I'll have the time to focus on building that portfolio and help me keep a healthy body/mind. What would you say about that ?

I also wanted to ask is pursuing a masters in 3D a good idea as well ? I hear and see a lot of mixed opinions and would like to know more.

Sorry that the post is just one and I loaded it with questions but I'll summarize:

**TL:DR-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

1. Should I quit my current long and mentally exhausting job for another one that would be better for my physical health and work less hours, so i could have more time to learn 3D?
2. Masters in 3D ? Is it worth it or maybe another masters would be better / None at all ?

1fzto10,Advice please?,"      So for the past few years I’ve been having trouble trying to figure out what I have a passion for, which led me to wasting time and money on a course to get a certification to be able to start working but ultimately was having trouble with. I had completed the course work at the time but had never taken the test to get my full on real estate license. I just had a gut feeling that I would fail the test because while studying I just couldn’t seem to stay interested in it at all.

       With that being the case, I’ve looked into exploring some other careers. While looking into the other careers I’ve come to realize that maybe I had looked at things the wrong way. That maybe instead of selling, I would love to decorate or design the spaces inside. Thinking about it, I feel as though that would be a perfect fit because I’ve always loved watching HGTV shows with remodeling a space and busting down walls or something simple like just decorating a space. 

       Coming to this realization I have had a hard time deciding on if I should pursue a career in interior design or interior decorating. I’ve looked into the differences between them and have looked into some courses I can take online near me.

  I have come into a few dilemmas when doing research which would be: 

                    1.) What if I start pursuing one of these careers like I did before and come to realize they aren’t for me either and I just wasted more time and money?

                     2.) Maybe I’ll finally be ready to pursue either one but have no idea where to start. (this has been another thing that I feel is holding me back because I don’t know anyone I can talk to that’s in this field and can help me get started).

       My boyfriend has been so supportive of me through the years in whatever I decide to stay pursuing at the time. At this point, I’m just scared to start something else and fail to see it through. I don’t want to disappoint him or my family anymore than I already have. But I mainly don’t want to disappoint myself either.

         If there’s any hell or advice you can give me, I would deeply appreciate it. For now, I’ll continue to try and look into more things on my own.

I was thinking to dropout in my 3^(rd) year for doing drop-shipping/amazon-fba but didn’t do it due to fear of failure/uncertainty (I used to have unrealistic expectations and distorted view of reality until I got a reality check slap!).

since I was a kid, I loved tech used to watch every video about gadgets

I have made a plan on how to achieve this (ready to work 24/7) I’ve 2 plans(of course flexible years): - first to learn about coding (java and building cool projects) from 1^(st) oct to 30^(th) dec, create a near perfect resume start applying for job in Jan and get a job any how by apr-june ‘25 (even a crappy/low-paying service-based as it is easier to get in) till June ‘27 in these 2 years ill upskill myself and whatnot (like DSA, projects, opensource) then I’ll look for jobs in Bangalore (silicon valley of India) in a product-based company/startup and gonna do there till aug ’29 (again ill in these 2 years ill upskill and gonna try a side hustle, create networks, attend events) then I’ll try for the real silicon valley SF, CA in a FAANG company and do there till oct ’32 and then finally my own journey….forever but this plan have an obstacle it will very difficult to get a job the company will gonna have two doubts why didn’t he got place in-campus and why he’s applying after 10 months that’s a wide gap therefore the second plan comes in i.e. to appear for the GATE ‘26( for masters, prepare for a year from oct till Jan ’26) get in a good college prepare for job then college end then job in a good product-based company (from in-campus) from July ’28 till oct’30(gonna try side hustle, upskilling and whatnot) then try for FAANG in SF, CA do there till dec’32 and then finally my venture….

1fzt8r4,"How to deal with a ""casual"" manager ","
 

Someone who is like buddy with their subordinates

Its alright until they are kind of rude/ unstructured? Because they think they are already friends with you? So things can be casual/overlooked?


For context: I'm new to the company and I am required to have a buddy but it's literally close to one month in, the other new joiners already had their assigned buddies while my department is still discussing.

For example: 

1) I was at my work desk, literally I heard the manager asking who wants to be my buddy behind me and the colleagues from my department were like ohh but idk if I want that ohhh. While all the manager did was seemly "" oh you guys discuss among yourselves ok"" 

To me it screams lack of structure. I would have expected the manager have set aside time to pick someone and not just a very causal randomiser. buddy would means a trainer responsibility as well. 

2) they were going soon on a company trip and asking if I am going, before I could answer manager said oh then give <my name> do the work since we won't be around. Wow.... I don't want him as my manager .. idk it's a bit unprofessional for my liking


3) talks behind supervisor back. Manager talked behind the supervisor back in front of me and the other colleagues, and othe colleagues do so too, quite loudly and other departments could hear it. It's weird to me. Idk if this is like an acceptable thing going about.
I wonder if the reason why manager is holding this ""casual"" stance with his subordinates is because he wants to show that he's on the teams side vs supervisor. Some weird power play. While also benefiting because maybe manager doesn't want others to talk badly about him so idk. Maybe it's a plan made by the manager and supervisor. I'm definitely overthinking now. I'll definitely not get involved. But I need to be careful because if am not as friendly as others are with this manager, I'm definitely getting picked on.

 4) blame shifting/ working pushing 
The manager shared to the other colleagues while I'm literally standing around them that apparently supervisor was supposed to inform me about something but he forgot. Supervisor asked if manager told me said information. Supervisor asked manager to ask other colleagues to tell me about said information. Manager shared that definitely these colleagues wouldn't tell me this kind of information. Its such as stupid situation, I feel stupid typing this out lmao.

Idk how true this is, because i can tell from what manager said, manager didn't take any accountability and didn't explain from his point of view, all he said was what others did. 

5) direct red flag: colleague straight up told me that ""in this company people talk about everyone, everyone has been talked about. This is how it is in every companies so don't take it to heart""  

What I'm worried about: manager favouritism/project management. I think a likely scenario that would happen is uneven work allocation and they might give me more work than other colleagues. 





My General thoughts of manager: maybe like a athletic coach attitude ? I have never seen him smile at all towards me, maybe  he is doing so to show that he's the kind that is not going to be warm with others easily, I smiled at him multiple times and he didn't smile back, he doesn't match with my energy/ doesn't reciprocate or accept my excitement. I can see he definitely make sure to involve others in activities. I do not think he is a professional person (given how he crudely worded on giving me more work to do) 
I don't think he is a positive person. I think the way he bonding with the other colleagues is through shared pain/ negative experience such that he can buddy with them.

My General thoughts of supervisor: opposite of manager, cares for his subordinates, warm feels like the kind that truly wants to nurture new joiners and concern for them.

I hope this is not a higher level of sick political play either way I do not trust anyone in work and I'm grounded on I'm just gonna make money and leave work as work. I am aware about no friends in work as well 

I DIGRESS MAIN THING IS: 

What should I do to just protect myself mentally? I truly get affected easily.I'm thinking 

1. Ask how much of collaborative work is needed and what forms (so I can avoid them as much as possible) 

2. Walk away/ change topic whenever they start gossiping 

3. Ask if there is a clear indication / assignment of work 
 
4. Any politics I need to play at the start?? Smile less?? Quick butter up with team lead? Don't butter up with him? Avoid him? What do I do?? But currently my stance is I'm just gonna play the role of quiet person, lay low.",New-Piece-368,2,1.0,4,1728485470,2024-10-09 14:51:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fzt8r4/how_to_deal_with_a_casual_manager/,10,2024

1fzs6cr,Potential Job Offer - But Don’t Feel Quite Right Accepting It,"I interviewed with Amazon this past week for a Finance Manager role and it was the infamous loop stage. Of the 4 interviewers, I only felt a genuine vibe from 2 of them. I didn’t feel quite a click with them and they all seemed to look exhausted.

The TC discussed from HR was $180k, which seems pretty low for an L6 role from my research. And given the RTO and potential manager layoffs, I’m not too keen on joining. On top of that, the growing criticism of Amazon, and how I felt during the loop, it doesn’t feel right that I take the role. I think had it been a 3/4 day in office with Amazon, I’d lean towards taking it too.

I enjoy what I do but my main reason for considering Amazon was that my current job doesn’t pay that well (Finance Manager - $110k base). My manager and I had a 1:1 and she did say that she would like to give me a direct report and potentially promote me next year but she did add that this is what she’d ideally like but the ultimate approval lies with senior leadership.

I hope you're all doing well. Lately, I've been facing some challenges in my job search. I've been actively looking for opportunities in digital marketing and project management, but I haven't had much luck finding the right fit.



I hold a bachelor's degree in Indology, and I have internship experience in project management and digital marketing. My native language is Turkish, and I have a good command of English. I'm currently learning Spanish. Being multilingual has helped me understand cultural differences and communicate effectively.



However, I often feel that the qualifications for the positions I come across are quite high. I'm focusing on remote job opportunities, but so far, I haven't found what I'm looking for. I'm reaching out to see if anyone in this community has experienced something similar or has any advice to share.



I'm here to learn from the experiences of others and to support each other in this journey. Any tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

1fzqvyj,"Need to make a change, but I can't decide what job I should be doing (or if I should go back to school)","I'm currently working in a job I dislike and living in a city I dislike. However, I can't figure out what I should be doing instead. I peruse job postings, look at big lists of jobs, etc., but I can't figure out what I would like, what I would be good at, and what wouldn't leave me destitute. Below is some info about me--do you have any recommendations?

___

**Education:**

* Bachelor's from a public university; majored in English and two more obscure humanities; had solid extracurricular involvement (leadership roles).
* Master's from an Ivy in a niche humanity; no extracurriculars because the pandemic threw everything off.
* Grades and coursework solid for both.

**Work experience:**

* I have been working in higher-ed administration for almost two years; it's mostly a clerical job, and I hate it (my motivation for working here was in case I wanted to go back to school--see below).
* Beyond that my background is primarily in technical writing--counting a college internship, I have about three years of experience there. Also hated it.
* Money hasn't been a problem with these jobs, but I worry that the trend is pay correlating with misery.

**Other things I've tried:**

* Growing up I worked on a farm and in a bakery; enjoyed the physical exercise the former gave me and did not like the latter.
* Have done freelance writing, Excel work, and web design, all of which I am not a huge fan of.
* Did some content work and ticket management for a big company for a few months and also did not enjoy it.

**What other people tell me I should do:** Pretty much anyone that knows me, when asked, will say that I should be a professor. It's partly because I really do give off that vibe and partly because I think they just don't know what else to say about my skillset/experience.

**What I've thought about doing:**

* I also have thought about going back to grad school and becoming a professor. However, this seems like a terrible idea financially and in terms of job prospects. I also don't think I could handle writing a dissertation--I'm good at coursework, but I am not confident that I could hold to an independent writing schedule for a book-length project (or for writing/researching independently as a professor). I would be good at and enjoy teaching, though. Getting accepted into a PhD program also might be a little difficult: I don't have great recommenders because I didn't make connections during my master's (COVID, mental illness, etc.), and I have failed to retroactively foster those connections even while working at the very university where I got my master's (mental illness, again, but also indecision and because working full-time saps so much from me).
* As a child, I first wanted to be an astronomer. Then, when I started to dislike math, I decided I should become a writer (which is an aspiration I have not fully let go).
* In college, as I was languishing in technical writing, I told myself I should really be doing editorial internships in NYC; that's still an idea I entertain, but the pay is so abysmal that, even if I could get my foot in the door, I would be ruined by the transition. Academic publishing would be a better-paying compromise, but I am outcompeted by PhDs.

**Things I am good at and like doing:** Editing. Proofreading. Formatting. Public speaking / presenting. Teaching. Photoshop.

**Things I am good at but do *not* like doing**: Writing. Communications. Remembering/recalling information. Excel. Project management/coordination.

**Things I'm *not* good at**: People. Programming.

**Useless skills:** I know several dead languages.

**Subjects I know a lot about:** English literature. Antiquity. Religion. Internet culture (which has made me some money in the past, so it's not as useless as it seems!).

**Places I want to live:** Pretty much just New York City. Somewhat open to Chicago.

**Other considerations:**

* My aging parents live in the Midwest, and I feel guilty about being so far away from them.
* I'm 28 and ideally would like to find a relationship that will really stick, but that seems difficult if I remain in the wind.
* I have a bleeding heart and would like to do something that benefits the world--I've thought about the United Nations, given my desire to move to New York, but I never see jobs there that look good or for which I am remotely qualified.",The_Inexistent,1,1.0,0,1728479000,2024-10-09 13:03:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fzqvyj/need_to_make_a_change_but_i_cant_decide_what_job/,10,2024

I’ve been working here for too long not to use the recourses I’ve been given to be more helpful with my team, especially when I know how to. But every mistake I make is unforgivable, and it’s to the point where I don’t even know if I’m a good fit for this job. I understand it’s unfair to have to deal with an annoying unexperienced teenager all day, but I really wish she would be, nicer? It’s hard going into work everyday just to be put down, I come in with a positive mindset just to be crushed into a million pieces (literally she makes me cry a lot lol). I think I’m just too sensitive, but genuinely I can’t stand this anymore, what are some good career choices for forgetful, clumsy, and sometimes lacking common sense for teenagers?

1fzq8ah,Should he take the promotion?,"My fiance works in the banking industry working in the back office. He's been offered a position as a team lead in a different dept. Let's call this Dept X. His ultimate career path is Dept A. To share some context:

Dept X is not his career path line of work. But I told him by having managerial experience on his CV, he opens a lot of doors in the future even if he decides not to continue on a managerial role in Dept X. One of the higher execs paved the road for him to take this promotion.

Pros: 1. Managerial XP. 2. Higher salary bracket. 3. Great addition to CV.

Cons: 1. Not his desired career path. 2. Sacrificing time in a dept that does not add to acquiring skills that contribute to his career path.

If he decides to apply for Dept A instead, he's working towards building XP towards his ultimate dream job.

Pros: 1. Build XP and acquire new skills towards his desired job. 2. Network within the dept. 

Cons: 1. No managerial XP on resume. 2. Most likely a lower salary bracket due to not having personnel responsibilities. 3. Potentially disappointing the exec that paved the way for him for this position.

Question: Would it be considered a step down if he took the job as team lead in Dept X, but after 2 years or so, decided to change to Dept A and not be a team lead?

1fzq19r,Last night I tried ending my life. Please help.,"Graduated in August 2023 (BE CSE). I was placed in Accenture, Bangalore (on campus) but they revoked the offer right after I graduated leaving me with no job. 
I joined an early start-up in September 2023 as a react native developer. I was being paid INR 20k and I kind of ignored it was my first job. My manager promised me a decent salary by the end of six months and also I can elevate the amount by my hard work. I was building a mobile application for the company. I worked very hard. Six days a week. Completed 32 pages mobile application for customer release in just 100 days (frontend + middleware).
With that application my start-up raised 27% extra fundings and hired few freshers. My six months contract as an associate got converted to Full Stack Developer fte in just 4 months but they increased my salary to just 25k.
Next I build the complete website for my company (parenting from mobile application), guided and taught freshers frontend technology and handed them over the website for completion when I started handling middleware, automations, testing of the website.

My problem:
I am still at the same salary of 25k. After continuous begging my manager says wait 2/3 months until we get a good funding (he has been saying this from past 6 months). I am living in Bangalore with INR 25k. 

- Can't afford food so I skip lunch and dinner. Imagine sleeping with empty stomach or eating Parle-G/bread dipped in water for past 6 months.
- Lost 14 kg of my weight in last 3 months.
- I am using my 5 years old laptop for work and had to spend my salary to get it fixed now and then.
- Imagine working for over a year, and still you have zero savings.
- Imagine giving industry use mobile application and website to client in 6 (3+3) months still not getting appreciated enough.
- Imagine not being able to spend even Rs 200 in a restaurant because that would get me 1 kg rice and half kg daal which would last 5 days if I eat less.
- My dad hasn't talked to me in three months.
- I have 50-60k loan on my head (thankfully from relatives and not from any loan app).
- Imagine you love icecream but can't eat because you can't afford it.
- Imagine all these being a computer science engineer.
- I have a relationship of 5 years with my girl. She is single child. Her family for obvious reasons expects her provider to be financially stable. 
- Imagine applying for 800+ job openings and not getting calls.
- Imagine not being able to resign from my job because I belong to a very small family and have no backup.

I tried ending my life yesterday but I guess I was not strong enough to make it happen. I am alone. I can't tell my problems to anyone. I haven't slept happily once in last 1.5 years. Not once. At this point I am not even complaining I haven't ate a good meal in months. I just want to have one good sleep.

I feel like most places I go, there's plenty of people who will use you and take credit for your work which always seems to happen to me, I'm often overlooked or undervalued in most places I work at due to this.

I've worked for quite a few company's now, and the one I am at now seems to have the best culture by far but I just can't seem to enjoy working with many devs, due to no one respecting my intelligence and ability to do my job (it's very isolating being a woman in tech)

I'm at the point now where I'm debating if this is the career for me anymore as it's also the type of job where you think about fixing things or going the extra mile after working hours just to prove yourself... 

The only big issue is the pay I get paid 40k (uk) to do my job, I work from home and have flexibility, there's also room for pay rises of course when I progress. I often dream about working in a coffee shop and coming home not thinking about programming. Has anyone been in a similar situation and how have you dealt with it?

The job's ok, but something doesn't feel good and I am always thinking about should I get a master's degree or not. I wanted to start working as a freelancer or a digital marketing agency. But I also kinda feel like I need to complete master's degree for a better future. I don't know. Iam so confused right now. Which field should I follow? Am I doing it right? Or should I get a Master's degree? Can someone give me some advice? Please 🙏.

1fzmrfd,What holds my future?,"Hi guys,

Need help!

I am a NOC Engineer with around 1.6 YoE. I am a CCNA and AWS Cloud Practitioner Certified. Basic of the basics.

I am confused on where to go next.

I am interested in Cloud, not that I am not interested in Networking, I am thinking of taking the AWS Solutions Architect exam, but I am not sure if I can land a job in the Cloud Industry with no experience and just two certifications. I am no good in coding either.

Now, after that I thought since I already have the CCNA cert, can I go ahead doing the CCNP ENCOR/SCOR and any one of the concentration exams.   
  
Here comes the money crunch.

It is very difficult to find good free reliable study sources searched on google, torrents, LinkedIn (not in depth), even if I do, both the exams, Core + Concentration cost like a Ton. And my company is not going to sponsor for it.

I am confused on what to do or where to go next and it's eating my head up.

Please Help!",fazalll,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1728463156,2024-10-09 08:39:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fzmrfd/what_holds_my_future/,10,2024
1fzmb3y,Seeking Career Advice: From Hospitality to Banking.,"
Hello everyone! 

I'm (F) 29, and I've just moved to California. I've been here for three months and am still Seeking Career Advice: From Hospitality to Banking for my work permit so I can start applying for jobs. 

I have four years of experience in a call center in the Philippines and another four years in the food and beverage industry. I also have a degree in Hotel and Restaurant Management.

I'm having a hard time figuring out my career path since my experience doesn’t match the jobs I want to apply for. 

Here are my questions:

- Do you think I can apply for a banking job or as a teller? I want to start fresh and build a professional career.

- Then after the banking experience, do you think I could qualify for a government job, like an office clerk?

If you have any suggestions on what I should apply for to pursue a career in government or what steps or training should I do, I would really appreciate it. 

I want to be successful in my career!

Thank you for your help!",aTPNY,1,1.0,0,1728460919,2024-10-09 08:01:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fzmb3y/seeking_career_advice_from_hospitality_to_banking/,10,2024

1fzl7cf,What fields can an ex-co-founder get into? ,"I need advice regarding my career. I’ll try to keep this short. I have almost 5 years of experience. I’ve built two startups in Pakistan. One was in the asset fractionalisation space and the other was a prop-tech SaaS one. Both of them didn’t have a-lot of success and failed to raise investment. 

I recently relocated to the US on a green card and its my third month here. In both startups i was overseeing almost every function but my core areas are Product development, sales and customer support/success but in all the areas my experience has been more setting those departments including but not limited to strategy building, hiring talent, training them and everyday operations. 

Now on my resume, my experience seems to be very broad in a very short time, and i want to get into a job preferably as a product owner/manager but i’m also open to sales or customer support roles and i havent had luck getting alot of interviews here.

I’ve been told my startup experience is valuable but it does not feel like so. 

So my question’s are
1) What do i do to break into a product field? Do i get some sort of certification? 
2) Do i show the fact that i’ve been a co-founder to every job i apply or should i make it specific i.e (Changing titles to product owner for product jobs, etc)
3) Should i keep trying to get a product jobs for which i havent gotten any interviews as compared to customer success and sales where i still have gotten some positive responses.

Any advice would be appreciated as i feel really stuck right now. Thanks. Sorry for the long post",Ancient-Bite-9144,3,1.0,2,1728455739,2024-10-09 06:35:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fzl7cf/what_fields_can_an_excofounder_get_into/,10,2024

1fzk61r,I'm Lost For What To Do For A Job At This Point,"Here is some context. I have a bachelor's degree in English Teaching, a minor in Library, and a master's in Creative Writing. 

I worked for 9 years as an English teacher in a town 1.5 hours away from my hometown. Teaching full-time was not a good fit. I took a high school Library job in my hometown. The position was cut after 4 years. I had tenure and they offered me a middle school English job but I declined. I didn't like what full-time teaching did to my mental health. 

I have been working as the Advertising Director for a local newspaper for 16 months now. This job basically has entailed doing everything for the paper besides writing articles and doing layouts and other editorial work. I do all the work with ads such as solicitations, billing, ad creation, and execution. This includes print ads and digital ads. I help with obituaries, overdue billing, general customer service, especially for subscriptions, and I coordinate content for our special publications, which are our big moneymaker. 

The print advertising has been steady or even gone up some months while working here. However, my boss said the digital growth needs to be four times higher. Nobody seems to want digital advertising in the small town where I live. He basically wants to restructure my job and have someone else focus on digital ad sales in my area because I haven't been able to devote enough time to it or make enough money doing it. I'm just kind of at a point where I have little to no interest in more change at this job. The company is slowly pivoting away from newspapers to a digital ad agency and it just seems like a scam to me. 

I'm wondering what the hell I should do at this point. I don't want to leave the town I'm in because it's my hometown and my parents are here and I've got kids. But the job market is so slim and the cost of living keeps going up. Any ideas?

1fzjuqv,What should I do? I don’t know if i should choose going to college or into the trades. ,"I live in California, I am currently 17, going to be 18 next year and going to graduate high school. And I’m really stuck of what to do with my life. Through my high school years, I’ve always and only gotten As and taken some APs and an honors class too, with my highest GPA being 4.44. But through those years I never thought of what to do with my life. I didn’t know what to major in and I didn’t know what to do in general. 

During summer of 2024, I went to an internship for all the trades and there I really learned a lot. I went to fields trips for electrician, carpentry, and more. But electrician really caught my eye. I can go to community college for an electrical technology degree and then maybe an apprenticeship after. 

But I’ve always felt that I have to go to universities and college, and I believed it too and I believed that too even though as I have really good grades and a high GPA, but the cost of college and universities scared , but the cost of college and universities scared me as I just don’t want it to be a waste of my time and my parents money. Before the internship, I joined a program about college that can help me figure out what to do in college and more college help too like financial aid and all of that type of stuff. Ever since the trade internship, I felt like I should maybe major something that is construction related, like electrical engineering or construction management in a process of community and then a university or college. 

But I really feel like electrician can be something I can pursue and do, but at the same time, I feel like I did all those APs and honors class for nothing and don’t want to waste all that work I put into those classes. So I’m really stuck between going to community school for electrical technology and then an apprenticeship, or go to community college and then a university or college after majoring in construction management or electrical engineering.

1fzjjla,Can't seem to keep a stable job. Keep making mistakes.,"So for background, I have not been able to find employment for most of my life (30+ years). I mostly floated between schools trying to get into a career that way, but never really accumulated anything noteworthy. I've done some volunteering, and the folks at the places I volunteer at appreciate me a lot. But the quality of work expected as a volunteer is not even close to what is expected in a professional environment.  Last year I had an intermittent gig as a web developer, but my boss was really nasty and sapped my motivation to no end.

I was finally able to find a job as a security guard at the start of this year. But lost it when I just kept making mistakes. I seemed to always misplace things, miss things I've been trained to spot. It sort of all fell apart when I spoke to my supervisor with no filter on.

I was able to land another one recently. Essentially I analyze data via excel. However, I keep slipping up. I'm 5 months in and my boss is getting frustrated as I'm still mislabeling files, putting things in the wrong folders, messing up emails to clients. The list goes on. It's really frustrating as the instructions are very clear. I just can't seem to pull my mind together to do it properly. It's not even like it's some high level skill. I just keep messing up little details and it drives everyone (including me) crazy.

Any advice?

1fzhwnd,Waiting on internal promotion interview ,"I’ve been in my role for nearly 9 yrs. I am good at what I do and love the company. I have a good job and don’t want to leave.

However, recently a role/promotion opportunity came up in my office. I applied for it because I feel I would be qualified and could have a shot at it. I went through the proper channels for it. I applied last week.  I know the hiring manager and sent an email stating I had applied.

Yesterday the HR recruiter reached out to me asking a question and later replied that they would be setting up an initial call. 

I’ve applied for other roles before and nothing ever happened after I applied so I take this as a good sign, but I still have a sense that an interview won’t happen.

My question is how long does it usually take to schedule an interview and how do I keep my patience in check? 

I try to stay focused but every time I hear an email ding I check to see if it’s an invitation…I know it’s only been a few days, but it’s a great role and I would like it very much…so it’s hard to think about anything else…

1fzhs32,Career recommendations?,"Hey everyone, I’d love some career advice. I truly have no idea what to do after I graduate college in December. 

I began school majoring in biomedical science, as I was originally pre-dental. I took all of the pre-med classes, but last semester, I had to drop the major due to failing Organic Chemistry 2 three different times. To avoid adding an entire year, I switched to an Interdisciplinary Studies major with concentrations in natural & physical sciences, and decided to pursue a career in Speech Language Pathology instead. I recently found out that a masters in SLP is going to be a minimum of $105k for 2 years, and since I’m not the most passionate about that career path, it just doesn’t seem worth it for the amount of debt I’d be in. 

I was wondering if anyone had any career suggestions for me. I’m willing to pursue a master’s program or do a different program if I need to. I enjoy working with numbers (love math) and I also feel like my previous coursework has set me up well for the medical field.

1fzh2qv,Manager wants me to lie on audit to incur credits from supplier,"I apologize but I have to be vague here.

  
I am a vendor manager at a very large company that owns a lot of real estate.

My company hires a contractor (MC) to do maintenance and cleaning at our properties. We pay the contractor a flat fee and audit them to ensure that they are providing consistent and quality service. If the contractor fails a certain amount of questions on the audit then we will withhold some payment for that given month. 

One of my jobs is to conduct this audit with the MC manager at one of the companies’ properties. We have a new property manager (PM) at this property. During a large meeting recently the PM let me know that they do not agree with the scores I have given MC recently, and so I invited the PM to walk the property with the MC to identify areas for improvement. My property manager was very quiet during this walk, only asking the contractor a couple of questions and pointing out a few small areas for improvement. There was no recap to the walk because my PM had a meeting to attend. A couple of hours later my PM called me into their office to say that they had calculated the audit score to be very low (meaning the vendor would owe us some money) and basically insinuating that I should give them a low score. 

My boss has now messaged me saying that there is a gap and they want to discuss tomorrow. I have talked with my boss many times about this contractors performance. My boss has previously voiced that they believe the contractor is performing well, but that I should be auditing more harshly to try to promote even better service. Keep in mind that my boss and property manager have never actually provided any proof of failures for the audit. It seems as though my company is just trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of the contractor and are pushing hard on all vendor managers to give harsh scores.

So.... I feel as though I am about to be punished in some way if I give them a good (accurate) audit score this week. I don't want to give them a bad score because its morally wrong, and inaccurate through my perspective. I also don't want to get fired or looked at as too soft for my role.

1fzgre7,Could really use some advice on old employer vs. new.,"I am sorry if this is long, I will try to keep it as short as possible.  I started working for a company as a temp worker out of high school and as life changed that turned into a full-time position.  I worked my way through the various jobs, continued my education, and eventually ended up in a management position at a very unsteady time.  I applied for a Manager position, was turned down, and a more experienced individual was selected outside the organization.  During this time, the Plant Manager decided to leave the organization and the individual selected for the position I applied for was promoted to Plant Manager and I was promoted to the Manager position I initially applied for.  
Several months after these events the company sold to a private equity firm.  Structuring, personnel, and budgetary cuts/changes came fast.  People lost their jobs, third parties were added to fill the void, and projects got cut/pushed back.  People that had no knowledge of the industry were brought in to tell us what we were doing wrong.  
I was the manager for a year through all of these changes.  I loved the job, loved that I corrected a lot of wrongs that had been done by the previous manager, loved the people that worked for me, but the PE firm was adding a substantial amount of stress to my life.  A new job opportunity appeared, I applied, and was hired.
My new company is several orders of magnitude larger.  But I am starting in one of the lowest positions available.  I know career advancements are possible, but they seem very distant.  I took a significant pay cut for this position in a larger company and it is hard in the current economy.  My pay rate will increase slowly over the next two years to get closer to where I was, but it does hurt now quite a bit.
But, my old company just posted a Plant Manager position.  Continued structural changes led to my old boss being promoted and his position being vacant.  My dream was to work my through a company from the ground up and end up in a Plant Manager position.  If I wouldn’t have left when I did I am fairly confident I would already be in that position with my experience and education.
A member of management at my previous company informed me of the new Plant Manager position being posted tonight.  They believe I would be a great fit for it and that I should turn in an app.  I really would love to have that position but I also know the PE firm is looking to sell the company as soon as they deem it profitable and I don’t know how that will go.  I also know the company I am working for currently isn’t going anywhere for a very long time and is very secure, even if promotions are much, much slower.  The position I am currently filling is so, so slow and unsatisfying to me that it makes going back so tempting.  

I really would appreciate any advice anyone has to give.  Thank you.",THERAGINGCAUCASIAN,2,1.0,1,1728439223,2024-10-09 02:00:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fzgre7/could_really_use_some_advice_on_old_employer_vs/,10,2024

The location is in a terrible neighborhood. They have an armed guard there due to theft. This location is probably one of the worst looking that i’ve ever seen and this would be my 4th location i’ve worked/ trained at. It’s so disorganized. Their products are not organized, there’s no rhyme or reason for anything. Things are labeled per company policy where things should be kept and it’s clear that they just throw things wherever for no reason. I don’t understand how they work like that. The sales floor is an absolute mess. I witnessed a customer hit some kind of pipe in the back of the store. Customers run through and out the back door when stealing.

I was a nursing student for 2 years but due to some health reasons I stopped and shifted majors. Fast forward I'm working now as a front desk in a hotel but I've always wanted to go back and work in healthcare. I've worked as monitor tech before as well.

Also, just another background, I have double hip replacement and it's connected to my previous health issue that's why I didn't finish nursing. 

I wanted a long stable career. The type where I can buy a house in the future. I also live in SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA but I'm willing to relocate if needed. I initially wanted nursing but waitlist in CA is very long and I work FULL TIME and I'm self supporting so not working isn't really an option. Both the programs  I inquired is hybrid but the mri is 17 months and the first 9 months is purely online clinicals is only 3 days a week so I can work on that. Cardiac Sonography is 24 months and only 6 months is purely online. The last 6 months is full time internship so I have to stop working ☹️

1fzeeow,Overworked/Being Taken Advantage Of? Or That's Just How Life Goes? ,"*Made a new account to post this!*

I recently got hired to do marketing for a company. I'm fresh out of university, so I was excited and lucky to land a full-time job relatively soon after graduating. However, because I am a recent graduate, I make less than what the role typically starts at (keep that in mind). 

  
I make social media content to be posted daily (reels, stories, replying to comments, etc.), and run the YouTube account. All content creators are responsible for thinking of ideas, filming and then editing them yourself to be used for whatever platform. Currently, I manage 3 platforms, while another person hired recently manages only 1. 

  
On top of the daily tasks, new responsibilities get thrown my way without asking. Every time something new comes up, I get assigned to take on the project. If the other new person is assigned, then I'm also put on the project to collaborate. Sometimes it's a one-off task and other times it's something that will be reoccurring meaning I have to change my schedule which will cause me to be behind as I readjust. 

  
Whenever there's an issue as well with a collaborative task, the negative feedback/comments are always said to me as if it's solely my fault. Let's say there was an issue with the sound or the setup. When co-worker A asks if everything is okay they reply with ""Yeah sure"". When I ask the same question regarding the same project it's ""Yeah there's a problem with \_\_\_ and \_\_\_. Next time you need to....""

  
Although I don't agree with the content strategy, I do my best to get it done because that's what's asked of me. Anyone who works in social media knows that spamming your social platforms with a post every single day, sometimes multiple times a day, knows that it typically does more harm than good. With the other content creator having fewer responsibilities (and likely getting paid more than me) you would think that they would give them more things to do. Instead, everything gets passed my way and then when I end up falling behind schedule suddenly everyone is *so confused* as to why that could happen and the standard is I need to have everything prepared in advance - no excuses. 

  
Is my workplace taking advantage and overworking me or is this just the workplace reality and it won't get much better for me? Curious to know what others think.

I've been hired in a company to handle their training department and training offer. But the company has other departments such as research, consulting etc. Basically, before my arrival, knowledgeable people from other departments were initially requested to give trainings as trainers on top of their initial job.

They were promised that it would be a small part of their mission and that it would be temporary. Fast forward X months (or years?) later, I am here now and they are still required to give trainings because there are no better alternative than them (our topic are very technical and they know these topics better than most independent trainers on the market). 

Now, the training department is a somewhat successful (especially compared to the other departments these people belong to) so management is asking for the training activity to go on but these people don't want to invest more time or effort in it.

 I understand their point of view but my job requires to involve them in the activity to make it successful. I am not really sure on what course of action to follow. Should I just try to motivate them to willingly get more involved in the activity? Should I try to respect the deal of not involving them any further? 

Also, I sense that they may consider training as a ""lower"", less professionaly/socially rewarding activity than their usual one so maybe it is also playing against me.

I pivoted to environmental science & policy. I got 2 Masters degrees in 3 years at a prestigious university; it was a good deal because it was dual-degree program (discount!) and I got scholarships. I maintained a near-perfect GPA and learned subjects like land use planning, GIS, Stata, water resources mgmt, financial planning, & environmental problem solving.

1fzc66p,Chat GPT for cover letters? And general career advice for recent graduate.,"Also just any general advice would be so greatly appreciated from recruiters/ individuals that have had decent feedback from jobs.

I was recently laid off from a very good job for a large company. This was an entry level position and was my first ""career"" focused job. Prior I've only had experience working customer service/ serving and bartending. I graduated from college in 2023 with a bachelors degree in business management specialized in marketing and my last job fell under the department of creative marketing/ operations and was in the entertainment media sector (pretty easy to boil down where I worked based off news coverage of recent layoffs) 

Unfortunately my time was cut very short, I hadn't even worked there for a year. This was not reflective of my performance and I have had incredible feedback from team members and managers. I am really in a rut right now though and I'm unsure what my next steps will be. I've been applying to jobs left and right and since I've been doing so so frequently I've been using Chat GTP to write my cover letters. Based on the abundance of personalized information I put in prior to generate these letters, they are definitely unique to me still as the only reason why I'm using it is to formulate my words in a more professional manner, save time, and better connect my previous job experience to the one I'm applying for. Do you think that HR managers can detect that I'm using chat GPT? I've become increasingly worried as I've noticed that the more letters I write, the more redundant a lot of the words are like for instance the opening and closing. Granted this could also be justified to say these would simply be based off templates given to me during college, however I'm still concerned that these letters sound all the same across other applicants and I still do want to stand out. 

I'd appreciate general feedback on this as well: I know cold applying is just not enough for most jobs these days, and connections are great. But since I had such little time to build my experience and connections from my previous job, I don't really have much of this to benefit from. I've been exhausting nearly every option I have with the connections I have made. Some people in high positions (who's names I've gathered by luck or from my former manager) have my resume I guess for consideration but I still haven't heard any feedback after 2 weeks. I've been trying to connect with hr managers on LinkedIn, I have a recruiter who sent in at least one application for me, and I'm applying for jobs that are extremely entry level (0 years of experience which even these are incredibly hard to find). I'm just not sure what more I should do?? I'll do everything I possibly can at this point, I just want a job and I want to get my career going. I'm so excited and ready to work but it's been so challenging, and I fear that another year will go by and that make things even harder for me. Any advice at all would be so appreciated.

1fzb4dn,Trying to Quit Job of Two Months,"

Hi all! 

I've been in this temporary non-contract position within a healthcare organization for about 2 months. To put it plainly, it's been a shit-show. My position is relatively new, and because of that, there's been little to no training provided (i.e. no CLEAR written policies or procedures for me to follow for the position). I didn't know what I was walking into, but I was desperate to take anything since I'd been unemployed for 6 months. 


My first two weeks at this job were sitting at a desk running through training modules that didn't end up translating over to the work that I actually do now. No one was available for questions or training most of the time. I was left alone at a computer for hours and then someone would throw work on me that I had no idea how to tackle, and it's been an endless, stressful cycle ever since. My mental health was already fragile and it's only gotten worse working in this area within the organization. 


I was recently offered a new position (still within the organization but in a different department). It has full benefits, a better location, and work that better fits my skillset. The problem is, from speaking to coworkers and managers I work alongside, I'm hearing that my current position requires that I put in a full 28 days notice. Everyone has also stressed that they need the full months time to ""find another person to fill my position and train them."" 


The non-contract terms and conditions agreement states that employees must ""endeavour to provide 28 days notice"". This time period can be waived, but it's up to the employer to determine. I've emailed my manager to discuss a time to leave, but they're out of office until the end of this week. My intention was to put in two weeks as a formality, but try to end things earlier.


I think this is crap. I was hardly trained and the on-boarding process was incredibly rocky. I've been flying blind for two months, why should I be expected to give 28 days notice?

Although I don’t NEED a higher degree to continue to move up in my career it would help things move faster and I’m told it will result in higher raises etc. I went to school for CAD drafting and was considering starting a degree in construction management and using this program to take a few classes either at night or online to chip away at the degree.

I live in one of the most expensive counties in the country and I have a bachelors degree and need a car as well becuase mine doesn't work. I simply would need 2 jobs in order to sustain myself, however, planet fitness told me they were not going to be flexible on the hours based on policy despite the fact that many people would rather have the trainer in the morning (before work) and work from there. I also really dislike the job. I am super competitive in the military, love doing more than just being a trainer at PF which btw isn't ANYTHING like an actual trainer at another company.

1fz9s4d,"Considering leaving my first post-grad job, advice needed!","Hi, all! Hoping to get some good insight from those presumably more experienced than I am. 

I graduated from college in December 2022 and started my current job doing research in May 2023. It’s a really, really great job to have for someone of my age and experience level — there’s plenty of room to continue developing my skills. 

That said, everything else about it is terrible, and I have been absolutely miserable the last year. For some context, when I was interviewing for this position, I was warned by my (now current) supervisor that it was an extremely toxic environment to work in — but, I was desperate for stable employment and accepted the position anyway. 

Flashforward to now. Both my mental and physical health are suffering immensely, I don’t make enough to comfortably live without working a second side job, and even then, it’s tight. I’ve asked about a raise, and it’s out of the question. My supervisor explicitly told me during my latest performance review that she purposefully rated me lower than what she actually thinks — “you won’t get a raise if I rate you higher, and if anything, you’ll only get more responsibilities.” I’m not eligible for most benefits and I’ve grown resentful of my specific research field. The director is genuinely abusive in how she speaks and interacts with employees, and she essentially bullied me into doing a graduate degree, under the guise the company would pay for it — they did not, and I’m paying entirely out of pocket now. Being in that office environment in general makes me feel utterly miserable and unmotivated. 

I know that at this stage in my life, it’s not supposed to be “easy,” (and I don’t expect it to be), but I feel like there HAS to be something better than this. I have a decent amount of research experience between things I accomplished in college, what I’ve done through this job, and the connections I’ve made throughout. I’m just terrified of leaving a really good, stable position that I KNOW looks excellent for future prospects, especially in this economy. I’ve tried to push through the last couple months, but it’s not getting any better.

If I were to leave, I wouldn’t plan on putting in my two-weeks notice until I had another job definitively lined up. Part of me wants to try and keep sticking it out until I finish my graduate degree, but the thought of working here for another two years fills me with immense dread and pain. Any insight, advice, or recommendations would be so, so appreciated. Thank you all in advance!",jordanbelfort34,1,1.0,1,1728419421,2024-10-08 20:30:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fz9s4d/considering_leaving_my_first_postgrad_job_advice/,10,2024
1fz9ewf,Is healthcare administration the right career for me?,"Hello,
I was interested in a career in healthcare management but just wanted to get some insight from people in the career before I jumped in.
Some background: I graduated with a undergraduate degree in Biology and am looking to go to graduate school for a masters in Healthcare Administration. I was at a period where I was unsure where to go with my degree but have been heavily considering healthcare admin for a while and even saw a career counselor and kind of reinforced that I would enjoy that career.
Now I did have a couple of concerns: day to day job activities, salary, and work life balance.

For day to day job activities I understand that healthcare admin is a broad field so there can be different careers within this field that I would possibly enjoy more than others and/or may check off boxes for salary and work life balance. I did talk to a friends dad and he works in Revenue cycle and Health Information Management. He said that his section of healthcare admin is definitely better when it comes to work life balance but I did not ask him about salary because I felt it might be rude. This may be different for different companies but he said that healthcare administration is very specialized and there’s not too many jobs where you are overseeing a facility. 

For salary and work life balance, I generally was looking for a 90k-110k paying job. From what I’ve seen the average salary for a medical and health services manager is 110k$. Where I live in New Orleans the average salary is 105k$. However I wasn’t sure if this has a huge range and the average is just being brought up by people making hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

While I would be in school for a MHA degree I would be trying to start a fellowship because I have heard that is important to getting a job in the career. 
Any help is greatly appreciated

TL;DR:
I am looking for a career that pays well (90-110k, but of course wouldn’t complain about more) but I am also looking for a good work life balance. Is this doable? I feel like this could be a good career fit for me but I worry about balancing a good salary with a good work life balance.",Substantial_Home4900,1,1.0,0,1728418476,2024-10-08 20:14:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fz9ewf/is_healthcare_administration_the_right_career_for/,10,2024

1fz8cap,"Discovered my passion for teaching, but I'm in my final year of studying accounting - need career change advice! What do I do?","My mom is a teacher. She fell critically ill and required surgery, which would keep her away from work for over five months to fully recover. After some months on leave, the school considered laying her off since it was already the fifth month and she hadn't returned as promised (due to health complications). One of her colleagues, an old staff member, intervened on her behalf. The head teacher agreed to keep her position, but requested a substitute teacher due to the school's teacher shortage and existing applications for her job.

As I had just finished my second semester in my third year at university, I volunteered to assist in her class for the remainder of the term. They agreed, knowing I'd only teach when the main substitute teacher was busy with other work. Despite being unpaid, I ended up doing all the work for the term. Notably, I had no prior teaching experience, yet my supervising teacher consistently commended my quick adaptation to the school system. I spent three months at the school until my mother returned, then resumed my accounting studies.

However, I discovered I genuinely enjoyed teaching and wasn't bothered by the lack of payment. In contrast, I doubt I could work as an accountant without pay for even a month.

1fz7rca,Graphic desginer struggling with AI,"At the beginning, I'd like you guys to read it to the end. It's really important to me.

I'm 20 yo. I spent my whole life creating visual art; I just love it. When I was 15 years old, I decided that graphic design would be the perfect career for me—it connects art and new technologies, allows me to work wherever I want, and earns really good money. 

The last 4 years were serious to me - I was preparing for graphic design studies. It took me many, many hours to spend them on this instead of studying at high school. I always knew that life is about setting priorities.

In the meantime, I heard about AI. I even started to engage it in my job and learn it because I saw it as a revolutionary tool for the design world. Unfortunately, I'm not able to study at my dream university, but I still study graphic design at a pretty good one. I like going there, feeling passion for what I'm doing, but...

I've always thought about AI as a tool. I still won't have a problem finding a job if I just learn how to use AI during my projects to make myself more efficient. Now I'm still wondering if I wasted all that time. Was it a good choice? Just can't get this out of my head. It's especially hard because I spend so much time, energy, money, and passion for that field that if, after all of that, nobody needs my services, that will be painful and really problematic for me. Even more if I would spend even more years on my studies.

So I'd like to get some advice from people knowing the field better than me. Besides involving so many resources, should I completely turn around while I still can, and change my career path? Maybe for less interesting to me but really promising (like a lawyer). Maybe I should go for something connected with art, but less endangered by AI, like, for example, tattoo artists. Maybe just do what I'm doing because the Devil is not as black as he is painted.

Please give me some advice because I'm feeling lost but I know that might be one of the most important decisions in my life.",marek_____s,1,1.0,0,1728414281,2024-10-08 19:04:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fz7rca/graphic_desginer_struggling_with_ai/,10,2024

Are there any areas that I need to include and get additional clarity? I'd love to hear about your experiences in PE startups. 

What are your thoughts, suggestions, and feedback? Does this seem fair and a good offer?

Thank you in advance!!

**Compensation Plan for Chief Operating Officer (COO) – Startup**

The compensation plan for the COO will be structured to reward both the short-term sacrifice and long-term value creation, taking into consideration the company’s initial lack of revenue and the COO’s critical role in driving growth and securing the first customers.

**Stage 1: Sweat Equity Period (First 6 Months)**

During the first six months, the company is not generating revenue. The COO will not receive a salary during this time but will be compensated through equity and other benefits that reward commitment and performance.

**1. Equity Grant**

•Sweat Equity: 3-5% equity stake in the company, based on performance and milestones achieved. This equity is earned in exchange for the COO’s efforts to establish the company’s operational foundation, attract the first customers, and drive early-stage business development.

•Vesting Schedule: Equity will vest over a 4-year period, with a 1-year cliff. If the COO leaves within the first year, no equity is earned. After 12 months, 25% of the equity will vest, with the remaining 75% vesting monthly over the next 36 months.

•Performance Bonus Equity: Additional 1-2% equity based on achieving key performance indicators (KPIs) such as securing the first paying customer, establishing a full operational structure, or achieving defined revenue milestones.

**2. Milestone-Based Bonus**

•Customer Acquisition Bonus: Upon securing the first customer, the COO will receive an immediate one-time bonus (paid in equity or cash once the company is revenue-generating).

•Fundraising Milestone Bonus: If the COO plays a direct role in securing a successful fundraising round (Series A or other), a 0.5-1% equity bonus or a one-time cash bonus (once the funds are raised) will be awarded.

Stage 2: Transition to Paid Compensation (After 6 Months or Upon Securing Revenue/Funding)

Once the company begins to generate revenue or successfully closes a funding round, the COO will transition to a salary-based compensation model, with performance-based incentives. This will ensure that the COO’s efforts are rewarded as the company grows.

**1. Base Salary**

•Initial Salary: The COO’s initial salary will be below market rate but competitive within the startup landscape. Starting salary is $150,000 annually. This base will increase as the company scales and revenue grows.

•Salary Adjustments: Salary reviews will occur every 6 months, tied to company revenue milestones. After achieving $1 million in revenue, the salary will be increased by 10-20%. Exact amount to be determined by sole discretion of CEO.

**2. Performance-Based Bonus**

•Revenue Milestones: Bonuses tied to achieving certain revenue benchmarks:

o$500,000 in revenue: $10,000 cash bonus.

o$1 million in revenue: $25,000 cash bonus.

o$5 million in revenue and over: $50,000 cash bonus.

•Profitability Bonus: Once the company reaches profitability, a percentage of the company’s profits will be allocated to the COO as an annual bonus, 5-10% of net profits. Exact amount to be determined by sole discretion of CEO.

**Stage 3: Long-Term Compensation**

As the company scales and achieves its revenue goals, the COO’s compensation will evolve to reflect the increasing demands and responsibilities of the role.

**1. Additional Equity Grants**

•Ongoing Equity Grants: As the company raises more rounds of funding or scales significantly, the COO will be eligible for additional equity grants based on performance. These additional equity awards will vest over time and be tied to new milestones, such as expanding into new markets, securing strategic partnerships, or growing revenue beyond a certain threshold.

**2. Profit-Sharing**

•Profit Sharing Plan: Once the company reaches a stable profit margin, the COO will participate in a profit-sharing plan that allocates 5-7% of annual profits as a bonus, ensuring long-term incentives for continuing to grow the company’s success.

**3. Stock Options and Exit Strategy**

•Stock Options: Upon achieving certain company valuation benchmarks or in anticipation of an exit strategy (IPO, acquisition, etc.), the COO will be granted additional stock options, which will vest according to the company’s exit timeline.

•Exit Bonus: Should the company be acquired or go public, the COO will receive a significant exit bonus based on the company’s valuation at the time of sale or IPO. This bonus will be structured as 2.5% of the acquisition value or a flat cash bonus based on equity holdings. Exact amount to be determined by sole discretion of CEO.

**Summary of Compensation Plan:**

**1.Sweat Equity (First 6 Months):**

o3-5% equity stake. Exact amount to be determined by sole discretion of CEO.

o4-year vesting schedule with a 1-year cliff.

oAdditional performance-based equity (1-2%).

**2.Milestone Bonuses:**

oCustomer acquisition and fundraising bonuses (equity or cash).

**3.Salary (Post-Revenue/Funding):**

oInitial salary: $150,000.

oSalary increases tied to revenue milestones.

**4.Performance-Based Cash Bonuses:**

oRevenue and profitability bonuses (up to $50,000).

**5.Long-Term Compensation:**

I am a High School Librarian at an International Baccalaureate (IB) school, where I manage a collection utilized by several hundred students. In addition to my librarian responsibilities, I am the sole Coordinator for a critical IB program, overseeing both faculty and students.

I am very comfortable in my positions now and I really enjoy my benefits but I feel that I don't have a clear career goal at the moment. I am merely curious to see what other possibilities are out there - in librarianship or management (though I am not sure if I would qualify for such a role). 

I am not sure if I want to go back to school for my Masters or not because I am unsure of what career path I might like with the skills I have already obtained.

1fz5pqz,Should I leave my first job after college when I have only been working here for 4 months ,"Hello, I am a new grad that just got their first big boy job back in June. I have been with the company for 4 months and at the beginning I was excited. I was getting paid more than what was expected for someone newly graduated in my degree and the commute was not bad as this was an area I was familiar with.  However It dawned on me after 1 month that I hate my job. The environment has been overall toxic. I was mislead on who I would be reporting to after being told something different during the interview process.  The person that I am now reporting too is a BIG asshole and no one at the office likes him, he's even been banned by security to come into the office but still comes anyway and nothing is done. What  I was signed on to do was just forced on me with no training or guidance and I am constantly belittled by my boss when I dont complete something on time or something doesn't turn out the way they were expecting. We had two manger rolls get fired back to back during my time here and  they did not have time to train the 2 new supervisors that we hired in my department who have no experience in the department. We have been losing customers left and right due to putting metrics first and not the customer. Everyone seems to hate the company and also thinking of jumping ship. I currently had an interview today with a new company and they liked me a lot and want to do a in person interview at their facilities.  I am now second guessing myself and wondering if I should leave here and pursue this new company or just keep putting up with this for a year or until I get fired whichever comes first.

1fz5jas,Should I Sign a 1-Year Bond with a 3-Month Notice Period? Fresh Grad SQL Developer in Pune Seeking Advice," Hey everyone,

I could use some advice on a job situation I’m currently in.

I graduated in 2022 with a non-IT background, and this is my first job as a SQL developer at a small company in Pune, India. However, most of the work isn't aligned with what I expected, and I feel it may not be the best fit for my long-term career goals. They've now offered me a formal contract with a salary in the range of ₹15,000 to ₹20,000, with an in-hand salary around ₹10,000 to ₹12,000.

The concern is: they want me to sign a 1-year bond, and the contract includes a 3-month notice period. This means I’d be locked in for 15 months if I agree.

While I’m keen to gain experience as a fresher, I’m unsure if the pay and commitment are worth it, given my reservations about the role. The combination of a low salary, bond, and long notice period makes me hesitant.

Is this kind of bond and notice period common for fresher roles in Pune? Would you recommend signing in this case, or should I look for other opportunities? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",Sleeplessjunkie41,1,1.0,0,1728408726,2024-10-08 17:32:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fz5jas/should_i_sign_a_1year_bond_with_a_3month_notice/,10,2024
1fz58y9,Should I stay or should I go?,"Hi all, 
To keep this from being a million pages long, I’m 22M with an associate degree in Supply Chain Management and Logistics. 
I’m currently taking online classes for my bachelor’s degree. 
I have a full time job as a Purchasing Associate. I really like my job because it has a fair bit of down time, and on MWF, when I get to work from home, I can get homework/studying done in my spare time. However, my issue is that I’m quite underpaid. I was hired with little to no experience, but I’ve progressed very quickly and handle some of our larger clients. Our company is pretty open about how poorly we’re doing overall, so when I asked for a raise, it was well received but just shot down due to our current lack of budget. On top of that, I feel like a robot. All I do is create purchase orders in SAP and then go home to accounting homework or whatever class I’m taking, and then do it all again. I’ve been here since January 8, and I’m getting “burnt out”. I’ve changed majors a few times and wasted a lot of time trying to work full time instead of prioritizing school. It’s one of my biggest regrets. 
My qualm is this: should I keep this job because it’s slow paced and allows me to get all my homework done and work remotely three days a week. 
I live with my girlfriend in a pretty small, but nice apartment. We make do and are even able to go out to eat every now and then. I just recently saved enough to buy a PS5, but I am still on my parents insurance, phone bill, and other petty payments. My gf and I pay for the whole apartment, bills, groceries, gas, and everything. So by no means do I STRUGGLE. 
However, this job is genuinely just soul sucking. It’s so boring and dull that I can’t focus and it’s starting to cause me to make mistakes. I’ve never been a thrill seeker and I even pass out when I see blood (vasovagal syncope), but I can’t sit in front of a screen like this for the rest of my life with kablooming myself. 
I COULD move home and try to finish school more quickly, but I honestly don’t want to move back to my home town despite living my parents. I also really don’t want to step away from school. I sometimes wish I had never changed my major from kinesiology (I wanted to be a physical therapist). 
Any response is welcome. I hope I provided enough context, but if not I’m happy to answer questions. Thank you in advance for your responses. 

TLDR: 22m burnt out from online school and full time work. Job is mostly the issue. Should I quit my easy, but underpaid job? ",RentalFerret69,1,1.0,0,1728408015,2024-10-08 17:20:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fz58y9/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/,10,2024

1fz3iax,To Jump or Not to Jump,"Long story short, I've been offered a pre-sales consultant role internally for a big software company where I currently work as a project engineer. Company renowned for not paying overly well but great perks. (M26) No kids, renting, happy to take risks. 

The project engineer role currently consists of implementing and configuring APIs for 3rd parties that work with our system, along with having to understand networking, databases, infrastructure, software implementation, website deployments, and security. The work is challenging but fun when successfully delivered, and I’m always learning new products and technologies. = Base £38k, bonus/OT £4k (senior position opening in the next 6-12 months with a base of £47k).

The new pre-sales role is something new and interesting. It would really push me socially, which I feel I've fallen off since working from home over the last three years. I'd be helping the account managers scope out what's possible from a technical perspective, as well as assisting with demos and Bid/CCN responses. All for the product that I've been deploying and configuring over the last three years = Base £40k, OTE £50k (next step would be account manager, base £50k, OTE £100k+).

I love both teams – the one I currently work for, and the sales team are always good fun on a night out and great to work with.

The issue is that the sales role doesn't seem lucrative enough to really make the jump. The product we have is excellent, but I understand there'll be a lot of repeating myself, and I also know how cutthroat it would be if I were to take this all the way to becoming an account manager, etc.

1fz2yrh,Help me decide 😪,"
I’m new to the American job market and have received two offers, but I’m struggling to decide between them. I have experience in logistics and interviewed for an inventory control clerk position at a well-regarded company. They offer great benefits, including paid PTO, health, dental, vision, life insurance, and a 401(k). It seems like a nice place to work, and they genuinely care about their employees, even offering programs to support education. However, I’m concerned that the role might involve a lot of warehouse work, like counting pieces and handling boxes. On the plus side, it’s not an environment like Amazon, where employees have limited breaks, and my manager seems supportive.

The second job is as an office assistant, which would allow me to interact with various departments, potentially leading to opportunities in IT which is what I want to do in the future, the job is from 8-5 . However, I was hired through a staffing agency, and I’m unsure about the benefits they offer. When I asked about benefits they said that I will get benefits when I be hired on . The salary for this position is also $2 less per hour, but I really like the people I’d be working with and the company is also pretty big with a lot of opportunities to grow . 

I’m trying to decide which job would be the better fit for me, should I go for the benefits or for the experience, it’s really hard to find a job with good pay when you are an immigrant and your English is not 100% perfect.

By that time i will be 45-47yrs old! I will have to compete with younger generations.

1fz1d7x,Need serious advice guys. Please help (kindly read it all if u can),"Hello people,
I'm a 23 yo (M), Mechanical engineering undergrad, Batch of 2024 currently at home, job hunting and trying to actively upskill.

I'll just put it this way, bluntly; at 23, I'm still unsure in what direction I wanna take my life career wise. Do I have an interest in my degree? Yes sure do but it's not something I'd like to do long-term. I just cannot imagine myself staying in the engineering domain in general for a long period.

I've been applying for jobs since June, when I got my results. Every single interview I've appeared for (atleast 12 till now; from trainee to junior engineer positions), I've managed to clear all rounds till the very end only to be ghosted by the talent acquisition team. No matter how interested the higher ups seem in my skillset, answers and abilities, I'm unable to make the cut. 

SOMETHING TO NOTE: Specific to my degree domain, I do not wish to pursue a career in Design engineering and Simulation. Im skilled in CAD-CAM softwares but they're just not my interest area. 

I'd like to take up a role which is more of a management position, even as a trainee or intern to kickstart. I don't mind taking a significant paycut at the start either. I'm at a point of no return and I do not wish to compromise any further than I already have when it comes to my career. 

I possess immaculate communication, deliberation and pitching skills, which also happens to be my interest area. Taking that into consideration, I'm also inclined towards sales and marketing roles. 
However, my degree doesnt give me the required skills to be shortlisted for such jobs.
Some other areas that interest me are Supply chain management and Project management ( planning to pursue CAPM if I don't find a job by the end of October)

It's been 4 months now and every passing day leaves me unable to answer the future interview question ""How would u explain the gap in your professional career"" 

I really am clueless as pursuing something completely different literally means having wasted 4 years of engineering for nothing. Any suggestions and experienced advice would be welcome. 

I do not have any parental or peer pressure as such but sitting unproductively at home eats me inside out everyday, coz I can't be productive beyond a certain point

TLDR: Rant my a fresh graduate. Help a brother out if u can please

I don’t drive, and the hotel was separated from the training location by two freeways, so I couldn’t walk. There was no public transit. I had to take Uber twice a day. 

My hotel didn’t have a microwave in my room, and there was no free breakfast in the morning, so I had to eat every meal out. 

For two weeks of out-of-town training, I spent $440.

For reasons I’ve discussed in other posts, I quit that job when I wasn’t allowed to use any of training I’d been required to have, which meant I wasn’t allowed to use standard procedure, which made the job impossible to do. 

I submitted my reimbursement forms as instructed more than a month ago. The manager responsible replied to me two weeks later, asking me if I really had to spend that much. So I resubmitted all of my forms and receipts again, along with explanations about why each expense was necessary. 

It’s now been two weeks and no one has responded. I sent an email asking for an update last week, and I haven’t gotten a response. I don’t have this guy’s phone number, and I couldn’t call anyway, because my phone service is shut off for missed payments. I need that money back. How long does this typically take?

1fyz1qj,Started a new job today and I’m honestly shocked,"So I started a new software dev role today, it’s a small company (less than 10 employees), but I’m just shocked at a few things:


- There’s basically no process for anything business related. It’s made onboarding unnecessarily difficult, as well as any official business matters clear as mud.
- We’re provided an official Office 365 account, but for whatever reason most people seem to communicate via personal gmails?? I’ve setup both outlook and teams and it appears neither really get used.
- As a software developer, there’s zero process or formalities. The few developers on the team just blindly committing directly into the master branch, if they’re committing at all (quite often it’s clear they’d do a release and commit later). Releases are manual despite using Azure DevOps and being deployed on Azure App Services.
- Projects created within the last couple of years are using .NET versions that were old 10 years ago.
- I’ve been informed that there have been instances in the past where a release has gone badly, and since they don’t know what’s gone into a release, they’ve had to spend ages figuring it out.

Now, as a senior developer on the team (though granted just started today), I can’t believe how poorly everything is run.

I don’t want to come in and drop explosives, but I feel like there needs to be way more structure and accountability. I’m conscious it’s a very small company, but I don’t feel like that’s an excuse for the abhorrent spaghetti code I’m reading right now, or the seemingly zero processes when it comes to software development, or even using personal Gmail’s as a method of communicating official business matters when we’re provided an outlook email with teams. I also definitely don’t want to feel like I’m overstepping in my first week.

However, I do want to begin pushing things in the right direction, and that starts with communicating. Ignoring the lack of business procedures, it’s pretty clear the non-technical people (which happen to be those at the top) understand quite how bad the technology has been looked after.

To make matters more difficult, the developer whose job it was to look after the technology, is still at the company and has been for years.",Head_Inside_3758,22,0.9599999785423279,32,1728391925,2024-10-08 12:52:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fyz1qj/started_a_new_job_today_and_im_honestly_shocked/,10,2024

1fyw4ge,"Currently in Digital Marketing, thinking of changing careers to Chemistry.","I'm 27M who's been practicing digital marketing since I graduated in 2018 (6 years ago). I want to shift to a career in Chemistry because throughout my working life, I don't have any drive to advance my career, I don't like how my job only helps businesses outside the country, and I wanna settle down as a Chem teacher and contribute to my immediate community by giving kids a chance at a better education in the pure sciences.



I'm at a point in my reflection where I bought some e-books and am trying to read the concepts to see if I'm still capable of studying such a complex subject in my age. The next step is to research which schools offer a BS Chem program for a low tuition fee. I understand that a college grad is no longer eligible for free tuition in state universities (this is for high school grads only).



What are my thoughts about the shift?

(1) It's pretty fckin scary. What if I make the jump and couldn't make it after all? My best bet would be to go back to digital marketing and pray that 1-2 years of no work-related experience won't put off employers.

(2) Which school would accept me at this point? I'm 6 years out of college and my grades are dismal (I failed one class and shifted from engineering to management). I'm afraid that my college grades won't make the cut for most schools which have grade requirements for admission.



Here are my questions for you guys:

- Has anyone ever made a jump from a non-science to a science field before and share their experience?

- Any schools you can recommend that offer BS Chem, have relatively low tuition and not-so-hard admission requirements?

- Any tips on how to prepare myself mentally before deciding whether to make the jump or not?



I'm more than happy for your follow-up questions as well.

1fyvniv,My Counter offer experience and what was yours? ,"Put in my resignation and was asked to look over a counter offer but then asked me for my number? Has anyone accepted a counter offer and been happy? What is your experience 

I recently got an amazing offer and accepted the position. I let my boss know and he said they didn't want me to leave and could they do anything to keep me. I really didn't want to stay part of the reason for leaving is dealing with his ups and downs and disorganization of his management plus the pay. I agreed to hear the counter offer though. They came back saying they needed me to provide a number first. I never really wanted a counter in the first place but I was open to hear them out. 

I decided it wasn't for me and that I wanted the new position and didn't pursue any further counter or give them a number. Has anyone encountered this? From what I have read on here it's usually not favorable to take a counteroffer and people end up leaving the job any way later due to being dissatisfied. This other position is exactly what I am looking for so I'm fine with my choice but I don't understand wanting to offer me more but not being able to give a number.

 How do you even respond without it seeming like too high of a number. Just curious how someone else would have handled it if they wanted to stay and has anyone accepted a counter offer and been happy with the decision?",fitknit97,7,0.8999999761581421,33,1728379444,2024-10-08 09:24:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fyvniv/my_counter_offer_experience_and_what_was_yours/,10,2024

I am a professional Firefighter in north Texas and I have been for 5 years(24 hours on, 48 hours off schedule). While working as a fireman, I also have worked many part time jobs on my off days, including working as a moving crew foreman for a moving company(12 years on and off), working as a trailer mechanic/truck accessory installer/welder/fabricator for a shop(2 years), and running my own handyman, small construction, and home repair business(2.5 years). Some of the reasons I am seeking a career change are the pay, being gone from my family, the politically charged environment, and the city I work for treats the FD terribly. I would love to find a career that both pays well and allows me to be home every night with my family. I love to work with my hands, so I don't think a desk job is for me. I'm not against computer work, and actually a job that was half ""field work"" and the other half being computer work, reports, etc. sounds awesome. I would like whatever field I enter, to be something that wiill allow me to find a job anywhere, as my wife and I plan to move out of our current city soon. Also, I would like whatever I pursue to be something that I could possibly branch out and start my own business down the road. And not a must at all, but a job with a company vehicle would be great as well. I appreciate any advice anyone can give me. Sorry this has been so long.

1fysbxp,"History of job hopping, not been too much of an issue historically, but now just need help knowing how best to handle it with my current job hunt.","Looking for assistance regarding the best way to market myself to potential employers given my background, especially my recent background. 

I initially trained up in IT, after 4 years of almost no pay increase I needed a change. I was also no longer sold on IT being my best career path. I landed on driving jobs for a supermarket chain whilst studying urban planning. After 1.5 years of studies I decided urban planning wasn't for me and went into programming instead. To supplement my programming interests I went back into an IT helpdesk role. This role was good, however after a while I opted to return to delivery driving whilst still studying programming as it was easier to study alongside. I returned back to this IT helpdesk role after a year of the delivery driving as they had a full time role available which I was now interested in. The return was great, however I was offered a role at an MSP, very close to home and sounded too good to pass up. I stopped studying programming at this stage and pivoted to GIS which felt like a good in-between for IT and urban planning. I studied this and landed a job in this field. 

Once in the role I didn't feel comfortable at all, I felt in over my head. It was more corporate than I was used to and full of meetings and suits and large projects for large organisations rather than day to day IT support for small businesses. I scared myself away, ran in the opposite direction completely to disability support work. I thought support work would be a good fit due to past volunteer work I'd undertaken. I studied and eventually got a role, the company I did GIS for was incredibly accommodating throughout. The support work job I landed was good initially but then I lost a lot of hours and started to see it wasn't great for where I was at in my life right now, also I realised volunteering doesn't translate at all into paid 'helping others' type work and just didn't really suit the kind of person I am. I returned to the GIS role where I still am now, however they can only offer me casual work and at this stage they can't offer me any hours at all. 

I have decided to continue a career in GIS, however also looking at IT roles. Trying to figure out how to make my past history work for me rather than against me. In particular the support work component is something I'm not sure about. I have been omitting it from my CV entirely but am wondering if I should include it, it's been hard to talk about my GIS role without mentioning the impact my support work stint has had on it. I thought it may be better to be honest about it and say it's helped me realise that GIS is the direction I want to take in my career. If applying for an IT job I could say I felt conflicted about GIS, tried support work which didn't work out for me so have taken casual work back in GIS until I can secure an IT role to continue to grow my IT career.

**tl;dr:** History of job hopping, most recently to disability support work but looking for how best to market myself in GIS or IT roles, in resume, cover letter and during interviews.

Compensation has been good, I am currently making over $250K this year. Unfortunately, I just lost the additional responsibilities (due to some restructuring). 

The problem is that the company is very toxic. It’s an unwritten rule that you always have to be available for work: 7 days a week, holidays, etc. 

Also, I do not 100% get along with my manager. We have had our differences and I don’t see them helping me progress more in my career. However, I believe my managers boss might help me. But I’m not sure. 


I’m slightly frustrated that the additional responsibilities were taken away. I took this extra work to grow, but I am in the same place I started. They are saying that now earning potential will change and not be capped so I have the opportunity to make more money.

1fyrn55,MBA or JPMC?,"MBA or JPMC?

Need help deciding, do I take a role as a VP at JPM or pursue my MBA?

Background:

I’m 24, graduated college in 2022, and have just over 2 years work experience. I currently work at a fintech as an implementations specialist working with large financial institutions. My plan was to apply for an MBA and switch into consulting, I’ve known I don’t want to stay in finance and consulting really interests me. However, I was just offered a VP role as a back office operations manager at JP Morgan in the Corporate and Investment Bank.

Here are some of my questions:

1. Given I only have 2 years FTE and would matriculate with 3, should I just delay anyways?

2. The goal is MBB, how much will experience as a VP at JPM matter to them?

3. As my name might suggest, dream school is Tuck, but I’m planning on applying to all the T-15. If I wait 2-3 years, how much will this add to my application?

4. I don’t have any “name brands” on my resume. My undergrad is a no name, and my company, while I do work with big name clients, we are unknown. How much does the “brand” matter when applying to MBA and MBB, or just in general?

5. Pursuing an MBA has always been a goal of mine, if I take this role will it be worth it for me to go back and get one? Some have told me going back to get my MBA could take me back in my career if I leave a VP position. From what I can see many companies recruit MBAs for the associate/senior consultant levels in finance and consulting, I don’t see many recruiting at the VP/Director/EM levels. Do you think I’d be going back down by getting my MBA?

1fyqwm0,How do I explain getting fired from/leaving my last 2 roles to potential recruiters?,"My career started in 2018 after college and I've held several positions since then, mostly contracts. In 2023 I finally landed a full time role and have been there for over a year. I sensed management was toxic and so did my other longer tenure coworkers so they left. I stayed, but unfortunately when I started voicing some concerns it turned into having a target on my back and the environment started to directly affect me. I ended up going on FMLA and right after I announced my intentions of taking a leave, my manager put me on a PIP so that when I return I would be returning to a PIP. I don't intend on going back because the pay is pretty low and opportunity cost to my mental health would be bad when I've worked so hard to overcome in the past months.

The previous job before that (6 month gap), I was a contractor and had some concerns with management and the job was a deal desk job that wasn't the best fit for me personally. I got fired from that contract after 4 months because I brought up some concerns with a manager and I guess the way I brought it up wasn't very tactful.

How do I explain to recruiters what happened in my last 2 roles without seeming like a red flag? For the contract positions I could just say that I was traveling and interested in short term fixed contracts. However I finally got a full time job and I was hopeful this would last 3-4 years, but unfortunately that's not the case. So now I will have to explain yet another gap in my career.

1fyqpzh,Should I try to negotiate in this situation?,"I’m in my late 20s, five years of relevant experience. I believe I match ~80% of the requirements listed in the job description for the position I was just offered. 

It’s already a ~50% pay increase over what I make now, so it would be devastating to miss out on this, especially considering I find the job itself very interesting and I like the company a lot. 

I’d be asking for about 5% on top of what was already offered if I chose to counter. I’m just terrified of them rescinding the offer. I know it’s an extremely rare circumstance, but missing out on that 5% seems like a much more pleasing pill to swallow than missing out on the the 50% already in play.

1fyq2dz,Girlfriend needs help finding roles that fit her experience ,"Hey all,

Looking to get some advice for my girlfriend who just recently got fired from her engineering job. Why she got fired isn’t super relevant to this post, but suffice to say it wasn’t entirely her fault and not relevant to her engineering ability/ experience. 

I’d like to get some advice so I can better understand how to help her. 

Quick summary:
- She has an electrical engineering degree from a state school
- 5 years total experience as an engineer 
- Her last position was for 4 years as a NASA contractor working on structural analysis of large unique structures using 3D imaging (its so unique that it may dox her to explain further)
- She worked her first year at a nuclear power plant doing various entry level design approvals 
- She wants to pivot more to software roles and machine learning but doesn’t have specific software development experience 
- We’re from a city that without naming it, is home to a lot of engineering jobs

She’s in a tough spot bc her engineering experience is focused around a very specific kind of test engineering that isn’t found anywhere else in industry. As I understand it she was closer to a technician working on maintaining and ensuring smooth operation of this specific highly complex structural testing system. And a highly specialized subsystem at that. 

I know she knows how to code and she’s done some software stuff. Probably like short scripts and programs in Matlab and C++ but not actual software development. She wants to pivot to a more software, and especially machine learning. She’s doing a course on it. 

What I’m trying to understand is how much will employers weigh her existing experience when applying to software roles? Will they count 5 years closer to 2-3 years or 0. 

And what kind positions would be a good fit with her experience? 

Happy to clarify things further. I would really like to not dox her though and so I may reply in a DM to avoid that.

1fypxid,My skills are limited and my degree feels useless,"Hi everyone,

I'm typing on my mobile, so please excuse the format. I graduated from college last year with a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience, intending to go to medical school. However, after working in healthcare during COVID, I realized that this was not the path I wanted for myself. Specifically, I was a nursing assistant.

After that, I took an entry-level research job, but it was draining and lonely, involving eight hours on my feet in unpleasant working conditions. I am currently a receptionist, which is not a difficult position, but I find it unsatisfying and not mentally stimulating at all. On the plus side, the benefits and hours are great.

I’m worried that I’m becoming complacent and comfortable, not fully utilizing the potential of my college degree. I'm fine with not becoming a neurologist or going to school for five more years, but I know I am capable of more than being a glorified greeter.

I’m open to any advice or even just words of encouragement. I know the job market is tough right now, and I should be grateful to have a job, but is it wrong that I want more?

Thank you in advance, and have a wonderful night!

1fyorxq,Considering careers and roles outside engineering,"I am currently in my senior year studying electrical engineering at a US university, and I have been questioning if an engineering career is truly right for me. Since I am almost done with my studies, I still intend to finish my degree, but the main concern is after I graduate, and if I should get a regular engineering job or pursue another (possibly related) field instead.

These past years in college gaining further experience, I figured that robotics may be the best area for me to continue pursuing. This past summer, I did an internship in business development, and now I am doing a robotics internship for this academic year. With this internship, however, I am doubting if a career in robotics, or even anything technical within engineering is truly for me. 

This could partially be imposter syndrome, but in both this internship and in previous student engineering jobs, I often feel confused in meetings or when I read about technology and projects in my department, and I often feel little desire to read extra about these technologies. Furthermore, I feel as if the structure and nature of many technical engineering jobs is not quite fit for me. I have decent skills with public speaking and making presentations, and I often enjoy being more social and interacting with people as well (my personality type is ENFP-T if that helps).

For some background, as I was late in high school, my biggest interests were in music and dance, and I almost would have chosen to study those, however, my family recommended not to study that due to low pay and security for careers in the arts. Furthermore, I was good at math and had experience with coding in the past, so I ultimately chose to study electrical engineering. I still was not fully sure what I wanted to do when I made this choice, but I knew that EE was a field with potential in many areas, with the main areas of interest to me being robotics, clean energy, and biomedical engineering. However as said, I eventually settled with robotics.

With that said, what career trajectory should I take given my situation? What areas could I explore that still have potential for good pay and work-life balance? Should I get a regular engineering job after a Bachelor’s as I originally intended, or should I pursue another career path sooner rather than later? I believe my skillset could still be fitting in a more business-oriented role rather than a technical one, but I am not sure whether that would require me to have further education, although I would definitely consider an MBA if it is helpful.

In short, if anyone has a similar problem, get along with your team and deny everything. 

HR scheduled a last second meeting with me and my manager today. When I joined, HR told me that they had an on-going investigation concering me being racially offensive. The HR person showed me the evidence, which was actually multiple recordings from around the same time frame, and let me watch them. They then started citing company policy, saying this behavior doesn't align with company values, and that there is zero-tolerance for it in or outside of work.

Once they let me speak, I told HR that an ex-friend was attempting to get me fired, that I never said those words, and that it's likely AI synthesized. HR gave me a weird look, but they ended off the meeting and told me there'd be a follow up meeting later.

I ended up getting called into a second meeting at the end of day. HR told me that they concluded the investigation and that there'd be no action taken against my employment, but that I do have to take sensitivity training due to company policy.

After that, I talked to a a co-worker outside of work and he told me that HR reached out to everyone on the team individually to ask if I have said anything offensive during work hours. I haven't and everyone on my team said so. Same co-worker also told me that HR was probably ready to fire me since they scheduled the meetings last second, which never happens.",FaithlessnessGold226,998,0.8399999737739563,469,1728351613,2024-10-08 01:40:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fyok29/hr_confronted_me_about_old_recording_of_me_saying/,10,2024

1fynau2,Employer Offer Scam,"**Could someone let me know if this is a scam or not?**

Recently, I got a job offer from a SEIT service provider as an IEP Coordinator. It is one of my highly preferred job roles and something I'm passionate about. However, I have this nagging feeling that the company is a either scam or a complete nightmare to work for.

**Application**

I sent an application on Indeed and they responded a day later. I received a video interview offer that would take place at 5 PM. However, I made it clear in my application that I was only available between 8 AM to 4 PM. I still accepted it because it wasn't a major deal. A few days before the interview, I receive a new MS Teams invite (in my email messages) for a new interview time of 3 PM. I guess it was nice of them to be considerate to my request, but emailing me first with a typed message would have been better than suddenly changing it without any prior notice. What if I didn't see the email and waited for them at 5?

On Indeed, they have only a handful of reviews and most of them are 4/5 stars, praising the company. The single 1-star review is commented by the company that it is a fake reviewer. Google has only one review where they similarly praise the company. Most companies, whether good or bad, have a handful of mid and low reviews no matter how good the workplace actually is.

**Interview**

Immediately, the video session is to a rough start. The two people (CEO and a director) are nice but their mic doesn't work (should have tested it beforehand) so they move to another room and share the same camera. The questions they ask are fairly standard and having done many interviews, I handle them alright.

When I'm given the chance to give questions of my own, I ask them what a typical day at the office looks like. The CEO eventually tells me about how she is a workaholic and does 7:30 to 5 on most days. Is she implying that I'm expected to work these hours too? 👀 She is pretty warm and friendly but my intuition, in this job market, is finding it to be really suspicious when other interviewers were all neutral or cold.

On a side note: I can't find either of their LinkedIn's either.

**Offer**

A week later, I receive an offer letter from the company. Cool, but the unusual thing is that it's not from the HR person who I communicated with on Indeed, but the CEO. The wording isn't formal, like the usual ""*Dear Mr. Heyyoguy123, we would like to extend a formal conditional offer letter at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.*""

Instead, she says: ""*Hello Heyyoguy123, I hope you are doing well. It was a pleasure meeting you virtually last week. Please see attached employment proposal and benefits package. Please let me know if you have any questions*."" (the employment description and benefits PDF's were attached below)

Did she forget to ask me to accept the offer first? Here, she's just assuming that I'll take the job. It's also written like a college intern who never worked in a corporate setting before. All of my previous offer letters were far more professional and properly formatted, like the typical letter you can think of.

**Scam???**

In conclusion, something seems really off. My feeling is that it's either a scam or an absolute nightmare to work at. What do you think?",Heyyoguy123,1,1.0,3,1728347826,2024-10-08 00:37:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fynau2/employer_offer_scam/,10,2024

I’ve discovered that I thrive more as an individual contributor. I’ve successfully automated several processes within my team, and for the first time, I genuinely enjoyed my work. I’ve come to understand that I prefer roles where I can focus more on hands-on tasks, with fewer dependencies on others and less constant communication.
I have worked as an analyst in my internship or working student positions and naturally I feel like that would be a good entry point.

However, I feel completely lost in the current job market. I’m unsure how to pivot toward tech/analyst roles, as most seem to require significant prior experience. At the same time, I know I don’t want to continue in my current position, which I’ve been stuck in for around three years now.

Have you ever experienced something similar in your career journey? I would really appreciate it if you could share any advice or stories from your own experience.

Thank you in advance for any guidance or suggestions.

1fyl5s1,Returning to work after 5 years looking after my parents,"Hey everyone. So I (F29, in the UK) have spent the last 5 years looking after my parents. During that time I've worked multiple 'gig' jobs from club hostess, model, catering, events assistant, children's entertainer, dog sitter etc to earn an income and work flexibly around the ever changing demands of looking after two high needs individuals- across two households as they are separated- as well as tackling my own disability, mental health issues and a lawsuit (I've had a lot on my plate that's for sure!).

The time has finally come when I can recentre my working life, and focus on having (sadly only really just 'starting) a career. The trouble is I've got no idea how to market myself. I'm not a fresh faced early 20s graduate, but I don't want to settle for just any role. I want a real shot at catching up with my peers which means shooting for a good role/salary. I just don't know how to market myself and the experience I've had these last few years.

My background is in psychology and I was on a graduate programme in social work before I had to give up to look after my parents/the pandemic took hold. 

I'm incredibly ambitious, academically always did well, I'm adaptable and have been described as a 'multipotentialite' or 'multipassionate generalist' in the way that I can get interested in just about anything and I tend to be good at whatever I try (granted, some things take a little longer than others but I'm a hard worker and take pride in what I do). The fear of rejection and the uncertainty is keeping me from taking chances. Any tips or advice? Anyone returning to or entering the world of work in their late 20s or older that felt so lost got any words of encouragement?

1fyl1hk,Changing a career from a medical office assistant ,"I'm a 29 year old woman. I was born in Poland, and moved to Canada 5 years ago. (I'm a permanent resident). I have a bachelor's degree in English studies (completed in Poland). I feel stuck at my current job, and would love a change. I have no idea what to do though. I started working as a medical office assistant when I first moved here, as there were not many job options. I used to work at a GP's office for 3 years. Now I am with an internal medicine specialist. I do like my job but sometimes I feel like it is not enough for me. I would like to have more meaningful job? Make some more money too.

We live in a very small town in BC so I have very limited options if it comes to degrees/certificates. I have been looking for some online courses, but there's not that many options. I would love to feel like I am making a change. I love helping others, talking to people. I was thinking of completing a teaching certificate, or becoming a social worker. (Found online programs for those with University of Calgary). Is there anyone who has any advice, or who was in a similar situation? I was also debating doing a bookkeeping certificate (my husband thinks it's not for me, as there's not that much contact with people).",domdom955,2,1.0,0,1728341372,2024-10-07 22:49:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fyl1hk/changing_a_career_from_a_medical_office_assistant/,10,2024
1fykiz4,How do I frame 2 resignations?,"I’m a teacher. 

I’m wondering how to frame 2 resignations in my resume and potential interviews with old and new employers

Last week I reached out to a former employer about the possibility of returning to that school to work again as a teacher. Today I received a warm reply from the CEO that I would be welcomed to apply when a position becomes available.

I was given multiple references by admin there when I left and left a legacy of very proficient student outcomes. I left there summer of 2023 as I had been lingering some health concerns and had started to clash somewhat and become disillusioned with some aspects of that school.

In the time since then I quit a teaching job that lasted from August 2023 to October 2023 because my health issues got worse and the teaching placement and school was very dysfunctional, I didn’t need that in my life.

I also quit another teaching job recently that lasted 3 weeks of August 2024. This time I was well recuperated health wise but the school was highly dysfunctional, 5 teachers left that summer and 3 more (including me) in the first weeks. I figured I deserve better and that it was early enough in the year for me to find another place.

If I try going back to my old school I kinda doubt they won’t know about me being at those schools, I had to ask for employment verifications from HR and I don’t know if my admin references were contacted. 

How do I frame these experiences in my resume and interviews with my old school/new potential schools?

My resume format fits 3 experiences, I’ve put substitute teaching as my current position from Jan 2024 to present. Before that I’ve put my previous school. I haven’t put the two newest experiences and I don’t think I will. 

Resumes should serve as highlights rather than extensive abc lists of things no? In interviews with new schools my plan is to ignore those last 2 schools ever happened. 

If I interview with my old school l wouldn’t put those experiences on my resume and I’d only mention them if asked, vaguely mentioning substitute teaching and any new school experience between now and then.

Any other advice?

And… yes. I’ve been pretty dysfunctional myself in this process, but also reflective. 

Thanks. ",Solidus35,4,1.0,9,1728339956,2024-10-07 22:25:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fykiz4/how_do_i_frame_2_resignations/,10,2024

I’m not depressed but I just don’t have the tolerance to spend money unnecessarily anymore. Does it sound like I could be depressed without realizing it consciously?

1fyk9st,Advice for dealing with a coworker,"Hi,

I am having trouble with my team member and need some advice on what to do.

I work at a financial publication in New York City writing articles about investments in real estate. About a year-and-a-half ago, the other member on my team (who was very hardworking and dedicated) left for a higher-paying, more prestigious position at another company.

A little while later, I saw that one of my colleagues from journalism school who I always had a friendly rapport with had been part of a wave of layoffs at a major financial media company and was also looking for work. While at this company, he had held a role as a senior producer and was making upwards of $100,000 per year.

In addition to attending grad school with him, we had also worked together at another major news company, where I was an intern and he was an associate producer. He quickly rose through the ranks while there, from intern to associate producer to producer before leaving for the senior producer role at the company that would eventually lay him off.

Whenever I had seen him, I was always impressed by his energy and enthusiasm for the job, especially considering he was in his early 20's.

Thus, when I saw that he was looking for a new role (and has extensive knowledge of finance and business journalism), I recommended him to my boss.

He ended up eventually getting hired by my boss and I got a $1200 bonus before tax (not my sole motivation for recommending him, but a nice gift).

He joined the company last September and to say his performance is subpar is an understatement.

Every morning, as is the case in the world of journalism, we are required to show up with a handful of story ideas ready to go. Ideally (best case scenario), our stories will come from conversations with people who have insider knowledge of the industry (sources). Lower on the totem pole are government documents, internal database records, social media, and on the very bottom, press releases.

In our morning meetings, for the past month, he has shown up with no concrete stories. In fact, he spends his days at the office searching for stories until my boss usually hands him a press release. On days that my boss is off, he doesn't write any stories, which means we don't reach our quota for the month.

Another component of the job is attending industry conferences where we meet executives of different real estate investment companies. While at the conference, it is our responsibility to set up meetings ahead of time and walk away from the event with a handful of stories based on the intel we have learned.

Our biggest conference is in June of each year and we are under pressure to get 10 stories each. Needless to say, because there has been talk of outsourcing our jobs if we don't regularly get stories from sources, I did extensive outreach on my annual vacation in Asia, because I care about my job and can't afford to be unemployed in Manhattan.

I spent the whole conference fully booked with meetings, albeit suffering in a state of extreme jetlag.

My co-worker, however, had no meetings set up and did not get any stories based on interactions he had while there over a two-day period. The only stories he ended up writing were based on interviews that I arranged and I let him take.

He keeps texting me after each morning meeting, saying things like, ""I think I'm cooked. I had no stories.""

The other day, when we were leaving the office together, he said, ""Even if I get laid off, I know god has a plan for me.""

It is difficult for me because, up until this point, we have gone out to lunch almost every day together and consider ourselves friends. I have tried to gently reiterate to him what he needs to do to meet the minimum expectations for the job, over-and-over again. Yet, it doesn’t seem to be getting through.

I can tell he doesn’t feel comfortable with the other team members, that he is nervous, but that he does feel comfortable with me. 

Yet, at the same time, I’m having a hard time having any more patience for him at this point, considering he has been at the company for over a year and still has yet to learn the ropes. 

I guess the fact that he was applying for other jobs immediately after getting the position should have been a clear indicator for me, but, at the same time, he will also turn down job interview offers from recruiters and tell me that he wants to “grow with our company.”

How should I handle this situation? Any advice?

I don’t want to ice him out as a friend, but at the end of the day, this is a work environment, after all.

1fyjo9u,28 and feeling lost,"A little bit of background: I’m a male studied computer science and graduated just before Covid. There wasn’t any particular reason I studied cs, it’s just that no other field interested me. I then realised that I had no interest in being a software development/coding either. There were a time I had serious anxiety issues because I was constantly thinking about my future and I’ll be working in a job that I had zero interest in. Also I don’t really know why but I always hated the idea of working in a 9to5 job in an office. Maybe it’s because I’m an introvert guy. I always had the dream of being “free”, and having my own business.

After graduating I was unemployed for almost a year. I discovered Etsy and tried to sell some stuff like Tshirts in 2020. That didn’t work but in August 2021 I tried another product(custom jigsaw puzzle) and it did work. I didn’t know at the time that people search for custom photo puzzles, and that the competition was really low. My sales skyrocketed that holiday season, and I thought that the sales will be always high, that I finally did it and became financially free and I won’t have to work for someone again. Sadly that wasn’t true. Even though I made some pretty good sales in 2022 and 2023, the sales has been dramatically low since the start of 2024. I’ve been trying everything to get my sales up and I haven’t been successful. I opened a second Etsy shop selling AI art. I made 300+ sales since April 2024 and people seem to like them but it’s not getting profitable because I barely cover ads expenses. I feel depressed at this point and being unemployed and having no expertise at 28 is even worse feeling. Etsy was my only source of income.

I didn’t know what my passion was when I was a kid, and I don’t still don’t. Only thing I like doing is creating (AI) art/editing them. I sometimes think if I should spend 3-6 months learning cybersecurity, or anything tech related, but the thought of AI overtaking these specialties always concerns me. I don’t want to spend months of studying only to be unemployed by AI 2-3 years later. There’s already big layoffs in the industry and I don’t know if AI is going to make things worse for juniors.

Sorry if that was too long but any recommendation is appreciated

The branch I was at had great career progression ( I managed to get promoted to line manager and was receiving training for a data analyst role as part of a program run by the company) management actually listened and made improvements and colleagues actually worked together, but we all got made redundant around 8 months ago. 

I landed a role as a team leader for another retail company about a month later, 7 months later and I'm just fed up, very poor management, they speak to staff like toddlers, they have very poor organisational skills and can't make a rota to save their lives, on a busy day they'll have 5 scheduled no store manager in and only one team leader then the next day it'll be 15 people scheduled.

1fyhno4,CS Grad with SWE Job Offer - Debating Medicine Career Path. Need Advice.,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 23-year-old CS major about to graduate with my master’s degree, and I have a software engineering job lined up in Austin starting next year. On paper, everything looks great, but lately, I’ve been feeling unmotivated and disconnected from my coursework. It’s starting to feel like all the effort I put into this degree is pointless when landing a job depends so much on Leetcode, luck, and skills that I’m not particularly a genius at.

I’ve always had an interest in medicine and considered it seriously at multiple points in my life. I’ve noticed that I’m better at studying consistently, grinding through material, and working in structured environments compared to the chaotic nature of coding interviews. Recently, I received an acceptance to a post-bacc program that would start next August, which would be my first step toward a med school application.

The problem is that I can’t do both—the SWE job and the post-bacc start around the same time. So I’m stuck at a crossroads: do I take the job and commit to the CS world, or do I pivot and pursue medicine, knowing it’s going to be a long road and I’m starting later than most?

If you were in my shoes, what would you do? I know there’s a chance I’m experiencing some form of “grass is greener” syndrome, but I don’t want to live with regret if medicine is truly the better fit for me. At the same time, turning down a good job offer in tech makes me feel like I’m throwing away years of work and opportunities. I’d really appreciate any advice or insight from those who’ve been in either field or made similar decisions.

1fyfr01,Seeking alternatives to disability case management ,"I'm a disability case manager for a large Canadian insurance company, and in my mid thirties. I've been with the job about six months and while my performance reviews have been okay (a lot of praise for customer service, some criticism for speed, and a lot of personal difficulty managing the workflow) I'm unhappy in the position and looking to explore alternatives.

I have my BA in psychology with distinction, and a minor in counselling (I went to university a fair bit later in life then many, hence being in my 30s and only having finished my undergraduate studies). My practical experience job history wise is mostly customer service, with a few years in quality assurance (including some team leadership/training), and some ta'ing in university. I also did a practicum with a mental health outreach program.

I'd love to be working in human services, but no one seems to want to take me on since I don't drive. And given how long it takes to get a full license in Canada, fixing that isn't a good short term solution. (It takes three years to get a full license here for the confused Americans in the audience). 

I've been accepted to an MA program in clinical counselling. I am meant to start next year and am very excited, although since its at a private university (a reputable one, with a widely recognized credential, not Yorkville) It will be a big expense. 

I know my work as a disability case manager is just too mentally taxing to also manage gradschool concurrently, especially while living alone and without any support with domestic tasks. In fact I'm already struggling to keep up with the endless cycle of cooking/cleaning/laundry/groceries shopping with my current burnout. 

A lot of people think I should stick with my current job as the income for clinical counselors isn't significantly higher (lower at the bottom end, than I'm making now, 10-20k higher at the top range) but personal satisfaction, work life balance and portability are all important to me. My parents are older and I'm an only child so the flexible hours and location of Telehealth private practice are much more compatible with my long term goals and outside responsibilities than being tied to a corporate office. Also, it's something I can see doing in at least a part time capacity into old age, whereas the thought of trying to keep up the pace of a case manager even until age 65 feels impossible. Which I personally think is vital given the uncertainty of pension security in the future. 

Any suggestions for lateral moves or similar careers to help me narrow my job search for a more sustainable job? I understand I'll need to take a pay cut (theres a reason case managers make relatively high incomes for a relatively low bar to entry and that reason is 100% burn out risk) but am aiming for around 50-60k (currently making 70k, but that's getting eaten up by takeout due to being permanently exhausted). I'd settle for as low as 45k if the benefits were solid and the work relatively unstrennous, but don't think I could get by on less where I am currently living (and I have an extremely lucky situation rent wise). 

To be clear since I'm aiming to move into counseling in the long run, the extreme stress and burnout from my current job has very little to do with dealing with the clients and their emotional/health concerns. I have decent emotional boundaries around that and am open to work with fairly high emotional labor involved. My current burnout is very specific to dealing with the finances of others, the sheer scale of the workload, and the archaic and poorly integrated tech utilized by my employer to manage workfkow and customer data. 

I'd love to aim for remote work (time spent commuting is time better spent cooking/cleaning/doing homework) but I know thats a bigger ask than it was 2-3 years ago. 

Ideally, I'd love some suggestions for alternative jobs for the next 2-3 years, as well as suggestions for better job search options than mass applying on indeed. The rapid fire, high volume approach to job applications I've taken in the past, is not compatible with full time employment, but it's all I've previously had much experience with. 

Skills wise, I have all the basic software and hardware competencies (word, basic excell, pos software, image editing, slack/teams etc), but sadly no coding/web design. No second language - a bit if very very broken spanish. Numbers are not my strong suit. I do have solid soft skills, verbal and written accuity and I like to think am a pretty fast learner. 

Apologies for the length and wordiness, but I figured when seeking advice its best to give more detail than less.

1fyf663,"26 M Doctor wanting a career change into Management, few doubts and concerns","Long version to get a better idea about me - (TLDR BELOW)

I did my schooling and college from Dubai, been here since 2002, and the college at the time I started studying, was the best available in the country.

Now a little bit about my self I was a bit undecided in my high school which career and my direction in life I wanted and my parents sold me the idea of a doctor being respectful, financially stable, recession free ( my dad is in construction and he suffered a bit). I am an ENTP assertive btw that would explain a bit if you know the mbtis 

Even though I wasn’t the typical doctor type, I do like helping people and seeing a smile but it’s not a driving factor for me, I could never study for long hours even my final 5 th year exams I studied for 2 weeks and graduated. Now I did fail an exam in year 3 and got delayed by half a year and corona came delayed another 6 months so I lost a year but I got a bit more serious in my 4th year, I don’t really remember much of the biochem and all those but I remember the clinical stuff more. So my basics are horrible in short, so you get the idea that I wasn’t fully invested in becoming a doctor like how the norm is. However, I completed my college, got a 2.7 gpa (67%) did the 1 year internship also. I was quite a decent doctor, all the specialists I worked under in my internship never had any complaints, some even praised me and gave me recommendation letters. I used to stay overtime and help out other interns. I had actually started to like surgery snd psychiatric a bit and thought maybe I could see a future there. Basically enjoyed being a doctor you know. 

Now I have given almost 4 exams 3 uae ones for licensing and PLAB earlier this year, I failed all of them and been almost 2 years now since the internship. I’ll tell you the reason why I’m quite discouraged right now and don’t feel motivated to study either. 

- In Dubai they have given out this golden visa 3 years ago when corona came  ( a 5 year visa for gp doctors, without a work visa, a guy cannot stay in Dubai and no such thing as citizenship or PR you lose your job you gotta pack up and leave before the visa expiries ) now because of this scheme a lot of doctors from India and Pakistan came here, due to this over saturation, GP doctors are getting paid 4-5k dhs thats about 1k GBP. On top of that the doctors from these Asian countries come with 2 3 year experience and are accepting these entry level offers, because of that theres no such thing as a fresher or entry level job here as medical centers prefer these more trained ones willing to work for cheap and unless you are connected it’s very difficult to get a job , moreover my marks aren’t helping me either at this point. 

So basically in short, doctors have no respect here anymore in fact nurses are getting paid more. Forget the financial aspect or the stability as it’s over saturated. No incentive or future for me whos not completely invested in being a doctor as all the pros have been removed now it’s just do hard work for nothing from my point of view.

I was thinking about getting into management as I always liked business but I wanted to make my own money snd use that to start one. Mind you back in 2015 fresher GP doctors had a 10 -12k monthly salary so thought it’s easily doable. The pay for 10 15k is enough to offset the workload given and stress in this job too makes it quite worth it for a bachelors degree lasting 6 years. Anyways I even had a offer letter from a different uni for bba but I still went for the mbbs route as I thought I could always do my business later on and don’t specifically need a bba to start one. Felt like the most logical route to take which had the risks if my business failed minimized( thinking I could work as long as my business picked up snd make the jump when I could sustain and as a really good back up plan too).
I already know what business I want to do I have it all quite decently planned. I’m just missing the funds and the experience of business since it’s not related to medical field 

Anyways Now I don’t wanna waste my degree as I had gotten decent at it, sure my marks weren’t the best but I can see my self being good at hospital management. And we all know hospital management always has the worst people ever. I wanna help change that as I believe not many people in hospital management do have a medical background and understanding of the other side so to speak. 

My mom fell sick earlier this year and was in the icu she’s fine now but dad lost his job recently it’s all very stressful so I don’t really have the time in my hand either. 

TLDR - DOCTOR, GRADUATED 2 YEARS AGO- CANT PASS MY LICENSING EXAMS- NO SCOPE FOR DOCTORS IN MY COUNTRY- TOO MUCH OVER SATURATION AND CRAP PAY WITH NO ENTRY LEVEL JOBS-  ALWAYS LIKED BUSINESS/COMMERCE - DON’T WANNA WASTE MY DOCTOR DEGREE - THOUGHT OF HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT- PLEASE READ THE QUESTIONS I HAVE BELOW - 

Please free to answer any or to the best of your knowledge 

- People advice to do MBA after you have experience in management, in my case I can’t even apply for those jobs as I have a medical background, so does it make sense to the MBA first to get my foot in the door ?

- Is a normal MBA good enough or Doing a specialized MBA hospital management preferred ? ( I have a few university’s for hospital management but they aren’t that highly ranked and a bit more cheaper on the other hand the normal MBA ones being more highly ranked and costlier  )

- I was thinking of leaving the country, before that I wanna try again to get my license at least so that maybe I can transfer it to the new country ?

- Can I still work as a GP to make some money or do I have to completely give up the physician side if I do end up completing my MBA ? 

- Which countries would you suggest, I’m following up with the news I do realize the job market is the same in the UK and US and people are struggling everywhere, Australia maybe ? Or learn German ? 

- Or just stay here in Dubai and work as a GP somehow and until I get 2 3 year experience then do MBA ?

- If I do my MBA now, Do I have to start from the utmost basic level in management snd climb the ladder or will the MBBS degree help skip a few levels ?

- Do you know of any doctors who work as physicians and handle the management side of the hospital too ? 

- Any suggestions to help with the black hole of 2 years that exists in my cv ? If anyone of you’re in HR 

- What skills would you say I brush up or learn ? For an MBA coming from a medical field ( read up accountancy from high school or something? ) 

I had it all figured out even with backup and contingency plans and here I’m today more lost than ever. 

Thank you if you took the time to read and help a brother out.

1fyevm7,Turning down job I accepted to stay at current job?,"About 4 months ago, I interviewed and accepted an exciting role that requires a security clearance. The job pays the same and accepted it as more of a strategic move and to join a fun project.

4 months later and I now have a provisional clearance to start working. I brought up to them the job I accepted and that my last day would be 4 weeks out. 

Well, a lot has changed in 4 months and my current job is really fighting to keep me with a very tempting career path and more pay. I am considering staying and turning down the other job but I feel awful about doing that considering how involved the onboarding process has been with them and how much of a great team they are.  

Knowing that I already accepted the job 4 months ago, how bad does it look 4 mths down the road turning it down in this case without having actually done any work for them? I don’t think negotiating with the new job is an option or professional-looking. Their benefits are mostly the same but they do offer one week less of pto vs the 4-ish I have at my current job. It also has to be accrued vs the “unlimited” pto I have on hand at my current job. And that flexibility has really gotten to me after I’ve had 4 mths to think about it.

1fyeo75,Failed DOT drug test and still got the job,"Howdy people, a month ago I applied  to Delta airlines to be a simulator technician. Did the interview and got the CJO for their Atlanta location. Sent my background info and the next day I went and did my drug test. Now to be upfront I only had stopped smoking about a month before this but just stopped cold turkey during a vacation. Checking the portal it said my background was in progress for the longest so i assumed background but friday I got a phone call from the MRO saying i tested positive for weed. I was surprised because I had taken a drug test for a different company literally the week before and they cleared me with no issues so I'm still wondering how I even passed that one and failed this one but the day after the MRO my application goes from ""background in progress"" to ""completed not selected"" i assumed that meant they withdrew the CJO. However about an hour ago the recruiter calls me and tells me they want to send me to the Utah location instead and theyre gonna try to get paperwork done by tomorrow so I can recieve my start date. How the heck am I getting a start date if I failed the drug test? I'm so confused and was wondering if anyone has any answers.

1fyee6w,What are reasonable requests to ask of a company as a first time mom? Company is rather unaccommodating in general.,"I am the Marketing Manager of a multinational company's USA division and am currently 18 weeks pregnant with twins. Our division only has around 25 employees, and I am the first one (ever!) to be pregnant.

When I told the division president, my boss, that I was pregnant, he asked what I was looking for in regards to maternity leave. I told him that I plan on taking three months off after the birth of the babies. This was discussed with overseas management who approved it. Even now, it is unclear whether or not this leave will be paid.

I am hoping to make two additional requests, but I am extremely nervous to do so with the fear that I will be seen as difficult. They are:

1. Currently, we can only roll over 15 PTO days each year. I would like to ask permission to roll over all of my remaining days (24.72 days), so that I have extra in case of health complications.
2. I would like to be able to work from home 2-3 days/week after returning from maternity leave. We would have childcare at the house during this time, so I would not be the one playing, feeding, changing, etc. I would just be around a little bit more than if I was in the office.

The second request is what I am really worried about, as my boss has always been extremely against WFH/hybrid work. Like, with Covid, we returned to the office full time after around 6-8 weeks.

Are these reasonable? Is there any way that you think I should frame these requests in order to get them approved without push back?

1fye2e2,My manager is now also the department head and we feel they are spread thin,"Hi everyone. I work on a team of three consultants and we report to one manager. Our manager recently became the department head while still keeping the role of our manager.

My team is feeling a little bit left behind as our manager doesn't have the most time to assist with our projects, review proposals and deliverables, etc. basically slowing our pipeline of work. 

We want to address this with them and we feel the solution is to hire a more senior consultant who can sit between us and them.

Everyone has just taken on more work. My understanding is that since our utilizations rates are not sky rocketing there is no need to hire more people. But i know people feel overwhelmed.

1fydt9i,Rejected for a role for being too nervous.,"So I interviewed for a role I have been doing for several years. It’s much better pay and benefits than my current firm. I knew the hiring manager as she worked for my current firm some years ago so it was safe to say I felt relaxed. Had the initial 30 minute screening call via teams then the in person interview for an hour. Everything went well, it seemed to flow naturally. Answered some technical questions and competency questions, all seemed fine. I gave thorough answers and there were just a couple of questions that came up in regards to certain processes but I explained, I had only little exposure to them at this moment in time but will be working on them very soon. I had a brief chat with three of team who would potentially be my direct reports, a very casual chat but again very relaxed. 
I received an email a day or so after the interview to say they were not proceeding with my application. 
I followed up with an email to ask for feedback. 
I received my feedback today and the reason they rejected me was because I have great skills and experience for the role was too nervous! 
The role is still advertised so needless to say I feel like I have had a massive kick in the teeth.

1fyd7aq,Is it better to fake the confidence and just start applying to jobs or take the time to slow down and build up my confidence by learning through professional certifications after a mediocre college experience?,"I recently graduated from a top 40 university (U.S. News and World Report), but I struggled a lot in college, some of it due to genuine things and others simply due to not caring enough in the moment, and got a a 2.6 GPA (junior and senior year GPA was around a 3.1). My major was economics, and my minors were finance and math. I often chose to not turn in assignments, got lots of C's as a freshman/sophomore and lots of B's throughout junior and senior year, and the only course I got an A in was computer science, which I took over the summer and have forgotten almost all of it. I also tried applying for internships but was unsuccessful, which means I currently have zero work experience directly related to my economics major and math/finance minors. Before my senior year started, I got a part-time job as an instructor for a math tutoring company, and have slowly worked my way up the ranks to senior instructor as well as de-facto assistant director. I definitely applied for 30-50 full-time jobs throughout my senior year, but only got 2-3 interviews and was unsuccessful in every single one. I ended up deciding to just clear my mind, stop applying for a bit after I graduated, and focus solely on the part-time job since I was taking on more roles and responsibilities. I got fired on Friday for reasons I won't go into here, but nonetheless, that's what brings me to writing this post.

Because I didn't really care that much in college, my biggest concern right now is that I lack the confidence myself to go apply for those high-end corporate jobs that can financially sustain me in the long-run. My parents have recommended completing some online certifications, but my research showed me that they're often not the best investment of my time and money. They also recommended a full masters program but frankly I'm just not too intrigued by the idea. Other friends have recommended faking the confidence and just going out to apply for as many jobs as I possibly can, and just hope that something works out.

My main question is: should I show down and take a formal certifications/educational courses to build my confidence? Or should I not waste time, fake the confidence, and jump into applying and just hoping I get one offer from all my submitted applications? And if it is a good idea to build up my confidence on the actual hard skills and knowledge, is a professional certification the best way to go about doing that?

1fycnws,Is a computer science minor worth it for a non-tech resume?,"I started college as a computer science major but was not a fan of the (in my opinion) soulless mindset required to be successful in tech. I opted to major in something not practical but that would allow me to have more of a liberal arts education (psychology). I’m currently a junior and I have no career plans and I’m trying to figure out what I am interested in by taking lots of classes. I’m not particularly in a rush to commit to a career as I don’t know what I want to do and I’m considering grad school because I can afford it.

My dilemma is this: I completed a lot of computer science classes and I would only need to take a few more to get a minor in CS. However, the classes that I have left are notoriously hard and I have no real passion for computer science. My only motivation would be that it would help in grad school or job applications. I would really rather not take those classes as they take a lot time away from me being able to do other things that I actually care about. 

Does Psych Major + CS minor look that much better than just a Psych degree?

1fycmsh,The difference between your work career and your school experience,"I see a lot of questions on this sub that make me realize that a lot of people don't understand the fundamental differences between the work environment and the school environment.  Here are my top 3, please feel free to add more:

1.  There is no equivalent to school councilor in the work place.  So many people think that this is the role of HR.  HR's role is to ensure the policies of the company are adhered to and implemented and to help the company achieve it's objectives by maximizing the effectiveness of human resources.  The role of 'school councilor' is filled by external therapists that may or may not be covered by your benefits. 

2.  Many of your co-workers are your competitors for the few opportunities for advancement.  There aren't any 'participation awards'

3.  You will not be promoted just because you are doing a great job.  Think of it this way, if your company was getting a product from a supplier for $100 and knew that the product should cost them $150 they are not going to call the supplier to ask them to increase the price.   In this case your work is the product and you are the supplier.  If you're waiting to be recognized you will rarely be rewarded.  You need to fight and advocate for yourself.

1fyarqh,Job hunting sucks,"I’ve been working at a job for six years expecting to grow. This was my first job out of college. It wasn’t until now that I acted on being underpaid, 56k after 6 years here. I tried transferring internally to departments that I thought I might genuinely like given that I’ve had an interest in them (audit/tax). Audit sadly didn’t have capacity to bring me on. Tax denied me because my partner works in there as a staff accountant (same position I was going for) so the manager declared nepotism, (this whole convo was crazy lol). So after being turned down internally, I decided to look externally. Two very promising jobs reached out to me and sadly they both didn’t work out. One offered me a job, but offered only $900 more of what I’m making now. I tried negotiating salary but HR said that was based on my years of experience already. This job was an accounting position. I declined the job due to low pay. Second job, I had a phone screening with HR that went well. Ended up getting an interview with two managers, who basically just told me about the job, who I will work with, their day-to-day work life, what clothes they wear in office, etc. They told me they were really excited to meet me due to my resume and experience. They told me they were looking to hire quickly so they could provide enough time for training. They said can they let me know a decision in a week and I said yes. It all sounded so promising. HR responded saying they decided to go with other applicants. This was for another accounting position. Now I’m left empty handed. This whole job process is taking a toll on me. I’ve had many rejections, and it’s just hard to see my worth. Part of me is like did I make a mistake in declining the job offer I received? But I know that I shouldn’t leave a job for a $900 raise.. 

I’m just venting here, so thanks for reading if you did. If you have any tips to help me keep my head up or job hunting tips, I’m open to advice.

Would it be appropriate to send a follow-up text to that one or give her a phone call at some point today or within the week (I don’t have her email address).

1fyae6j,Quitting before another job lined up,"I've been a contract software engineer for 2 years now. I have 2 years of work experience in tech, but I have \~2 years in marketing, and \~6 years in business administration -- so in total, 6-7 years of professional white-collar work because of overlap. 

I was told I'd be offered a conversion over a year ago, never got it, and found out a few months ago that leadership was doing a bad job + screwing people over. Leadership got replaced a few months ago and is now saying they're trying to make things right, BUT they don't have a solid plan yet, and I still don't know what's going to happen. This contract position is stalling my financial/personal plans and I'm currently burned out + fed up with the empty ""promises"" / ""assurance"" they keep giving me, so I want to quit but don't have another job offer yet. 

I honestly want to take 3 months off because I've been working so much for the past 2-3 years, and can tell the burnout is just a step away from ruining my health (been there, done that, so I know what it looks/feels like for me, and it's horrendous to go through)

I have two rental properties (a single unit & a duplex), one mortgage is taken care of by the rent it collects, and the other mortgage is 1/2 taken care of by rent and I live in the other unit. I have a part-time job on the side that makes enough to cover the remaining half, and to pay for other living expenses. But I'd be living very frugally with the part-time job, which I'm ok with, as long as I can take my time recovering from BS/burnout. I'll also be taking a 1-month family vacation in December, so I'm not really trying to rush into a job to only tell them I'll be gone for 1 month soon after.

Is it a bad idea to just quit now without another job offer lined up, or is it ok if I quit now, take my time searching for another job & enjoy my \~3 months of rest + vacay, then really worry about a full-time job after I get back from vacation (if I haven't secured one before I leave for vacay)?",mzoua,1,1.0,0,1728314827,2024-10-07 15:27:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fyae6j/quitting_before_another_job_lined_up/,10,2024

I am 23 years old, a Marketing graduate. 

I have been working remotely at a Great, not relatively big company, but has been running in its own niche industry for 15+ years. The company is very good. It pays me well, enough to satisfy my needs and wants (Although there are no benefits like HMO, Insurance etc) and to also spoil my family. The people in it are good to me, especially the bosses. However, I haven't been getting the satisfaction of learning more about my degree and the practicalities of it, because my role is to serve the Communication part. I sometimes do social media management and some editing stuff, but it's not enough for me. Also, It's a very, very easy job. I can literally play games while working. It's chill. It's just that I'm looking for something more, something that would challenge me. Something that I can take for the progression of myself and my career.

This month, I have been offered by Google, to work on their digital marketing side. The benefits are great, very good actually.. but the salary is lower. It's 20% lower than what I earn on my Job right now. And I have to actually commute to the office as it is pure office setup. But reading the job offer and job description, I feel like I would actually \*struggle\* in here a bit, and learn about my degree. 

So I am stuck. It's hard to leave my current job because of its pay, the people are chill (literally), and the work life balance it offers. But it's hard to not dismiss Google's offer because of its benefits and the things I'd learn that'd help me further my career.

Hey everyone,

I'm a self-taught music composer who's been dabbling in composing for a few years now. I've worked on a few personal projects and even did the music for a short film. Lately, I've been thinking of taking things to the next level—maybe do a residency abroad or find some way to get connected with others in the industry. I’ve applied for a few opportunities, but I've gotten rejected each time. I think it's because ,even though I answer the requirements, the way i structure my project and write my applications is holding me back.

So here’s where I need advice: there’s this online workshop that just launched specifically for artists like me who want to learn how to write proposals for grants or residencies. It’s $50, which I can afford, but but it’s a bit of a stretch. I’ve tried learning on my own through YouTube and guides, but I feel like I need more hands-on guidance, especially because this workshop offers 1-on-1 time with the trainer. From what I found out, the person leading the workshop seems to really know their stuff.

I’m hesitant to sign up because I’m not sure if it’s worth the investment or if I should keep looking for free resources or other payed ones.  Has anyone been in a similar situation? Would this be a good step, or should I hold off? Would love to hear your thoughts!

1fy4e46,I feel like I have no skills = no employment ,"Hi. I just got over with my UG degree in communications and media (which is pretty useless in itself tbvh). The career options are far and wide and one can pursue anything from PR to Journalism to Business to ANYTHING. Which is quite a confusing time for me. Alluding to the title, I don’t really have any core skills - let me explain. People that I know have some or the other hard skill that they leverage to get a job or score a gig i.e. good at social media - social media executive; flair for writing - journalist or content specialist or pr executive; understanding of google analytics - marketing executive. While I’m extremely happy for my friends, I feel so lost because I fall into none of these categories, I have none of these skills. The only skill that I actually have and am good at is people. The sole purpose of me getting into communications was to be in a field where I had a people facing job. I tried my hand at sales and realised that it’s too hectic and too demanding, I could not cope up with the stress. I dipped into advertising for a bit and thought it was alright, didn’t have enough time to explore. The main problem is that the job market is such where there are no jobs for freshers (atleast the ones that I saw) and the others require skills that I don’t have/am not interested in.

1fy46ic,Need some advice ,"I (23M) left a job i loved in the entertainment industry because i felt i would never grow in the company. Admittedly, this was because i was very wet behind the ears and didn't have the drive to try and grow. Also i hated the thought that i'd never make enough money to have a car, or to provide for a family.

I now work at an industrial job in Witbank. I really hate this job so much because though the money is a lot better, i work some questionable hours. 7 days a week, from 7am till late in the evening (depending on what needs to be done that day, on a good day the default time to go home is 18:00)

My gf and i work at the same company, but she hates that i'm never home for long enough to build a life together. So we have decided to go back to our home town as soon as our rental contract has run out. She's planning on starting her own consulting agency, and i now have 2 job opportunities. One of them is at a well paying company that is recession proof, pays well, and will likely help me to study something of use in that field.

Studying is something that is important to me, i've always wanted to get a higher education, but couldn't afford to pursue.

The other option i have is to go back to the entertainment company. They do want me back because i was good at what i did. But the girlfriend doesn't seem very keen on it, despite the fact that i am now able to haggle with them regarding pay and benefits i will need to go back. The entertainment job is my dream and what i've always been passionate about. So i guess my question is this: do i take the ""safe"" job option that ensures i am set, but i might not enjoy. Or do i pitch a deal to the entertainment people where i list out my demands for return that include better pay, the option to study something (preferably something that i can use for this job as well as to help me get another job should it ever become necessary- i'm just not sure what though)

We have to keep in mind that if i choose the entertainment job and i don't properly navigate the conversation between me and my girlfriend, it might result in a break up (which would be less than ideal because i really like her and would love to build a life with her). I understand why she is pushing for me to take the other job, but i don't know if i'd enjoy that job.

Any ideas or advice would be appreciated. ",tigerdriver2000,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1728295972,2024-10-07 10:12:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fy46ic/need_some_advice/,10,2024
1fy38pr,Request leave or severance package?,"I’m facing a bit of career burnout. I’ve been pushing myself for a while. Now, I’m considering taking leave. Been at my job for 14 years and was regarded well previously. However, now my performance is slipping. I have a big talk coming up with my manager. I don’t think I’ll get fired, but I am expecting some sort of warning. I don’t have the energy to look for a job. I actually liked mine and may once again with a break or different Manager. I’m also considering bringing up the subject of a severance package, but I am nervous/overwhelmed about looking for a new job after we at the same company for so long.

But I had to drop out in my 4th year and final year due to financial issues, family and mental breakdown. I still don't have any money. Does any reputated university offer online courses with certificates that I can officially apply and do classes and assignments and projects? I would like to do some sort of graduation and not remain uneducated. I cannot attend the university physically nor can I apply for loans or scholarship.

1fy0729,Should I quit a good job with a bad boss?,"I (25F) got this 9-5 job almost a year ago, and have wanted to quit since five months in. I’m an assistant to a moody bureaucrat. Normally rude bluntness is just annoying to me, but something about how he treats me makes me uncomfortable in a way that I can’t explain. He makes me call him after hours and on the weekends because he refuses to tell me his schedule until the morning of, even though my job is to manage his schedule. he tells me he hates me, calls me a nag, or tells me to “fuck off” when I am reminding him of things he’s forgotten/procrastinating on (so my job), and he often curses at me if I make a small mistake, even if he is the one who makes the mistake. For example, I also manage his social media. I’ll send him a caption for approval to post, he’ll approve it twice, and then an hour later tell me that I “monumentally fucked up” with the caption and yell at me to take down the entire post. (If he didn’t like the caption he shouldn’t have approved it twice, right?) He’s had a bad run with the press in the past so I understand that he is sensitive to it, but it feels like overkill for what seems like a very trivial subject. 

He has kept me after hours (with no overtime pay) and yelled at me until i’ve cried after humiliating me in front of our coworkers. He has blamed me for not catching legal mistakes in his work (not a part of my job, I am not a lawyer). 
Also, he will say things like “don’t cut your hair” or “i bet your dad was mean to you” which also make me uncomfortable.

The list goes on—but the reason i have stayed at this job is because i make nearly six figures (99k), have insurance, and it is hybrid remote. There is also guaranteed job security at least for the next 4 years. On paper, it is a perfect set-up. I believe I am good at my job when he isn’t making me feel like shit, and even then I get by. But his behavior has gotten more and more unbearable lately, calling me after-hours 30 times on both work and personal phones until i pick up to deal with something that isn’t an emergency. 

For the past 6 months I have been trying to convince myself that it is worth it, that I am paid to get yelled at, I have bills to pay, it isn’t always so bad, and i just need a thicker skin. But every time he calls me an idiot or makes fun of me in front of coworkers, I want to scream at him and quit immediately. I can’t see myself being happy after being spoken to like that everyday for years, but the market is also terrible for jobs in my field (i was a marketer before this). At this point I just feel so burnt out. I have some money saved, so i could be fine for maybe 6 months before the money really runs short. 

TLDR; i have an unbearable asshole boss but the money + benefits are great. I want to quit this month, but i’m scared I’m making a huge mistake.

1fy04sw,Should I change careers and study at university?,"Should I change careers and study at University

I’ve had quite a few obstacles as a young 26 year old growing up. I was a very smart young kid growing up, receiving the academic award in grade 6, but in high school when my family fell apart I started to not care about my studies. (Or anything for that matter). So I dropped out in year 11 and started an apprenticeship as a roof plumber and have been for about 9 years. I currently work for a friend of mine that is quite narcissistic at times, but in his eyes he thinks he is doing what is best for me. The colleagues/supervisors at this workplace have also been friends of mine for some time, but they are very toxic and childish, constantly getting angry at minor inconveniences. I got myself into some trouble with the law when I was 20 and did some stupid things when I was drunk attaining a criminal record for assaulting police and I unfortunately do not remember any of it. 
The recent passing of my father has made me rethink my life choices. I have recently started reading some old philosophy and psychology books and it has really sparked some passion inside of me, and I think it will be one of the few careers that I enjoy.  
I completed a semester of a finance degree when I was 21, got a part-time job to only be turned down by the HR department 2 weeks later because of my criminal record. 
Is it still worth it for me to pursue a career in psychology? Or I could potentially finish my finance degree and look at becoming HR or even a financial analyst would interest me.

1fxz2dd,"Graduate and work or almost free, single year masters","I’m currently facing a dilemma in my career choices. I have two options. I’m a senior in mechanical engineering with two prior summers of internships at the same company. I currently have a full time return offer (82k base + benefits) for after I graduate. This is in the US and I have no student loan debt.

My first option is to graduate in the spring and work at the company that I’ve interned at the last few years. (Great company, compensation, and people)

My second option that has come to light recently is doing a 4+1 masters degree basically for free. I would only have to pay for my food and housing. The deadline for it is such that I would need to start gathering the necessary things tomorrow but can still do it. I would just have to tell the company I won’t be graduating and instead would do another internship and then hopefully go work for them after I graduate with the masters. The other question I have is if I go for the masters should I go for the professional or thesis masters? 

Right now, my thought is that I should do the masters program because it will be almost free and fast. Additionally, I could be promoted to level 2 (+10k base salary among other things) within a year after I start working there after the masters. This is opposed to having to wait 3 years for the promotion if I don’t get the masters. So I’m thinking the masters could probably get me a slightly higher offer in the first place as well as a decent promotion within a year. It would also potentially unlock doors down the road for me that I don’t even know exist yet.

atm i'm emotionally overwhelmed - about my career as a developer, and how unhappy i am to have to rely on it today

I'm pretty concerned and desperate for not having a plan for me.

Let me sum up everything for u guys:

* Currently i'm 23 yo.
* Have been working as a web developer for the last 5 years, in the last 2 years i started getting really paid for the work i actually did - and i'm still unhappy, no matter what: last place i was working i did get actually depressed and got a burnout as a bonus!
* I always wanted to have a career in music: but i never stood a chance here in Brazil (most of the people here rely on networking and connections inside the industry: it's really difficult to get a decent full time job around, even as an audio technician in great studios around here!)
* Since i was 17yo i have decided to move from here (Brazil) to another place because of what i said above.
* i always wanted to make the transition of my career in another country because of the conditions (it seems to be less harder in 1rd world countries than in Brazil), but i don't know how it works to get into this industry at all!

So, here's my problem: in the next month i'll probably be on my next employment as a developer, and i'm certain that i will not have sufficient time or energy to get everything planned as i intend to...

So what i'm asking for u guys is a plan.  
I will follow and go through it, but i have to get a plan.

I don't want to spend the rest of my life getting paid to be working in a office rotting my brain with things that i don't love.  
It's not me - i don't want to spend my time with any of that after my 30's!

Some important things u must know:

* i know how to play piano a little: and with good effort i can get to some really cool chords and melodies as well, problem is i don't have a good sense of rhythm in the piano.
* i know how to dj (here i have better control of my rhythm): been working on this all the time while i was unemployed, getting thousands of songs in my collection, learning everything on rekordbox, making contracts and everything ""professional"" - i already made 2 dj sets in public spaces.

I need help, i don't know how to get off from i.t., and i really don't know how to proceed from the place that i'm currently am to get to my dream.

I know it's gonna be a difficult journey, but i really don't want to be a developer anymore.

However, my new manager hasn’t given me that sort of talk and I enjoy receiving feedback like that because it really makes me feel like a better work knowing what my higher ups think I could work on.

So, I’m wanting to ask and have a discussion on how I’ve been doing but I’m not sure how to go about it because my manager never seems to be in the office and when they are they always are busy.

So any advice on the best way to go about asking?",ExchangeTrick317,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1728269447,2024-10-07 02:50:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fxxt4w/asking_what_i_can_do_better/,10,2024
1fxxnpe,Help streamlining ,"Streamline vessel Inspections with Microsoft forms

TLDR: streamline vessel inspections by using forms to fill word documents.

Hey looking for inputs on how to best do this. 

My company has been around for a long time and we have a massive archive of vessel inspections. Which is helpful, but frequently I go to a vessel that hasn’t been inspected. 

So I have to do a report on the vessel from scratch. We have blank word docs that are pretty well organized with each topic that needs to be hit. The blanks word docs are broken out by vessel type and type of inspection. Frequently the wording used to describe the vessels are similar with very slight differences. 

My issue is I go to the vessel with a blank report, take 200 photos, scribble some notes. Then sit at my computer for 4-6 hours trying to describe everything. I’m looking to try and streamline this. I have a remarkable 2 tablet and a iPhone and was thinking I could do some sort of Microsoft form which would allow my notes to be clearer, and more organized for when I go to do the report. Or be able to generate a report requiring only minor edits. 

Any recommendations? I am pretty capable with a lot of various computer applications and I just haven’t found anything yet besides some chat gpt rewrites to make things easier.

1fxxm49,Carter change ,"Hi everyone, I’m 27 and currently working in IT software. The job offers a great environment, good pay, and plenty of growth opportunities, but it’s not something I’m passionate about anymore. I enjoyed it when I started, but over time, the enthusiasm has faded. I don’t want to settle into a career that lacks excitement.

Since childhood, I’ve always loved cars and dreamed of opening a shop or offering car-related services. However, the stability and benefits of my current job took priority. Now, I find myself torn between staying in a secure, well-paying job and pursuing a new path in the automotive industry. The challenge is that with a mortgage, car payment, and family to support, I need to earn at least $80k to cover expenses. Starting in the auto field would likely mean taking a pay cut at the beginning.

Therefore, I believed that choosing a career that didn’t require a graduate or doctorates would benefit me. I ended up failing out of the CompSci program XD.

Then, I chose MIS as a last resort. I haven’t been happy with this decision, but I don’t have the time nor the resources to let that affect me, I’ll deal with that after graduation. My plan for a compsci degree didn’t work out, but these last 4 years HAVE to mean something.

But is the hard part where things just started to collide. It ranges from my mom being in the icu for 3 months to fighting mental illness to making decisions that would affect me physically to where I would be out for roughly 3 months. 

Anyways, I’ve gotten to a point that I couldn’t separate my personal feelings from my work feelings and it just felt like things were colliding in my head. 

I don’t know what the protocol is when someone shows that vulnerability side in a work space but I could tell they (VP of HR and Business Partner) were concerned in a good way. They gave me the time I needed and I was able to get back on medication and start talking to a therapist.

1fxwxmf,I want to get paid more but don't want to leave my job,"I'm a 25yo engineer with a Bachelors degree in MechE (emphasis on robotics/AI), and I'm currently finishing my Masters in Robotics & Automation. I was hired at my current company after I got done with a 6-month Co-Op at a large pharmaceutical company, because they saw the work I did while they were contracting with that company and wanted me on the team. Fast forward about 16 months now, I have not received a single raise from this company, and my salary is at $55,000 ($5k bonuses). Granted, I was still completing my bachelors degree for 12 months of those 16 months. The company has been very understanding of my time, and as long as they are satisfied with my work, do not care if I miss hours of the day due to classes or projects.

  
Now that I'm completing my masters degree soon, I am really hoping to get paid more, and my company expects me to move across the country to be closer to the company we contract for, partly because I said I'd like to do that. Living directly in that city, which is what I'd have to do to commute to work, is one of the highest in the United States. I am worried that they will only offer me a raise of $15-$20k, which, after 2 years of experience, a bachelors and masters, and living in one of the most expensive cities in the US, is certainly not enough (IMO) to move there. I am hoping for an $85k to $95k offer, but I am skeptical that will happen.



Like I said, I told my company that I'd love to move there for them, and I really feel bad asking for so much, partly because they are a small startup and partly because the guys at the company have become my good friends. However, I am getting older, and feel like I should be making more at this point in my life, especially if I move. Any advice is greatly appreciated!!

1fxwtco,Is condensing my resume to 1 page important ,"My resume is currently two pages and I’m not sure if it’ll be a problem to potential employers. I’m currently sophomore in college and I’m trying to make a good resume but I’m having some trouble. 

Because I’m still in school it would make sense to me to highlight my education (gpa, awards, etc.). I still still have some stuff from high school on there too, like all of the clubs and teams I was in charge of (I only included it if I was president/captain/head) because it’s still pretty recent. 

I also have a separate section for presentations because so far I’ve given three and it’s a pretty big talking point for me and I want to highlight my research experience. 

I could also start taking out previous jobs and volunteer work like personal assistant and counselor but I would assume that personal assistant looks good because it shows that I have some background in business and I know that my old boss from when I was a counselor would be a really good reference.

1fxwqbm,6/mo at job and still clueless what do i do?,"(Long story sorry..) Ok so here's the thing- I got this IT job as an internship for my cybersecurity degree. They told me they were looking for someone to stay after the internship was over as a permanent position (great!). I was told word for word ""we don't expect you to know anything.""

Now to my current problem- I feel like I learned as much as expected for a 2 month summer internship… but it's been over for a while and I've learned NOTHING new. My internship consisted only of me going to my boss every single day asking ""what can i do?"" only to be instructed to go to other IT people to see “if they needed anything”…what am i? a glorified assistant? And of course, no one ever needs anything from me. what could i do to help anyway? i don’t know how most things work.

The only thing i’ve been taught how to do is basic helpdesk tickets (people locked out of accounts, PC not turning on, wifi not working,etc). I’ve been reduced to “cleaning and organizing”. The IT guys go and messy up the room and it’s “my job” to clean it up because i’m still an intern in their eyes. I should also mention i’m the only female in the IT department. 

I voiced my concerns about doing cyber security work (since i’m going to college for it obviously) and my boss said “well plenty of people don’t end up doing what they want to college for. you’ll like doing helpdesk”. I also asked my coworkers about getting more projects and being trained for actual work other than the 3 helpdesk tickets I might get a day. He told me “Just take initiative. go find something that needs to be done and do it.” ??????? wtf does that mean? Every time I try asking to help on a project or I find something I think can help everyone, I get shut down and they say “we don’t need that.” 

I sit there for 8 hours a day and do NOTHING. I sit and wait to be told to go clean something or take a ticket no one else wants to do…I feel useless and confused as to why i’m even there…but finding this IT job took me SO LONG and I don’t graduate for another 8 months…what do i do?

1fxwmrv,Was informed a PIP is being written as I finally got a medical diagnosis- to tell or not to tell?,"In fall 2022 I accepted a job offer that was a little bit of a stretch skills wise but I was excited to learn some new and different skills. In January 2023 I found out I was pregnant. The first trimester was rough and I did the best I could, my review had some fair constructive criticism but also some praise. Pregnancy was hard but I did my best to keep up. While I was on parental leave my department spun off on its own and there were a couple new hires. I came back and was excited to be back at work but felt like my job became more vague and I was given some guidance but the expectation was I would be proactive and find and come up with work. 

Spring 2024 I’ve been struggling. Sleep deprivation (kiddo would wake every 2-3 hours), brain fog, forgetfulness, anxiety, and depression but I keep trying to power through. But I’ll fully admit I wasn’t doing well so when my boss brought it up in early June his criticism was fair. I was burnt out and trying to juggle motherhood and work and dealing with lingering grief (I lost both of my parents to cancer 6 weeks apart in 2020, it was 5 months from diagnoses to their death and I dealt with depression and ptsd from it). I found a therapist who pushed me to get a psychiatrist screening because she thought meds might help. Got an appointment and just kept trying to struggle along as best I could. I knew something was wrong with me but since I didn’t have a diagnosis I didn’t share anything beyond mentioning some medical issues vaguely in some 1:1 meetings.

My boss would often push me to take the lead and be proactive and I would try but I often felt that when I did and if I made a mistake, he’d remind me to keep him in the loop, run emails by him and cc him on things. So I did. I think I over corrected but I wasn’t sure what to do. 

Last week I finally had my eval appointment on Friday. On Thursday I was told that I was being put on a PIP. I’m not entirely surprised and have been applying for jobs for a few months because it’s just not a fit for me anymore. The PIP has not been presented to me yet, I’ve just been told it will be written. I had my eval, got a diagnosis and a prescription so we can start trying to find meds that work for me. 

Do I bother informing my boss? I know I messed up at this job. I haven’t felt supported as a new mom and struggled with vague soft skills. I was told I’m not developing the soft skills needed for management (I don’t supervise other people in my role). I was told to think about what I want to develop/how they can support me which looking back is kind of nuts…I’m failing enough that I need a PIP and you want me to come up with what I need to do? I get it, they’re informing me hoping I’ll quietly move on and that’s what I intend to do but for the time being I need to stay employed and keep my health insurance (kiddo is on mine). I’m meeting with my boss on Tuesday and go back and forth on whether to share anything on my new diagnosis- if I do bring it up it’s not to get any accommodation or get out of the PIP, more as a reason for why this happened. 

Tl;dr- struggling at job since returning from parental leave. Got a medical diagnosis the same week I was told a PIP is being written for me.

1fxwf2p,I’m tired of feeling like I’m at the bottom of my salary range.   How do I fix it?,"I started my initial job search and career during the pandemic.  I had to settle for a pretty low paying job compared to the vast majority of my peers who I graduated with (I should’ve done more with internships, my own fault).  I left that job after a year because it wasn’t very good, and took a better job, but since I had no job experience in that field I was brought in low.  And since I was brought in half way through the year, I didn’t receive a raise.  After a year there, I left for an actual decent raise that I was happy with in a related but also slightly different field.  Again, I was brought in half way through the year, and got no annual raise with being new cited as the reason.  I’m still at this company and enjoy it, think it’s good for my career, and feel like I’ve found my field.  However, I’ve come to realize that I’m probably on the low end of the salary band for my current position compared to peers.

I just find it frustrating to constantly be on the short end of the stick in this situation, especially when I see those I graduated getting high level positions at amazing companies and presumably making a boatload more than me.  Ive only ever received strongly positive feedback about my work.  I had a meeting with my boss to confirm I was up for a promotion this cycle and he implied it would happen.  I know I’ll get a raise, but I’m worried that they’ll keep me on the low end of the next salary band.  

I guess the advice I need is what do I need to say to my manager to set an expectation that the low end of the next salary band won’t be good enough?

1fxw4y7,How do you confront a manager who is not good?,"I used to be under a high performance manager. They were rough a tad bit but was essential to the best version of myself performance-wise. I was at the top in terms of rankings and was always doing great. I loved going to work because I got to help people and was having fun and felt supported.

That changed last year when I got a new manager. The most descriptive word I can use can probably be complacent. I remember talking to them and telling me ""I don't care about the numbers"". I thought hearing those would actually be helpful in terms of not being stressed but for the past few months it actually felt more detrimental because I wasn't getting proper coaching or advice on how to do well at my job. They have no social skills or even a drive to actually succeed at work at all which is essential in our field of work that involves a lot of relationship management with clients. Like they were just in for the paycheck. It drained me because I felt useless.

On the other side though my colleagues came to me instead to be their informal leader. Whenever they needed help with clients or tasks, I am the one they go to. This made my performance dip even more because I was juggling two things at once. It just became the opposite of the work environment I wanted.  Communications-wise I don't think she is as receptive. In a naive, holier than thou, I am right way of functioning who subtly disregards people with a smile on their face.

I feel stupid for saying this but I still want to try to work together and make things work but should I? How do I talk to the manager and say that they need to change?

1fxvueg,Hold out for partner opp?,"I have a good career in a niche industry that is very hard to get a foothold into. The fact I’ve done it is big, but now I don’t know what’s next. I’ve been at my company for 10 years. 

Feeling the itch lately to leave - for many many reasons. It’s a great job, culture. I’ve received many promotions and raises over the years too. But last two promotions were symbolic - my role and work didn’t actually change, and that’s because I already have as much responsibility as I can.

The only next step is partnership. Of course responsibilities would change but most of the work would not. 

The partnership opp has been discussed extremely vaguely. The founder cannot deal with speaking about it - it represents their retirement and age. They are also just bad at being concrete in general, with everything they do, even with clients. 

All i know is that it’s on the horizon, I’m in the equation (along with 4 other people), and   that’s it. (From my understanding of the business, I don’t think partnership would result in a huge boom in my income actually)

There are a bunch of reasons I have been considering changing jobs. One reason is that I am beginning to dislike the industry (at the same time I feel like I know it inside and out which makes it hard to leave).  I’ve been thinking about leaving for 4+ years, but all of the positive things above have made me pause. And I wonder if I am crazy for leaving when a partnership is likely on the table. 

If I change industries (same work, different industry) the pay is generally 20% higher right away, which is also a factor I’m considering.

1fxvnec,Thinking of stepping down from a research tech position to an admin assistant. Where can I go with an admin role?,"Hi all a bit of background to the question (if you need context):

* I have been struggling with the ""what's next"" question for several months at this point if not years...  I graduated from uni with a degree in environmental sciences in 2020. I thought this was the degree to take to help the world lol...Long story short, the real world doesn't work the way I wished. 
* Science and math do not come naturally to me so I've always had to work extra hard in these subjects. 
* My work environment has a lot of toxic egos - if you don't think like everyone else they become very frustrated or treat you like you're dumb
   * in addition, I was recently diagnosed with ADHD which means 
      * my processing time for certain things is a bit different which can frustrate people in science to a higher degree (very little patience in science)
      * makes this decision making process a bit harder
* current role is very stable but I'm withering away. I am depressed af, I have gotten sick so many times this year (more than I have in a life time) due to a negative work environment 

All this to say, I discovered that science may not be the right career for me. After looking within, and thinking of the skills that come naturally to me, i've been thinking of stepping down from my job as a research technician and applying for an administrative assistant role. 

I like working with people (I am quite bubbly), I love being creative, I love the paper-work aspect of my current role, I like being organized, and I like structure. Due to my ADHD having to work against my natural skills burns me out A LOT and life feels miserable, i am genuinely depressed. 



ANYWAY I would like to know if there are opportunities for advancement if I switch to an administrative assistant role? I don't want to feel stuck again.

1fxut1u,Looking for assistance ,"Has anyone taken a promotion that ended up being the wrong career move?

I work for a large company and their headquarters is in another country that speaks a different language. My team in my country is quite small though. 

A role opened up for a senior role as my manager got promoted, and so they created a new role to backfill. I applied for it, and they had said this role was going to be built while I was in it,and I'd be working with alot of people from the other country who don't really speak English.

In hindsight I shouldn't have applied for the job because 1) the language issue was a well known problem within the company and 2) I had a coworker who was I think would've done a better job. I was career hungry and wanted to see if I could get it, which I did. 
3) if I didn't take the promotion then I would've still held a relatively senior role but would've been chilling as the job was hella easy. 

The decision to accept really fucked me from a career pov. I was in the senior role for about a year and a half and learned nothing, did nothing, and had no guidance. My days were filled doing the bare minimum because there wasnt a focus on the team in my country, and I couldn't be part of any strategy meetings because they would always be in a different language.. Now I feel like I don't really have the skills to be in a senior role because I didn't learn shit, and I'll be applying to senior roles at other organizations.. 


Now the company did a reorganization and my position was terminated. They company gave me a temporary role for about 9 months with a demotion in title but not in pay, and they've extended it a few times. They just offered me another temporary position for 9 months but it'll be a significant demotion with a large pay cut.

I'll basically go from a senior role to a coordinator role if I accept this new temp position. It'll hurt my ego, it'll hurt my wallet, but I'll still have a job.. My salary is going to go from 93K to 70K per year which is going to really hurt. 

Anyways looking to see if anyone's been in a similar situation and also looking for guidance.

1fxt99z,data analyst to UX designer in 2024,"Hi, I’m reaching out to you designers for help.
I’m a 25-year-old Data Analyst who just graduated. I have about 3 years of experience in this field, but I feel burned out. I’m not sure if it’s too early to feel this way, but that’s how I feel.
I studied human-computer interaction for my bachelor’s degree. I learned a lot about UX design, perception psychology, computer graphics etc. For my master’s, I pursued big data analysis. During my studies, I landed my first job, and I currently have 3 years of experience in data analysis.

But I feel like I hate it.

I can’t stand looking at Excel, cloud, numbers, etc. I know I’ll never be good at it because it just doesn’t interest me. I don’t have a analytical mind, that's for sure. I dream of doing something creative and, kind of, artistic.

So lately I’ve been wondering if I should switch to UX, UI, graphic design, or something similar. I started refreshing the knowledge from my bachelor’s studies and began learning Figma. I feel like I finally enjoy it. I’m not struggling, and the learning comes easily to me. I’m aware that every job has its pros and cons; I’m not idealizing UX. There are deadlines, client confrontations, and a lot of hard work. I just know that working with data no longer interests me at all, and I don’t want to do it.

My question is: is it hard to break into UX in 2024 at 25 years old with zero commercial experience? What would you recommend I do in my case? My current job is stable (well, as stable as anything can be these days) and provides me with a decent salary. I know that if I switch fields, I’ll be starting from scratch.

I see a lot of posts from people who have been looking for a job in this field for about a year without success. It's terryfying. I’ve read that right now we have the worst moment to start over and that the demand for UX designers is decreasing.

Thank you all :(",RegularCalendar19,1,1.0,1,1728255274,2024-10-06 22:54:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fxt99z/data_analyst_to_ux_designer_in_2024/,10,2024
1fxt4tu,"I need to quit my current job, but I already had started the new one ","Hi, 

I am going to need some advice on the matter as I got myself into pretty tricky situation. 

2 months ago I got a ""you have to be an idiot to miss that"" job offer. I thought twice before accepting as the new position is more of a freelancing (business contract) and if I couldn't manage with the work I would put myself in a real bad position. (I should say I live in Europe)

  
So I figured that since the both contracts are not conflicting with each other legally, I could take some vacation or sick days to see what the freelance job is all about and if ideally could keep them both. Reason for that at my current job the work is not that much, meaning once or twice a month I get some tasks to be done, in the meantime I could just die of boredom. Which could allow me weaving on two looms.

  
Did as planned and saw that its impossible to keep both as working hours align and new freelance position can absolutely keep me occupied for straight 8 hours. That's great, exactly what I was looking for. 

  
But here is the issue: my time from vacation days is up. Tomorrow is my last vacation day and I have the following options: extend paid vacation days to the maximum, turn in my leave notice (1 month) and take the rest of my notice period in unpaid days; or take sick leave and do the same. 

  
Whatever option I choose, I will have to face the moment where I tell my manager I am quitting. What's making this hard for me is that the workplace itself is very nice, my manager, my colleagues are great people, I've never had any issues with them, but all of that will not pay off the dementia I am going to develop 2 years later if I stay there,  and I have no idea how to break the news or what to say exactly. 

  
Should I be honest about having already stared a new job? Should I try to bring up the topic to figure some arrangements out so they dont have to find another person to take my place since I would gladly work 2-3 hours more when needed? Both positions are not entry-level and knowing the job marked around, I am certain that it's would be nearly impossible to find another person for such short time. 

  
Any advice would be appreciated.

  
P.S. I am an IT.",serpent_decker,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1728254903,2024-10-06 22:48:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fxt4tu/i_need_to_quit_my_current_job_but_i_already_had/,10,2024
1fxs4ud,Feel Like I Chose the Wrong Degree,"Hey everyone,

I went with a Computer Science degree thinking it’d give me a shot at remote work and a stable career, but now I’m starting to think I might’ve messed up. Funny thing is, I don’t even care about working remote anymore. I actually like coding, but I’ve realized I’m way more into building physical systems and doing hands-on stuff. Looking back, I feel like I should’ve gone for something like mechanical or electrical engineering instead. I’ve thought about switching to engineering so many times, but I never pulled the trigger, and now I’m stuck with a lot of regret.

I’m 28 now, and it feels like I’m too deep into this to make a change, especially now that I have the degree. I'm struggling to get out of my own head, and I don't know how to move past this. It feels like I’ve wasted time, and no matter how much I try to reassure myself that things will work out, it doesn’t seem to help with the regret. I just want to move forward and find some fulfillment without constantly worrying about what I could’ve done differently. I want to accept my decisions and not be weighed down by them.

1fxrcvj,Contract Position,"This will be a long post.

So I had a full time position in the automotive industry. I was successful enough to move up the ranks from a lube tech and reach manager of a dealer service department. I was reached out one day by 2 recruiters. One was offering a full time job and the other a contract position for one year. I had been wanting to maybe leave the company at was at so it kind of worked out. Anyways, I entertained both and did interviews and the one with the full time position was looking for someone with a bachelors which I don’t have. So shortly after they sent me a rejection letter and was stuck with the contract position. I decided to take it the contract role since they were doubling my salary but I’d take it at a pay cut since as a manager I was on commission and was making 110000-120000 a year. The contract offer me a base pay of 75000 and another 5000 in bonus money with reimbursements and my foot in the door at a big automotive industry company. I haven’t been at the company long, but the more I spend time in the more I like the company and want to stay in it but I have a feeling the contract may be renewed but will never amount to a full time position for some reason. I guess my real question is should I be actively looking to leave already, or just wait and try to make it a full time position? I don’t even know if it’ll ever come to pass but what are my chances it does? Has anyone been in a similar situation? I have been trying to get in elsewhere where but gave up due to the competitiveness of the positions I’m applying for and wanting to see if I have a future with this contract turning full time.

1fxr2en,"I'm not content in current role, but not sure what direction to go in or how to get where I want to be. ","My current position is not very fulfilling and is really starting to drain the life out of me due to how much of a bad fit it is. I went to school for 6 yrs to get my BS/MS specifically for this role and realized the customer service part of the job specifically with the population I am working with is not compatible with who I am as a person. Additionally, I have not and will not be trained/certified to perform the job duties in my job description anytime soon due to lack of training/seats available. I interned in the same role for two summers during undergrad and it was a mess then but I blamed it mostly on covid and thought it would be better now.

I have ADHD and am only motivated by a challenge and novelty and by things I am passionate about. I was originally very passionate about my career but the system is broken and it has killed any faith I have in humanity...I know I sound dramatic but I really believed in this cause and to find out that it's all just a smoke screen has really upset me. 

In grad school I went to a lot of networking events, conferences, spoke with a lot of scientists and higher-ups and really enjoyed talking to those people who actually wanted to make a difference, where I am now is the complete opposite, just a team full of people who don't care and just want to collect a check and do as little work as possible. 

My current role is very understaffed, over-funded, and I am unable to provide any value to the team because they won't even acknowledge my previous education/experience and they are trying to mold me into something that I am not and never will be based on my personality and interests. My coworkers and supervisors straight up told me my education was worthless (it was required to apply) and that I am essentially worthless until I get more on the job training.

I have always been a high-achiever, thinking outside the box, told by several past employers that I ""need to be the Indian not the chief"" which I understand means that I naturally gravitate towards leadership roles? I am always thinking several levels above where I am at, how to optimize a task or make it more intuitive or efficient. I think about how to fix organizational issues, improving the culture, or how to retain employees who are in my position. I really struggle with the monotonous everyday tasks that I don't find interesting. 

I want to find a career that plays to my strengths and that still fits into my passion of making the world a better place...but I'm not sure how to get there if I'm struggling in the entry level positions I don't know how to get to a career where I can actually implement change and optimize things. 

If you have been in a similar situation and can provide me with some pointers I would really appreciate the wisdom.

I am not sure what to put for my title however, because ""internship"" seems to imply that I would only be at the business for at most a few months, ""apprenticeship"" would suggest I was getting paid and put on track towards an actuarial job, ""volunteer"" is apparently illegal for a for-profit corporation, but it also isn't a full-time job because I never got paid a salary (I've lived with the owners/my parents the whole time and they were supporting me financially).

If he hears me typing on the keyboard, he asks me what I'm writing. Every time I stand up, he asks where I’m going—like, are you my dad? Leave me alone!

He's also super stubborn for no reason and often wrong. If you try to make him understand something, he gets offended. It's really frustrating.

I loved the work and thought I’d be too busy with research to dwell on how much I hated the town/state I was stuck in. It took a huge toll on my motivation/happiness but i knew what I was getting into and didn’t quit the program  until a series of chemical safety violations made me decide that this degree was not worth my health (I’m 24 F, worried about future fertility and general health) and worked directly with organic solvents and also got exposed to pesticide residues in the greenhouses due to mistakes made by coworkers. Now I am applying to similar jobs and am struggling to frame why I left the program to potential employers. I tend to over explain and want to honestly convey why I left without throwing my lab under the bus or sounding immature. Should I not even mention the factor of location and just focus on the lacking chemical safety culture or will that make me sound like someone who might blow the whistle/quit again over safety concerns. I quit after the third chemical safety incident I was personally involved in over 2 years, I didn’t take leaving my position lightly but couldn’t stay after the third strike. Will calling out the safety culture as the main reason I quit be a red flag to employers? Would I sound uncommitted if I mentioned wanting to live in a different climate as the main reason I wanted to leave before the third safety mishap made up my mind?

1fxmos2,Anyone laid off at late 30s but took it as an opportunity to work on totally new field that you wanted?,"Sometimes I see some people laid off all the sudden and it seems things got screwed especially when they get older.

But then I heard some people took it as an opportunity to try to work on what they actually wanted to do in their lives. 

Sounds great but I know it is not as great as it seems in reality.

Recently I have seen my coworkers who were always great got fired all the sudden or at least not expected, and I am scared just thinking about this could happen anyone depending on situation.

It sounds silly for me to worry about it yet but I do feel like I need to have a backup plan just in case.

I imagined what if this happened to me, what would I do?

Would I try to get any job asap or take it as a chance to focus on learning what I always wanted to try and enter the new field?

Honestly I have no idea.

And I do have something I always wanted to try and am working on it

But I work over 10 hours everyday in my current job.
And I mostly have 1-2 hours to work on what I dream about after my day job, which isn't enough.

And I don't see this amount of time I put in my dream career wouldn't get me where I want to be anytime soon. 

So I was curious if there are any people laid off but then they took it as the last chance to put all their efforts to switch their careers.

And I was wondering if this is really a thing that many people made it work in real life.

Or they still got a part time job at least.

1fxm2f8,Introvert struggles as starter in corporate job,"I have started working in a junior position at a major corporate firm about 5 months ago. For the most part, it has been very good. My manager has complimented my attitude and said that, if I keep developing as I am, my temporary (12 months) contract will be made indefinite.

However, things have gotten tougher over the last month. My immediate senior has been critiquing me relentlessly, without balancing this with some more positive words etc. 

I notice that I am now more nervous/anxious/intimidated as I discuss projects with her, which is actually making me make mistakes. Ex. she told me to read a contractual clause - normally no big deal, since I am used to it as a law grad. However, with her looking over my shoulder, I became too anxious and answered too quickly without reading the full paragraph - making me answer wrongly.

I feel like I need to improve primarily in the sense of staying calm and taking my time to answer, even when someone is pressuring me/looking over my shoulder as I work.

1fxlddq,How can Ieverage myself in event management/design to advance my career internationally?,"Hey everyone,

As a 21-year-old woman in America, I'm currently on my third internship in event management and design, with a potential fourth and maybe even fifth one lined up. These internships involve working at smaller events and festivals ranging from 400 to 20,000 to 25,000 attendees. I also have been doing part time event work with my local goverment and doing design work for them. I'm set to graduate next year and I'm eager to further my career in event management and design. I'm particularly interested in international opportunities and have researched internship abroad programs.

One of the challenges I've encountered is that many of these international opportunities seem unpaid or the programs cost more than my titution, and I'm concerned about the financial implications. I'm seeking advice on how to network with companies overseas and research paid internship opportunities while I finish up my college education. I'm determined to secure a substantial abroad internship that will allow me to leverage my skills and experience to work on even larger events after college. I'm not picky about where I go, but I would love to see Asia. Visa applications seem complex, but I mostly want to further my career in events that I can leverage for a bigger career.

1fxkjk6,Aged 29 career change to structural engineer?,"Hi,

I appreciate it's 'late' to begin trying to become an engineer, but I am willing to change as I cannot continue with my current career.

What are the steps/qualifications I need to achieve in order to pursue a career change to become a structural engineer or an a type of Civil Engineer?

Any advice is appreciated!

I previously posted about my reasons why and my background below:

**Background/Current:**  
I live in the U.K, aged 29, male and I am a carpenter who began as an apprenticeship and now run my own business for a total of 12 years with the last 5 years being entirely my own clients and specializing in the higher-end bespoke made fitted furniture.

I run a small carpentry/fitted furniture business where I design, make and install kitchens, fitted wardrobes, alcove units, bookcases etc. Starting from a carpentry apprentice and working my way up to owning my own workshop and running a business. I handle every part of the process from design, manufacture and installation, as well as quoting, client meetings etc.

**Reason:**  
Due to the recent economic times here in the U.K, people aren’t spending, the business rates are going up and I cannot charge more as the competition and market is very tight and people are under-cutting just to stay afloat. This drives the overall market price down and people’s perception of what things should cost.

The stress and annual return of the job isn’t worth it anymore and after running everything for the last 5 years, things aren’t getting any better. I love the job, but I need to move on.

**Experience:**  
The nature of my role as a business owner means I have a wide range of skills I’ve built up over the years such as sales, management, client relations, designing with Google Sketch-Up, experience with Microsoft office such as Excel, Word etc. I started as a carpenter’s apprentice and worked my way right through to owning my own shop, which shows dedication and determination.

1fxk76g,Should I take a step back in engineering,"At my first job post graduation, almost at a year. A company and role I applied to, and never made it past the application process, reached out to see if I was still interested and would be available to interview with management week after next or so. Per online resources, as accurate as they are, it would be at least a 20% pay cut as well as relocating to what appears to be a slightly cheaper area. 

Current role is a step up from entry level, but is hard to say what the career path looks like within the role, and probably would have to look elsewhere to progress.

New role is entry level, and from what I can tell of the description, seems to align a bit more with my skills and previous work experience. As for career progression, unsure without having a more formal meeting with HR and management.

1fxjupe,25M looking for advice. Which path should I take?,"Apologies in advance for the long post. I’ll explain my situation and then list my questions. 

25M living in Alberta. Recently started my 2nd year of nursing school, but dropped out. Largely due to ongoing struggles with anxiety/depression. I also dropped out of university at 21 for similar reasons. 

Right now I have a hard time seeing myself returning to nursing school. The content and work was somewhat interesting but I spent much of the time anxious, stressed, and not really enjoying it. Right now, I don’t feel like care about nursing enough to go through another 3 years of that. I have dropped university twice now and if that happened a third time… I don’t want to think about it. 

Fortunately, I have some work experience that has put me in a decent financial position and might help me move in another direction. I was a wildland firefighter for 5 summers and also have worked a couple other jobs where I got some experience operating equipment such as forklifts and skid steers. 

Right now, I’m planning on taking care of my mental health issues for the next few months and then potentially looking for some sort of apprenticeship in the new year. I’m leaning towards working in the trades because university hasn’t worked for me and I can see myself enjoying and being good at the manual tasks involved with being a tradesperson. Thanks to my previous work experience, I am very aware of the problems that can come with working on a crew for long shifts in remote areas, and the other BS that happens at any workplace. So I definitely understand that no matter what path I choose, it won’t be perfect. 

My questions are:

- Should I pursue a trade or just grind out another 3 years of nursing school?
- Are there any other careers that I should look into?
- Any other advice for my situation?

Thanks!

I am probably going to aim for HR but I’m scared I won’t land it. If I’m really desperate I’ll take sales, marketing, anything as long as I can move out. I’m lucky I’m currently in a dorm but I don’t want to go back home. My biological mom is expecting me to be her retirement and that’s the only reason she gave birth to me and helps me. (I’m half asian.) My step-mom puts her kids over me, doesn’t care much for my graduation or choices. I don’t think she cares for me at all, just sees me as an obstacle between her marriage. She’s always trying to subtly stir something negative about me to my dad. And none of them will help me with anything besides getting this degree. My dad also treats me like a burden when it comes to my birthday or appointments. I suggest things like uber or doing it myself and he always says no. 

I’m scared when my dad passes I will have no one to help me basically. I just don’t know what to do. I feel too stupid to try and study something harder. I have a chronic illness that makes it dangerous to drive and gets worse when my GAD is triggered. I’m going to therapy but I feel like my time is ticking. I know when I’m 24 I won’t have my parents’ benefits anymore. I don’t want to fail and waste more time. I’m not sure if Cybersecurity is the career I want, so I wanted to try a low risk option first but it’s late now.

1fxiz45,Not smart enough/high anxiety issues ,"I really need some advice. In the past I had jobs that I excelled and I had confidence and was able to perform well. It was not until I began my RN career that I started exhibiting a lot of anxiety. Part of the reason being that the stakes were high and I didn't want to mess up. The other reason that a lot of the doctors and other nurses we're just plain mean and did well to make me feel small and inadequate. A couple other nurses even told me that it seemed like they wanted me to fail. Overall though I just felt overwhelmed with the amount of information I had to know and the intensity of the job so I ended up quitting. 

I then self taught myself some basics on networking and ended up landing a job as an engineer (routers, switches, etc.). I thought this would be less high stress and it was in the sense that no one could potentially die, but the amount of information and the things I had to know was immense. A completely different language. After a few years I ended up landing another position that involved more of app and presentation layers. Again feeling overwhelmed with the amount of information I have to learn. Some of the engineers have told me that it might be a solid decade to truly feel comfortable which is a scary thought. 

There was an outage last week that had high level execs (VPs, directors, etc.) on the call and I was supposed to be managing the incident and I completely dropped the ball. My manager has been very supportive and helping me build my confidence, but I really let him down and made our team look bad. I am really embarrassed to the point where I feel like I need to quit because I cannot handle high intensity issues.  

So for myself personally I think I am smart, but when it comes to high stakes issues where everyone is looking to me for the answers I completely shut down and I get very anxious. Idk why I am like this. I used to be a very confident person in other jobs I held, but I suppose that was because they were more basic in nature and I wasn't ever put on the spot to fix something. I am just feeling so defeated. I don't think I have the mental capacity to handle jobs like this. I work part time at a grocery store and never have anxiety in that role so I am thinking of going in that direction. Something simpler like a mail carrier or something like that. 

Not sure if anyone can relate or can give me some advice. I know most of it is probably from my own self fulfilling prophecy that I am going to fail and then end up doing it bc I don't believe in myself or something. I just don't know how to get out of the anxiety other that to quit. In my head I feel like if I did something more basic I would more peace.

I need some advice on applying for a position where I don't meet all the qualifications. Is it ever okay to do this? To potentially show that you are serious about future growth at a company?

She is not interested in the position at all because she is new to her role. However, I do have an advanced degree in the field with 11 years experience with an quite an exceptional track record.

I suppose my biggest concern is coming off as delusional or ego driven. I know my chances of landing this are really low, heck I don't necessarily even qualify for an interview. However, I know I could do the job and I'm completely ready for more responsibility. Is applying a bad idea, will it reflect poorly on my character?

1fxgvhk,How can I ask for a salary adjustment? ,"How to ask for a wage adjustment
I 29F just started a new job and I think I messed up. I quit my soul sucking job of 5 years because I wanted to go into medical sales. I am friendly and have a bubbly personality so I thought sales would be a perfect fit for me. Only issue, no one would hire me without previous sales experience. I completed a pharmaceutical sales certification as many companies suggested I do but still nothing. Finally I interviewed for a sales job for a small medical office. I got a job but not the one I wanted. They said that they liked me so much that they wanted to offer me a position with their new program. I jumped at the chance, thinking that this position was going to be my start into medical sales. I accepted the payment for this job based off of the other one thinking that I would be getting commission as well. In short I accepted $26 an hour which was a dollar more than I was making previously. Here’s where I messed up. Previously I was working a crazy amount of overtime 90-110 hours every pay period. At this job there is no overtime and I’m losing $200-600 dollars a check compared to my old job. I’m having to dip into my savings to keep my head a float which is not sustainable long term. I checked the pay range for this new position that I’m working and their salary range is 60,000-75,000. I’m in a “probation”/ training period for three months but at the end of three months I’m going to ask for a wage adjustment. Any advice on how I should bring this up to my new bosses?

1fxcwxv,Operations and Logistics internship at a FAANG company benefit a mechanical engineer,"Hi guys,
I hope you're doing well. I'm a mechanical engineering student who recently received an internship offer from a FAANG company. However, I'm a bit skeptical about this internship.

1. Is it worth pursuing as a mechanical engineer?
2. What's the ROl on this internship?
3. Does working at Amazon offer significant benefits?
4. If you worked at amazon and apply for future vacancy at amazon is it easier to get in?

I spoke to several engineers who had this internship, and they said, ""We didn't have any other choice; this was the only option."" For me, this internship means a lot, so hearing that was a bit disheartening. I see myself working at Amazon in the future as a PM.

1fxaucg,How to get more money as a full-time employee ,"Hello guys, 
I am from Europe, the eastern one and I work as full-time SW Developer at a huge corporation. It pays my bills, but I am always running little short by the end of each month and also it literally just pays the bills. 

I am working on junior position for over a year now, so I will be asking for a raise by the end of this year. But still, I think I won’t get much and little more money is always welcomed. 

I was thinking going part-time as extern specialist, just as my class-mate buddy who does this and makes almost three times as much. 

But by doing this I would be hourly payed, have no benefits and no guarantee of not loosing my only income entirely and would have to do taxes myself. 

I don’t know what should I do to get more money. People on the internet says, that I could: 

1. Create tutorials (i dont wanna create yet another something.js tutorial…)
2. Teach someone personally (great! Where do I get my “victim”?)
3. Create a Sass (figures, but its really time-consuming)
4. Bug hunting (searching for sw issues online and getting rewards) 

I know that people in my industry also go away after a year or so to a different employer because of better offerings, but I really like my employer and my job.

I own 50% of the current business I own with a partner that has an employee mindset. Has not advanced our company in 4 years, any big accomplishment or growth has been on my part. Truth me told, we’re taking a negative every month for the past 6 months from his part of the business, and nothing has gotten better. It’s the same old “it’ll get better, I’ll do better, I’m trying, etc etc. I’m tired of carrying about the baggage of it, snd not getting any real help and not being able to scale more because of him. 
I gave him an option to sign over his part of the business & give him 6 months pay even though he isn’t making any money or doing anything to better us. (Nice friend I am right? 😂) 
I’m able to pay myself a “salary” of 69k a year, air quotations because that’s what I’d pay myself if it’s doable weekly. Some weeks, no pay, sometimes less, but no more than 69k a year. 
-
I worked as a sales manager before this and I quit to start my own business obviously with a friend. 
The year that I quit I made an annual pay of just over $108k. Base pay + commission. 
Last week I had got a text that the current sales manager was quitting to go into another industry and I was offered my job back if I was interested. 
The job offer was 80k, plus 20% commission of profit. Quarter, and yearly bonuses & room for growth. So if commission was over $6700 a month, I would be paid the difference at the end of the month. 
-
I would have to relocate which would be paid for, and hotel would be paid for up until I could find a place to move into if nothing was available by the time I took the job. 
It will take roughly a month to 6 weeks to line out everything to sign over the business. 
I don’t want anything from my business, simply sign over my 50% and be done with it all. 
A lot easier said than done, but it is doable.

1fx3t4k,"Lack of Advancement, Feel Taken Advantage of","I'm currently in a mid-level position at a Fortune 100 company and have been here for over 10 years. Throughout my time here, any advancement I’ve achieved has come from me stepping into the role I wanted before it was officially mine—and even then, I’ve had to have some uncomfortable conversations with my boss to push for promotions.

A few years ago, I took on all the responsibilities of a senior team member who left, yet management hired someone else internally without even posting the job. It was only after I expressed my frustration that they promoted me, almost as an afterthought.

Now, I find myself in the same situation again. For the past year and a half, I’ve been doing more senior-level work, consistently exceeding expectations. When a senior team member recently left, I was able to interview for the role but was ultimately passed over for an external candidate after two rounds of interviews.

I’m beyond frustrated by the lack of upward mobility, especially after a decade of loyalty, hard work, and overachievement. I’ve had to fight to even be considered for roles I’ve essentially been doing already, and it’s wearing me down. While I know I’m fortunate to have a stable job at a strong company, I’m seriously starting to wonder if it’s time to invest the same energy into finding opportunities elsewhere.

1fx0wt8,As deflated as an old beach ball,"Hi all, 

I’m looking for some advice on a situation that’s left me feeling conflicted. I’ve been working at a mid-sized company for a couple of years in a somewhat niche role. When I was hired, I was told the company valued career growth and invested in employee development. That’s one of the main reasons I joined. However, I recently learned that my colleague, who was hired after me with the same title, was promised a promotion to a senior title from the start, despite the fact that I have previous experience in the role in a different industry.

Recently, that colleague was promoted to a senior title and it’s thrown me a bit, given that I’ve been proactive in communicating to my department head my desire to take on more strategic responsibilities and grow into a senior role. I had been led to believe there were opportunities for career growth here, but now I’m feeling like my path was blocked by a promise made to someone else without a fair assessment of both of our contributions.  Looking at it from my side - I delivered a project successfully that saved money and the majority of the company relies on, and my colleague delivered a project that cost the company thousands of dollars and is now abandoned.  On top of this, I’ve been increasingly sidelined from a project to incorporate more people into the system I implemented.  It feels like my input is being minimized by them purposefully excluding me from meetings and I can’t help but wonder if it’s for visibility purposes now that this has come to pass.  So does it really all come down to being the person that will ‘play the game’ the hardest? They were apparently meeting with People and Culture almost monthly to talk about a promotion.

My manager suggested that I reach out to PnC to discuss my growth path and my unease about how things progressed, but I’m hesitant about whether that will help or escalate the situation. I like the people I work with and I’m good at what I do, but it’s hard to stay motivated when it feels like my growth is being stifled. Plus, you can’t un-ring the bell, they already promoted my colleague ahead of me and our department can’t support having two senior titles. I don’t say senior role, as the work is exactly the same, it is essentially a raise and a notch on the resume so to speak, but still - some formal acknowledgment of my contributions would be nice. 

Has anyone else been able to navigate a similar situation? Should I keep pushing for my development here, or is this a sign that it’s time to start looking for new opportunities? I’d really appreciate any insights or advice.

1fx0mx9,Looking for a better opportunity ,"I’ve been working remotely with the same company for the past six years. I was an actual employee up until about two years ago, when I moved out of state. 

Now I am a contract worker because the company doesn’t have a tax contract with the state I live in, but I guess they really needed me as no one can really do everything I do for them, and even if they could, the team in our division is pretty small (3 people including me) and the other two really don’t have time to take on the tasks I perform in addition to their own roles.

So it’s been about two years working for this company as a contractor. I’ve lost access to all benefits obviously. This company also has a pretty slow accounting department when it comes to contractors—I get paid about once a month (sometimes over a month) and it’s killing me. I’ve been extremely patient and understanding about it because I really like the other two people in my team, and I know it’s not their fault I don’t get paid on time. 

But I have a kid now and I *need* health insurance and I *need* to get paid on a consistent basis. I wish I could say I’m living paycheck to paycheck but with a month in between I definitely don’t make it that far.

Im also still making the same hourly wage I was making six years ago when I started—actually I asked for a raise maybe two years ago and they offered me a dollar. So currently I’m making $26/hr. I’m not sure if that’s normal or not. When I started it seemed like a lot of money but now with inflation and kids it seems like nothing. They can only offer me part-time hours right now so I feel like I’m cramming every assignment into my 20-hr work week. Some weeks are easier than others.

The most stressful aspect of this for me is that I’m working from home and raising a toddler at the same time—I have to take multiple breaks throughout the day to tend to him and it ends up being that I pretty much spend my whole day working, even though I’m technically only supposed to be working 4 or 5 hours a day. I wake up, feed/dress baby, drop partner off at work, rush home to start working and deal with 20 interruptions over the next five hours until I’m done for the day. Every day for me just feels like nonstop work and I’m not even clocking more than 20 hours plus I can barely afford to feed my kid. It just feels like no payoff whatsoever. 

I can’t afford daycare at all, so that’s out of the question at the moment. What I want to know is: What other jobs should I be applying for, that I actually have a chance of getting?

My current title is Program Coordinator, and honestly I’m not really sure what that actually means, because I do so many different things for this company. I manage their social media, I do graphic design as needed for event promotion, I manage their blog, site updates, I edit and design their monthly newsletter and other promotional emails, and I handle miscellaneous internal email communications from time to time, plus some other tasks as assigned. My first thought was either marketing or something in that realm but to be honest I have no formal training and I only have an Associate’s in Filmmaking (I know) and a photography certificate, hence the graphic design. Most marketing gigs require a bachelor’s at least.

My strengths are writing and design. Do I have any chance at a career outside of this company? Any advice would be appreciated.",Feeling-Term-2786,1,1.0,0,1728163137,2024-10-05 21:18:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fx0mx9/looking_for_a_better_opportunity/,10,2024
1fwzs72,Feels Like I'm Being Set Up for Termination - How Can I Protect Myself?,"Hey Reddit,

I'm seeking advice on a tough situation at work that’s been causing me a lot of stress. I work for a corporation where the management of my department has a history of creating a paper trail to justify firing people. Lately, it seems like they’re creating a narrative that I'm doing insufficient work, despite my strong relationships with several leaders across the company and consistently high performance reviews. None of the partners I work with have raised any concerns either.

Recently, I received an email that hinted I’m still underperforming. They even mentioned the possibility of a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan) - something I have never seen or face in my 13+ year career. From what I’ve seen with colleagues, this feels like a setup for termination.

I'm in an at-will state (Michigan), so I know my options are somewhat limited, but I’m wondering if anyone has advice on how I can:

a) Avoid getting fired, or  
b) If termination is inevitable, maximize any protection or leverage I might have against the company.

Mentally, this situation is taking a toll on me, and the job market in my field is really tough right now, so I’m trying to explore any and all options before things get worse.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What steps did you take to protect yourself? Any insight would be appreciated. 

Thank you for taking the time to read and have a great day.",allstarmike,3,0.6700000166893005,7,1728160732,2024-10-05 20:38:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fwzs72/feels_like_im_being_set_up_for_termination_how/,10,2024
1fwyrch,Have you ever been let go after 3 weeks?,"I'm a bit in shock.

I honestly considered quitting this role because I was so stressed. But I need the work.

I was hired for a generalist position, whereas I've been a specialist for the last 10 years. It's a small firm, 20 people or less total.

I was pretty clear in the interview I'm capable of doing the work and open to learning, but don't want to disappoint anyone.

They said because I was very senior, they expected me to master their workflows in 3 days and be on projects immediately due to my salary.

I said at many points, I was not comfortable with taking on a project for a brand new client, since I'm brand new myself. I would prefer to work with a tenured employee and a longer term client, and by 30 days look at branching out solo. I was not comfortable representing the firm in meetings my first week.

The manager put me on the project anyway. I certainly could have done a better job - I made several mistakes. He claimed he was going to take the project from me, then got caught up with other clients for 2 days. So I did my best to manage it and get updates done, but fell short in several areas - it was my second week with the firm.

The manager comes across as very erratic - he goes from being very calm and nice, to literally shouting at his employees in seconds.  
He said on the call that I'm a great guy, he likes me, and the team thinks I'm a great fit. But basically needed to let me go because I failed to address one of his notes. From my point of view, it was his project - I was scared to make changes on my own without oversight and show them to the client.  
He also mentioned that this week they lost 3 long term clients. So I can't even tell if this is truly due to my performance, or mainly for financial reasons and they're masking it as performance to save face.

I think I've gotten along well with everyone on the team. They said they thought I fit in great. This is a fully remote role, so it's hard to say. The other obstacle was, I'm on PST and firm is on EST, so I was always 3 hours behind. It's manageable, but required an early start 6am my time being 9am their time. I've spent 10 years working 9-6pm PST, so 6-4pm is odd.

I don't know what I'm expecting to get out of this post other than to put my thoughts in writing. I'm just in shock that this happened.

1fwwbi5,I missed meetings and my boss is very mad at me,"TLDR: I missed a meeting already before because I saved it as CST instead of EST and THEN missed the next rescheduled one too, this time by oversleeping. The meeting was with an indirect supervisor and she had to tell my direct supervisor what happened, and my direct supervisor is really mad at me and subliminally reminded me I'm on probation as a new employee. My direct supervisor is even more mad since this happened a month after she warned me about tardiness after I was late to a tech team meeting for the first time.   
  
I work on solo projects that are being developed for my direct supervisor (tech) and indirect supervisor (marketing). I've been pulling all nighters consistently for months and sleeping on average about 4-5 hours trying to get these projects done as fast as I can to prove my worth to the team as the new employee, and my days and nights were all over the place and I had no weekends. 

I started having a 1:1 meeting with the indirect supervisor every week. One month ago, she accidentally woke up late and missed our meeting because she was on the road for a family trip (hybrid - WFH day). She apologized and rescheduled for the same day. 

Two weeks later, I accidentally moved our meeting on my calendar as starting an hour late (it got saved as CST instead of EST) and missed our meeting, and I apologized and told her this would never happen again and she rescheduled for the week after. She said it's fine and that she also missed our meeting before so there's no issue in rescheduling. 

That next week, on that exact day we rescheduled for, I woke up late by sleeping through my initial phone alarm and my phone died while I was oversleeping. 

I woke up two hours later than the scheduled 9 AM meeting, and when my phone turned back on, it was on fire from the emails and texts and messages of my direct supervisor telling me that my indirect supervisor told her I missed our meeting and that I was completely missing and unresponsive, and that they both were very worried and to confirm if I was okay. 

The indirect supervisor sent me an email at 9:10 AM saying ""It looks like you're not able to come to our meeting, let's reschedule for later this morning"" and sent me an invite for 10:30 AM, and then canceled that invite at 10:40. She also messaged me on teams and left a missed call at on my phone before it died. 

I called her immediately and apologized profusely, and then replied to the texts and emails letting them both know I'm okay and apologizing for what happened, and then sent an extra apology email to the indirect supervisor and we rescheduled. My direct supervisor didn't respond. 

Then a week later since the incident, I had my 1:1 meeting with my direct supervisor. We had a good conversation about my work progress during the first 45 minutes, but then during the last 15 minutes, she brought up what happened that day and told me that:

- She already warned me a month ago when I was late to our tech team meeting for the first time about tardiness

- The indirect supervisor told her that ""this is not the first time"" I missed a meeting and that she is shocked to hear I missed multiple meetings, let alone to hear it from someone else

- I disrupted her day by causing her to have to pause the meeting she was in with another person to call me and message me to check if I'm okay, but then I ""didn't even have \[my\] voice mail on"" which made her even more concerned

- That there ""wasn't even a prompt apology"" 

- She knows I'm young and this may be from inexperience but still doesn't make sense

- Our company has a one year probation policy for new employees and the manager has the option to lift it after only 6 months, and I just hit my 6 month mark, but this requires a performance review to be submitted by the manager. She does not want to lift my probation, and that she's telling me this because she wants me to know how serious this issue is

When I was apologizing to her again in our meeting, I said ""I know that an apology does not fix anything, but.."" and then she stopped me and said ""No, an apology helps, this does help. This does make it a \*little\* better"" and crossed her arms and pulled back. And then I finished the rest of my apology letting her know I'll be very careful and that I understand how serious this situation is, and we finished our meeting. 

It feels like my boss still has been avoiding me and the atmosphere has been quite icy, and other directors at work have started being awkward with me too. 

I just earned a new master's degree in tech much earlier than my company expected, and I'm not sure if the concern that I'm going to try to look for a new job is making the whole situation even worse. 

  
Will my direct supervisor hate me forever? I really wanted to make her proud and prove to the team that she is a great boss by doing good work, but I just screwed everything up and now she's really mad at me and everyone at work is slowly being awkward with me too as each week goes by. I feel horrible and I don't know what to do with myself.

1fwvw57,Digital analytics to move into tech as a data scientist?,"
I am looking for advice on whether making an internal move to a digital analytics team could be a way to get into tech DS/DA role later down the line.

I’ve been in the financial sector as a DS for 2 years and 5 years as DA.

In my current role as a DS, I work on building forecasting models to predict customer demand of products a bank would  offer. I like mine model development work, but I find the subject matter boring (banking products) and not sure if the subject matter will help me move into tech later on.

I have an opportunity to move internally to a digital analytics team as a DS (lateral move) where I'd be working with digital data (webpages & mobile apps) and perform short term analysis (think couple weeks to maybe a month at max). Although the role title is DS, this team does not do any type of modeling work and I am not sure if there will be appetite for modeling work down the line.

Would you recommend that I move to the digital data team to have exposure to digital data, which I think is way more customer facing than the data I've been working with (mainly backend process related data), or should I stay in my current role, where I will have opportunities to work on more technical models, and potentially implement some Gen AI use cases next year?",to_data,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1728150090,2024-10-05 17:41:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fwvw57/digital_analytics_to_move_into_tech_as_a_data/,10,2024

1fwupxj,Stuck at Security Engineer role,"Hello folks

I took me a long time to finally post it, but I am extremely frustrated by my current job and would like to get a piece of advice regarding my career state or at least confirmation of my ideas.

I am originally a software engineer from a slavic country, that is currently involved into a war, you know. Career wise the relocation would be the best way, but on the other hand I have family, friends, real estate here. Overall the life here offers much better comfort level than relocation to any country.

I have 10+ year of programming experience in a popular scripting language.The last three jobs were fully remote at US based companies, so I have a pretty fluent English, can effectively communicate with international colleagues and stakeholders.

Around 4 years ago I switched from the software development into Security Operations. It happened through learning offensive security, penetration testing and passing OSCP exam.I joined the current company as the first security engineer, and originally the plan was to build and lead the security department at this company. Unfortunately that didn't happen. There are no plans in extending security team here, so I have no possibility to grow as manager as I planned.

In terms of security engineering I don't have much challenges as well. The job position turned to be a mix of GRC manager and IT support. Most of the time I keep running the corporate security program, make sure that we comply with the required standards and manage user accounts across different services.There are almost no technical challenges, no experienced colleagues to learn from, and even the current routine is moving extremely slowly. E.g. I keep running the corporate bug bounty program, though no vulnerabilities are being fixed because the development department is fully focused on new features. In other words nobody gives a f@#k on security. The only value I bring is the result of the annual security audit performed by a 3rd-party firm.

I feel that I got stuck in my career. Even though I have a plenty of interests and desire to learn new stuff, I don't have a plan what to do further career wise.Applying to other jobs doesn't work, because my current location is a red flag for the majority of the companies. Working at a local company means decreasing my income by 3 times. So far the plan is to stick to the current job and keep learning new stuff, improving technical skills by reading books and passing online courses.

And what would you do?",mv0id,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1728146908,2024-10-05 16:48:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fwupxj/stuck_at_security_engineer_role/,10,2024

Now im in my 2nd month of training, im dreading every single day since the start. Tried to request a subject transfer to Food & Nutrition but not allowed to. My mental health started worsening to the point of affecting my self care, daily basic tasks and social relationships. My program leader, dean and career coaches advised me to consider quitting too seeing how i look very depressed. 

However, resigning means i have to pay up my tuition fees + salary ive received throughout my training so around 15-25k. But im willing to pay instalments as long as i get to feel happier. I plan to finish paying in arnd 2/3 years by taking double jobs. Ive been waiting for the outcome for my healthcare job interviews. I am concerned for myself as its been around 9 months that I have been feeling unfulfilled and now depressed.

What shld i do?",rinury,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1728146113,2024-10-05 16:35:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fwuexu/shld_i_break_my_bond/,10,2024
1fwu7qo,Wasting my time?,"Hello all, im currently a union apprentice plumber. I know that this is just not fitting for my personlity but I took it to learn. My real aspirations are more entrepreneurial and independence driven. Since I dont have a degree, I figured I try the apprenticeship, build up some experience and a fall back, then move into sales around the Mechanicals (Allows for me to build capital for business and develop skills to better build/run my own ventures.) 

Something I notice is that some of our estimaters and sales people arent even experienced in the trades, yet are making the deals.

My questions are:
1. Am I wasting time that can be fully dedicated to improving my sales skills?
 
2. Is learning the trade even necessary to be a knowledgeable salesman in the Mechanicals industry?

Kinda feel that I am blowing some valuable time that I could be getting somethings rolling had I been in sales already..

Your thoughts and opinions are appreciated.

At the same time, my parents also want me to go back to my country and help run the family business. Initially, this was gonna be my last option if I can’t find a job here. However, even after getting the offer, I still considering going back as it not the job I aim for when I graduate.

1fwstls,How do I go about getting an entry-level job as an applicant with no prior work experience and not having worked at all for 1 year after I graduated from college?,"How do I get a job? I'm asking this unironically as someone who hasn't even done an iota of research apart from a Google search.

I went to college in Mississippi starting in August 2019 and graduated August 2023 with a BS in biology (and a minor in chemistry). This was one of the main public flagship universities in Mississippi.

Yes, I graduated from college about 1 year ago, and all I've done since then is a single Google search maybe a couple of weeks ago after which I said fuck it and called it a day. And during college, I didn't network, worry about what kind of training I might need or internships I should take up, or do any research of the kind about getting a job after school.

I have 0 work experience in the biomedical field and never had a job.

I want to get serious and change my life for the better, and I desperately want to move from this shithole state.

So what's the best way to approach this? I'm eager to listen to any and all advice as someone who is so out of the loop on this.
Here are some questions I have:

1. Do I just basically make an account on one of the main job listing websites like LinkedIn and apply en masse to dozens (or hundreds?) of entry-level job openings related to my major that don't require prior work experience?

2. Will I be able to get any entry-level jobs considering I have 0 prior work experience whatsoever in my field and also
considering the fact I've been unemployed and have done pretty much nothing but stay at home for the 1 year since I've graduated from college?

3. I can't say I completely remember the skills and lab techniques I did in my classes. I'm sure though if I were exposed to it
again I could easily re-familiarize myself. Is there generally an expectation that a fair amount of on-the-job training needs to be provided for new employees for entry-level positions?

4. What implications could the fact that I've stayed home basically sitting on my computer out of the labor force not looking
for work at all for the 1 year since I've graduated have?

5. Would it be a better approach to not even think about a ""job"" yet and do an internship first? It seems an internship is a kind of job though.

6. What would I write for my resume, CV, and references if I've never had a job?

7. I've lived in Mississippi my entire life and went to college in-state, and, long story short, I hate living in
deep-red flyover country in Middle America and badly want to move out of this state. Honestly I want to live in New York, Miami, Los Angeles, or another large metro area, so will the fact that I would have to move across the country to, say, New York be a negative thing in considering hiring me?

8. What percentage of successful job offers should I expect for entry-level biomedical-related jobs in New York as an applicant
with no work experience and what percentage of successful job offers should I expect for entry-level biomedical-related jobs
in Mississippi as an applicant with no work experience? Is it possible I might get absolutely 0 job offers after applying
to hundreds of jobs in New York or Mississippi?

Thank you so much for the help!!!!",renchken,1,0.5699999928474426,4,1728141804,2024-10-05 15:23:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fwstls/how_do_i_go_about_getting_an_entrylevel_job_as_an/,10,2024

1fwrx1g,Feeling lost,"Cant find a path, need some advice.

Hello guys, i hope that you are doing great. 

So, i (29m) finished the faculty of orthodox theology with intention to become priest one day. After i got bachelor degree i decided that i dont want to become a priest because of some things. I was excelent student but right now i just dont want to become priest. Once i was younger that sounded like a great idea but now, no, its not. 

3.5 years ago i got a CEO personal asisstent job at one company where i did financial reports about incomes and outcomes, making order of the supply we need, because that was sales company (serious brand). I did numerous jobs in that company than i decided to leave because of some things that wasnt good. I ended up in construction materials company and currently i am public procurement manager and i got over 30 contracts and jobs done with many state institutions in last year. 

I love sales, i love public procurement system, i like to calculate things, i would like to become sucessfull export manager etc but i dont know what to focus on. I have degree in Theology and dont know what to do next to build myself in business. Should i pursue econonics master degree or something else? Should i become accountant, or manager, or public procurement specialist? I am not sure which way should i go, i feel kind a lost. I want to learn new things, but dont know what is that one thing i want to put focus on, i am so sad about that. My main goal is to find good job in the future that will pay me well for the skills i developed during my journey. 

Did you felt this way? How did you decided what you want to do?

1fwri2j,Is my boss micromanaging me?,"Hey, so this is my first job out of college, I got a job working in the business operations department at this company. I so far have really liked the company and the work, but I feel like I may be getting micro managed. I’m the only person in the position that I have, and my manager has never managed anybody in his life, i’m his first. I first noticed that he was very particular about certain things, and kinda a control freak. But I’m sorta the same way, so I cut him some slack. As I’m onboarding, for some reason I feel like there has been an issue every step of the way. And the conversations with my manager have me feeling really stupid always for some reason, even though I know i’m not. Either I don’t have the correct access, files wouldn’t download correctly, it’d take me a few minutes to understand the functions he was
Writing in excel. Mind you the job description asked me to be proficient in excel. My boss has always been “nice” but I always had the feeling that I was secretly really bothering him or frustrating him that I cannot work as fast as him, (mind you he’s been in that position for 3 years and me less than a month at this point) I also noticed he’d give me tasks, but keep a really close eye on what I was doing. At first I thought this was completely normal as it’s my first job out of college and besides having an internship in the same field I don’t know much. But then even at 90 days he’s writing me exact templates on how to write emails to people , and having me cc him on almost everything. That was the first red flag. The next was that that the more time I spent at this job (all under 3 months) the more my boss had going on and the less time he had to actually train me. I’d send him “assignments “ he’d ask me to do and he straightup would just never look at it. He’d also be so busy that he would tell me one thing, i’d go to do it and then when we’re reviewing he’d ask me why I did that and why i thought to even do that. When I would   say that he told me to do it he’d deny it. THIS IS ALL THE PREFACE MIND YOU. Now to where the  problem actually lies, we had an informal 90 day review to discuss my progress and how I can do better. He explains to me that there’s things he’s grading me on, that I have not learned yet, and shouldn’t know yet. He said it wasn’t my fault for not knowing these things and that they will come with time. Then gives me harsh grades on all sections. Surprisingly the sections that he graded as an A+ were my actual expectations for the 90 days, but the rest of the chart read needs immediate attention. His corrections were that “I don’t write things the same way he does and I need to start mimicking his verbiage more.” Next was that he didn’t like that I didn’t keep my excel table colors consistent when I pulled different reports. ( i either make them the standard blue or gray as he does) and that sometimes , even thought he pivot table shows the correct info, he doesn’t like the way I break it down. I took the comments to the chin and decided a plan of action to succeed. I was doing a recurring assignment where I was writing Commentary for employees. To match his verbiage I downloaded a previous report of ours to try to match how he writes things. I get a message from him saying “QQ I noticed you downloaded “xxx” file twice may I ask why you’re using that” I was in shock that he was tracking what I downloaded. I explained what I just told you that I was trying to do what he asked by mimicking his verbiage and he quickly backed off. Do you think it was overstepping by watching what I downloaded (given the file was directly related to my job and I use everyday) it weirded me out and scared me for what’s to come and I need to know if I’m crazy or not.

1fwrfda,Advice Needed: Frustrated with Disorganization at Work – Should I Stay or Go?,"Hey everyone, I’m in need of some advice about my current work situation. I’ve been working part-time at a company that’s been somewhat flexible with my availability, but I haven’t been scheduled for shifts this week, and this isn’t the first time something like this has happened.

The company is growing rapidly, but I’m running into constant issues with disorganization—everything from scheduling to how the store is run. There’s no proper training program, so I’ve still been doing training shifts, and the inventory system feels redundant and inefficient. It seems like their vision is really rigid, and they aren’t making efforts to streamline processes that could save time and improve things.

On top of that, my manager has reached out last minute to cover shifts on my day off more than once, and communication has been spotty at best. This is now the second week in a row where I haven’t heard from them about my schedule, and I’ve spoken with another manager who hasn’t had any luck getting answers either.

I like the people I work with, but I feel like I’m wasting my time waiting around for hours that might never come. I need the money, and I’m starting to think it might be better to move on to something more reliable.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Should I stick it out, or is it time to look for another job? I’m grateful for the flexibility, but I can’t afford to be stuck in this cycle.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts.",sxngoddess,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1728137905,2024-10-05 14:18:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fwrfda/advice_needed_frustrated_with_disorganization_at/,10,2024
1fwraia,Pro and Cons of Job Offer (Simplified Version),"I'm a contractor for the government and was recently offered a postion at a new company that works for the same client. The pay increase is good and it is an opportunity to branch out and improve my skill set, but the new role is in project management/coordination, which is something I don't have much experience in. Here's a simplified pro/cons of each position:

OFFERED JOB:

Pros:
- $20k salary increase (115k -> $135). I'm in a high cost of living city.
- Company culture seems to be better
- Allows me to increase my skill set in an industry (government consultant) where the more skills you have, the more value you have, opens other doors in the future, etc.
- This could be good for networking/career advancement
- 2.5 year fully funded contract
- Performance bonus (capped fairly low)

Cons:
- The work is in project managment/coordination on a large-scale project with lots of high-level stakeholders. I don't have any formal training, and I've never done well when asked to do this in the past. I'm more of an analyst/process designer vs. planning meetings, tracking deadlines, using spreadsheets, etc .
- At the pay level, I believe the ""learning curve"" window will be small. I feel like they want someone who knows what they are doing the moment they hit the ground, not someone who is going to require training to get up to speed.
- I've done low-level coordination and managment before and did not do well, imo. I struggled being organized and generally did not like the work.
- Increased workload.
- Being very organized. This is not a strong suit.
- Meetings. Meetings. Meetings.
- 15 days PTO (including sick leave)
- Increased health care costs by $100+ a month
- It's remote, but it sounds like I'll need to go to in-person meetings 2-3 times per month.
- I'll be on a different team but within the same agency. I might burn bridges with my current employer and the client if I leave, especially after they lost a lot of workers during layoffs.

CURRENT JOB

Pros:
- Been there for 4 years.
- Good relationship with clients and co-workers
- Very flexible 
- Unlimited PTO
- I enjoy what I do. I'm good at what I do.
- Not sure if this is a pro, but the client lost a lot of funding, but I made it through the layoffs.
- I'm largely left alone to do my work, and I like that. I interact with others, but it's nothing outlandish.
- 

Cons:
- While I've been largely spared, company culture is not good. There are instances of shocking unprofessionalism (laying people off via email, leadership feeling slighted over small things)
- No salary increase in two years (my increase in the two years prior was more than $30k over that time span).I'm not happy at my current salary, but I'm also not living paycheck-to-paycheck. I'm doing OK.
- No bonus structure
- I'm in a role where there probably is not much more room for growth and advancement.
- Contract is only fully funded for 1 year (with option to be renewed).

In a nutshell, I'm mostly interested in the offered role because of financials. I understand the growth opportunity is there and realize that I probably need to make a move to increase my salary and progress in my career, but I'm literally feeling dread when I think of the offered role. Part of it is that I fear change and have imposter syndrome, but the main driver is that the skill set required for this role IS outside of my wheelhouse, something I've never enjoyed, and I might have difficulty adapting. Had the offered role been all the same but in a similar role, then I think I'd be more inclined to take the risk.

Thoughts? Any project managers/coordinators want to weigh in on whether I can learn this role while working in it?

1fwr5ej,How to deal with toxic coworkers and team leader ,"Hi all, hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share my experience with my work and ask for advice from people who were in the same position.

For context, I graduated around a year ago, and after a few months, I landed an internship offer from an international corporation. I have been with them for 8-9 months now in the internship.

From the first time I joined, I learned from coworkers that there’s no chance of a full-time job as there’s no headcount for our department. I learned from them that they didn’t receive any raises in the last few years due to the budget constraints in our department. Keep in mind that they have been in the organization for 20-25 years.

I was aware of this, but I decided to stay as I thought it would be good for my CV, and I assumed that I would be learning. One of my coworkers was leaving for a specific time, and I learned his work to replace him. A few months passed, and I didn’t learn anything new other than his work. I started asking the others to teach me anything new, but there was no response. Then I learned that they didn’t want to teach me as this would increase the responsibility on their part, and they don’t get paid enough to do that (I overheard them thinking I didn’t speak their language 😂).

Regardless, I decided to ignore it and continued doing my work in silence. Keep in mind that I didn’t learn anything new during that time, other than what I learned in my first month. However, my work involved dealing a lot with one of the directors, and he wanted me in the organization. He fought with HR to increase the headcount and the budget for our department, and somehow after 9 months, I got a full-time job. I was happy, but now I just feel so unmotivated to work and crushed after their actions.

I just discovered that the team leader was against me getting the job because I’m a fresh graduate and not a professional. His logic is, ""She doesn’t know the work, and we will have to teach her, so it’s more work for us."" He thinks this budget should be used to increase their salaries rather than hiring someone with no experience. But the director ignored him and offered me the job anyway. I just feel crushed that I’m disliked in that department so much. Moreover, the team leader keeps picking fights for no reason.

For example, my work involves dealing with three people. Last week, we dealt with two and didn’t deal with the third one. Overall, the work was perfect, and everything was smooth. He came to me before the weekend to ask why we didn’t use the third person. I said he was busy, and I agreed with the others to replace him this week. The team leader made comments about how I’m not doing the job perfectly. It feels like no matter how hard I work, he doesn’t see any of it, and everything I do is just bad, whenever i ask any questions his response is just laughing and then he ignores my question, he came back few days later why didnt you respond to this email or do this task i remind him that i asked him about it and waiting for a reply regarding how to do it, he ignored me again and then send the work to my coworker to do it instead of me ! 
I never said i will not do the job i just want someone to teach me how to do it properly. 

I’m unmotivated to work, and everything feels just bad, i dont know how to deal with all of them.",_May311,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1728137097,2024-10-05 14:04:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fwr5ej/how_to_deal_with_toxic_coworkers_and_team_leader/,10,2024
1fwquox,Do I negotiate raises?,"First start off by saying I’m an elder millennial. I don’t think I’ve ever had a job that I stayed at for over 2 years, I’ve moved on when I got bored or didn’t feel appreciated, usually for a larger salary.

I started at this new place at the beginning of last year, negotiated by salary up 28%. Things have been going great, I’m successful and appreciated. The owners of my company are the nicest capitalists I’ve ever met. About 10 months into my first year was the end of our fiscal. P&L shows that I’m making my territory a good chunk of money and I’m dusting my peers. Boss sits me down with ownership and says they’re giving me a 24% raise. No annual review, no questions, just here have more money. I take it without even thinking. Usually with my annuals I have to negotiate for myself, but they’re never anywhere near the raise I got. At the beginning of the Summer my boss gets drunk and tells me he’s trying to get me a promotion. I’m like cool, heard that before, won’t hold my breath. Now a couple weeks ago I sit down with ownership and my boss and they ask me what I would do if it was my company. I answer honestly, some was hard for them to hear, some things they liked. A week after that, boss says I’m getting the promotion, lays out parameters and then offers me a 27% raise. I’m just really confused. I’m not used to being appreciated, or given things without asking. I don’t want to burn any bridges, I finally feel like I’m somewhere that I can grow a career at. Do I ask for more? Or just expect that when they see me succeed, they’ll give me another raise? If I ask for more, will I not get a raise in the future?

1fwq0qf,hate working in areas I love studying ,"Essentially, the fields of study I find most fascinating are precisely the fields I would hate actually working in. At this point, I'm not even sure what I *would* like as a job. Before anyone says a job is just a way to make money and not supposed to make you happy -- I've seen what being miserable at your job does to a person. I've grown up with parents who thought hating your job is fine, so long as it helps you take care of your family. Now they're empty-nesters and miserable every day until the weekend, when they are too tired to enjoy their time off. I'm not subjecting myself to that fate. 

Anyway. I'm in linguistics (and econ, more on that later). Through this major I've realized I LOVE studying about language and communication disorders, SLP, the likes. I rave about what I've learned to anyone who will listen after an interesting class. This has prompted me to research into a Master's in SLP (I'm not in the US btw, no clue how this would work over there!). And the thing I found out is I love all the classes...but would hate doing the job. I'm inpatient with kids, I retch at the sight of saliva, I'm just bad in a medical setting -- and I know *that* because I wanted to be a veterinarian until I actually got experience in a clinic and realized I would need to go on antidepressants to make that career path work. I just loathe being around illness. There's nothing I find more interesting to study, though. That and I'm allergic to fur so even if I found a way through my phobia I couldn't work in vetmed anyway (no, meds don't help, I've tried; yes, it's depressing). 
Then I thought, fine, I also like learning about computational linguistics, LLMs, machine learning. Fairly lucrative path too, and I have experience in the tech field. There I got the feeling that tech is absolutely soulless. Or maybe it's just corprorate in general. Don't know, but I don't think AI is a good thing anyway, so doubtful how I would feel working on it -- probably not good. 
I can apply this to most fields I thought about going into. Law? Love studying about it, would hate working with people at such capacity. Psychology? Same thing. I would be the worst therapist. Am I just fucked because all of my interests steer towards social sciences and medicine, and I don't like working with people? (I'm fine with working in a team of people, I'm referring to clients, patients, etc) 
Econ I can actually see maybe working out, if I don't go corp-side. It's extremely difficult to get a government job where I'm from though, and the work culture there sucks. I would probably suck it up if I liked the job itself, but it just seems like too risky a gamble to bank my future on. I'm good at maths but it's just not where my natural affinities lie -- I'm *great* at my linguistics and theoretical econ classes. I'm a reader and essay-writer and researcher at heart. I just have no idea what to do with that. The things I love studying and the things I love doing seem so diametrically oppossed. Also I don't consider myself an introvert, so again, jobs where I work in a team are perfectly fine. 

Do I just give up the search for a good career and get a PhD? Or do I drop out and start over in bioinformatics or something. 

(Just to clarify re:econ, there's no such thing as an independent business, finance, accounting etc degree where I'm from. All of those just fall under economics. You graduate as an economist, *then* you can go into finance or whatever. Because I know it works differently abroad and that Econ is seen as more of a ""liberal arts"" degree elsewhere.)

1fwois2,Ex avvocati? ,"30 anni, laureato in Giurisprudenza. Quando scelsi l'indirizzo di studi, ero consapevole che ""di avvocati è pieno"", ma mi dissi che era una laurea abbastanza flessibile, che avrei potuto spenderla anche in altri modi, che magari avrei comunque trovato il modo di condurre una vita dignitosa anche svolgendo la professione. Non ho mai voluto diventare il principe del foro a tutti i costi, per me il concetto di ""vita dignitosa"" vuol dire poter pagare le bollette e magari concedermi una vacanza all'anno. Tutto qua. Mi laureo con il massimo e nei tempi, facendo anche un erasmus nel mezzo. Faccio un tirocinio in tribunale e inizio la pratica forense. La pratica va anche bene, nel senso che mi pagano un piccolo rimborso e mi fanno scrivere atti (i miei ex compagni di uni al contrario mi raccontavano esperienze da incubo). Divento avvocato alla prima occasione utile. E li inizia il problema: il mio studio legale mi ""tiene"" ma la paga resta misera (800 euro, per capirci, lordi) nonostante un incredibile aumento delle mie responsabilità in studio. Resisto, da ingenuo, un po' perché i miei amici non prendono tanto di più rispetto a me e un po' perché ingenuamente credo al mio capo che mi promette salti di stipendio futuri. Risultato: ora ho abbandonato lo studio legale, sono in burnout per gli anni spesi a lavorare fino a tarda notte tutti i giorni, mi resta l'amaro in bocca per il tempo mal investito e per le occasioni mancate. Sono stato ingenuo e me ne rammarico infinitamente, soprattutto perché ci ho sempre messo il cuore senza vedere che così non si poteva proseguire. Qualcuno come me ha avuto una brutta esperienza? Come vi siete reinventati? A 30 anni faccio ancora in tempo a farmi una ""nuova vita""? Vorrei provare concorsi pubblici e fare un master magari.

1fwog2f,Internship dilemma ,"Should I accept this job offer?

Im currently wrapping up my A-levels and will have about 10 months before starting university in August 2025. Recently, I applied to several finance-related internships(FP&A, IB, PE, VC, Asset management) and received an offer for an Accounts Payable internship, primarily focused on filing invoices for their year-end closing. However, the internship begins right after my exams and lasts for 8 months, until June. I stupidly mentioned that I was available right after exams, so it would mean jumping straight into work.

Now, I’m weighing my options:

	1.	Accept the offer, and if a better opportunity arises, I could either switch or leave after 4 months if I’m not gaining much value.
	2.	Decline the offer and hold out for something more aligned with my career goals.

I’m unsure if I should commit or hold off and wait for a more fitting opportunity. To add, I’d ideally want to break into IB after university or at least do FP&A but this internship is leaning towards accounting. I think this will help my greater goal of a job in corporate finance after university but I’m not sure.

I’ve spoke to several people and the general consensus are that it’s already really hard to get an internship as it is so I should just accept it. However, if any better internships that aligns more closely with my career aspirations comes along, I should just go for it. I was also told that i should try my best not to leave the internship after I accept as it is quite damaging to my reputation. That said, this company is not in the financial industry.

1fwlqha,"Struggling with the decision: job, PhD studies, and moving – how do I make this work","Hi everyone! I could really use some advice or input from anyone who's been through something similar or has experience juggling big life decisions.

I'm currently facing several major life changes and feel very torn about what the right path is. Here’s what I’m dealing with:

1. **Job**: I have a fairly stimulating job in labor market policy and public administration. Since returning from parental leave, I’ve started seeing new opportunities for development. It feels like there’s potential to grow in the role, and the job has become more meaningful. On the other hand, I’ve previously thought about making a change and trying something new.
2. **PhD studies**: I’ve always dreamed of pursuing a PhD, especially in an area I’m really passionate about: how AI affects workers' sense of meaningfulness and professional identity. We've discussed this setup within the family, and it feels like it could work, although it would definitely mean a different financial situation. The question is, am I ready to take that step now, or should I delay it?
3. **Moving**: We’ve both been eager to move to Uppsala, where my in-laws live, and where we have better chances of finding a townhouse, which would suit our growing family better than our current apartment. Uppsala feels like a more family-friendly place to raise our child, as it's a slightly smaller city with a calmer atmosphere. We also have the option to get a rental place temporarily if we need somewhere to stay while we search for the right home.Another option that would simplify things is finding a job in Uppsala. Commuting from Uppsala to Stockholm would complicate things, especially since we're planning to enroll our daughter in daycare in about six months. Picking her up and dropping her off would be difficult if I have to commute every day.
4. **Remote work**: I’m allowed to work remotely two days a week according to my contract, which helps a bit. I’m considering raising the possibility of more flexible work arrangements, but there are different views on this at various management levels at my workplace, which makes it harder to predict how that discussion will go.

# The Challenges:

* **Finances**: Pursuing a PhD means a lower income, which could be tough, especially if we move and need to get a new home.
* **Time and stress**: A PhD requires a lot of time and energy, and I’m unsure how I’d manage that alongside work and family life.
* **Commuting or changing jobs**: If we move, I may have to commute long distances, which would cut into family time. Getting a job in Uppsala would make things simpler, but I’m struggling to see any roles there that would be as stimulating as what I have now.

# Questions:

* How have those of you who pursued a PhD or made a mid-career change dealt with the financial and mental strain?
* Has anyone else faced the choice between staying in a job they enjoy versus diving into an uncertain but dream PhD path?
* How have you managed long commutes, and is it sustainable over time?
* Is it worth delaying the PhD dream for greater stability in life?

Any advice or experiences are welcome! I’m trying to navigate this as clearly as possible, but it feels like there are so many variables right now.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!",emillindstrom,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1728116671,2024-10-05 08:24:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fwlqha/struggling_with_the_decision_job_phd_studies_and/,10,2024

1fwkpci,Am I cut out to be a scientist?,"Hey labrats. This is sort of a long vent about my mental health and feelings of inadequacy that's tied to being a neuroscience student and trying to figure out my career path. 

I'm 24F currently trying to navigate my career path although I still feel like I haven't found something I'm truly interested in. In my undergrad I really enjoyed learning neurophysiology and have made a direction towards learning more about this field. I'm a neuroscience masters student and I'm currently completing a dissertation on auditory evoked responses. However, I feel like I'm not very interested or curious about a lot of aspects of my project as it takes me a lot of will power to just sit down and work on it. Last Friday I gave a presentation of my final results for my project and it was complete flop because I did not practice enough. I just ended up talking really fast, not explaining anything clearly and actually finishing 5 minutes earlier than I was supposed to.(it was a 15min presentation and I had initially thought i was running out of time during my talk). I'm so embarrassed about this and I'm still recovering from the shame. It happened in front of people in my field who I could have supposedly connected with. They know me now and that I perform poorly. I clearly showed a lack of knowledge and confidence meaning they won't be interested in talking to me or see me as a potential employee at their lab. It is really hard to find work in a lab through job applications, most people in my city find jobs through their network so I'm sad that I have not been able to connect with my lecturers and scientists in my university. I'm very shy and painfully awkward during social interactions which deters people away from me.

I do want to improve my professionalism because I have been longing to connect and learn from people who've had experience in my field. The problem is my lack of confidence tends to show a lot and people end up not trusting me to be competent. It happened at my previous jobs where I worked as a lab assistant. My coworkers were condescending and did not see me as their friend. The scientist in charge at my previous job actually told me that I should consider switching to a career that would suit my introverted personality and that I do not learn fast enough to work in a lab. It was hard to hear because this was just negative feedback about my performance. It was tough because I've been so used to receiving constructive feedback at uni where I was given both positive and negative feedback to lessen the blow 😅 
On a related note, the atmosphere in the labs I've worked at feels so competitive. I feel really dumb among a bunch of smart people. My anxiety is really strong in these situations I just become a helpless people pleasing doormat with no authenticity in my self expression. I can't speak coherently and appear as if I don't know things. I'm trying to work on my anxiety by exposing myself to networking events where I'm surrounded by smart people however most of the time I'm still not good at connecting with people.
I do feel like following a scientific pursuit will challenge me in so many ways but make me hate myself because I feel like I'm not good enough. I'm not sure if I will be able to make it out with more self acceptance and belief in myself. But I guess I should try? One thing I know for certain is that my current sense of purpose stems from trying to be a part of something that could contribute to a positive change in the world. Another part of me also likes the idea of finding a low stress job like being a receptionist at a small clinic for example lol. I could just work and focus on my hobbies during my free time, live in my own bubble.

I guess what I'm getting at through this long rant is the question of whether someone like me with self esteem issues, repeated failures and an inability to fit into the science world keep pursuing science. Did anyone else struggle with these kinds of issues, persevere and come out on the other side to being a successful scientist? 

Also do you have any networking tips for shy people haha.

1fwici3,Laid off hours after advancing to a final interview round at a new company. What to tell the new company and when? ,"Posting on my husband’s behalf since he doesn’t use Reddit. He has been in a leadership role at a company that’s been pretty toxic, and he saw the writing on the wall that they weren’t making wise financial decisions. He had his third interview this morning for a new role at a new company. Two hours later, he gets the good news that he’s made it to the final round and he will have another interview scheduled very soon. Awesome.

At the end of the day today, a few hours after, he learns his entire branch is being eliminated and he’s getting severance pay. The layoff paperwork says his last day is today, 10/4. 

What should he tell this new company, and when? They haven’t checked references yet. We are in California. Not sure if this is the law everywhere, but my husband is a hiring manager and he knows he can’t ask a company if someone quit, was fired, or laid off, he can only verify dates of tenure. He wants to be honest that he was laid off. The timing of it all is sort of crazy.

Should he:

A) Tell the new company in an email ASAP? He thinks this could make him look honest and transparent.

B) Say nothing until he gets the job offer? I think this is the best bet, so they don’t forfeit the interview or wind up not picking him.

C) Say nothing at all? We hate this idea but would like some feedback.

D) Anything else we haven’t thought of?

1fwi4aa,Sexuality discussion accused of harassment ,"What can/should I do 

This coworker I trusted and I shared and joked/speculated about another coworker sexuality. That coworker we will call Tara and I would text and chat sometimes outside or work and someone I considered as a friend. The cowoeker told Tara I was asking and talking about her. I guess this made Tara very upset because she told our boss and next thing im talked to about sexual harassment and told to stay away and not talk to Tara! I was shocked and upset by the whole ordeal and like I was thrown under the bus!

I waited a few months for the drama and some rumors to die down. I asked Tara about us being friends and she said yes. I start texting and emailing Tara even though I’m not supposed to because I missed her and the friendship and felt we had started fresh. Later I say something that makes Tara upset so she goes to hr and shows them the emails I sent from my personal to her personal account and they read them and open an investigation because she claims she is harassed by me. Of course she leaves out her responses to me. I can’t believe she would do something so hateful! I think now she hates me! Hr says I will lose my job if I talk to her and me discussing her sexuality with another coworker is sexual harassment! This was months ago and also I am female. It is too much drama

1fwh12u,Not sure about my major,"Hello, I am currently a sophomore doing computer science at my community college. Right now I am currently unsure of computer science as my major. I'm doing well in math and I actually like it more than I thought, but programming on the other hand is a different story. I am having a hard time understanding the subject and using the tools that are given to create these program assignments/ projects. I mean it is programming 1, but I'm not sure if i enjoy it or not. I was trying to find a major that somewhat creative since I do enjoy making art, but also has a decent income. Not sure if I should continue cs or try out some other engineering major or possibly pivot to art. I kinda don't want to waste my classes, so my options are engineering or art/design.

1fwgxv7,I took a $15k pay cut and now I work with bitchy women in a potential dead end role,"I recently took a $15k pay cut to leave a job in Public Relations that was severely effecting my mental health. I dealt with everything from petty complaints to egregious acts within the corporate world. After months of not eating or sleeping consistently I made the jump to an entry level role at a very profitable company. 

Although I took a pay (and corporate respect) cut, I was excited to do something far less mentally taxing for not that much less money in the grand scheme of things. I ended up getting the job from a previous work connection that switched companies and gave me a raving review. I was hired with obvious intent to grow at this company and learn a new skill (Recruiting). My working buddy (who referred me) is an all star at this company. His referral has a lot of weight and got me in good graces with the “big boss” right off that bat.

Fast forward 2 months..

I schedule meetings for a living now as a coordinator with 2 other employees. Things turned south quick when I realised just how devoted these 2 employees are to scheduling fucking meetings. They live and breathe for this job. Are pissed at every little thing and every one. 99% of their work woes could be solved with a deep breath or just being approachable and friendly to others. I do not understand the level of their frustration and do not think I ever could compared to what I came from.They think their jobs are harder than they are. I will admit that I was spacey during training and was not picking things up as quickly as I should. I was coming out of a mental fog and trying my absolute best with a smile on my face. Every time I would “mess up” or ask a question they would get so annoyed. They would not train me anymore and would literally nick pick the shit out of sending calendar invites!!!! .. so after 2 months of constant negativity I ask my manager to please speak to them. 

Since my manager has spoken to them they have completely cold shouldered me. It is so fucking hostile and ridiculous.

My manager has since made several patronizing comments to me about how she appreciates everything I am doing and that my coworkers like me and are glad that I am here (yeah right). She also added me on Facebook out of the blue. Yesterday during our meeting I asked about more responsibility and she politely made it clear that I am in this position for the foreseeable future and that she wants me to lean in more in my current role.

I feel so blah. I’m not sure what to do or think of all this.

1fwgtv0,Denied promotion after 10 years.What next?,"I’ve been working for this company for 10 years now under an amazing manager and was talking about becoming a senior. My director/mentor was let go due to office politics and i reported to the VP while they looked for his replacement. I had a performance review with the VP and was informed that i have hit my salary band and would need to be promoted to senior if i want to earn more. He said he just needed to talk to other VPs and directors to see how i’ve performed working with them. I was very confident that many would speak positive of me. 

Then the new director came in. He seems like the caring type but he’s one of those managers who only step in when something goes wrong or if he needs something. The last director was very involved with the team so it’s a very different atmosphere within the team now.

I didn’t want to go to the VP to talk about the promotion because i didn’t want my manager to think i was going to try to bypass him. He said that he needed to see more from me and told me to take training in more. 

I just don’t know what to do now. It’s not like i’m asking for a managerial position. I love the company that i’m working at but i feel i’ve now hit a brick wall in my career. Should i go to the VP anyways or should i start interviewing somewhere else?

1fwgsse,Would you roll out?,"Retired from military and landed a Sr PM role through the bro network. Make $110K, plus retirement pension and disability...$190K total. 
However, the job is terrible.  The company can't get out of it own way, constantly over promising and underdelivering, leaving the PMs to face the onslaught of angry customers.  Co-workers are excessively dramatic and like to stir things up.  Director is a miser of information and unnecessarily compartmentalizes. I had better flow of communication in the military, where info compartmentalization is actually necessary!  Director also only listens to two particular people in the department and everyone is wrong or lying.  It's wild to watch, tbh.  

Now, my spouse is also retired military and ended up in a lucrative management role at a large company making $165K base, plus bonuses, on top of their pension and disability.  $245K total base, plus another $10-15K in bonuses. Combined incomes is $450K a year.

I want to leave my job. Essentially just rage quit, effective immediately! I won't, but I can dream!  But the market is slim right now, especially at the six figure plus mark.

1fwgrlu,I regret leaving my job,"I think I made a horrible mistake. I am almost 30. 

The last year, I was working at a respectable healthcare company in my city. I was a little uncertain about being healthcare, and there certainly were things I didn’t care for. All in all, a pretty solid job though. Great working hours, an excellent work life balance, top notch benefits, a quiet work environment. I am rather introverted and easily overstimulated so in many regards this was a good structured job and environment for me. My team and supervisor are absolutely amazing. The biggest reason I left is because I needed more hours, but I wasn’t brave enough to talk to my supervisor and ask for more. 

I recently left this job on good terms to pursue what I thought was my dream job, working full time for a boutique. My first day was Monday. I have cried each day, I believe I have made a horrible mistake leaving the healthcare company.  This boutique, I am working in the warehouse. I have never worked warehouse before, but I thought I would give it a shot, and actually thought I may like it. I always liked the backend of my retail jobs, so I thought this would be similar. Ugh. 

It’s a small family owned boutique. I’ve had bad experiences with working for small businesses before, so I am extremely wary, but I am giving them benefit of the doubt. This job is much more physically demanding than I expected, the working hours kind of suck and don’t allow for much work life balance. I am so sore from standing all day that I don’t get to come home and  go for a run, which helps me manage my mental health. I think they misrepresented the job when I interviewed. They told me they wanted an associate who could keep things moving along when management wasn’t around. As I get into this job it seems they want someone capable of managements projects without paying them managements paychecks. Oh, and I don’t get my schedule until 3 days before the week starts, so how am I to plan my life? Its mind numbing to do nothing but stick stickers and package orders. My ears ring constantly from the crinkling of packaging all day long. I think I am going to hate this. 

I feel like I downgraded. My dream job is no longer a dream, it is just a job. This boutique job seems something for high schoolers or more a summer job. I think this was a poor career choice on my end. It’s only been a week but I want nothing more than to undo the last three weeks and be back at my old company in my old position. I want to go ask for my job back, but I fear it has not been long enough. Not long enough to give the new job a real chance, but also if I went back to my old job I’d be embarrassed I was disloyal and left to try something new only to realize so quickly i was so wrong about it. 

I know everyone will have an opinion about this, and I welcome your thoughts and opinions. Please remember I am trying to figure out this thing called life the best I can. I mostly just needed a place to talk about this and to hopefully not feel so alone.

1fwfsjg,32 years old just getting a bachelors...,"I'm 31. In my spare time, I've been taking online college classes and slowly chipping away at a Bachelor's in Business Administration. 

After this semester, I will be 8 classes from graduation. I plan to spend 1 year as a full-time student to finish the degree. I will be 32 when I graduate. 

I'll spare you my life story, but basically to date I only have two jobs to include on my resume. I worked nearly 5 years in a sales job, and about 1.5 years in a customer service job. I have 1 solid reference from each job (my direct supervisors).

Once I finish my degree, I plan to shotgun out my resume to try to find a ""better"" job. 

I know that people say that these business degrees are really becoming devalued. The thing is that I don't have high standards. If I could just land an office job that isn't talking to customers all day, I'll be happy. I'm also flexible and willing to relocate. In fact, I want to get out of my home state.

1fwf28v,"Job Description for a company I like is lowballing based on ""internal equity"" - how can I negotiate? ","The job I currently work in is exhausting. I've been there for about 2.5 years now (3.5 with the company) and have never seen a pay bump. In that time, I've taken a lot more work on and I've also completed my Master's. My job is both in data analytics, reporting, and writing the occasional Python script. I am part of a very small technical team in a company where things are always breaking and there is very little technical literacy - so what we do is very important and we're always brought into big projects.

All in all, I make under $80k. I no longer find it competitive and for the hours I work, the results I generate, and the incredibly poor company culture that's come into focus after some leadership changes - I am looking for next steps. I'm also tired of worrying about remote work. I work remote and have for the last four years - it's a non-negotiable. I am a special exception at my current workplace, but I worry our new CEO who is ardently pro-office, will be an issue for me time layoffs come around. Morale is low.

The good news? I'm not desperate. But I'm tired and unhappy. And I've got student loans to pay and a lot of them. This salary no longer gets me by as I'm looking at the next stages of my life (20s going into 30s). I have not asked my boss about a raise / promotion, but it's been hammered home time and time again in our bi-weekly town halls (you heard that right), that there won't be cost of living adjustments or formal raises. I'm in great standing with my boss and my team, but I haven't wanted to ask because I'm afraid to bring it up 1) because we're entering our ""peak"" season and 2) I just don't like rocking the boat, and I don't love asking for these things without some kind of backup plan.

Over the last month, I've been aggressively job hunting. I've spoken probably to 4-5 companies for roles ranging to Senior Analyst, Reporting Analysts, Data Scientist, etc. My graduate degree is in CS, but I'm much stronger on the Data Science end. Advanced SQL, very strong reporting, and my job is very intense. I have experience in a lot of facets of commerce. But, the salary range for roles I'm applying for are typically between 90k - 130k, with the expectation being in the high 90s/low 100s. At this point in my career (5+ years or so, grad degree, tons of high recommendations / growth), I think that's fair enough and it will help me breathe a bit every day. I'm suffocating in anxiety right now. I'm up all night worrying with life being more expensive, some new bills, and some unforeseen expenses.

Back to the main issue. I saw a posting for a very highly regarded cybersecurity company. I'll let you take a guess. Job listing was posted for $85k - $140k. I expect a midpoint range of $100-$110. I do the HR screening and the call with the hiring manager - all is well. However, they mention the role is for $85k hard cap. This is due to ""internal equity."" I didn't really expect that kind of trick from this employer. When I spoke with the hiring manager, he said the team was new and there was one employee under him and a role backfilled where the person starts in 60-90 days. My guess is they were offered something lower $75k - $85k. For me, that's lateral. I have a pretty strong feeling they'll make an offer. I was more or less told this by the hiring manager who really liked me. Not a guarantee, but I feel good. And I really like the company, so I'd want to accept, but I have a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.

I expect a few competing offers next week, with higher base salaries but the companies are a little more risky. They're all well-known, high regarded companies - but they are in industries where I feel layoffs will be more prevalent or where RTO is more common. With the cybersecurity role, it's ardently remote first which is a plus. But the competing offers will all range in that mid 90s / low 100s territory. I'm unsure I'll honestly take them if they were to happen, but my point is I think I'll have some options.

I'm wondering, is there any way to negotiate on internal equity if they really like me? I kind of find that BS. On one hand I get it, but that is not reflective of the job description and I have a hard time believing this is competitive given the company stature and what I've heard from people. But, never having to worry about RTO is huge. And I'm very tired where I currently work. But I don't think it's worth jumping and starting over for under $10k.

I guess there's no need to rush this, but I'd like to find a new job with some quickness because I am REALLY having a hard time where I'm at now and I won't rest until I can securely cover my new expenses without fearing about my grocery bill. I guess I have a few questions - 1) is there a good way to speak to my current boss about this without coming across disgruntled, 2) is there a way to speak with the recruiter at my top choice company to at least get me to $90-95k, or is that a fruitless effort and 3) any suggestions / advice at all for this search? I work intensely hard, I've re-shaped my entire company's BI platform then went on to replace our analyst who left...taking on basically two jobs and allowing us to no longer need our contractors. For the first time I feel confident and steady with what I can contribute, but there's got to be a way with the education and experience just to somehow get to even sniffing 95-100k. I've been told by multiple recruiters this is more than fair for my experience, but I'm starting to sweat even though I guess I don't have to.

1fwes5q,How long to take on new role before promotion? ,"I was very under qualified for my position when I started my job over a year ago. Due to that, I was promoted around 7 months in, to a different department. 

I've been in that role for over 5 months, and as of 1.5 months ago, they determined my attention to detail is so impressive they wanted me working with the compliance and legal departments to do some other task. I'm in operations so it's very different from my role. This past week, they added another task on that is also very different that requires extreme attention to detail (they plan to publish studies with info I supply them) and I've taken on training new hires for our department as well. I've since completely stopped doing the job I was hired for and I'm also extremely busy. 

How long do I wait before I demand a raise and promotion? I know it's very soon but I'm doing literally 0 job tasks I was promoted into this position for. I feel like 1.5 months was generous enough but wanted some guidance since I know in general it's been a short timeframe.

1fwe6ye,"How do you handle a toxic leader that isn't your boss, but provides terrible recommendations for work? ","Anonymized a bit for privacy. I’m dealing with a weird situation at work. I work as part of cross functional team, and one of the leaders in that space is pretty toxic (the roles under her tend to be revolving doors in terms of talent), but she’s not usually toxic outside of her own team.



The feedback she gives is generally terrible, but because she’s high ranking within the organization, nobody really speaks up about it, instead preferring not to rouse her ire. I’ve also heard (from multiple people), that this leader takes pride in getting other leaders fired or on the radar for layoffs.



That being said, she rarely brings any feedback directly, but always filters it through one of her direct reports. Now, her direct report is an absolutely lovely woman, who I’ve become friends with since I’ve started this role. She also understands how terrible/problematic the feedback is, but her boss measures her directly on her ability to whip people (mostly me, but also others) into line doing what her boss wants. When I don’t do what this woman wants, she takes her direct report to task.



This puts me in an awkward position where I have to take this terrible feedback or my friend gets verbally lashed for not getting it done. I’m genuinely concerned about the blowback of following her bad recommendations and having it show up as my own work.

They were brought in to an entry-level junior role, were promoted to the same level as me (in less than half the time) and have now been promoted above me after the next ‘level up’ received a promotion. 
Kudos to them, they joined my team and fitted in well, after a month was well received and liked. I personally quite like them.
However, I feel like I’ve been strung along now for the past 6 years. Constant reassurance that ‘development’ is round the corner but my work has really stagnated in the past year or so. 

No new tasks, not learning anything new, I’ve just sort of been going through the motions than has suited me until recently.
I had some  personal issues that have since resolved, but work were not aware of any goings-on at home, I keep my personal and professional life very separate.

I’ve asked persistently for specific areas where I’d like to strengthen my skill set, knowing full well the work is available, to no avail.

I will be 29 soon and can’t help but feel like I’ve wasted so many of my best years with a company that have effectively f*cked me around.

Some further context:
Financial services, medium sized business, I am more qualified than coworker but not as outgoing it has to be said.

Had a major disagreement with a manager (who was not my line manager) 2 years into this job, who is now upper management.
Current job is very accommodating in terms of flexible hours, WFH etc and is a great location meaning a relatively short, traffic free commute.

Paid slightly above industry average, but not great (£35k + 10/20% bonus, depending on profits)

1fwc2je,"Career Advice Needed: Transition to Program Manager, Operations Analyst, or Stick to Software Engineering?
","Hey Reddit,



I’m at a crossroads in my career and could really use some advice. Here’s my situation:



I work in NYC in the Operations and Tech department, managing a dispatch team of 8 and nearly 30 drivers. My responsibilities go far beyond basic operations management, and I wear a lot of hats:



- Lead day-to-day dispatch operations, ensuring optimal performance and service delivery across a large-scale logistics team.

- Handle risk management to minimize losses and oversee project finances, ensuring scalability and cost efficiency.

- Coordinate with software developers to ensure proper data management and handle software procurement.

- Oversee hiring: resume screening, interviewing, onboarding, and training.

- Manage driver and dispatch invoices.

- Work to expand operations to different states, focusing on profits and cost efficiency.

I’m accountable for any errors in a team of around 38 people.

I’m also on call for 18 hours a day for escalations.

I really enjoy the management side of things, but here’s where I’m conflicted:



My educational background is in Computer Science (I have a Master’s degree) with some technical projects in full-stack development. I’ve been thinking about transitioning into roles like Program Manager or Operations Analyst, but I’m not sure if that would mean losing the opportunity to utilise my CS education. 



My questions:



Would transitioning into Program Management or Operations Analysis make sense given my background and experience, or am I better off sticking with Software Engineering to stay closer to my CS roots?



Is management worth pursuing in the long run, especially when I enjoy it, or should I focus more on the technical side where my education lies?



Does one path (management vs. software engineering) offer more career growth in the long term?



Any insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",Dry-Bat-1631,1,1.0,0,1728082061,2024-10-04 22:47:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fwc2je/career_advice_needed_transition_to_program/,10,2024

1fwby07,How to explain gap on resume?,"So at the end of 2023 my (26M) Grandmother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. I was working as a manager in the manufacturing industry and this has been my first job after graduating college with an Industrial Engineering degree. When my grandma started needing more and more care I would take care of her on the weekdays before work as I wouldnt work until the late afternoon. I lived about a 1-1.5 hours away from her while my dad helped on the weekends.

It slowly started becoming too much and I decided to quit my job when she needed more full time care. I really did not like my job either and am looking for a major pivot. In the meantime I started studying for my ""Fundamentals of Engineerings Exam"" for electrical engineering as I want to transition more into actual engineering an get my PE License eventually. I am extremely grateful I got to spend time with her before she died and had her in my life as long as I did. After she died I took some time off and hiked the entire John Muir Trail which was a once in the lifetime experience and really helped me grieve. 

My question is, how should I address the gap on my resume? Essentially I quit my job in early July to become a caretaker for a family member and since then have studied for a licensing exam and have done an interesting trip. Should any of this be on my resume or should it more be something addressed in an interview? I know its general advice to not explain gaps but she was my last grandparent close to me geographical where I could provide this care and I also took time to further my career with special licensing. Any and all advice is appreciated, Thank you!

1fwbq9z,Coworker was given a task that I usually do? ,"So, I've been with this place for about 2 years (officially today). I like to think that I understand my role and tasks fairly well (that's another something for later.) But yesterday one of my coworkers was given a task that I've usually done since starting, with no reason as to why other than to have it done. I wasn't even asked despite having not really having anything to do at that point.

My two coworkers both found the sudden change rather weird and out of field as they have *never* done the task before. I was never told of any previous problems or mistakes made from the previous times that I've done.  It's made me feel a bit self cautious and wondering if I've done something wrong, as I talked with my supervisor the day or so about it as I know it was coming up. 

It's gotten me worried....

-Applied for a job that I was experienced in and a good fit for.
- got interview and they asked me my salary expectations. 
- Explained it’s a casual position at the start then salary.
-  offered me the job and start date.
- However didn’t send me contract until 2 days before starting (forgot)
- I read the contract and the hourly rate what I said (for salary position) was my expectation was bundled up into a casual rate: ie: no holiday pay, sick pay, public holidays, overtime rates only $3 more per hour, 25% loading on my rate compared to full time, so works out about $6 less per hour. Obviously to them a low rate in the industry I work.
- they asked me if I’m still happy to start in two days and I basically said no I declined the offer. It instantly gave me a red flag. I’m experienced enough to not waste my time. It was disappointing because I did like them. 

They asked me to give an explanation and reasoning, and said I was ‘projecting’ onto them and made me feel bad and told me that was the rate I gave them they aren’t mind readers! 
I wanted a quick phone call to say thanks but no thanks, but the call lasted about an hour! As they tried to convince me to put another offer down. 
I didn’t want to and just politely declined.
Do you think their intentions were an honest mistake, or are they just throwing something at the wall and seeing what sticks? 
Any thoughts would be much appreciated. Thanks.

With different work days. Mainly due to my lack of supervisory experience. How do I convince her to take a chance on me? I can’t get supervisory experience if they don’t take a chance right?

1fw9gws,23 year old - Getting Fired,"I have been working a corporate job in the construction industry since May 2023 when I graduated college. I recently got assigned to a massive travel project and the “team” my company sent out was myself  (1 year experience) and two other people who have 1 year or less experience. 

Not so surprisingly we fell on our face and are behind schedule and costing the company a lot of money. I am having constant anxiety about it and have never been so stressed in my life. Since I am the most “senior” employee here it feels as though I am getting all the blame for failures that occur on the job. I have a feeling that I will be separated from the company for not performing up to standards. 

If that happens what are the odds I can find another job quickly even though I have been fired? I think I am a hard worker but I have just been so overwhelmed with all the tasks and suddenly getting the responsibilities of a senior leader. I have a few certifications like my OSHA 30 and CPR.

1fw91wk,Do I pursue my family business? If not what should I do? ,"I (20F) am half way through my second semester in college as a finance major, and I am feeling very lost as to what I should do for a career. 

My family owns a couple big companies that put on Motocross and GNCC events (dirt bikes and ATV races). I had always thought that that was what I would do for my career, but now I’m not so sure. I have several older cousins and siblings who are in line to take over the business before me, and I am concerned that there won’t be a place for me in the future. They all have degrees in entrepreneurship, engineering, graphic design, and one is currently in law school. I feel like all of these career paths can be utilized in my family business, and that there’s not much left for me to bring to the table. I am torn as to whether I should deviate from my family business and find a separate career path that pertains to my skills and interests, or continuing to try and figure out where I might fit in there. 

I began college in fall of 2022 right after I graduated high school. After my first semester, I enlisted in the Army National Guard and left for training. My job in the Army is a 12N Horizontal Construction Engineer, which is a heavy equipment operator. I figured the skills I learned in this job would align well with my family business, since heavy equipment is used for building and maintaining the tracks. I really enjoyed my training and I enjoy operating, so I guess that’s one treat I could contribute. I’m just not too sure that that’s the route I want to go. I’m also not sure if I want to pursue a career in the military after I finish out my contract. 

I have been trying to identify my best skills lately, and I know that I am artistic and technical. My friend is a Landscape Architecture major and she was telling me all about it. I think I would be great in that field since it is very design oriented, and a lot of what she’s learning is familiar to me from my experience in operating the heavy equipment. I just don’t know if I’m ready to call it quits on the family business. 

As for my major in finance, I chose that path because I thought it would be useful to the business side of my family’s companies. If I end up deciding that I want to follow a new career path, I definitely would not stay in that major. I would never want a job in finance and it seems like a very math-heavy major. Math is not my strong suit. 

I have considered law and engineering degrees as well. I don’t think I’d want to be a lawyer because of the pressure they have to endure, and the long hours. I think I’d enjoy something to do with engineering, but I also don’t know exactly how that would translate to Motocross and GNCC racing. 

Overall, I am just feeling very lost as to what I should be doing now. I think I’ll finish out the year as a finance major, and I’d like to spend more time around my family members who run things at the races. For now I’ll continue with the path I’m on and see where life takes me. 

This really isn’t enough context for some solid advice. I just figured writing all of this down, or some outside opinions would help calm my mind.

Over the past few months, I have felt super uncomfortable and like an outsider at this job. I've been working here since June but I've already started to dread working for the lead attorney. I feel like she rather I go, but hasn't said it yet. 

She often criticizes me ( because of the mistakes I make) (I read things too fast, which I know is my mistake)

Doesn't offer feedback and if it is.. it's negative

I never know which mood she's going to be in regarding me, but she doesn't treat anyone else in the office like she does with me.

Ignores my emails but will 100% conversate with the other paralegal (who has worked here 7 years)

Micromanages my work.  I forgot to give her a file once and she practically chewed my head off. 

Also: There is no HR at this job. The lead attorney is the managing shareholder so she is the firm I would think lol. The male attorneys are chill, but something about her is insufferable. 

She has stated before ""If don't think you're a good fit for this job feel free to let me and the other attorney know"" :)

1fw7ijp,Is this wrong?,"Hello, to make things short I quit my job with no notice due to reasons - I felt the courtesy of a 2 weeks notice was not earned. I essentially stated my employment ends on X date, and they can send me exit communications to my methods of communication on my employee profile. e.g., where to send equipment, status of benefits, etc.

Naturally, this was unexpected from the employers perspective as I purposely gave them no clear reason why I had done this. My friend and a family member also work at the same company, both being in completely different parts of the business with very little if not 0 overlap in work. HR, reached out to my family member with the approach that they're concerned for my well being, even though I clearly communicated when my employment ends, and set the boundary that I will not be explaining myself. This caused a mass rift between my family member and I, with them attacking and making me feel like 2 cents for disrespecting the company - essentially what I would expect HR or my manager to say to me if I had opened up this commutation with them. They then did the same to my friend, essentially asking them on their behalf to get me to answer my phone and explain myself. I understand the topic of leaving a job with no notice or reason is up for debate, but past this, was it the right thing for the employer to involve individuals that have nothing to do with my employment status to get more information out of me? I feel the methods they used to try and get me in touch with them is to cover their own asses and was uncalled for, and I'm not sure how to approach this as I can't find other similar situations to read about.

The method I used to leave my job of course is not the ""normal"" expected approach, but I still feel like they were looking for information they were not owed whatsoever, and instead of leaving it, they caused drama within my own life from a narrative they built themselves. So I just want to throw this out there to hear some perspectives on the situation, as I believe there was no reason to start probing for answers from people associated with me when they already received my resignation.",AggressiveDuty9337,2,0.75,9,1728069895,2024-10-04 19:24:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fw7ijp/is_this_wrong/,10,2024

I received a job offer from company B with an additional $17k in salary. When I informed company A that I would be leaving, they countered with a $20k increase in my current salary. I went back to company B and now they're offering me a $25k increase from my current salary. I have verbally accepted the offer from company B.

Both jobs offer remote work and a similar benefits package, but the type of work is slightly different. I am leaning towards a preference for the work I'd be doing with company B. Seems like company B is the obvious choice, right? The only issue is that with company A, I get the chance to travel internationally (I'm based in the US) each quarter to various places in Europe. This type of work travel is such a cool opportunity for me to see the world on someone else's dime. With company B, I won't get any travel opportunities.

1fw61ym,Not sure if I want to make the jump,"After a series of unfortunate layoffs twice in the years 2022-2023 I was thankful I landed a job in a place that I knew had stability. My current company has never had financial issues and has been a long-standing mid-sized company for over 150 years. I have a space to grow in my role which I have been for the past year however, I am still making the salary and the title I was last year with more responsibilities and projects on my plate. I like fast-paced but it is getting taxing. 

Not to mention I do not like my boss. She is very micromanaging and often makes me do work over and over again in circles because her mind changes from one week to the next. Its incredibly frustrating and our 1:1 conversations are never about how I am doing or my potential growth in the company.  I just like the stability and the somewhat flexible worklife balance in a hybrid role.

However, I recently got sourced by an HR Tech company which is where my passion is anyway. My skill set is perfect with the job title I want a little bit of a pay increase but no more than 10,000 more a year than I am making now. If I were actively looking for a role it would be a no brainer! The company has seen alot of growth but what worries me is they are in Series D funding and the last time I joined a start up I got burned and was laid off as the company went under. They do have some very large customers in the market but I am just worried. 

I just want to be somewhere for a long time and grow with a company for once. Anyone have any advice? ",DinkyDeveloper,1,1.0,1,1728066142,2024-10-04 18:22:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fw61ym/not_sure_if_i_want_to_make_the_jump/,10,2024

No assisted whatchacallit here in Ontario.. 

If life just won’t let me quit, I’ll try to fight back as much as I can until life decided to kick me out.

I’ll live in my car and not worry about rent and just do some full-time minimum job and go to uni or college.

1fw4nz9,Is it worth it to go for an MBA if my bachelors was completely unrelated?,"I’m really stuck on if this would be the best decision for me or not. I went to school for graphic design (I know, not a smart choice, but I was like 18 when I chose it and I really thought it was right for me). But by my last year, I started feeling really miserable with it and I feel like the program taught me more along the fine arts side of design rather than the business aspects. It has been 5 months since I’ve graduated and I’ve had trouble getting any sort of job or internship. I landed about 2-3 interviews which were either for entry-level design or marketing positions, but I never got the job. 

I’ve been realizing that I honestly might be happier and a lot more financially stable going into business. I’ve already tried applying for entry level positions (such as administrative assistant type roles), many that don’t even require a degree, but my lack of education in that field and lack of experience makes me look really unappealing. 

I actually already applied to a grad program and was accepted, and right now I’m taking a few foundation classes at community college since it’s cheaper and the credits can transfer, but I’m starting to have doubts if this will be worth the money or not. I felt really confident about continuing my education since it would open me up to a lot more career options than what I’d have with my current degree, but I just don’t know if it’s truly the right direction.

For context, I’ve been at this job for seven months and I’m desperately applying elsewhere. The job wasn’t as advertised and I’m doing barely any of the work I thought I would be when I started. There’s a lot to say about this but I’ll try to keep it to the point:

There’s a lot of nitty gritty stuff I have to do with sending emails out to large numbers of people and business travelers in the US and Mexico. We also keep detailed records of what we do throughout the day in a daily log.

Recently, my team lead (who doesn’t like me) has been scrutinizing me anywhere she can. I have no idea why. She’ll go through the log where I’m writing and tell me I’m not being detailed enough (even though I’ve written the same way SINCE I STARTED), and most recently she told me I included a traveler on an email who wasn’t  from the US or Mexico. I’m going to go and double check on my shift today but I don’t think I made a mistake. 

Is this a sign that I’m about to be fired? Is she collecting a list of mistakes so she can get me out?

1fw3vw8,"Torn About Job Offer (Salary Increase, Growth Potential) vs. Staying in My Current Role","

I'm a federal contractor in a role that I'm very good at, have a great relationship with my client and co-workers, and don't have any overall complaints except that the company I currently work for hasn't given raises in two years and I feel like I've hit a ceiling in my current role.

The job itself is flexible, I know my work (it comes ""easy"" to me at this stage), and I'm fairly content. We have unlimited PTO (within reason). The downside is that managment is somewhat erratic (firing people via email, taking things personally instead of professionally, etc.). I also want more money. I'm doing OK, but I'm in a very high cost of living area. I planned to ask for a raise this week since it was the start of the new fiscal year, but there were a lot of layoffs due to budget cuts, so I'm not sure it's the best time to push for that.

I was recently contacted about an opportunity with another company. The role is at the same agency, 20k salary bump (plus another few thousand in bonuses) and has the potential for career growth (in theory). 

However, when I spoke with them about it, the job description was slightly misleading and turns out that it is primarily a project managment/coordination postion for a massive project (lots of tracking, columns and rows, communication with stakeholders, constant meetings, etc.--all things I've never enjoyed, have much experience with, or am necessarily good at). I think the role might be a) outside of my skill set, and b) not something I'd really enjoy. I tend to be risk-averse and sometimes underestimate my capabilities, but this is the first time where I have truly questioned if I'm capable of performing at the level they require. If I felt like I'd have time to get up to speed/trained, I'd feel more comfortable, but it sounds like they want someone to come in and hit the ground running. While the opportunity sounds great on paper, I'm concerned I might struggle, and given the level and salary, I'm not sure how much leeway I'll have to get up to speed. 

What I don't want to do is leave a role I'm good at and end up getting tossed aside if I have difficulty adapting.

I’m a research coordinator at a major university. I’ve been at my current job about two years. My boyfriend has been unemployed for several months and has been trying to apply to a lot of jobs without success. He recently started applying to jobs at my university, for job titles similar to mine. He doesn’t have a biology degree like I do but he is very smart and good with data from a background in private industry. He helped me with a data project that I did a few months back so I think he definitely could do the job. 

Recently he asked me to write a letter to an employee in a different research lab, to recommend him for the job but I don’t know anyone in this lab. I’ve never done anything like this before, but he said it’s very common in private industry for people to do things like this. Is this appropriate in a research/academic setting?

1fw3cnr,Quitting current job to focus on masters degree for one semester?,"I want an opinion whether I am sane and logical in my reasoning. Whether I made a bad decision and how to best improve my situation.

I did a 3 year bachelors degree without having a job in the field. I landed a fairly good job (by my standards) immediately after the bachelors degree after being an intern for 2 months. I then paused college and worked there full time for 1 year. During that period I learned much since that was my first ever job doing programming.

After that I decided to get back to college to do 2 year masters degree because that's something I wanted to do but not right after bachelors degree. I then did 1 year of masters program while still working part time for the same company. During that period I felt like I wasn't improving my skills at the job and there was nothing exciting. It impacted my masters and now I need to do 2 more years instead of just 1 although those 2 years will be much easier since I only need to do some courses.

Now, I am planning to quit my job (part time job) and focus this semester on my masters program since this is the hardest semester (in addition to regular courses I enrolled in some additional courses I failed). I like the job but I am not thrilled about it. I don't see a clear progression there so I don't feel like I am missing out on much.  
The main thing I want an opinion on is, I mainly went to do masters degree because I've been struggling at the job. I feel like my skills are not what they need to be to feel comfortable in that environment. I needed to fake it till I made it on some cases and I did my best but I feel like I need to invest more in my skills outside of work because the same will happen on the next job... I will feel inferior. I am planning to use the masters degree to give myself some time to polish my skills and maybe explore more part time positions at different companies without overselling myself.

The alternative would've been I didn't start masters and stayed full time at the company. I think that would be doable and I would save much money but apart from that nothing more. I would have 2 years of full time experience but wouldn't feel like it.

Are there any flaws you see in this reasoning?",tothespace2,1,1.0,1,1728059298,2024-10-04 16:28:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fw3cnr/quitting_current_job_to_focus_on_masters_degree/,10,2024
1fw39zg,Feeling stuck in my marketing career. What are my options if I don’t want to go into management (UK-based)?,"
I’m in my mid-thirties and currently work as an email marketing executive (CRM), but I’m feeling stuck in my career. I’m UK-based, and while I like my role, I don’t have aspirations to move into management, which seems to be the only progression route at my company.

My job is mostly remote, which suits me well as I need to be home to care for my disabled dogs. Going back to full-time office work isn’t an option. Ideally, I’d like to become an expert or specialist in something so I don’t have to manage people, but I’m not sure what my options are without going back to university, which I can’t afford.

I’m autistic, and I struggle with corporate environments, especially with the social demands and expectations to be proactive. In past office jobs, I’ve faced criticism for not being proactive enough socially and for needing clear, step-by-step guidance in tasks. Managing a team feels out of the question for me.

I’m open to learning new skills and taking online courses. Right now, I’m using Mimo to learn HTML. I have experience in digital marketing, web content editing, email marketing, live chat and customer support, as well as basic Photoshop and design skills (though I’m not skilled enough to be a graphic designer).

One important thing: I’d prefer to stay on a salary rather than go freelance, as the unpredictability and stress of freelancing feels overwhelming to me.

What are my options for career progression in marketing, or even outside of marketing, that don’t involve management? Are there any certifications or online courses I should consider?",fairwellfairground,1,1.0,0,1728059116,2024-10-04 16:25:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fw39zg/feeling_stuck_in_my_marketing_career_what_are_my/,10,2024

The first year was great, but I realized VERY quickly that my direct manager has favorites and for a while there, I was one of them. He’d call and gossip about other people on the team, get me involved in projects, and try to get me to achieve great things my first year. After they got rid of someone who he very much didn’t like (and who was difficult to work with as well), I knew that whoever new that came in would be the new favorite, but I didn’t realize how awful he’d end up being. 
He’s still really cool with another person there but that guy never makes mistakes so it makes sense, but I’ve sank hours of time into projects that aimed at progressing the team and users workflow in the business, get glowing reviews from other coworkers and higher ups , and have actively saved the team money in just one year and some change. When I talk now he’s rolling his eyes, is super short with me, and is ready to argue with me about ANY small thing. Things that before he’d shrug off and say no big deal and then gossip about how someone else on the team is worse. The job that has been a dream job for me and the first corporate job I’ve had is quickly becoming a nightmare because I feel like I’m on eggshells. Trust me, I saw the red flags in the behavior but I just thought that he could still remain professional and treat people fairly. He’d have to be able to do that if he’s in corporate right? I’m not used to this as I used to work in hospitality where people called out each other but in this situation I’m afraid to talk to HR because I don’t want to make a big deal out of anything and have this all explode and have a bigger target on my back, but I also know that other people on the team have NEVER been the “favorite,” from day one, and getting a taste of that treatment had me almost in tears when literally a few weeks ago I was told that my performance was great and that I was “going places fast.” Please advise, I’m turning to Reddit of all places for answers. 

** Note that I never talked bad about my coworkers as I was always trying to bring the team closer together. I’d listen to him, because I didn’t want to be disrespectful or ungrateful.

1fw297b,Career change ideas while pregnant and between jobs.,"Hi everyone! 40 F, living in Italy, currently 5 months pregnant. A couple of months ago, I had to close my own food and beverage business, which was a tough decision. Throughout my life, I've worked in various fields of design (graphic design, fashion, interior design, visual merchandising...) and more recently, I took on branding and art direction roles for my own business, while also managing product sales. I’ve always had an entrepreneurial mindset and love the challenge of building something new. However, I’m at a crossroads now. I don’t want to return to graphic design(it feels like it’s time for a change). I’m searching for something new that’s creative yet business-oriented. The challenge is, being pregnant, it’s unlikely anyone would hire me when I’m heading into maternity leave in just 4 months. So, I’m thinking about using this time to study and prepare myself for the future.I already hold a master’s degree in design and another in management, but I’m not sure what direction to take next. I'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions—whether it’s in terms of career ideas, educational paths, or anything else that might help me navigate this transition.THANKS:)",a2matu,1,1.0,1,1728056555,2024-10-04 15:42:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fw297b/career_change_ideas_while_pregnant_and_between/,10,2024

1fw0xr8,how do I go forward from where I am right now?,"
Hello Everyone!

I’m a 27 yo F, finished my master’s degree in data science a year ago. I have a 3 years of working experience along with it. 

I’ve been searching for a job post master’s since past year, half heartedly at times, but have had no luck so far in it. I’ve upskilled myself during this time, doing certifications, changing my resume and cover letters so many times but the job search seems futile so far. 

At times it feels like I am really not interested in the field I chose to pursue and then hit with the realisation of all the efforts I’ve put to finish my education. 

I had real interest, talent and passion for coding during my bachelor’s, which carried into my job as well but because of my bad work experience, I’ve lost interest in coding. 

Any attempts to rekindle the passion by relearning and challenging myself have not been successful, due to struggle with thoughts between “I’m afraid I won’t get back to where I was” and “maybe this isn’t what I’m meant for”. 

I’ve been in a limbo since past year and the tech job market hasn’t been kind on anyone since 2021 either. 

Kind meaning people around me advice to be patient and apply or find something else to get going financially, but having had not so great work experience before, I’m scared of getting into such situation again and am unable to take any career changing decisions either. 

How do I get unstuck? How do I get the drive to work or find better ways to earn? How do I even find what I like?

Any advice would be helpful. Thanks in advance. ",skylar567890,1,1.0,2,1728053254,2024-10-04 14:47:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fw0xr8/how_do_i_go_forward_from_where_i_am_right_now/,10,2024

I have experience in film producing, editing, film exhibition, and teaching. I also worked in customer service for a couple years. I even went and got a PhD in screen studies (just graduated; it was funded &  I'm not in debt) with the goal of building a career as a lecturer and researcher (I'm pretty passionate about film criticism and I have written some stuff etc etc). I thought academia would be a good career pivot from the industry. That doesn't seem like it's going anywhere either; I keep getting rejected from university jobs. I was the happiest when I worked in film exhibition, so I thought ""cool, let me pursue that"". Well- it didn't go anywhere after a couple projects; also I can't really rely on project payments; I need a stable salary. I literally moved countries to pursue a film career. I did everything I could. I tried so hard for a decade. I think it's time to give it up. I reached a point where I just am tired of not being financially okay. So what do I do now? I just want a well-paying office job. I don't care if it's not creative.  I think giving up my passion would be worth it if I, at least, make a good living for myself. Any suggestions?

1fw0qhk,how to cope with feeling like you're awful at a job,"

doing a part time retail job alongside an online masters degree bur I feel like the amount I stress about this job it's full time in my head.

i have done my first week at a retail job, won't name it but it's red and people always try steal from it. I get the feeling I'm just shit at it.

people are okay for a retail job I've had worse managers and ruder coworkers in the past, but I'm on lots of closing shifts. the issue with this is I am apparently shit at leaving stuff good enough for the next day (which I'm partly like okay I get it yeah has to look nice but it'll get messed up again in 5 seconds).

I was on women's clothes the other night and I thought I had done a good job looked neat had put stuff back right. then comes over the headsets ""can some people come and do this area again"". 

and that's been a constant theme this first week. ""so and so still needs doing"" ""whoever did this can u do it again"" ""this looks a right mess"" ""we all go home late if you don't do this better"". 

I genuinely do not understand how it doesn't look good enough half the time like it's not s total tip. Just gets me down. when no one else is receiving feedback like that. 

and when half the time they expect it done before the shop closes too but people stay until the shop shuts so anything u fix will get messed up again. 

idk I just think I'm too slow and too dumb for even a simple retail job. if anyone has any tips or advice (pls be nice im sensitive) I would appreciate it thank u ",Cute_Aspect7438,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1728052745,2024-10-04 14:39:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fw0qhk/how_to_cope_with_feeling_like_youre_awful_at_a_job/,10,2024
1fw0o9o,How do I find a job that suits me? (Trouble knowing what I’m qualified for) ,"Hi! 30(F)
Currently as we speak I have a great job that I love and enjoy. My team is great, the PTO is amazing, I get to work from home. (Could they pay me more? Yes but I do get paid decently and I can afford to live and support myself so it’s not the end of the world)
The only downside is the constant changing of the higher ups. They are making constant changes and our company has gone through many major lay offs. My department hasn’t been hit hard but me and those on my team do fear we will be next to get the ax and replaced with these new people. 
So while I hope to have this job for the foreseeable future, I do also have to be prepared somewhat for the worst case scenario. 

I have a bachelors degree in fine arts. (Not my best decision looking back but I can’t change that now) I personally do not want to go back to school and throw myself into even more debt unless it’s actually going to put me ahead and not just drown me. 
All my working experience though is in customer service. I’ve worked a lot of call centers (I absolutely hate them) and my most current job is education based, and I do a lot of back office pro reading I guess you could say. 
I’m feeling lost whenever I do on the off chance look at job listings. It seems bleak. 
I want something that is more than just answering a phone all day, but I don’t know what else I should really be looking for. 
Sorry I know this post is kind of long and round about. 
Any advice would be helpful.

I’m being offered a new job for 120k, + 7-15% annual bonus at a for profit company with a somewhat bad reputation for high turnover. The HR team seems great and I hear departments on the admin side are much happier. 

The thought of switching jobs is horrifying becuase I love my job and I’m well liked. But I worry about money a lot, and we want kids and as our current budget is, we wouldn’t be able to save any money when we have kids. 

The new job would help so much, and I think I would do just fine performance wise, I’m just worried about being a small fish in a big pond. The company is much bigger and a much more corporate setting. 

I’m worried about letting my current team down as I feel like they need me and my boss will hate me for leaving. The thought of a new opportunity is exciting as it is equally terrifying. I will miss the long tenure, and I hate the idea of starting over; rebuilding a reputation and rapport…

1fvycbb,"New job, managers are absent and I am overloaded","I just started a new job this week (HR for a healthcare company) and it’s a bit of a hot mess. It’s a smaller company (under 200 people, mostly field workers) and I report directly to the owners. They are incredibly busy, I get it, but I’m a week in and they have not once asked me how my first week is going, if I have any questions, or spoken with me at all except to assign me stuff to do with no guidance or support. 

They have said they will train me on the things no one else can train me on, then they don’t do it, and send me that stuff to do anyways and say it’s urgent. When I replied that I will get started once they train me, the manager asked me to tell her what I need training on. 

By the end of my second or third day, I had a list half a page long of tasks they had sent me to work on, with no indication of what is priority. If something comes up they just put it on my plate. 

They’ve already made me feel in the first week that they don’t care about me at all. They don’t work in the same field as me and they are not managers, they are owners and clinicians. I knew this coming in but I didn’t expect to receive no training and an overload of work with 0 guidance or support. 

It’s a 30% raise and more senior job title from my previous job, and I will learn many more aspects of my field to help me get another job (I was stuck in an entry level position previously). So my plan is to just do my best with what I’m given, gain some experience, and then move on to something else. But as a person with bad anxiety, it’s not going to be fun for me.

1fvy9b8,Customer is unhappy with my work and contacted my boss,"Hello everyone, I recently had a very unpleasant week and have been thinking about it a lot ever since. I hope you might be able to give me a different perspective on things. I am a very ambitious person and always have very high standards for myself. However, this is also one of my biggest flaws because I tend to take criticism very personally. Here’s the situation: I work as a Product Owner in a software company that serves many clients. I’ve been working as a Proxy Product Owner for a particular client for quite some time. My main responsibilities in this project are requirements management and stakeholder management. Everything had been going well until I returned from vacation last week. On Monday, my boss asked me for a meeting, and after some small talk, he mentioned that he needed to discuss something a bit unpleasant with me. He revealed that my main contact, who is also the lead product manager on the project, had complained about me. He said that the client was not satisfied with our collaboration and felt that we often talked past each other and didn’t really share a common understanding.

As my boss told me this, I felt deeply affected by it, as communication is one of the most important aspects of my role, and the criticism was directed precisely at that. I hadn’t seen it coming, so it took me by complete surprise. After having some time to reflect on the conversation, I also talked with my team to find out if anything had happened last week that could explain this behavior. I was told that some tasks hadn’t been completed satisfactorily, and the client was annoyed that certain requirements weren’t considered. Moreover, I had been out sick before my vacation, and since we are a small company, information might not have been passed along properly. Since I’ve been back from vacation, my project manager has been sick, and I haven’t been able to talk to her yet either. This means that everything the client said happened behind my back and wasn’t discussed with me directly.

This situation bothers me a lot because A, I don’t know exactly what was said, and B, I haven’t been able to speak with the involved parties yet. My boss wasn’t even part of the conversation with the client; he only relayed what he had heard. Later in the week, my boss had another meeting with the client, where it was revealed that the client was particularly unhappy about a task that wasn’t properly handled, and he reiterated that they felt like we often talk past each other. Additionally, there was criticism that our delivery speed isn’t fast enough and that the client has to wait too long for certain things and feedback. I must admit, I find it very challenging to meet the client’s expectations in this regard because it’s a startup, and they have very chaotic structures, with a very high pace of requests. However, I see my job more conceptually, and I believe my main task in requirements management is to develop good, sustainable solutions with the client, rather than quick fixes. But the client expects quick fixes—or rather, prefers them—because they are so chaotically structured internally that they can’t provide clear requirements. This naturally leads to conflict, which is why I can understand the complaint to some extent.

My boss has now suggested that I get support on the project to better handle client management in tandem with my colleague. For me, this feels like being given a babysitter, and overall, it’s just not a good feeling. I also wish that the client had spoken to me first before escalating the issue to my boss. I haven’t been in this job for long, so this is the first time I’m dealing with a situation like this. I’m familiar with customer dissatisfaction, but no one has ever expressed it so explicitly about me. Since, as mentioned above, I’m a very ambitious person, this criticism hits me hard and makes me doubt whether I even want to continue working on this project. On the other hand, I see a successful project as an opportunity for personal development and as leverage for salary negotiations. I’m trying not to take this too personally, but I keep catching myself feeling sad and not good enough for this job because of the criticism. I know this is probably an overreaction, but how do you handle situations like this?",Unleashed94,1,1.0,2,1728045912,2024-10-04 12:45:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fvy9b8/customer_is_unhappy_with_my_work_and_contacted_my/,10,2024

1fvw1qv,Advice on raise and profile change on top of yearly raises ,"Hi, 
In my company we have a yearly review process, which also includes a mid year review, to just check if we are still on track, what is going well, what to improve etc. During the end year review, you get a raise based on your performance, usually a few percent. You have to perform “within expectations” to be considered for the raise, and the better you perform, you can get a bit extra. I work here for 7 years and always had a higher rating. 
I had one bigger promotion 3 years ago when I changed roles. They offered it themselves and I didn’t negotiate at the time (never actually). It was a 16% raise.
After the change in roles, I did get a change in job title a year after, adding “senior” to my name. Because they were hiring juniors in the same job title. This didn’t come with a raise. (I asked for the name change, but didn’t negotiate a new salary, I did know the junior one was offered less than me, but still more than what I got when I started). 
Now I have discussed with my manager to change the type of work/projects that I will be working on. In my opinion it involves more responsibility, guiding the junior employee, also more involvement with higher management. We haven’t discussed formally changing my role though, so I want to discuss both things: what does it mean for my role description, and what can we do about the salary. 
I have never asked for a raise before and I’m already nervous about it. Next week is the mid year talk. I’m wondering if that would be a suitable moment to discuss this, how to approach it, and also what to expect if we actually already get these yearly raises. I want to be prepared for the type of answers like: but you already got a raise with your performance review, or it is not a job change/part of the current profile, etc etc. I know myself and I don’t want to walk out with “oh okay that’s fine then I’ll guess”. 
Does anyone have a similar system at their company and advice on how to get an additional raise/advocate for a role change? 

Additional info: I’m on good terms with my manager, we get along really well, but that doesn’t mean I’m comfortable in these type of conversations (which is on me, not on him). I’m female, 29y. Only female in a male team, which I love, but I bet the rest is better at asking for more money.",casaFinn123,1,1.0,0,1728038202,2024-10-04 10:36:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fvw1qv/advice_on_raise_and_profile_change_on_top_of/,10,2024

Hi, so this is my second time writing this because it got flagged and I had to update it, so please excuse me if there are any errors.

A little back story. 

I, 20F, graduated with Bachelors degree in Health Sciences with a concentration in Biology and Health IT in December 2023. During my last couple of semesters, I was interested in the IT route and wanted to explore a career in Cybersecurity. After I graduated, I took a few more courses and was trying to find an entry level/internship position to help me gain a better understanding of what I've learned. However, in the tech field, they mostly require experienced workers even if it is an entry level position. So it's been he'll trying g to find a position. Along the way, I've actually realized that I don't think I'd be too happy in this field, and I think I want to return to the health side. 

Here's another thing, I initially planned on going through the pharmacy program but realized that I may not be committed enough for it and let it go. So I need help trying to find a career that'll be good for me. So if anyone has any advice or has ever been in a situation like this, please let me know.

1fvtgj0,Feeling Stuck at 24: Masters Abroad or Gain More Experience for an MBA?,"Hey everyone,

I'm at a bit of a crossroads in life and could really use some advice. I graduated in 2022 from a tier-3 institute in India with a GPA of 7.7. For the past 2 years, I’ve been working as a Senior SDE at a US-based startup in India, earning a decent package of 17 LPA.

Lately, though, I’ve been feeling stuck. Most of my friends are pursuing their Master’s degrees abroad, especially in the US. Initially, I had thoughts of doing the same, but looking at the current situation, spending 60L INR for a Master's in the US doesn’t seem logical anymore.

Now I’m at a point where I don’t know whether I should pursue a Master’s abroad in a more affordable country like Germany or stay on my current path, gain more experience, and maybe opt for an MBA down the line.

I’m about to turn 24 this month, and I can’t shake the feeling that I haven’t really grown much in life, career-wise or personally. It’s scary to think I might end up not figuring things out while everyone around me seems to be flourishing.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation?

1fvtg2i,Is It Me or Does My Boss Hate Me? ,"TL;DR I get along with my coworkers and supervisor fine but I feel like my manager has disliked me from the start. My work isn't perfect but is above average in many ways, my manager ignores that and only focuses on the area I'm lacking in (time management). The first time I was ~25 minutes late to work and he hung up on a client I was helping in order to confront me about why I didn't notify him before getting to work (on a day he is typically unavailable), and recently he passed over me for a new, more advanced position in favor of a new hire I helped train, citing ""personality differences"" as the reason when I requested feedback. And I feel like I'm out of my mind, so any feedback or guidance is appreciated. 


I've felt since my interview that my manager just does not care for me, when I got hired he told me that he thought I would be a great fit for the role but his non-verbal cues like tone of voice and expressions seemed almost annoyed. I think I'm good at reading people, but at the time I chalked it up to the fact that he was interviewing me over zoom and I was nervous, so I thought maybe I was projecting my nerves onto him. After a few months I noticed that he approaches my coworkers in similar ways and people have implied that he is not the easiest to work with or the best communicator. My supervisor will sometimes apologize for my manager being short with us, he does things like approach our team like we have done something wrong because he conceptualized some situation in which we might potentially do something wrong in the future, is generally unhelpful when approached with a problem and typically tells you to go ask someone else, and never takes angry client calls when they would demand to speak to management, just leaves us hanging until they hang up, calm down, or become abusive enough that we hang up on them. I get along well with my coworkers and my direct supervisor who I interact with much more frequently, so at that point I just made up my mind to just stay out of my manager's way and figured he didn't have good people skills. I was actually pretty pleased to come to the conclusion that he might just be kind of a jerk, since it at least it wasn't personal. 

For the sake of fairness, I will say that I do have a bad habit of letting old work get lost in the mix sometimes. I have ADHD, time management and redirecting my attention are my biggest struggles and I work in a position (IT support tech, mid tier) where new tasks are constantly being thrown at me at a rate I cannot anticipate and I have no way of knowing if they will take five minutes to resolve or a few hours and if I'll have a minute between finishing one ticket and receiving the next or an hour, plus we have been understaffed for a few months now so each of us is expected to take on a higher volume of tickets than normal. I'm expected to work on these longer ""old"" tickets in between the work getting thrown at me throughout the day so very often it goes: Start working on an ""old"" ticket > Receive ticket I need to tackle immediately > Work urgent ticket > Forget whatever ""old"" ticket I was working on previously, my brain basically resets after I finish whatever the interrupting task was. It has yet to cause any major issues but its not great, I'm aware! 

Early on I could sense this pattern emerging, so before I received any complaints about my backlog, I asked my manager ""Hey, sometimes on high volume days it's difficult for me to keep up with my ""old"" tickets, would it be okay if on those days I set aside a block of fifteen minutes to half an hour to strictly focus on those without interruption? I think that would really help me keep my backlog down."". He responded by bringing up the caseload from the prior day (a slow day) and said ""If I brought that request higher up, they would say ""what was w1r3m0th3r doing this period of an hour with no incoming tickets, or this other period of a half hour here?"" And I wouldn't have an answer for them, so if your backlog gets too high we can entertain something like that after, but not now."". I tried to explain that I didn't mean daily, and that I had no issues on slower days (I didn't even have any notable backlog at the time) I only meant during higher volume periods and was attempting to just be proactive with a solution to this issue I could see incoming, but the conversation ended there. 

What changed my mind back to thinking he has particular dislike for me was the first time I was late to work without prior notice. Generally, we are meant to notify management via email when coming in more than 15 minutes late. I would also like to note that there is a day I work where my manager and supervisor are almost always out of office and I had in the past attempted to reach my manager regarding time sensitive issues on that day and I was ignored until he was back in office. The first time I was late to work beyond that 15 minute limit (about ~25 minutes) due to sleeping through my alarm was on the day he is typically out of office, I got to work and saw that we were unusually busy and there were calls waiting, so I opted to clock in and begin working immediately to help out my coworkers and figured that the email to my manager just saying ""Hey, I'm late today, sorry!"" could wait until the rush of tickets was handled, since he usually would not read it until he was back in office anyway. Unfortunately, this was the one day he was there, and as I answered a client call he began sending me Slack messages asking why I did not message him before clocking in, and before I could type a reply he hung up on the person I was speaking to in order to question me about not replying to his text messages (I had not gone through my phone notifications before getting to work and I hadn't expected him to text me when all of our prior correspondence was via email, which I told him) and tell me I needed to be better at communicating. He then proceeded to watch me like a hawk the rest of the day, and noticed that I was not closing tickets as I was ending calls (something I had been doing for several months and no one noticed at all... and that resumed doing a few weeks after this) and pulled me aside again, where he implied that the information in my tickets must not be correct due to them being closed later in the day rather than immediately after the corresponding call. I told him that I take notes on the side during each case and verify any necessary info in our CRM, but during high volume times I hold off on fully filling out and closing some of the tickets until things slow down in order to get through the waiting calls faster, and then using my down time when things are slow to notate the cases fully and I didn't think it was an issue because there wasn't a disproportionate number of incidents I worked that did not get entered as tickets. He asked me ""what if they call back and your coworkers don't have an existing ticket to reference"" and I stated that if I closed a ticket with incomplete notation for the sake of ""real time statistics"" my coworkers would have to reach out to me anyway for my notes, and it would be more time consuming to sort through the closed tickets later to add my full notes, or else I would have to spend time on the call with a client entering my notes rather than resolving the incident ASAP. I was not trying to be argumentative, but I was frustrated that it was implied I was not doing my job correctly and cutting corners, I felt I was being micro-managed while my coworkers were a man down during a rush due to this conversation. He got pretty clearly irritated at my response and threatened me with retraining if I didn't do things ""like everyone else"" because ""everyone else manages this way just fine"", despite there being no policy/rules against what I was doing and the fact that overall it made no noticeable difference in my performance unless you were watching me call for call and case for case. After that I was extremely frustrated and as I took one of my breaks to compose myself, my manager sent me multiple Slack messages about why I was not immediately getting back to work and how my coworkers needed my help. 

Just so that the impression isn't that I am a slacker, my work is overall pretty solid and I am good at my job. I am finishing up a related bachelor's degree and have been trained in ITIL foundations, comptia A+ and Network+, and have a lot of experience that, frankly, makes me overqualified for this role (I was reeled in with promises for advancement opportunities after graduating and the benefit packages). Senior members of the support/engineering team get along with me well and I don't need hand-holding with more advanced troubleshooting, I've come up with solutions to known issues that previously we didn't have a fix for, I frequently help out my coworkers (who have worked here years longer than me) with advanced troubleshooting, I volunteer for work other people avoid, my tickets have been used as examples for ""perfect"" case admistration/notation and professional correspondence (My supervisor's words, not mine. And yes, my tickets were used to train my coworkers about 4 months after I was confronted about my workflow and threatened with retraining for not doing things ""like everyone else"".) and after only being here a year I was chosen to help train a new technician, too. 

At my performance review, prior to the new technician joining our team, I tried to emphasize some of my accomplishments and he brushed them off and told me my performance was exactly middle of the road and that I had plenty of room to grow into this role. When I attempted to bring up some specific examples of how I went above the expectations for my role, he ignored me and redirected the conversation to ask me about how I planned to address my backlog, despite us being still understaffed, meaning he could not ""officially"" raise issue with or judge my performance on, by his own admission. 

My breaking point was when recently a new team was created that was intended to support one specialized area and they wanted to promote current technicians to fills spots on this new team. My manager was chosen to head this new team, which I was bummed to hear about, because the position came with more challenging work and a likely pay increase so I wanted to throw my hat in. There is one senior tech who is more knowledgeable than me in this area and I accepted that if he applied, he would probably get the role and would deserve it. However, this is a support area that the majority of my coworkers actively dislike and struggle with, but that I have been previously praised for my competency in, so I thought I still had a chance and would be the second choice if my senior coworker didn't apply. The only person other than me to apply ended up being the new technician I helped train, who is competent but had only been with the company about six weeks and is entirely untrained in that specialized area of support. I found out along with everyone else in a slack message that she was chosen for the role. I reached out to my supervisor to ask if there was any feedback from management as to why I was not chosen, since I was not provided with any, congratulated our new hire stating that she was capable and I thought she would do a great job, and (this was a mistake, I should not have offered a reason) said something like ""Was this just due to his concern about my backlog or are there other factors in this descision?"". My manager got back to me referencing the backlog, but his main point was a ""difference in personality"", stating that he would need people able to make suggestions to help shape the new team. 

I spent my lunch period after I was passed over for the new support position angry-crying because I don't *feel* like I've done anything to be treated this way, but I also can't wrap my head around why somebody would have such an issue with me for no reason. Our team is getting a new manager in several weeks after my current one moves to this new team and supposedly our new manager is much easier to work with, but I think I am done here. Beyond the culture issue, I disagree with many of their service management practices, I feel I was mislead about this position from the start, and that management is generally lacking in integrity. I've been trying to gear up for a job hunt, but I am so burnt out and discouraged after all of this that even updating my resume is taking me ages and I'm tired just at the idea of the whole process. Currently, my only plan is to show documentation of how I was treated to HR and my new manager during my exit interview, after I accept a position elsewhere. 

If you read all that... bless you haha and if anyone has advice for handling this or even if you have a dose of reality for me and don't think I'm being treated unfairly I'd love to hear your thoughts on this situation because I feel a bit crazy.

1fvt6gk,What would you do in my shoes? ,"TLDR: Would you rather take a traveling drone job or just find a minimum wage filler job to keep from going broke?

Hypothetically, say your most prominent work experience, outside of minimum wage filler jobs, has been drone work. You skipped college. You've bounced around full time drone jobs for the past 5 years, trying your hand at a drone inspection gig, a drone delivery gig, a drone agriculture gig, etc..  you're renting a nice house and settling down with your significant other / pets in a town you like, but there's no drone jobs or drone opportunities there. You're out of work, running out of money, and you have two options:

A. Take a traveling drone power line inspection gig for okay, middle-class money. You'll be gone for weeks at a time, often being home for a few days before another few weeks on the road. The upside is you're staying in the only real career you've ever known. The downside is you're always traveling.

B. Take a minimum wage job down the street with normal hours and the ability to be home each night to sleep in your own bed. The upside is you never have to go far. The downside is it's just another filler job that won't help your career besides keeping the lights on.

What would YOU choose?

You guessed it, this is my current situation. Besides various fast food restaurants and some landscaping jobs, my only career path has been commercial drone work - for other companies. I've tried running my own drone business but demand is low where I live. I've been lucky to land 3 different drone pilot roles in my state, but unfortunately the market for these roles is currently dry. I'd hate to leave my fiance for weeks at a time and accept a traveling role, but I'd also hate succumbing to unemployment and picking up another meaningless minimum wage job to keep my bills paid. I know that eventually, a local job for drone/video will pop up. I just don't know if it will be in a few months or in a few years. If it were you and you had 0 debt, would you try for a college degree in another field? Take the traveling job? Take the minimum wage job until you figured something else out? Would love to hear stories from those with traveling jobs and a family at home.

1fvs7hk,Should I name drop to HR about toxic people?,"Someone I worked with briefly filed a complaint to HR after she resigned following a shift where a supervisor yelled at her harshly and made her cry in front of many people, after months of being picked on behind the scenes over her weight, mannerisms, demeanor, etc. The people hating on her loved to inflate their fragile egos by trampling on hers whenever they could. They would get mad if they got treated the way she did, but they felt their hypocrisy was justified. She wasn’t amazing at her job, but she was a good person and felt comfortable sharing with me that she felt like nobody ever gave her a break. 

I work in catering and she had to lead a set up that day, but several people found it frustrating to work with her due to her not following instruction. I understand, but I don’t. It’s not that deep at the end of the day. She was still a human being. It’s not good to abuse your position and raise your voice at others, and this supervisor is a repeat offender. The same people that got interviewed about this event lied to HR about there not being any yelling at all just because they were trying to save their asses and they were all buddy buddy, despite telling me straight up that the supervisor might have taken it too far, and said “she deserved that shit” which I found disgusting. 

I was interviewed too to get insight into the general environment. I explained that the work environment could be non-inclusive and hostile, but I felt uncomfortable name dropping because I knew it would damage my working relationship with others and I’m personally not looking for another reason to be unhappy at work. I have to look out for myself too. But I was so disgusted today that I’m thinking I might. I just wanted to know what the potential cons were to this.

I’m really trying to grow and learn about my field in the job I wind up with. However, I definitely smoke weed. Usually it’s either edibles or THC pens, rarely bud. Of course a lot of the places I’m applying have the chance to drug test me, so I have a few questions.

1.) What happens if you fail a drug test? 

2.)Can the employer report me to the police since I’m underage?

3.) If I fail a drug test, am I guaranteed to not get the job? Or do employers know that I’m in college and party and all that??

4.) Do companies often drug test in the middle of the internship?

I’m a really nervous guy, and I’ve been smoking pretty regularly, so I know it’ll have accumulated in my system for a while. I’m not smoking while I go through the interviewing process and all that. I ordered some at home THC test strips so I can try to monitor it, I’m just really scared to fail and lose a good opportunity. Any feedback is appreciated.

1fvr34w,Just got put on a PIP with zero warnings,"God, I've been busting ass as a draftsman at an engineering firm for a year now. I've always communicated effectively and responded with positive and accurate messages. I fix redlines primarily, I thought I was doing okay.
Apparently I've been slowly removed from each project I'm on... Thought stuff was busy at QC and I was just waiting for more redlines...
Nope. Apparently the people above me just made harmless excuses as to why I haven't been given any projects or have flat out told me nothing... ""Maybe next week we'll have stuff for you.""
I get called into the bosses office and he brings up a PIP file. No one ever gave me warnings and instead tried to make me unaware of my incoming termination. I suppose this happens...

What do I do? I've just signed the PIP and they'll ""see if I improve."" I've already sent out applications for other jobs... I DO NOT want to work with people who can't be straight with me.  what should I do during this period? Should I just sit on my ass and wait to be fired? I've subtly let my boss know I'm looking for work elsewhere. Will my company pay me severance, or is a PIP a way around that for them? Any advice is appreciated 👍

1fvpour,To stay or to go,"I graduated college and have been working for the same company for 2 years. I started as an intern and got hired on full time and am fulfilling a large roll since many predecessors have come and gone allowing me to take on more responsibilities. I have learned a lot about the business and I would say I am really good at my job. 

Recently through a family friend received a job offer. It was quite a bit more than I was currently making and it peaked my interest and so I decided to accept the offer. 

It is now my last week at my current job and my employer told me that they would match the offer that I received. Prior to this I was honestly super sad that I was going to leave and I realized that I really loved my current job and my team. My manager has told me that I’m irreplaceable and that I am truly talented in what I do. Multiple people have said that they don’t want to see me go and wished that I could stay. I realized that this week I was happy for the first time in a long time. I enjoy what I do and had no problem working there it was just money that was enticing me to leave. Also current job offers better benefits and allows me to work hybrid and I’m unsure my new job would be that way. 

What do you think should I stay or go? ",Ambitious-Field5834,1,1.0,2,1728011485,2024-10-04 03:11:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fvpour/to_stay_or_to_go/,10,2024
1fvpaaw,"If you’re new at a job & mgmt so far is saying you’re doing good, would you actually feel more confident? ","



 
I know it sounds like a really stupid question. My anxiety is typically pretty bad, even worse when it comes to working & social interactions. Prior to this job, I worked in financial aid for ~2 yrs. It started out stressful but I ended up getting good feedback from mgmt/my metrics were apparently one of the better on the team. I sought new work due to the workload at the time & wanting better pay. Now I’m in my 4th week  & this is a school I’ve been trying to get into for a hot minute. 

I’ve trained with the mgr & supervisor, both have told me I’m doing well & I’m not even asking for feedback(yet).  Mgr felt the need to let the whole team know that I was picking up fast when I was first  introduced to them. This job is more in depth vs the last job & she even told me that they only hire people with experience now bc of how much there is to it. Prior to this wk, I was w/ the mgr  training & got that 1:1 attention. Now, they’ve thrown me into the deep end & I’m doing *work work*. I have SO many questions & just msg the supervisor, too many unknowns. I have notes I took & training resources but still feel like I might need direction if I’m working something new, especially if I didn’t work through an actual scenario before. 

I’m not sure if I’m expecting hand holding in the sense of wanting more extensive training or they’re just expecting me to ask as I go, as I work through a new task. The supervisor said that they expect me to ask a ton of questions & she said something today like “I think you caught onto doing an estimate quicker than I did when I was first training”. I know they wouldn’t lie to me & I guess that reassurance should be enough to get me through the brunt of it but it just never is. I REALLY WANT TO MAKE THIS JOB WORK. 

Am I being too hard on myself? Am I right to believe this might not be a good fit for me? My mom made a comment the other day to “have no expectations” when it comes to this job. In the sense that I shouldn’t expect it to be THE PERMANENT JOB or expect it to fail, more to just roll with it and see how it plays out.

1fvoyf1,Where on Earth Do I Go From Here?,"I’m at a bit of a loss and would appreciate any advice.

I started my career as a cook, got into management, and eventually became really interested in software—specifically building software for cooks. So, I taught myself to code and focused on recipe apps and culinary search engines. I worked on this for years—never highly lucrative, but it was something I really enjoyed.

I took time off around the pandemic to care for my kid. Now that I can really get back to work, I’m hitting roadblocks. The tech jobs are tough to find, and kitchens aren’t even calling me back.

On paper, I probably look super weird: I studied engineering, dropped out to cook, worked with some great chefs in San Francisco, was a Sous Chef for a pretty successful restaurant. Then I pivoted into tech, working on recipe apps and software products for food.

In my software roles, I did a bit of everything that needed doing: product management, marketing, data analysis, even making lunch. I helped build search engines, worked on systems that efficiently generated video recipes, developed grocery SKU matching for those recipes, and I've led several small teams, aside from the larger teams I led in restaurants. However, I never really had a formal title in tech, so anything I put on a resume feels like a lie. It's usually Product Management positions that most closely match the work I've done. I get interviews occasionally, but it's a tough sell. I'd guess I'm always competing against someone with a BA and verified PM titles with larger companies.

I love building software for chefs and cooks, but I think my career path looks erratic and irrational to hiring teams. I’ve been getting by on consulting work, a couple small service businesses, and some apps I've built, but nothing stable.

I’m increasingly comfortable with development, especially iOS. Two apps in the app store at the moment, a chrome extension, a few websites, and several apps on Android and IOS that I've pulled from the listings. But I’ve never been a full-time developer. I also have a little PPC and SEO experience, but I’m not passionate about marketing. Where I’m most valuable is the intersection of culinary and software, where I help bridge the gap between culinary concepts and code, but I struggle to convince hiring teams of my value here without traditional credentials.

At this point, I’m stuck. Should I get more education? Find a career coach? I’m a a point where I'm open to just about anything. ",Select-Resource4275,1,1.0,1,1728009074,2024-10-04 02:31:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fvoyf1/where_on_earth_do_i_go_from_here/,10,2024

1fvo3lv,Is a Bachelors Degree valuable at all once you're in your 30's?,"Hi Everyone, 

I (36M) am asking the community for some wisdom.

My situation is not common, and can be summed up like this: 

- I spent most of my twenties pursuing a ""special"" program in the US military, was finally selected for it, then was separated while in the program due to medical issues. Honorable discharge, but no benefits and basically nothing to show for all of that time invested. I was 26 when I left. 

- I had zero backup plan, so I started over. I began going to college full time and working full time.

- I got good grades for about two years and was eventually able to transfer into Columbia University, but I was only able to stay one semester because I couldn't get enough financial aid to finish. I then had to leave and re-establish residency back in VA, which ate up another year.

- I eventually transferred again into George Mason University. I graduate next summer with a BS in Economics. I'll be 37 at that point, and it will be 9 years since I started school. 

- In parallel, I worked hard (in a career that I hate) and did well at it. I went from contractor, to full time consultant, to getting hired in the federal government and making a good income (\~160k) for my area (Arlington, VA). 

Here's my question - does anyone care about a Bachelor's Degree at this age/career stage? 

I'm asking for help here on reddit because I feel so...bewildered. In some ways, I made it - I have a good job and I'm thankful for it. On the flipside though, I feel profoundly stuck, and I feel like I can't get UNSTUCK until I check this box with my Bachelor's degree. Is that true? Is not having it finished going to hold me back if I try to branch out and compete for other jobs? 

I would also really like to do something else career-wise, but I feel like anything that would pay in the same range would require grad school, which means more debt and more long hours on nights and weekends, which has already taken a toll on me. Despite the fact that I have a solid income, own a place, and am in great shape, I don't meet people much because I'm always grinding on work and school. I'd like to build a life with someone and put this all behind me, but I don't feel like I can do that until I can be sure that I can make moves and succeed in the future. I think I'll feel that way when I finally finish school, but is it stupid to think that way? Is it even true? 

Thanks for reading and to anyone that cares to leave a comment. ",jonestyler22,22,0.800000011920929,42,1728006350,2024-10-04 01:45:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fvo3lv/is_a_bachelors_degree_valuable_at_all_once_youre/,10,2024

1fvkt6b,25/yr Old Seeking Advice On Feeling Unfulfilled In Current Position,"I've come to a crossroads in my early adulthood / professional life where I am struggling to feel fulfilled with what I do and confident in where I am heading. To set the stage: I graduated with a Comms BA Degree in 2021 and immediately began working smaller, lesser-paying jobs in my field (supplemented by part-time service jobs to make ends meet). Then, around this time last year, I was offered a position as a Marketing Coordinator, making $58,500/yr. When I got hired, a massive burden was lifted off my chest, as I FINALLY had a full-time job to feel proud of when friends/relatives asked what I was ""doing lately"". But, like most things in life, that high did not last...

After a year in this position, I now feel somewhat stuck and unfulfilled. Though there is an opportunity for growth within the company I currently work for, I feel as though the work I do is somewhat meaningless (creating ads, creating brochures, doing outreach, etc). I see my friends who went into more labor-intensive, meaningful careers (law enforcement, local fire, medical, trades) and feel somewhat insecure about my more white-collar, office job. It's as though I work a job that does not quite require expertise of any kind, say like an electrician, therapist, or chef would have.

So, I've come to Reddit to seek out advice from folks who know a heck of a lot more than I do and have more experience dealing with struggles like mine. Is there a career field that you'd recommend I look into that does NOT require a complete pivot away from the path I've been on? I am eager to learn new skills and diversify my ability as a professional; I've even considered learning a trade and ditching corporate life altogether. As I look ahead to my 10-year plan, I would ideally like to be working professionally in a role that serves a direct benefit to others (improves general welfare). Any suggestions? Am I overthinking things?

1fvk82s,Is it time to grow? ,"I am a server at a corporate restaurant, I have been there for almost 4 years since I was 17. I have done everything there starting as a host moving up to Togo then to server. I have also been the employee that when we were short on cooks and dishwashers I picked up extra shifts for those positions to help out the restaurant. My manager has know about me wanting to bartend pretty much since I turned 18. I was offered the bartending job before I graduated high school but I said no because I was committed to a division one school to play football and thought I’d be leaving within a month. I got injured while working out and lost my scholarship before I got on campus. I let my manager know that I was staying and that I wanted to bartend but someone else already took the promotion. I completely understood and was okay because I was asked first and denied it. Well fast forward two and a half years and I have been passed up on the promotion 5 times. One of our morning bartenders just quit, and I brought it to my managers attention last night that I wanted to bartend and now there are multiple shifts open. She told me they were not necessarily open. I looked at the schedule and an employee who recently quit (didn’t give a two week but quit on the spot) and just came back was on the schedule for the bar shifts. I just kinda shut my mouth and went about my business of getting the restaurant ready to close. With the exception of not letting me bartend my manager has been awesome. When I got kicked out of my dad’s  house her first question was (do you have a place to stay). If I need off on a short notice she makes sure I get it, and if I request off on a day I normally work she normally schedules me on one of my off days to make sure i get my hours. When I ask her why I’m not getting the position every time someone else has gotten in and what I could do better to improve her main response is “you do an awesome job” and then tells me why the other person got the job and it has been different every time. I constantly lead the restaurant in sale percentage every week, and I am always early despite everyone being late and constantly get blasted with no call no shows from my other coworkers. I feel like I’ve hit the top of the mountain with where I can be and am starting to feel like it might be time to move on to a better restaurant while I finish college.

1fvivd4,Career Decision - 4-Day Work Week (Current Employer Offer) or 5 Day with 30% more pay (New Job Offer),"I am going to preface this with I know the usual advice is not to take your current employer's counter offer but I am still in two minds, so would appreciate if there is anyone who could provide their opinion or two-cents if they've been in a similar situation.

A bit of context - I handed in my notice around 2 months ago (my notice period is 3 months). I currently work at a relatively small firm, and for the past two years it's been a bit of a shit show with the small team of 3 having worked itself down to 1 (myself). The job was also not really as advertised, with the head of the dept (now gone) having advertised in my interview work involved in building out the service line and developing the business. However it was from the get go, thrown into helping our Luxembourg office dig themselves caused by a mass exodus of employees.

Since then it's been a bit up and a lot of down, internally a manager was moved over, but they have spent more time OOO then actually working on the BAU with me. I started interviewing around this time, and got several offers, I took one that is a small promotion to Vice President (Manager), have two reports, who both manage smaller sub-teams in addition to a small 10% pay bump, as soon as I got the contract, I handed in my notice. 

Since then the Global Head, and as of last week a new Country Dept. Head has been hired - have both been fairly strong in trying to convince me to stay, and I said I would strongly consider it if I could be given:

*  a 4-day work week
* provisions that the team is actually built out, 
* the capacity to develop processes and procedures 
* actual backing from exco/global management to start pushing back internally on workload given to the ""team"" and the chance to define dept. responsibilities

To my surprise they have come through with offering all of that (however the 4-day work week, comes with 20% cut to my current salary (going down to about 52k from 65k) and annual leave (25 to 20). They have also recently hired a senior admin to assist me and build out the team.

In the past 3 months however, I have decided that I no longer want to work in this industry and want to spend the next 2 years, saving to take a break so I can re-train, help my mother and work on personal projects.

That boils down to the current decision I have to make:

* **Option 1 - Stay with the current company.** 
   * Take the paycut, (still saving but not as much)
   * have a chance to work a 4-day work week  
   * However also potentially have all the promises fall flat and be stuck working 12-hours, 4-days a week to manage the evergrowing client demands without assistance. 
   * This would also involve rescinding the contract I have now signed with the new employer (I know there's really no issue to this, but still not the most convenient thing to do.)
   * Some comfort in dealing with known issues - provided I can deal with them.
   * More flexibility in terms of WFH, as only 2 days in office.
* **Option 2 - Go with the new employer** 
   * Take the bump in salary (75k) so I can save more.
   * Have a team, and direct reports again, so I no longer have to deal with all of the work myself.
   * More structure moving into a bigger organization.
   * Less flexibility in terms of WFH, 3 days in the office. (They said they are flexible but the Snr VP is commuting across country every week for those 3 days even with a newborn!!!)
   * Career bump - I know I don't want to stay in this career, but the VP/Manager title will look a lot more positive on my CV (at least I think it will).
   * Somewhat fear my current job has created a bit of complacency in terms of controls / standards and approach given how much I was purely focused on deliverables instead of foundations.

Obviously I'm aware that they want to keep me because it will look incredibly bad for the team to have completely turned over infront of clients, in addition the pains of creating a massive knowledge gap if I go, regardless of my own performance. In addition bar the contract reinstatement to 4-days, everything else is just talk right now.

Hopefully anyone can share some insight, or has some personal anecdote or opinion to share, I would appreciate anything.",Middle_Present_7948,1,1.0,1,1727991105,2024-10-03 21:31:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fvivd4/career_decision_4day_work_week_current_employer/,10,2024

I am technical and can solve almost all problems with computers, network, printers, etc. But this is al simple settings navigating most of the time or googling, but when it comes to dev work i don’t know what to do, they are very busy they do not have time to train me so i already feel guilty for taking their time.

Solving complex API issues, debugging are not my skills. I have some personal experience with  python, C#, html/css, little bit of git but tbh not much just know the basics. I can solve fizz buzz and TwoSum, can do the basics but i never actually finished a impressive project. Barely finished non existing projects.

I know the basic terminal commands, got experience with linux, windows and macOS but all of this to me is just basic knowledge of a computer. I never did anything that involved real coding.

How do i get this position? They are overestimating me, everyone says i can do it but honestly i don’t know much and i am pretty slow learner and stupid.

1fvfggl,28 Yo Female with a touch of ‘tism is on a career quest for the right job.,"I’m writing this in the name of my future wife. Apologies for the broken English as I’m not a native speaker!

My fiancé (lets call her Lisa) is a 28 year old woman currently living in Bruges Belgium. She graduated in 2018 as an bachelor in the “orthopedagogie”, which basically means she is educated (bachelors degree) in helping people with special needs and children.

During covid she worked at an old folks home where she was responsible for the quality of life of the residents. However, she burned out after not being able to do her job (she had to do laundry, cook food, … instead of caring for the elderly) because of the crisis (and terrible coworkers). During that burn out she stayed home for 2 years whilst working on herself and discovering what she wants to do. During one of the many tests she took, the person who took the test hinted that she might be autistic. After consulting a specialized psychiatrist, this diagnosis was confirmed. This explained a lot of feelings, thoughts, habits … from her childhood up untill now, so it was a bit of a relief and a burden at the same time. This hit pretty hard, but explains a lot. We view this as something positive we’ve learned about her because we can take it into account when searching for her new work. We’ve been through sleepless nights of panic attacks, crying, anger, helplessness…

Fortunately, since januari this year she found the courage to start working again. Lisa started as a volunteer at a farm to help disabled people spend their day. Then as a caretaker at a kindergarden, then as a caretaker in a daycare for kids with mental and physical disabilities and currently at a kindergarden once more.

These are sadly not the jobs she wants to do. They mentally and physically drain her as they require her to do things that don’t match up with introvert personality and autistic traits (having to drive from place to place, being extremely extrovert and talk to loads of strangers, work with a lot of people all the time, …)

Her wants in a job is somewhere where she can work from 1 place and does not have to drive around. A job where she has her own desk and people can come to her. Someplace that pays fair, and where overtime is either paid or taken in leave. Preferably somewhere were she can work progressively (start at 20 hours and build up). Her dream job is a children psychologist, but she does not have the right degree to do so, and going back to school is not an option. Working with children's psychologists is something she would like to do, as she likes to discover what is the problem with a child and see how they can fix that.

1fvf9xp,"Recent graduate: leaving job, ex direct manager being cold - not sure why?","Recent graduate, please be kind. I graduated in Covid and worked remotely for couple years, so this was my first hybrid job and first time being in an office. I’ve been at my job for almost couple years, I left my job last week for a promotion mainly due to career progression.

I have two managers (one direct) - we’ll call him James and one senior who oversees the team - we’ll call him Daniel. Daniel left before me to go for promotion. I left after.

I’ve still been speaking to Daniel, he mentioned to me to keep in touch. The industry I am in is quite small and everyone knows everyone. I also know the importance of not burning bridges. 

Dilemma: I left on good terms, thanked James for everything he taught me and arranging my leaving do. I also thanked him for the gifts.

When I initially told him I was leaving, he wasn’t happy e.g. he said I will be doing things I don’t like in the new role and not all companies pay bonuses. Whereas Daniel’s response was much more enthusiastic and encouraging, telling me to accept.

When working with James, we had a playful relationship. We would tease each other etc. Other people in the office noticed to: saying “we need to get a room”, “see you at the wedding” and “no table in between us now”. I did heart hands with a woman colleague and they asked him if he’s jealous. He’s always slightly mean to me but nice to everyone else. When I don’t tease him, he gets upset. I had to reassure him, that I do like him and enjoy working with him.

The problem is: I wanted to maintain a professional relationship with him even after leaving as paths may cross again. I messaged like I did with Daniel. James is normally very quick to respond, but he’s icing me out. He’s read my message and not responded, I thought we left on good terms.. I don’t understand why he’s being cold to me?

Like Daniel is fine with me and we had small chats/catch ups.. Not long messages but we still have professional relationship.

Can someone explain perhaps why James behaving cold to me and potentially something I may have done wrong? Just, so I don’t repeat the same mistake in my new job?",Potential-Paint-3022,1,1.0,0,1727981806,2024-10-03 18:56:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fvf9xp/recent_graduate_leaving_job_ex_direct_manager/,10,2024

1fvf0z3,Teach degrees with the best chance of getting hired ,"The end goal is cybersecurity but between my lack of actual work experience in tech and the current job market, I don’t think it’s realistic to major in and then expect to get hired anywhere. I’m willing to take the long route to get there (bachelors in something that gets my foot in the door then masters in cybersecurity). 

My considerations for majors are: software engineering (though I’m also afraid of that post-grad job search for the same reasons), IT (can be alone or with an emphasis in either software development or cybersecurity), or general studies where I mix in whatever IT/CS courses I think could land me an entry level job (literally anything to get experience) in tech while I do my masters. 

Of course I will do whatever I can to get internships, certs, and anything that could possibly help my case in the meantime. I’m just very afraid of getting to the end of all this and discovering I’m unhirable, because it seems like a very common experience.

1fve7u5,Should I leave my Internship?,"So let's start from the beginning, I am currently a junior at my local university studying in accounting. When I applied for this internship, they were looking for a marketing, finance, and accounting intern. They stated they were in the process of hiring an licensed CPA. For people who do not know, CPA is a certified public accountant and in order to become on you have to work under one for so many months and extra time in school. That was my goal and getting my bachelors degree. 
Once I started working here in August, they asked me to help in social media until they could get a licensed CPA and they said it won't be long. I agreed and thought it would be a great opportunity. However, I do absolutely freaking nothing there. I work about 15-20 hours a week. The most I post is make ideas that the marketing women hates and I make welcome binders for new clients.

1fvdxab,Looking for advice on inpatient vs. outpatient job as a psychiatric nurse practitioner,"I posted this in another subreddit, but felt it may be beneficial to seek advice from others as well.



So I am a recent graduate from a nurse practitioner program who is now board-certified in psychiatry and is just waiting on the state to finalize my CRNP license. I have been looking around extensively for available psychiatric/mental health nurse practitioner (PMHMP) jobs. I am hoping to move to Central PA to be closer to my girlfriend (ideally, as close to area around Chambersburg, PA as possible).



I have been hoping to practice in an inpatient environment and have been searching around the Central PA region for available positions. However, I have found essentially zero inpatient PMHNP positions available in this area.



During school, I absolutely loved my inpatient psych rotation. I felt like I actually had the time to work with my patients without feeling rushed. I felt like I was practicing psychiatry instead of just feeling like patients were on an assembly line. I felt like I was looking at the patient as a whole instead of just boxing the patient into checklists and throwing drugs at symptoms. I felt like I was actually doing good work for my patients.



During school, I feel as though my outpatient rotations (one in adult outpatient psych and one in child/adolescent psych via Telehealth) left *a lot* to be desired. I felt as though they were the absolute antithesis of the experiences I had in my inpatient rotation - they felt more like an assembly line than actual psychiatry (patients every 15 minutes in the one rotation and patients every 20 minutes in the other rotation), they were essentially checking boxes instead of getting any subjective perspective from the patient, every assessment was essentially the same few questions in the same scripted order, and I felt that the setup of these rotations was doing patients a serious disservice.



Having reflected on these experiences I had in school, the thought of having to ""settle"" on an outpatient PMHNP position due to no available inpatient PMHNP positions close to where I'm hoping to live (at least from what I've been able to find) is honestly extremely disheartening to me.



I am hoping I could get some advice about this situation. For somebody with these experiences and feelings (feeling as though ending up in the same type of practice environment as my outpatient clinical rotations would just leave me miserable and burned out), would it even be worth ""settling"" for a job as an outpatient provider? Are there actually outpatient psychiatric offices out there that don't feel like an assembly line and actually allow time to work with patients? And does anybody have any advice they feel would be beneficial that they could offer me?



Thank you in advance to anybody who takes the time to get back to me.",TheAnonBastard42,1,1.0,0,1727978408,2024-10-03 18:00:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fvdxab/looking_for_advice_on_inpatient_vs_outpatient_job/,10,2024
1fvdo2f,Feeling Discouraged. Where do I go from here?,"Hey Everyone,

I'm new to the community and I'm really just looking for some advice.

This going to be a bit long so apologies in advance.

So, I've been applying to jobs for a couple months now however I can't seem to land an interview at all.

I'll give a short run down on my background:

Graduated HS in 2010

Early Career:

Walmart - Retail Sales Associate 2010 to 2011
TMOne - Telemarketing Lead 2011 to 2013
RadioShack - Assistant Store Manager 2013 to 2015

Wireless Management:

Store Manager 2015 to2017
District Sales Manager 2017 to 2018

Expat and business owner:

Freelancer 2018 to present
Business Owner 2019 to present
Advisory Board Member 2021 to present

So I have roughly 12 years of sales experience.
Around 11 years of leading teams
1.5 years of multi unit management

My Business and Freelancing:

During my time running my business and freelancing I've had the privilege of working with some really incredible clients all over the world. A lot of VC backed startups, bootstrap startups, small businesses, solopreneurs, and the occasional enterprise.

My Entrepreneur Story:

In November of 2018 I left the US and came to Mexico with just a little bit of money and backpack. I started off making cold calls on behalf of clients and then grew that into a full service SDR offering. In 2019 I started to get into some AE roles and found myself making living so I launched my own brand to go along with my freelancing. By 2020 I had more work than I could handle so I started building a team. By 2021 we grew to a team of 10 and while my team members focused mostly on SDR and AE roles I shifted towards more fractional executive roles. We lived in Europe for 6 months last year before moving back to Mexico for the birth of our 3rd child.
That brings me to where I am now. However, over the past year and a half or so there has been a drop in demand for remote work and our services. There's also been an influx of people trying to get into these types roles. Also, the platforms we've used to source clients have dried up. Since then I've had to gradually downsize my team from 10 to 4.

Education:

I went back to school online shortly after I started freelancing and I'm finishing my bachelor's in December. I'm also already registered for classes in January for my MBA.

My problem:

My wife (who i met in Mexico) and I are moving back to the US soon. Her visa appointment is weeks away and our kids will be starting school. So, I've been applying for jobs like: Sales Director, AE, AM, District Manager, General Manager, Business Development Manager/Director, ect.
I also have really good references.

I've applied for hundreds (maybe over 1000?) of jobs at least over the past few months including remote roles, roles all over the US, roles in my home state. However I've only been hit with rejection email after rejection email. I've applied for jobs I'm overqualified for, jobs I feel I'm a good fit for, and even jobs I might be under qualified for. I've created different resumes that tailored to the job roles I've mentioned and nothing. I can't get an email or call or anything. The only responses I've received are from commission only scam type jobs.

1fvdftt,Forgot to take patient history as X-ray student ,"Hi everyone, I’m a student in an x-ray program and recently had a situation that’s been bothering me. It was my first time getting a patient history myself. I was told a chest x-ray was coming in for a pre-surgical check, and that I didn’t need to ask too much since the focus was on the wires in her chest. I did ask if she smoked or had asthma, but I didn’t ask about chest pain or other complaints.

After I informed my instructor of what I had asked, she reminded me to check for chest complaints, but I completely forgot. The patient was older, hard of hearing, and I was nervous. When asked later, I just said ‘no’ instead of admitting I hadn’t asked. Now I feel terrible. I’m worried something might go wrong during surgery because of my mistake, and I regret not taking the opportunity to ask the patient while she was still there.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? I’ll never let this happen again & I’m so disappointed in myself for being such a coward.

I've been in the telemarketing field for over 15 years. I own a call center back in Egypt, focused on strictly outbound lead generation for the US market but since I moved here I started learning about compliance and rules to dial and data purchasing to not get in trouble and I realized I really do not want to own a call center anymore (Even though it's very lucrative). Running the call center, finding clients, paying so much to stay compliant, and still end up being in a grey area, makes me not want to have my name on any of this. Telemarketing, lead generation, outsourcing, offshore call centers, live transfers, for different kinds of industries, this is all I know.

Otherwise, why would I have them? 

Recently a senior person who worked for me has been away on an extended vacation and some issues arose with the project she was leading. There are many people ""huffing and puffing"" about ""missed requirements"" and ""decisions that don't make sense"" and I asked these people to please wait for this person to come back from vacation before making costly decisions. 

What they said to me was why I, as her director, would not know all the details in the same way this person does? 

Because....that's not what I'm hired to do? If you wanted me to manage the day to day details, then you should have hired me to do that. But I have 10 people managing day to day details, do I have to be in every meeting with them, manage every call they make? What?

Just wanted to know your thoughts, am I being underpaid or is 40k already a good deal? If ever, what is the current market rate for Account Managers with experience in Digital Advertising Industry? I've also asked for a salary review but I don't know what to expect. I already waited for a month and almost 2 weeks but I haven't heard about the increase, if there will be any.

I'm not sure what to do, I love my job but I feel cheated since l also feel like my other colleagues got a better salary package than me. Shoul I start looking for other opportunities?

Thank you!

26 male just move in with the one and I want to start saving up for a house

I've been with my first firm straight out of college for 3 and half years

I do full desk It staffing we are specialize in .net stack so I can only work roles I find that purely .net Developer or SQL and I have to pass for no kickback to other teams if I find a Java, QA, etc roles

Last year I was paid 92k w2 for 500k billed w2... This billing is total fees we don't cut out what my firm takes home

My firm is a larger firm we are national we over 10 offices and my office is 30 ish deep

I am currently at $382k in billed across Perm fees, Contracting and consulting fees

I picked up 28 new jobs this year and have done 10 placements

I am on a 70k draw which is divided across 13 pay period about 4 weeks to collect I get 13% of a fee and I get 3% if a teammate does a deal.

My team has billed 913,176 so far this year,

Gross paid I've been paid currently 70k I've just collected my first commission check for 6k and another one 6k for our two paid periods which got paid out at the same time this previous month

I like the people I work with. We do turn and burn through entry-level people which can get a bit annoying as we literally have people crying on the desk.

A couple of questions

1. am I compensated currently
2. Is it time to move to another firm which I can come off draw
3. I do get feed some passover jobs is that worth giving up
4. is it better to go somewhere where I can hunt all technologies and not

1fv9v3f,"Frustrated with career growth and missed another promotion window, what to do now?","Today we had another promotion window closed. Due to feedback on the employee involvement survey the company added another promotional review cycle 2x/year vs 1x/year. This morning we had more promotions announced during the team meeting one person on my team was promoted and one person from the other team. Over the three years I’ve been here now my team has received 7 promotions there are 16 of in total divided into two teams. 6 of those promotions have gone to 3 people, each of them promoted twice in 3 years.

So now I’m annoyed not because my coworkers are getting promoted over me because they are hard working, smart and impactful. But really the lack of clarity and the continued ambiguity on what is required to be promoted.

For example I’ve asked my manager every month for the last year at our 1 on 1s am I on progress for a promotion, is my work impactful, what are the areas I should improve in or focus on. This is advice I received from my corporate mentor who is a director/hiring manager.

Each time my manager says I’m doing fine, that my work is impactful and continue to work on my goals. When I asked her directly what do I need to do to receive a promotion she responds stating “ Just be impactful, promotions are based on who’s most impactful, you just have to do things before I think of them or without me asking, you should ask your coworkers what they’re doing to get promoted.” A really irritating answer and only one person on my direct team has been promoted in the last 3 years like wtf. Since a most of us have only been on the team 3 years, that one person is the only one that’s been promoted on the team

So I understand that she can just give me a checklist of things to do the vague answer is bullshit. I spoke with my mentor about it and he said he didn’t like her response and that she needs to at least point you in the right direction. At the same time he admitted he was having trouble telling his employees what to do to get promoted himself and he was having difficulty getting an answer from his manager on how to get promoted lol.

1fv88fv,Ride it out or jump ship,"Currently a junior project manager for a construction company in Texas with 1.5 years of experience. The project I'm on is winding down and in our area, there aren't many other projects to be assigned to after. The common practice in our industry at times like this it is a possibility that they re-assign employees to other cities in the state. Moving isn't an option as my fiancé is in grad school and we are getting married later this year.  

Here's the catch. I'm leaving to join the military early next year. This is the primary career that I am pursuing. 

Due to the possibility of re-assignment, I have started looking for other jobs. I've had some interviews, but I am conflicted about the idea of just working for a company for less than a year then leaving for good. The current position I have been interviewing for is high visibility and comes with a lot of responsibility. 

Question is: Should I just go for it and jump ship before I potentially get re-assigned to a new job that comes with extra responsibility just leave after less than a year? Or should I ride it out at my current job with the risk of having to move away from my new family. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks

I am currently in my senior year of college pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and Criminology. Up to this point, I have been focused on forensic psych, but I am more aware of how bad the job market is for them. Going into college, I really decided on psych and crim because I found them both very interesting but I failed to think about many more career options. After taking biological psychology and cognitive psychology I have been very interested in brain + behavior and more of the scientific side of psychology. I definitely do not want to pursue counseling and I also don't think i am very interested in clinical psych. I am willing to pursue more education after I graduate undergrad but I do not think I am cut out for any PhD programs. I have been looking into radiology tech programs in hopes I can become certified in that and then pursue a certificate in MRI technology, which would deal more with the brain aspect I am interested in.  I just hate to go back for my Associate's degree after I will have my Bachelor's.

1fv7hbh,"Everyone wants me to go to art school but I want to pursue IT
","Hello, I'm an architecture junior that's been trying to shift to Multimedia Arts (BA-MMA) for the past year in a third world country (necessary to note since the art industry's quite small here). I've finally secured my guardian's letter of consent needed for the process but I've changed my mind and I'm now applying to Information Systems (BS-IS) under the IT cluster for more stability. Only thing is, majority of the people I know seem to be against it and I'm frustrated by my lack of confidence/inability to stand up for my decisions.

For context, I chose architecture to assist the family business and realized too late that I didn't see myself at all in the industry. Combine that with a plethora of family issues and financial struggles that all involve architecture, I decided prioritizing a more lucrative degree and sticking to it no matter what would be better than staying in place. I'm aware no degree is easy but at the very least, I'd like to have the knowledge that the difficulty will benefit me financially later in life.

Originally, my dream job was to be a video game concept artist. In fact, just recently, I got scouted and hired for that exact position due to my on-going illustration commissions. It made me wonder what the point of going to art school was if I had already proven that I'm capable of attaining connections and upgrading my skills on my own and through online courses (at a much cheaper price too). I'm not confident about many things but one thing I can say for sure is that I've got an unyielding work ethic and that I can use it to get me places if all goes well. In the long-term, I intend to continue working freelance art jobs and self-studying art, graduate BS-IS, and and have web/app development or UI/UX design (or any low level IT job really) be my day job while developing my concept art career until it's substantial enough.

My parents, friends, and even my assigned guidance counsellor expressed all levels of disappointment in my decision. My family keeps asking if I'm truly sure and that my artistic talents will go to waste in I.T., despite initially stopping me from pursuing MMA. My guidance counsellor keeps hinting that I should go for MMA or animation and kept poking and prodding with many ""Are you sure?""'s.

The final interviews for the shifting process are set to assess my determination to shift, existing expertise in programming (of which I have none) and my confidence in tech-related skills (also almost none). With many influential figures doubting me, I'm extremely worried about my performance - I'm scared I won't seem confident enough - and whether or not I'll pass the shifting process.

And of course there's that tiny voice that's worried about whether or not this degree's the right choice, but I've got this bone-deep exhaustion from college and parental pressure to support the family that I barely have the energy to care anymore and just want to graduate, regardless of the degree. 

I'd love to ignore what everyone says in theory but a good number of these influences are older adults that have control over my actions (i.e. counsellor and guardians). It seems that I'm quite weak in front of authority figures.

If anyone has any advice on how to tune them out and build confidence, has advice on how to choose a degree, or wants to point out any faults in my thinking/behavior, I'd love to hear. I appreciate the platform to voice my thoughts regardless and the time you've taken to read this.",swinteroo,1,1.0,0,1727961335,2024-10-03 13:15:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fv7hbh/everyone_wants_me_to_go_to_art_school_but_i_want/,10,2024

1fv6b67,Talk to Manager or HR,"I am a mechanical engineer, with 7 years of experience, at a pretty large company. Just this fall I started taking advantage of the tuition reimbursement my company has to offer to pursue an MBA and an MSBA (Master of Science in Business Analytics) as I want to pivot out of engineering and into an analyst role, and eventually a management role. 

Like anyone who is thinking of transitioning roles eventually, I browse through our internal job postings from time to time. When browsing yesterday, I noticed a job posting for an entry level technical analyst role. Although my company is pretty big, this is the first time I've actually seen such an ideal role posted for me to make the transition.

The job posting itself lists that any engineering major would be considered, with 0 to 2 years of experience (and the salary range listed is similar to what I make now, although I am on the higher end of the range). My issue is, I am just starting to learn a lot of the required skills for this role (but I am a fast learner, as cliché as that sounds) but I'm afraid if I don't jump on this to some extent, the opportunity may not arise when I am ready to make the move. I love the company I work for and would like to stay here with a new role.

From what I can tell, the ""hiring manager"" listed on the posting looks like an HR hiring manager, rather than the manager the hire would report to. Would it be inappropriate for me to reach out to them to see if my current qualifications would make me a decent candidate prior to talking to my manger? My manager has been very supportive of me returning to school and he knows my end goal is to leave the team, but I'm hesitant to discuss this opportunity with him, if it would lead to nothing. I don't want him to think I just want off of the team, especially as he has been such a great manager.

Can anyone offer me advice on how to proceed with this? I don't really have anyone with professional experience in my life to discuss this with. ",ashmasta27,2,1.0,2,1727957862,2024-10-03 12:17:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fv6b67/talk_to_manager_or_hr/,10,2024

I got a offer after a final interview last week and I took it as a backup and ""placeholder"" if I didn't secure the other final rounds of interviews for jobs that pay much higher with better and higher job titles. But the kicker was that I applied and interviewered for a IT Support tier 2 position with a salary range from $70,000-$88,000 but in the offer letter, they reduced the role to IT Support tier 1 at a set $30 an hour and said that I will be the sole IT employee at two small offices of just under 100 employees and only given one week of training from the current IT manager (who I will be replacing for his duties) who is leaving the company this Friday, which they never told me during the interview or application description!

However, I'm a bit concerned about what happens if I receive another offer from a different company in lets say December 2024 and decide to accept it instead. (I am in the process for Goldman Sachs) 

1. **Document Details**: It is basically an Non Compete Agreement And IP Confidentiality 
2. **Potential Issues**: If I do accept another offer later, could it create any legal issues?
3. **Advice Needed:** The internship will be in the summer of 2025 (around April/May), and I will know by December 2024 if I have received another offer from any other company. I have signed the offer letter, but I haven't signed the Non-Compete Agreement yet. I just want to ensure that in case I get a better offer, I can accept it without facing any issues from the company with which I am signing the Non-Compete Agreement and IP Confidentiality Agreement. I don't want to delay signing the Non-Compete Agreement because I am worried they might rescind the offer, leaving me without any internship on hand afterward.

It is in India if it matters but the company is based in USA

I left that internship because of this job due to higher package and the HR told me that they have various fields in the company so they will put me in web dev and I accepted the offer but later they put me in this NOC position and told me after 6 7 months I will get the domain of Devops, Cybersecurity, Cloud, Network, Database, and Backup. I don't trust them because there are many other people waiting for domain who are hired with me so it's gonna be in the randomised order.

Now my major concern is what to do here should I start studying for Devops and build projects in that to get a internship or entry level job which is quite difficult because no one hires a freshers devops engineer unless you are lucky.

i used to be really hopeful for this, but sometimes i feel like it's unrealistic and i should be doing something bigger and better. i always liked business/admin/management type roles. i'd love to work in a 9-5 office job. i did consider, after moving out, to maybe switch work in a call centre or something, and work my way up in a company.

It pays $26/hr, but the work life balance is the reason I became a SAHM and earned a bachelors degree in Business Administration/ Management. 

I know I don’t want to be in casino life forever. Just trying to fatten my savings while I figure myself out. I thought I’d have all this free time to deep dive into what the perfect job would be; but life has kept me busy. 

After getting all the kids in school at the 10 year mark. I became the hospice caregiver to 3 parents. 

So now, it’s time to work again and I’m lost. 

I love people, I love being alone, I have stashes and stashes of cards and send them regularly- it’s a fun passion. 

I love reading and learning about finance. I wish more children and young adults were more financially sound when they hit adulthood. 

After caring for my parents I feel like I have had a crash course for wills, trust, care plans and funeral planning. And how important it is to keep everything updated. 

My friend keeps having me send in applications for contract writing because it will pay big in a short time. But since I’m not moving for a job, it’ll be incredibly hard to get my foot in the door. 

I need to find the right fit for me. Banking seems logical- except here they don’t pay well that I know of. I have a friend who has put 6 years in with a masters degree and she isn’t even to $20/hr. 

Any suggestions for someone who wants great work life balance? A career I can move up in and actually make enough money to pay for my kids college soon. lol 

I feel like I need to play catch up on all the missed paychecks from staying home; so that maybe we can actualize some of our dreams. 

Hope that’s not too hard. ",Terrible_Purple7947,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1727936250,2024-10-03 06:17:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fv1bf1/been_a_sahm_for_13_years_gads_now_what/,10,2024

1fuzpg4,Am I getting scammed? LinkedIn side ventures (e-commerce),"I randomly connected with a guy on LinkedIn and one day he messaged me about my career and how it was going. I was honest and told him the industry I worked in (sports) was something I no longer desire to be in because of the pay and long hours, working nights and weekends. He gained my trust since he was also in that industry and had the same major (sport management) and I wanted to pick his brain so he offered to talk to me. Saw that he transitioned to a different career (Finance) and wanted to know how I could do the same, but when chatting with him he was more focused on side ventures (e-commerce). We agreed to chat again and he gave me his approach that he used to be successful. It was very broad and not detailed.

During this time I have no idea what business he runs, and he is reluctant to bring on just anyone as they must share common goals. He mentioned how during our talks he is evaluating me to see if I would be a good candidate since he does not want to share his knowledge to just anyone and he and his wife pick a few people each year that seem to be the “right fit”. I agreed to talk to him again next week since it’s not costing me anything except an hour of my time, but I am sort of worried. His big selling point is how he ended up being debt free by his early 30s and looking to quit his job in the next few years, all before turning 40. He also gave me an article and podcast to listen before we chat again. 

After a few conversations he mentioned how he is halfway through his evaluation process of me. He has told me about this 6 step approach he uses and was taught by others:
1)You and your person economy
2)Independent franchise 
3)Educational Company 
4)Traditional investments
5)Cash for projects 
6)Charity 

He talked about using these 6 steps to grow his side hustle. We talked about cashflow quadrants and how to make a self-employed individual to becoming a business owner in the e-commerce space. He mentioned two companys, his network marketing vendor (Amway) and educational company (Legacy leadership collective). He wants to talk again next week and gave me more resources to study until next time. Also his mentor is having a seminar tomorrow and after getting his approval last minute I was invited to attend. 

I am very wary of all this and do not feel comfortable continuing but it is not costing me anything at the moment. This all seems like a pyramid scheme to me but am not quite sure. All I was looking for is guidance with my career and how I can improve my standard of living or possibly switch careers since the sports industry has been rough with the salary and hours. If anyone has any similar experience or feedback it would be very much appreciated!

Hi everyone, I’m a senior at Rutgers Business School - Newark, studying supply chain management with a GPA of barely 3.1-3.2. I have no internships or CO-OP experience since it’s so hard to find one; it feels impossible. I was at a career fair where there were kids that were 5 to 6 years younger than me with way more experience, higher GPAs, and just overall better qualifications. It just made me feel so pathetic. Also, this semester I’m taking 13 credits, and I’m so worried that I’m going to mess up my GPA. My financial aid ran out, so for my last credits, I don’t even know how I’m going to pay for that in the spring. I’m going to be 27 years old next year when I finally finish this degree; I would’ve graduated three years ago. Had I known about the other campus in the business school at Rutgers University—Rutgers Business School Newark and New Brunswick—I would have gone there instead. New Brunswick is where I got in 4 1/2 years ago originally, but they didn’t take all my credits from community college. They were going to make me repeat calculus and managerial accounting, so I went to another New Jersey state school that I hated and dropped out because of COVID and my ADHD. Then I found out a year and a half ago that had New Brunswick told me to reach out to Newark, I would’ve had my calculus and managerial accounting transferred the whole time. Where I am right now at 26, I could’ve been here at 23. I feel so hopeless and like it’s not worth pursuing college since I’m already so old, so late, and so behind. Currently, I have 107 credits, or technically 103 credits. I’m 26 years old. I should already be making six figures a year in the workforce for four years. I should already be married having sex every day buying my first house making a baby and doing everything that successful people my age do, but I’m not and I feel suicidal every day And finally, this is not young and it’s not successful the 20s time. and it does matter where you get your degree from a top school with the name will get you a higher salary.",AppropriateKey3071,0,0.5,55,1727927518,2024-10-03 03:51:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fuz37q/should_i_just_drop_out_a_college_at_26_years_old/,10,2024

1fuymru,Leaving Current Job WHILE Interviewing for New Job / Advice Needed,"I am in a bit of a predicament, and in desperate need of some advice/guidance. In my current role, which is at a company going through a major transition period due to a M&A, I have basically been tasked with running a department that in normal circumstances would be a team of seven, with 3 people. But, one of my colleagues just started this role 3 months ago (I have been in this role for one year, normally this position would be help by someone with 10-15 years experience), and my manager, who was the one that claimed only 3 people were need for this team, is not only not providing ANY help after assigning this monumental task, but has also become emotionally and verbally abusive, telling me that I am the reason the company is failing, that I am the reason he is depressed, that I am the reason his wife is upset with him, and also speaking very poorly about me to other colleagues. Please keep in mind, this man is in his sixties, and I am in my late twenties, and these are only a handful of the things he has said to me and to others about me. I have asked for resources/help/you name it over email, phone, and zoom meetings to no avail.

I need to resign, as this is obviously detrimental to my mental health as well as my physical health and relationships. My partner is basically having to will me to get through the days, and I cannot stand this much longer. I would like to give my two weeks, meaning my last day would be October 18th.

The kicker is that I am interviewing for a new position, that I would very much like to get. I got a second interview with the new company's leadership team next week, and I feel very confident that I could possibly get this role. This is why I am hesitant to quit, as I'm afraid if I do land this role, the new company will call my old company to confirm employment, and my previous company will tell them I am no longer employed, and the new company will wonder why I did not disclose this. I am hesitant for this scenario, as I am afraid the new company will believe I got ahead of myself and quit my old job thinking I was a for sure with the new job, which I believe would greatly, if not completely diminish my chances of this new role.

Has anyone been in a position like this? If so, what did you do? Do I just wait it out, take the abuse for another week and really try and nail this second interview, and hope the new company confirms employment in the two weeks before I leave? Or do I resign, and own up to it, letting the new company know that I left my old company as I did not feel the environment was one in which I could successfully complete my day-to-day? I am torn, and I am really finding it hard to find a reason to keep going at all with the state of my current job, so I'm not sure what to do, and any advice is so appreciated.

TL;DR: My current boss is abusive, and I want to resign, but I am currently interviewing for a new role, and do not want the new company to think I quit my old job believing I already landed the new role when they call to confirm employment.",hammerag,1,1.0,0,1727925926,2024-10-03 03:25:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fuymru/leaving_current_job_while_interviewing_for_new/,10,2024

1fuych4,"2nd gen business owner, saturated","So I am M29 & have been working / running my father’s company for almost 8 years now. My father just looks into the company affairs when I ask him for any help. The money is good. It’s a small company with 20 employees & I am the top boss. I’d say I have learned well how to handle the company & my dad has earned a good name in the industry, country wide. I benefit a lot from this good name. The first 5 years, I learned a good deal. Managin a small company, people, inventory, accounts, clients, etc. I’ve also developed decent sales skills. 

Now the problem, I’ve not been able to grow the company since the business is B2B & new products are not easy to think of. Meaning, I don’t know what new products to develop so that my company can sell that & grow the revenue. With a steady 5-10% growth in YoY in the last 8 years, I’ve been happy but now it has come to a point where I’m saturated. For the growth needed, I have to put in a lot of efforts but I’m not that driven. I like my weekends. I look at my friends who have jobs & I wonder if a job is better suited for me. I know that the pay will not be as much (probably). I have only an engineering undergrad degree from a good college in Pune. And I also know that I’ll have a boss to report to unlike right now but I still feel that at a job, I’ll always have work which will keep me busy. I feel that at a job, there will be new things to learn & when I get saturated at a job, I can switch. More than the money, I want guidance / work. The work I’m doing right now is frankly, not exciting at all. I have no colleagues / peers. I don’t know what to do. For reference, my monthly income ranges from 2L to 5L sometimes even 6. Average annual could be approx 35 to 40L. 

Do you guys think that with my current experience (only of running a small company for 8 years) can get me a decent job? Thanks.

1fuxmmc,Where Do I Go From Here?,"
To put it bluntly, I’m not in the position I envisioned I would be in my career. I was laid off back in May from a position I had been in for 6 years. 

My previous job was good but kind of a dead end. I either needed to boost my qualifications or get very lucky and find a new role that was both a raise and promotion. So I started job hunting and didn’t find many good opportunities. At that time I decided to begin an MBA program to give me an edge to help move me up to the next level in my career and my employer would pay for it. Worst case scenario at my current company it would give me an automatic raise of about $10k per year at a minimum and would qualify me for higher level roles.


But lo and behold right when I start my MBA I got laid off. Fortunately I was able to find a job but it’s completely unrelated to what I was doing before in a totally unrelated industry and is much more entry level. So now I’m working an entry level job and I’m working harder for longer hours and significantly less pay. Once again I find myself starting all over again in a career that I never saw myself in. The job market is shit right now. I’m thankful to have something but it really sucks ngl. 

So what do I do? Do I keep trying to go back to what I was doing before? At this point it’s been about 6 months since I was in my previous role but now I find myself in another dead end with no way to move up in sight. I have two kids with a third on the way so I can’t just job hop and hope for the best I need to get back to the level I was at before and quickly. 

Any advice is appreciated. ",throwaway_1118120,1,1.0,0,1727922578,2024-10-03 02:29:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fuxmmc/where_do_i_go_from_here/,10,2024
1fuxkuh,"Got offer then, contract last minute and a bit disappointed.","Hey guys, I work in demand field in construction- long story short, I applied for a job that seemed to have flexibility and valued family time and seemed like a good employer.

I had an interview to get a scope of the people and they seemed nice and told them my salary expectations.
They offered me a casual position at the start which would eventuate in to a full time role if all goes well which was all good and well. 
I’m old enough and experienced enough to know my value and when to say yay or nay. 

I got the contract (3 days before starting as they forgot to send it) and was a little disappointed by it. 
It was the hourly rate that I said however in a casual rate so no holiday pay, no  sick pay, 25% loading etc.
There was also stipulations where I might have to travel up to 270km a week without compensation,
42.5hrs per week (4.5 hrs additional hours) not paid in overtime as standard.
Expectations to work overtime to get the job done etc 
Overtime 1.5x of a much lower rate so only $3 more per hour.
Anyway all these things just rubbed me up the wrong way from the start.

I then spoke to them and declined the offer highlighting why and the conversation wasn’t bad but just one of those conversations that was a lot longer than what i wanted (over 40mins).
They wanted feedback and reasoning, so I gave it but made me feel like I wasn’t making a good decision.
I asked me my price but just feel it is past that so didn’t and respectfully declined. 
I get it, it’s hard for an employer also, there’s a lot of risk at stake as-well with hiring but if you like a candidate and see value in them (which they said they did) then just give them what they are asking (not unreasonable at all) And see how it goes? 
I don’t know I just know a good start is pretty crucial that’s all? 
Thoughts?

1fuwcnc,Starving artist or Rich Corporate Dead Soul,"Hey everyone,

I’m in need of some serious career advice. I’m currently an intern at one of the biggest companies in the world, working in a entry level corporate finance role. Right now, I’m earning $2,100 a month (about $2,000 less than what I'd make in the full-time role), but I’ve already been confirmed for a permanent position after six months. I’m two months in, and honestly, the job is a soul killer. It drains me and just about everyone else at the company. There is no life in those eyes lol. 

The ladder is amazing though. People move up quickly and seamlessly, and the benefits were ranked #1 in the U.S. recently.


I’m 21, single, no kids, and my only expense is a phone bill, so I’m in a good spot financially. My original plan was to save up and move to a walkable city on the East Coast or Midwest to focus on my dream of publishing a book. I had been writing all year until I started this job two months ago, but now, I barely have time or energy to write—weekends are my only free time, and I’m usually too exhausted to get anything done.

Writing is my passion, and if ever there was a time to chase that dream, it’s now. But... there’s a big but... THE LADDER.

I’ve met so many people at this company who’ve been promoted 2-4 times in less than five years. I talked with my mentor (another perk of the job) about moving up, and he walked me through the company’s growth structure. He even showed me a detailed pathway map on our internal website that outlines how long you need to be in certain roles in order to get to another role, the salary at each level, and more. The spark was back.

In six months, I’ll get converted to full-time, and after another six months, I can be sponsored to become a financial advisor—the most lucrative path here when moving from entry. The base salary is $63k plus bonuses, and it only goes up from there. The benefits include 4 months of paid maternity/paternity leave, vision, dental, and medical, tuition reimbursement —all the good stuff. It just seems too good of an opportunity to walk away from.

But here's the dilemma: I feel like I’m at a crossroads. Do I follow the money and security, or do I take a leap and pursue my writing dream? I’ve planned this move for nearly a year, and this job offer just appeared out of nowhere. Who's to say moving cities and following my dream isn't an opportunity of a lifetime? What if I get stuck and never get to publish my book? I'm terrified. Scary scary thoughts. 

I have until January 21st to make a decision, but I’m torn. Should I be the starving artist or the corporate dead soul? I’d love to hear your thoughts.",jayjnotjj,0,0.5,7,1727918547,2024-10-03 01:22:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fuwcnc/starving_artist_or_rich_corporate_dead_soul/,10,2024

1fuv2u7,Would I be helping my manager by applying to other roles after being warned about performance?,"Long story short, (and I wrote a previous post about this) I have never in my 8 year career received formal coaching or formal negative feedback regarding my job performance. Even as recently as August, my manager told me I was meeting expectations and had no negative feedback for me at our mid-year review. 

That all changed about a month and a half ago when it was announced she was getting a new boss. Like a light switch went off, she started hounding me for every little thing I was doing “wrong”, like taking 6 minutes to reply to her chat on Teams or telling her boss to “have a great week” instead of “have a great day”. She went from being a little bit overbearing to a nightmare micromanager seemingly overnight. If I put my tinfoil hat on, I truly believe she realized she’s been slacking as a manager and wants to cover her ass in case the hammer comes down on her, because her new boss is notorious for firing people and making everyone’s life a living hell. 

Sensing this shift, I started looking for other roles and applied to a few internal roles last week. I ran this by my manager beforehand and she had no objections to me applying. However, this week I was hit with a warning about my job performance, which was written on an HR template. From my understanding it’s not a written warning or official PIP, but it is the first step of letting me know I’m not meeting expectations. 

Staying in my current role is not an option and I’m trying to do everything I can to get the hell out. But, it’s pretty customary for the hiring manager to have a conversation with your current boss before you’re offered a role. If she’s unhappy with me, I assume she would want me to leave and wouldn’t totally bash me in that conversation, but I also assume she wouldn’t lie when the hiring manager asks about my performance. 

I’m hoping some people leaders can give me insight on what to expect. Like I said, I have never even been close to this having this happen to me so I don’t know if I’m worrying about it too much or if my career at this company is over and I need to switch industries (or something in between those two reactions).",camelz4,1,1.0,4,1727914628,2024-10-03 00:17:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fuv2u7/would_i_be_helping_my_manager_by_applying_to/,10,2024

1fuuchy,"I may of made a bad career decision, what should I do?","Hi reddit, here is a short recap of what has happened the last few months in my career.

I graduated University and was lucky enough to land a full-time financial analyst job directly after school. I started as an intern and got an offer to stay. I had an amazing manager as an intern and he taught me so much, it was great. I stayed and worked under him for a year, after which I was asked to apply internally for an intermediate financial analyst role. They really loved my work as I worked a lot with this team. I decided to apply, and once I got the contract... I realized it was not an official promotion.

It was the same title as I previously had and only a 10k pay raise (with a heavier workload). I brought this up, and they essentially told me that I got a ""lowkey"" promotion, without the title because there were more senior analysts who did not get this (2-3+more years than me). I got very frustrated, but did not cause a scene. I felt disrespected and undermined because the only way they got me to apply was through the promotion of title. I accepted the contract and proceeded to find a new job due to feeling so manipulated and because it was such an unprofessional move on their part (they admitted this later when I quit). The new job was a raise from 70k --> 85k and 7% bonus --> 10% bonus.

Sadly, its been 3 weeks doing the new job and I hate it... its a larger company so I thought the workload would be manageable... but I was wrong. It is very heavy (like 55 hrs a week) and I was doing 40 tops at my previous job. Both jobs are hybrid, but the commute is around an hour at longer total at this new place. The manager is really intense (although kind enough) and the training as been shite, often being forgotten... I left on pretty good terms with the company but I know the manager who duped me into joining his team will not take me back.

What should I do? I feel like I should start looking for new work because this new place feels so much like a sweatshop... everyone does crazy hours and everyone is junior due to high turnover.",SlipperySlope-,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1727912473,2024-10-02 23:41:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fuuchy/i_may_of_made_a_bad_career_decision_what_should_i/,10,2024

I’ve been applying to places that require 2 yrs of customer service and a high school diploma. I went to university (and even plan on going back for a master’s degree.) Of course all of the skill requirements were met, certifications, etc. I even have volunteer experience… and every one of my past and current co-workers and managers can attest to the fact that I am an hard worker.
Why can’t I get past the application process with what seems to be a great resume?

1futsp8,I'm Confused,"Okay so A very big greetings to anyone reading this, I'm an 18 y/o guy from delhi currently preparing for iit. I'm sure i wanna go to iit and do my bachelors from iit, No doubts in that. But I've always hated a desk job. I hate sitting for a whole day and getting paid a little to none amount of money at the end of the month. I HATE IT. I also hated sitting in the school and studying on the same desk every day. I was the shy kid who talks to no one. At first, I wanted to join the Indian Army (Para sf specifically). But I remember in 8th standard (just before covid) during the annual function in which we were doing a play about bhagat singh, I decided to try acting for the first time. I got a really small role of a british officer and while practicing, my teachers used to say that I act really well and I might have a chance in bollywood also cuz I kinda look decent. Since then, I've always considered acting as a career option cuz it gave me the fame and attention I wanted. Although that was the only time till now when I did acting. That role was not that big too. If I had to say, It would've been not more than 3 min long role. But I liked the appreciation from my teachers and the attention I was getting cuz of my teacher's compliments. And also the fact that I hate a desk job, I kinda fell in love with acting as my profession. For the past 5 years, I've dreamt to be a big superstar of bollywood of one day like Amitabh Bachchan sir and SRK. I even chose a stage name for my future performances. But recently, I casually tried to perform in front of my parents and they said YOU CAN'T ACT. Then they recorded it and showed to me. I'll be honest, I've never cringed that hard in my entire life. That made me lose even more confidence in acting. So I thought that I've had a good interest in going abroad (specifically germany), and settling there with my girlfriend cuz sorry to say, I personally find India to be not that safe for women. What I thought is that I will go do my masters in germany and then get a job there, for almost 8-9 years I'll do a job and get a citizenship then leave the job and start a business. But the dreams of acting and becoming the next superstar isn't going away from my head. I'm confused. I like money and I want safety. But I also dont want to be just a guy sitting in his office all day. Idk what to choose and I dont have 2 lives. Acting in India, for initial many years I know I will earn very less money and since I've only acted once in my entire life, I'll need time to polish on my acting skills too. Forget polish, I first need to get some acting skills. I'll be honest, I have 0 acting experience and I'm sure I will need alot of time to learn cuz I'm introverted. Acting requires much more physical activity than a desk job, shooting at a location, going here and there and getting into different characters. It's wayyyyyyy different than a normal desk job, which I like about acting other than the fame and money part. Is it worth spending this much time in acting? Is it worth leaving the life of germany? I'm big time confused. If you can, then please suggest what should I do.🙏🏻🙏🏻",NamelessMonster101,1,1.0,0,1727910869,2024-10-02 23:14:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1futsp8/im_confused/,10,2024
1futgbd,Need financial stability but have BA in acting…,"I have been having a real crisis as I just graduated college in May and I have no clue where to go from here. I‘ve been working for years as a DSP for adults with developmental disabilities, but I‘m only making about $28k from that and get paid a wage when I would really love a salary. I know that that’s normal for 21 year olds, but what freaks me out is that I don’t have a plan. I also have an acting agent, but I don’t really get any work because I am not willing to work for free, which includes putting hours and hours every weeks into auditions that I will never hear back from. That’s not to say I never audition- I do, but I am just very selective because I am busy with my job and other things. 

  
The issue is my degree is in acting, so I am unqualified for most high paying jobs. I can’t afford to go back to school- I only went the first time because I had a full ride. I originally went to school for forensic psychology but burned out halfway through due to ADHD and mental illness, so the only way I figured I could finish out a degree is if I switched to something creative, and I had a lovely time studying acting, but now I’m in the real world. 

I am passionate about offering services to people with developmental disabilities, and am considering starting a sort of consulting business, but I am nervous that it will still pay horribly or that I won’t be good at it. I honestly would love a job where I don’t have to be directly responsible for anyone’s personal wellbeing. I’ve considered plumbing, but didn’t hear back from any apprenticeships as most require experience or trade school, so I sort of gave up on that idea. I have considered saying f it and pursuing the arts full time, but that makes no sense if I am looking for a good income. I’m going to continue to pursue my art, but I need financial stability. I have always had a lot of anxiety around money and not having enough of it, and I feel like I have set myself up very poorly. 

I have kind of oddball interests, but if it‘s helpful to anyone, my passions are 

-disability advocacy

-writing and performing music, plays, comedy sketches, and films

-entomology/nature in general

-home improvement and organization

Ideally, I would be making a comfortable living doing something related to one of these things, but with a degree in acting I am underqualified for basically everything. That said, I am super organized, driven, creative, and determined. I think I would do well at a lot of different things if given the opportunity. And despite these being my passions, I am very open to other things if they can make me more money and not eat up 100% of my time. Bonus if they utilize any of my skills (creativity, organization etc.)

I know that most people my age are not even thinking about this sort of thing, but I am just so tired of being broke and poor and not being able to do afford anything. All I want is to be able to buy a small house before I’m 26, but it feels like an impossibility. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for where to go from here?",Kooky-Candidate8272,1,1.0,2,1727909880,2024-10-02 22:58:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1futgbd/need_financial_stability_but_have_ba_in_acting/,10,2024
1futdd3,What am I supposed to be when I grow up??,"crossposted from r/careerguidance as I thought it’d fit well here too

After scrolling through this sub a bit, this feels like such an unserious question but honestly it seems like the best place for it. redirect me if i’m wrong

I’m a junior at a somewhat nice public high school (Niche ranks it from #4-#8th best in the country but idk how reliable they are). Everyone seems to know at least what college they want to go to, adults ask us all the time what we want to be and everyone has an answer like doctor, lawyer, biochemist, etc. But I have no idea what I am going to do.

It’s not I don’t have things I’m passionate about. I love writing and have written multiple books, only one of which is quality (my beta readers and I are still working on making the others suck less, all books are like that in their early drafts 😂), I think I’m good at photography and though most of what I’ve done so far is just landscape and astrophotography I’m open to trying other types, and I’ve been doing art since I was probably 3. I swear I have hobbies, it’s just none of these make money. I’m pretty low maintenance, I don‘t really shop unless necessary and the only expensive thing I enjoy is travel.

My best bet I think is working at the airport, my mom’s a training supervisor so I kinda know what it’s like. Being a pilot sounds nice but I’m not very smart/attentive and I just would not trust myself with that job lol.

But does anyone have other ideas? More fulfilling ones? Idk

College advice would be good too though it’s fine if not since this sub’s focus is careers after that",toospecificforgoogle,1,1.0,1,1727909631,2024-10-02 22:53:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1futdd3/what_am_i_supposed_to_be_when_i_grow_up/,10,2024

1fut5ft,New graduate unsure whether to accept high paying job offer,"Hey everyone. I graduated last June and have since been applying to jobs.

I’ve had a handful of interviews for BDR positions but no offers until now. The company is relatively big and the base salary is $50-55k CAD with OTE being 70-100k.

My main concern is reading through glassdoor. There are dozens of reviews saying how horrible the culture is, how toxic some people are, insane micromanagement, harassment, constant sexual innuendos etc. basically an old boys club. They say you’re expected to work 10+ hours a day including weekends. The list goes on and on.

It’s interesting because I never would’ve guessed that they’re so awful. They’re one of the bigger companies I’ve interviewed for.

I’m unsure as to whether to take the offer or not. I’ve expressed some hesitancy to my recruiter who set this all up and he’s scheduled a call with the person who’d be my direct manager. I plan to ask questions like what percent of people actually hit OTE etc. If there are any other questions I should ask please tell me!!!

I feel like many would be quick to say turn it down. It’s just that it’s been months with 0 offers so far so who knows when I could get one next and if it would be any better. Also, I don’t NEED the money but obviously it’s nice to be having money coming in rather than 0.

I think many of you may also suggest taking it and still look for other jobs, which is definitely something I’m considering. I just don’t know if I could handle working 10-12 hours a day in a horribly toxic environment for very long. It would take me a bit under an hour commute each way as well.

Sorry if this is just word vomit, I had the interview earlier today and even if I moved on I was expecting 1-2 more rounds so I’m quite surprised.

1fusjd1,Did I screw up leaving what I thought was my dream job?,"
Hi all, 

Thanks in advance to anyone taking the time to read this post. 

I (30 F) am struggling with a recent decision I made to leave what I considered my “dream job” a few months ago without another opportunity lined up. For context, I spent the last decade building a career in the entertainment industry that started with an entry-level role as an executive assistant then working my way up to a mid-level associate. I always knew I wanted to work in entertainment and networked relentlessly my first two years at a top tier talent agency and eventually, got my foot in through the door with a job offer at my dream TV/Film studio. 

I was fully aware of how demanding the role would be, but I knew it would worth it. The job allowed me to collaborate with some of the best in the business and work on A-level projects. It was a dream come true despite some late nights and stress I felt along the way (which was to be expected). I had a super supportive boss for the first few years and knew she would be tough to impress. I think I proved myself capable and hard-working so we quickly built a great dynamic. She truly pulled through on all her promises to promote me over the years which was extremely difficult to do with budget limitations. 

After my recent promotion, there was a change in reporting structure and I had a new supervisor who I was expected to work closely with on multiple projects. All seemed well in the first month of working together, but things quickly took a turn for the worse which ultimately led to my departure of the company. Upon reflecting, I’m wondering if I made a mistake in leaving despite my mental health being at stake. Here are some of the key reasons:

1. Since the new reporting structure, I’ve never felt more micromanaged in my life. I’ve always had supervisors with high expectations but this felt like it was on an another level. I would walk out of his office after meetings feeling so deflated and that nothing I did was right. He criticized every thing I did and even when I adjusted to his working style, it never seemed good enough. I tried over communicating so he can be well-informed and even gauge his opinion on things to meet his approval. In those instances, it was always “whatever you think is right, I support whatever decision you make” but no matter what I chose it was always wrong. I would overthink how I’d respond to emails that he was copied on… leaving them on read for days. I tried talking to him about my concerns, but he would shrug it off and imply he doesn’t want to give the answer for everything and wants me to learn on my own. 
2. As a result, my confidence shattered which is a crucial part of the job. I always prided myself in being able to take on difficult tasks or challenge myself to rise to the occasion. I’ve tried discussing our working styles and mentioned that I’ve learned under “sink or swim” circumstances so I naturally figure things out and sometimes I work better with a little autonomy. I reminded that I’m open to learning under his “working style” and just need a little grace as I’m just trying to prove I can do a good job if given the trust to do so. It didn’t work as he was a part of every meeting, every conversation and every email correspondence I had. Imagine you had 5 minutes to respond to every email with the appropriate response that he deemed suitable or else you would hear about it later. Yeah, not fun. 
3. Work-life balance was worse than before the pandemic. He would imply that we should still respond to important emails as a good gesture despite it being a weekends or if we’re taking PTO. I asked for a few days of PTO and he reminded me that I took 2 weeks off a year ago. I provided my PTO balance upon his request before he gave his approval. For reference, I had accumulated 160 hours since my last vacation.
4. Anxiety. Anxiety. Anxiety. I can’t explain how I felt inside from my anxiety about work. It consumed my daily life and I would ignore all personal tasks like laundry, dishes, cleaning my home, spending time with family all because I was so drained by the time I came home. Even when I was home, I would refresh and respond to emails because he didn’t think it was acceptable even we’re not on the clock. It’s “all about optics” right?
5. After my promotion, I switched from hourly to salary so I don’t get overtime anymore. Ironically, I worked 3x as much but couldn’t be compensated for late nights or early mornings. I made 70K before deductions.


It was the hardest decision I ever had to make but I knew I needed to walk away to save my mental health. I didn’t apply to any other jobs, because the industry is so small and I didn’t want to risk him finding out. I know it might seem impulsive and the general consensus would be that I’m an idiot for leaving without a backup. In terms of money, I’m working a lowkey office clerk job to cover basic expenses until I figure out my next move.

It’s been a few months since I handed my notice and my husband says I’ve never looked happier or at peace. My therapist says I’ve been suffering from chronic burnout so we’ve been working on that. I definitely feel like myself again, but I also hate myself for walking away from my dream company and what I deemed my dream job. I know many will say I made a huge mistake for leaving a “glamorous” job at one of the best studios. I feel regret as I know it will be tough to get back into the industry after leaving with no job prospect lined up or how to explain to prospective employees why I left my last job. I didn’t want to burn any bridges then so I certainly won’t want to now. 

Will I be red flag to prospective employers? How would I approach this change in future interviews?

1fusj5o,Options for people without a degree.,"Hey there everyone,

I'm 29, and college has always been difficult for me. I finally found what I want to do long-term, but schooling simply isn't financially feasible for me right now. I'm currently employed in healthcare doing sample preparation in a clinical laboratory, but here are a few other things I've done:

I was a QA supervisor at the beginning of this year before leaving due to the company not being professional in the slightest. (Highly disorganized, wildly sexual remarks from leadership.)

Before that, I was in QC for a German surgical device distributor for a year and a half. I was good at my job & liked what I did.

Before that, I spent six years in cleanroom manufacturing for semiconductors. I was also federally certified as a hazardous materials technician while working here.

I have a strong aptitude for technical skills. I've built my own PC, I troubleshoot my network at home all the time, and I usually arrive at a solution. I also excel at thinking outside the box.

I know a degree is everything in today's world, but is there anything I can do while I navigate my divorce to increase my income? There's nothing I'm not willing to learn. My only caveat is that due to my physical health affecting my stamina, I can't do manual labor again.",prolificmisanthrope,1,1.0,0,1727906945,2024-10-02 22:09:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fusj5o/options_for_people_without_a_degree/,10,2024

1furb0e,Calling in sick during my first week ,"Hi guys I don’t know where or who else to talk to this about but it’s made me extremely anxious. I just started a new job, which has been amazing so far. I really really love it and have been really putting so much effort into my training and learning on the role, trying to build relationships with the staff and just overall give a good impression. This is my first job after a long few months of looking. I was on my 3rd day today, and I was already quite sick. My manager, who’s amazing and made me feel very at ease about it, basically sent me home around midday because he noticed how ill I was getting throughout the day. I was starting to develop a mild temperature so it was good timing. In the morning he asked if I needed to go home but I said no because I didn’t want to give a bad impression, to which I was sent home anyway later on. I still said that I’ll be in tomorrow regardless because it is my first week and I really don’t want this to look awful. But it’s 10pm now and I’m still spiking a fever, both of my ears are completely blocked up, I keep coughing up phlegm and I’m so dizzy and nauseous I feel like everything is spinning. I asked my mum but she said to not even think about calling in sick because it’s the first week. But I really don’t feel great. My manager did say to see how I feel in the morning and that it’s okay and he completely understands but I did tell him I’ll be in anyway so now I feel even worse about having to potentially call in. I really really love this job, and I feel so motivated again for the first time in so long. I feel so scared this is going to ruin my chances to develop in the company, or that I will potentially be let go because of this. This is probably my first ‘real’ job in a big role.

I always dreamt to become a CEO but in 2020 I started to learn Ethical hacking and in 2023 I started to read psychology books. Though I have lot of dream I found myself as a purposeless man ,I already failed to get into public university at my 1st attempt and now I'm again trying to get into a public university specially in Jahangir nagar university IBA. But I can't focus on my study because I can't choose my passion and also stuck to understand the difference between passion and hobby that's why I pass my days by reading non fiction and scrolling 🙃

1fupw4z,How do I handle a co-worker trying to make me look bad?,"I recently started a new job last week in banking. I am not done with training yet so I can not process any transactions or do anything, yet my manager is telling me to do them anyways and one of them will help me. Okay no problem. At the end of the day the printer is not working, so I ask my colleague if it is okay for me to just print this tomorrow. She said no it has to be done today, I am on the phone with IT and we get the issues resolved and I am able to print. 

As I am leaving the office I am overhearing the same co-worker go out to my boss and tell her that “he told me he wants to print it out tomorrow, I told him no and sat with him until he finally did it, unbelievably” in a very hostile tone. Almost trying to make it look like i purposely did not want to print this out. I overheard this conversation and none of them knew I heard this. 

This is not fair because I don’t even understand how anything works here as I’m not done with training I’m not even supposed to be doing this work yet, she was creating a false narrative to my boss. 

Then that colleague keeps coming up to me and tells me “you better be on your best behavior because I am going to be sitting right next to you tomorrow” or today I was with a client and she said “he’s new so if you see a few zero’s missing from your account you know why.” 

I don’t know how I should address this because I’m new at the company and I feel like if I wait longer it’s just going to continue.

However, I know that part of the reason I was hired was for my skills and experience as a leader in my role: making architectural decisions, working cross-team and collaborating on projects.

I was hired to work alongside one person, and we were a two person team. This is what I'm used to, and prefer: working in a small group under a director, where we can collaborate to flesh out architectural and technical decisions. However, 2 weeks in, it was revealed to me that this person was instead going to be my new manager, instead of the director. I would be a contributor instead: my feedback is still valued, but I'm not doing any of the larger decision-making. The icing on the cake is this person is 5 years younger than me, and had only been with the company for 4 months... not huge problems, but I can't lie and say it doesn't sting.

I didn't say anything and have been trying to see how it goes for a few months. It's not terrible, but I can't help but feel like I'm playing second fiddle to this guy. Everyone loves him and wants him to be the one to help them, and they definitely don't see me as someone who can help them. I feel that I have to prove myself, which isn't necessarily bad, but I also don't feel supported by my boss, or the director. I have asked that they please direct other contributors to ask our team, instead of just our lead. (The best support I've seen is from a director in a different side of our department, funnily enough. He just happens to be a really kind and supportive leader.)

Part of me really wants to push back and propose we go back to the old system. I think that system would work really well. However, this would definitely mean more work for me, and since this company is very traditional, I suspect I would also have to go through leadership training and do other traditional leadership work. This is also a really small company, so I don't really have any movement options other than maybe hoping my current manager quits or something.

While I feel very unappreciated at work, I also feel that I need to take advantage of this time to enjoy my personal life and be a normal person. I was overworked at my last job and I fear I'm just trying to force myself into that same position. Although I can't imagine my current manager feels good about his workload at the moment...

Anyways, anyone with experience like this? Are you happy to have gone one way, or the other, or do you have regrets? I've been trying to just be chill about it, but I keep getting really frustrated with how limited my visibility is into problems and projects that are in-progress. But I don't want to be overworked again.",arcareeradvice2748,1,1.0,6,1727899588,2024-10-02 20:06:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fupo4k/hired_with_lead_skills_demoted_to_contributor/,10,2024

my dream job is to be an intelligence analyst, maybe for some 3 letter agency. i could major in a ton of things to get to that point, but i figured that cs would be the most helpful because i could offer an agency more since id be skilled in computers

but there’s a part of me that feels like this isn’t right for me. i really dread every time i have to open vs code and i want to bash my head into a wall when i get assigned something.

1fupdvc,What career should I pursue? ,"I apologize as this is going to be a fairly long message, but I want to give a little bit of background.

I am 22 and currently work as a Production Lab Tech at an animal pharmaceutical company. The benefits are very good, but the pay is very low and it is hard to make a living in today's economy. I also don't see my self doing this for a long time, I just don't feel fulfilled.

I am a Fisheries and Wildlife major (was originally going to go to vet school). I finished with a 3.75 gpa, I have lots of volunteer experience (Humane society and Hospital work).

So I am currently applying to go to perfusion school and radiology school. The application is due here in December and I will find out if I get into either school in January or February. Perfusion is the dream goal, but I understand it is a super competitive career.

So I am asking for a little bit of direction for my future if I am unable to get accepted for either secondary school. Are there any careers or secondary schooling that people here would recommend? I love working with animals and people. I just want a job that pays well and leaves me fulfilled (which I understand depends on who you are). I am open to going back to school. I am also open to getting a job outside of my degree which obviously might not be the easiest thing to do. I have been told I would be really good at sales as I am pretty personable. So do you guys have any recommendations for possible careers to explore or secondary schools to look into? Thank you in advance, I really appreciate any direction and help!

1fupavh,Seeking Career Advice – Struggling After Business Degree with Low GPA and No Experience,"Hi everyone,

I’m really in need of some career advice or mentorship and was hoping this community could help. I graduated from a well-known business school with a degree in business management, but due to a lot of personal issues during my time in school, I ended up with a 2.7 GPA. I know how bad this is, and I’m not looking for people to tell me that—it’s something I’m fully aware of. I’m just looking for ways to move forward.

Because of the personal challenges I faced, I couldn’t get much internship experience. Most of my time outside of school was spent dealing with those issues, and now I’m working in what feels like a glorified call center role at a healthcare company. Unfortunately, the job doesn’t pay enough for me to support myself, and I’m feeling really stuck.

I’m also a first-generation college grad, and on top of everything, I have a significant amount of student loans. Over the past year, I’ve applied to over 250 jobs with no luck, and I’m feeling pretty lost. I know my lack of experience and low GPA are holding me back, but I’m trying to figure out what steps I can take to get on a better track.

If anyone here has been through something similar or is willing to mentor or guide me, I would be extremely grateful. Any advice on how to move forward would be deeply appreciated.

1fupa8f,I don’t want to go to medical school ,"Hello!
I (18f) am a sophomore in college this year and I don’t know what to do.
All of my career interests (psychiatry and clinical neurology specifically rn) require medical school, but I genuinely don’t think I’m cut out for it (or, for that matter, what it takes to get accepted - I get straight A’s, but I’m not proactive and am not much of a self starter for extracurriculars like I need to be). I’m fairly unmotivated and lazy, and if I had literally any other option that could make me happy that didn’t require being accepted into medical school, I’d take it.
I know I need to do something incredible to even just get into medical school, like raise 10,000 dollars for a fundraiser and start a nonprofit or something, along with however many hours of clinical experience plus going through premed full time, but I’ve never started anything meaningful like former, and I’m already in my second of four years of college. I like relaxing in my free time. I’m not motivated to do anything I don’t need to and I don’t like reaching out to people (and it’s not depression, I think it’s just my personality - it runs in my family lol). I want to help people, and I adore biology and psychology and neurology and understanding the world as it is, all of which could be satisfied by achieving one of the careers I mentioned, but I’m just genuinely not cut out for it. I’ve been told I’m good with people and should be a counsellor or therapist by basically everyone (family, teachers, coworkers and supervisors, etc.) but it just wouldn’t satisfy the desire for information. 
I’ve followed the advice on the subreddit, and looked into many different careers, but none of them seem to click. Then again, I’ve never tried them, so maybe I’d be more fulfilled than I think? And it’s not like I’ve ever been a doctor, I might dislike that, too. I don’t know. I just need some advice right now if that’s okay. What should I do? How do I try different careers out without actually having a degree?

1fup3qu,Need some help.,"Good afternoon everyone I need some advice. I have been working probation now for three years. When I was first hired on I loved the job and enjoyed coming in everyday. The last 3-6 months I have grown very indifferent to the position. I'm finding that I have checked out emotionally and mentally. I'm also just tired of working in fields that I just don't have a passion for. Life's to short to spend working just because you need money. But that's the kicker isnt it? We need money. For years I've tried to think of how to make money to get to where my day to day job can be replaced and where I can have the freedom to be my own boss. The problem is I have no skills or assets that I can use to make money. I went to school for pastoral ministry and am currently a pastor. But I don't get paid for it. While it's my dream to do so, it's just not in the cards for me right now. And plus I would love to have a source of income that frees me up to do ministry without having to rely in ministry to make money. Most people suggest sales positions and I'm not a salesman. I've tried sales and I'm just not good at it..and I'm awful with customer service things. I'm very introverted and would love to have something that give me freedom and pays a good wage. For me right now I'm just looking at 45-65 k a year. I also live in a rural area and don't have a lot of city areas around which limits me.

So I was addressing one of the client, let's call them A, wrongly the whole time for a few months but they never bothered to correct me.

So I messaged the A's superiors while mentioning it was of the request from A. One of them told me that A has resigned. This threw me in a huge confusion and who was A then??? So I contacted A that I was informed that they had resigned and I would like to confirm on this and if in the future I'll be dealing with the superiors instead.

1fum6u0,At a crossroads in my career and life (divorce) and stuck in an unstable niche - how do future-proof myself and plan for the future? Should I focus short or long term?,"I’m currently getting divorced and in a few month’s time will find myself paying a mortgage / bills by myself in addition to child maintenance. As such, my costs have sky rocketed.

At the same time, there are redundancies going through at work, my area is quite niche, and London-centric (I have to commute in 2-3 times a week). If I lose this job, and if (big if) I end up getting another one in the same field (it’s very niche), it will be lower paid and with increased commuter costs (I will very likely need to be in the office more often) meaning I’ll have no money left at all at the end of the month (and overdrawn).

I will have 2 x nights free a week and 1 x day and 1 x night every other weekend.

Should I use this time to

1) Try to find some kind of flexible job / beer money-esque gig to boost income (my free nights in the week will be variable due to custody arrangements and commute so something such as bar-work or work in a fixed location will be impossible).

2) Train in a different area in my downtime to have a plan B (I’m concerned about my job being too niche and London-centric). Note – I do get some course access and a bit of time during work hours to do online modules or courses that compliment my current role.

3) Set up some kind of business that could maybe bridge options 1 and 2.

1fulqqd,Falsely Accused at Work—Feeling Lost and Need Advice,"A few days ago, I was called into what I thought was a routine team meeting. When I arrived, it was just me, my manager, and the head of HR. The HR rep started off by explaining the definitions of ""harassment"" and ""sexual harassment"" for about ten minutes. Confused, I eventually asked, ""I understand what those terms mean—can you please tell me why I'm here?""

They never gave me a straight answer and, of course, didn't tell me who had filed a complaint. The whole meeting felt like an endless loop of corporate jargon without any substance. In my state, a new law was passed earlier this year that makes it easier to file official complaints—even if someone simply feels uncomfortable, it's treated the same as actual harassment.

I've never been warned by any coworker or management about any behavior that made someone uncomfortable. If I had been informed, I would have absolutely respected their boundaries and adjusted accordingly. Instead, I was blindsided and taken straight to HR.

I'm happily married and have always prided myself on being respectful and supportive of everyone, regardless of their background. I work as a social worker and have dedicated my life to helping others, both here and abroad. This accusation is shocking and hurtful.

Now, I have a mark on my company record for harassment and sexual harassment based on an unknown incident. They've advised me to change or improve my behavior, but without any specifics, I don't know what to change. It's incredibly frustrating.

After the meeting, I was so bewildered that I used Reclip to mentally replay the last couple of minutes of our conversation, trying to catch any hints or details I might have missed. But there was nothing—just the same vague statements.

I'm at a loss for what to do next. Has anyone else experienced something like this? How did you handle it?

There are some other speeches at the same time, and 7 to 12 people are attending the other ones.

I assume that more will show up, but it's not worth traveling to speak to a handful of people.

Rude of me to suggest to my colleague that it may be worth cancelling?

Also, it would be just as easy for me to fly in on the morning of the speech, rather than stay overnight.  Would it be rude of me to do so, leaving my colleague alone?  We'd both otherwise be arriving at about 7pm, and I'd go to bed soon anyway.

1fujkhu,Incredibly depressed in a dead-end position at my first job. Are all corporate jobs this bad? ,"I graduated 1.5 years ago with a bachelor’s in engineering and got an internship at a huge MNC in the industry right away. After finishing my internship, I was hired as a Tendering/Proposal Specialist. Since then, I have been experiencing the worst depression of my life, despite getting paid well enough to move out and start saving. The working environment is very progressive, flexible, supportive, and not toxic at all. My role, however, feels like pure drudgery. 

The job involves reviewing requests for quotations from sales managers (usually for hardware or technical solutions), communicating with internal stakeholders to get information on specifications, plugging the inputs in our pricing tool and filling offer templates to provide offers. I struggle to get out of bed every morning because I find it so boring and tedious. In practice, you’re just copying and pasting things, relaying information, and worrying about meaningless details like word document formatting and font. It feels like a job that’s better suited for a 70 year old man than a young ambitious woman because you’re not adding any value, just aggregating inputs from everyone else. There’s also no exposure or visibility and you’re not allowed to communicate with customers directly or with upper management. Other people my age in the company have been flown out for training courses and seem to be involved in exciting projects.

People in my role on the other hand have been there for 10+ years or have left the company after getting stuck in this role. I’m also severely underperforming because my skills and interests are totally at odds with the job. In meetings with other proposal specialists, I have to stop myself from falling asleep because these people seem interested in discussing things like <1% increases in tax margins and terms and conditions for hours. I’ve discussed it with my manager and he has said that this is the only position he can see me in. 

Does anyone have any advice? And can you tell me if this is just what work is like for most people and I’m expecting too much out of life?

1fuhu0k,Systems engineer to SWE Transition guidance needed,"**Context**: 

I am a systems engineer at my current company, 4YoE, I have an undergrad degree in math and a grad degree in civil engineering from top 10 private schools. I got hired right out of school as a systems engineer by a small defense contractor. Right away, i started working on some basic scripting in python and some in matlab. Fast forward to two years or so, i was  promoted twice; doing more of the same but with a little bit more emphasis on software development work for internal tools ; building analysis tools, maintaining some code from old frameworks, data analysis (think matplotlib), etc. Nothing fancy that requires deployment for thousands of users to utilize. I started a MS CS program last year and I am about 4/10 classes in. 

I feel a little bit more confident in my abilities to design, architecture and code in the 'software sense'. I dont know, truly, what a real SWE does on the daily; I get the feeling that at real software companies, they are doing code reviews, PRs, DevOps, code maintenance and more (i know it depends on the type of SWE). I want to transition into SWE (like many others) and specifically focus on robotics simulations. 

**Question/career advice help:** Not sure what kind of advice im looking for -- i am hoping that by doing this CS program (coupled with my math and engineering backgrounds) I can leverage some of my skills. I've tried doing personal projects on the side, in my cs program ive taken control theory and reinforcement learning courses. I am passionate about learning and would love to pivot into robotics sims or related field (think NVIDIA IsaacSim). What could i do to get there? What projects could be helpful to build skill?

1fuhglz,Need advice: State pension taking a huge chunk of my paycheck – should I renegotiate or find a new job?,"Hi everyone, I really need some advice. I recently started a new job (next week will mark one month), and on my first day, I was forced to choose between a state pension plan or an Optional Retirement Program (ORP). Unfortunately, it wasn’t made clear that this choice is **irrevocable**, and the state is taking 7% of my paycheck for a pension ON TOP OF almost $200 that doesn’t even benefit me directly (It’s for teachers using the pension. I am not a teacher.). HR/Benefits have told me there’s nothing I can do about it.

I genuinely **love this job**—the team is great, and they’re all excited to see what I’ll bring to the table in terms of leading summits and conferences. But honestly, after receiving my first paycheck, I’ve lost all motivation. This was supposed to be a better-paying position, but the **pension deduction is taking nearly $800 from my pay**, and I’m feeling the strain financially. I have four cats and a dog to take care of, and after this deduction, I’m somehow making less than I did at my previous job. It’s incredibly stressful, and I’m worried about losing everything.

**My question is:** Should I talk to my supervisor about renegotiating my salary? They offered me the minimum of $71k with a range up to $80k. Should I let them know that with the pension deduction, this salary isn’t sustainable for me? Or should I just start looking for another job? I feel stuck, and I’m not sure what the best move is.

**TL;DR**: I started a new job a month ago but was forced to choose an irrevocable state pension plan that’s taking 7% of my paycheck (\~$800). This makes my new salary unsustainable, and I’m making less than I did at my previous job, which is causing a lot of stress.

1fuh59r,"Need Advice, Toxic Job? I’m Not Sure. ","Hey all. I need some advice or input on if my CEO/Founder/Boss is toxic or am I just being a b….. 

Job Field: Small MSP (I.T) around 7-12 people located in Delaware. My position is an IT Support Specialist.  

Want to start off saying I’ve been in the IT field for 10+ years. 

I’ve been at this job for about a year or so and it was promising at first with the CEO/founder, we will call this person John, stating that this company is different and any concerns can go directly to him because its a small MSP. Well this sounded good at first but then I realize there’s 2 sides to it. Since this is a small company John has direct access to me as well as everyone else in office which leads to micromanaging in a way. John comes into the office everyday but not until noonish but you can instantly see and hear that the office vibe change as soon as he enters. John always says to have “in order to work here you must have thick skin”. Funny thing is he does not have “thick skin” although he thinks he does. In my 10+ years of IT jobs I’ve never felt as if I was walking on eggshells but here I do, everyday. 

Why I think this job may be toxic:

1.) John calls everyone out when they make a mistake and then makes you the subject of his “lesson” to the entire team

2.) John says he does not micromanage but always in everyone’s tickets

3.) John thinks giving us more work is a reward. He always says “once you get this I can give you more work”. This always bothered me. (without more pay that is)

4.) John brings home life emotions with him to work

5.) 1 out of the 4 people that work from home does nothing and he knows this and does nothing (not too big of a deal but thought I’d mention it) 

6.) Called off a few meetings because he didn’t want to say something he was going to regret to someone who made a mistake. (Super red flag? Idk) 

I don’t even know why I’m typing this all up. I just don’t know who to talk to about this anymore.

1fugsty,"Advice- what should I do with my current situation? Please read, it is long but give it a chance.","I am a 43 male.  Married for 17 years to a wonderful woman who I love.  
We have 4 kids together. 

My wife and I worked together in Florida for 16 years, for our family business that my parents owned.

Then we got fired after 16 years of giving more time and energy, more passion and more love into a business than most people would have.  We gave it all we could, and mainly because it was family and they promised us for years that the business would be ours.  We also lived with them for 10 years and it is incredibly hard to live with and work for family.  You can do one or the other, not both at the same time if you want to stay happy.  Well, my parents lied and instead of giving the business to us, fired us and what happened directly because our family fired us sent us into a downspiral of financial distress.

In the past year and a half we have had 5 addresses.  From Florida to Huntsville, Al (three addresses in that area in a year) and then where we are now in Georgia.  

We do not have any contact at all with my wife's family and we are not in the same state as my family so we don't have any issues at all from family.  We do not have friends because we don't have money to do anything extra curricular.  

We have no enemies either though, nobody who would want to hold us back in life, nobody who is trying to make our life difficult, and no reason we should not be happy.

My wife is currently working pretty much all the daylight hours she can to support us.  I have almost $1000 coming in from a government SSI check every month, so it helps alot.  Some months she brings in about $1000 from her retail associate job.  She also does Uber and makes money with that to add to our income. 

I am proud of my wife, she works hard and does what is necessary.

I am not proud of myself.  I do not have a job and have not for months now.  The last real job i had was McDonalds and you cant support a family of 6 with that.  Before that I worked retail with my wife at another corporate retail chain. That was part time seasonal though so it ended.  I did Uber but they deactivated my account back in Florida because I had my wife in the car and then I did doordash but they deactivated my account because I tried to sign in with the wrong info (my wife had used her email address when setting it up and her name and stuff, we didnt think it would matter because we are married- what's hers is mine and mine is hers) but this apparently doesn't work with jobs.  They don't care if you are married and consider everything shared and transparent.  They only care about the individual that is employed.  And that causes problems.  Also, I did lyft but they deactivated my account because one of my passengers reported me as driving while intoxicated but I wasnt- I had one of those large aluminum monster energy drink cans in the cup holder and they must have thought it was alcohol.  Anyway they didn't even let me explain or care.  No accountability in rideshare or delivery apps at all.  They don't really care about the employee.  Only the riders. 

All of this having been said, I am a business professional.  I KNOW business.  Management, sales, purchasing.  I know how to read people and I am really good socially with people.  Customers, I always try to go the extra mile with them.  Employees and coworkers, I listen with an open mind, help when I can and am very attentive to their needs.  

I have the experience and skills, knowledge and expertise to be making $150k/yr, no doubt.  Could easily perform well in a role which would be bringing in that kind of money.  I have applied to literally hundreds of jobs which I am qualified for, capable of doing and thriving in.  Tons of different jobs- jobs which pay minimum wage, and jobs which pay as much as $250k/yr for a sales manager role.

I am not delusional and trying to just land some job I dont deserve. I am realistic and understand that I can be making really good money in business.
I would take any job I was offered just to be working right now and contributing more to my family, but I dont seem to even be given a chance in minimum wage jobs. 
Even if I took a min wage position, it would only be temporary until I found something which paid better because I feel like, why settle for making less than you know you are capable of making?  I mean who says ""I know for a fact I can make $150k/yr but I'd rather be making $50k"".  Nobody says that.  I dont believe anyone should settle.  You do what you need to when it is necessary, and when a better job is available to you, you do what you really KNOW you can succeed in and thrive in.

I was sick as a teen and young adult and had to take handfuls of medicine which interacted with my body in many ways. 
One way, was that it made it where I couslnt be outside in the heat or in the sun for too long because my body was weaker because of it.

Well, now after 20 something years of always working indoors, in the air conditioning, and never in direct heat or sunlight, I cannot handle working outside or in a factory.  Isn't my fault.  It really isn't. It is just the way it is.  I accept that.  
Lucky for me, I don't feel like a real man has to work in a laborious job, my gender is not defined by the job I do or where I work.  Also lucky for me, I have the experience and skills and knowledge to work inside, in an office or business so I dont have to worry about passing out or killing over.

I have never been the type of man to say ""oh I know I could be making good money but I wanna sit around the house and be lazy, play video games and not work while my wife supports my family"" no, I am not like that.  I would rather be working and solely supporting my family.
I have also never been the type of man who enjoys cleaning and keeping house, washing dishes, etc, yet here we are, my wife working when I should be, and me at home doing her role (no, I don't believe a woman's place is in the kitchen) but when my wife and I got married we agreed to have traditional male/female roles.  This is what makes the difference.  We decided together as a couple that we wanted those roles and we agreed on it and that should just be the end of it.  We should be able to live the way we want.  Everyone else does.  If a couple agrees that the husband will stay home and the wife will work, they get to.  If I believed that all men should work and a woman should be at home, then I could understand life trying to teach me a lesson, but I don't feel that way.  Women can do anything a man can do.  We are all equal.  My wife and I just choose to prefer for me to work and her to stay home but it isnt possible until I get a job.  She said her dream job was a stay at home mom and she has never been a social person, she is an introvert.  I am the extrovert, and a very social person.  I like to party, drink, hang out with friends.  She is the opposite.  I love her though and have rearranged my goals temporarily so that we can remain happy and married until I get a good job which can support us with her only working minimal hours. 

It isnt a choice right now for me.  If a min wage paying job called me up today and offered me employement I'd take the job.

My wife and I have goals in life.  We have dreams.  We want to build a house or buy our dream house.  We want nice cars and I would love a boat.  This is all normal stuff people strive to attain and work for, but it is impossible without me working and making good money.

There are plenty of good paying jobs out there, plenty of jobs which pay $100k or more a year.  There are literally tons of them.  

I am also a musician and I KNOW 100% that if I really wanted to, I could be professional with it in some capacity.  I know music and I know what it takes.  It is a very difficult life.  People think musicians have it easy.  It takes time, lots of it, and patience to record and write songs and put together music which sounds good and works together.  I takes energy.. alot of it.  If I stand up at the mic with my guitar for 30 minutes, I will walk away from it drenched in sweat and hot.  It takes so much energy to sing and play guitar with the passion and energy it takes to do it right. It takes alot of creativity and thinking as well.

This is not the lifestyle I want.  I once was planning on going into music full time.  Just being a pro musician.  Then I met my wife and fell in love.  Had kids.  Etc.  Now I dont want that life of a musician.  I want a house and cars and my wife and kids to be happy, our original dreams when we got married of having things in life and not struggling like we are now.  
I know being a musician to the extent I would need to be means also not having time for my wife and kids.  
What I want now is a group of people to get together and play with a couple times a week and maybe write some original songs and play sometimes for people.

I am just so stressed and dont know what to do.  If I have to be this stressed out I should at least have a good income and a reason to be stressed.  Worried about making a deadline or impressing a new client.  Concerned about last quarter's sales results.  Or worried that the new vendor I found and secured for my company might not be a good fit because of something.  All this shit I'm dealing with, having to be home during the day and clean house while my wife works is just stupid for our family because I don't even care enough about cleaning to make the house look good.  I'd rather go to work and provide and let my wife clean it the right way.  She is much better at keeping house than I am. 

I am also a VERY open minded person.  I am open to new ideas and I accept everyone regardless of anything else which might set them apart from someone else.  

I don't know what to do.  I wish someone would give some advice other than just ""keep applying to jobs"" because obviously something is keeping me from being hired but I don't know what.  I wish I knew what, so I could be normal and support my family as I should, have lots of friends and events, get togethers and such.  I just don't have a clue what is causing a problem.  I'm good to my wife, and people I meet.  I dont lie, steal, cheat, hurt people or talk bad about people.  I don't wish others bad or hate anyone.  I am the kind of person who feels like ""you go to work to work, not to goof off or break policy, or use the time for personal things"" and also I feel like the people you meet at work can be an opportunity to have more friends and such, but I feel strongly that any extra curricular things not relating to getting the job done which you were hired for should be done on your own time and away fron work.  Nothijg wrong with talking to coworkers at work, or even joking around or taking your break with them, but work is work, not for playtime.  I would be the idea candidate for any corporation which was really interested in making as much money as they can because I leave personal stuff to my off time.   I literally have no enemies or anyone I could think of who would want to hold me back in life. 
And I hate asking others advice because I have always been the type to offer advice and help others who need it. 

Ugh.  Anyone have advice?

TLDR: I could be making $150k a year but I can't get hired and I don't have a clue why.

Hello i am seeking some counsel , wisdom, insight advice. I am 5 years out of undergrad with a degree in broadcasting cinematic arts. I went to college at 18 and followed my passion at the time and now I feel like it’s gotten me pretty much nowhere. 


My résumé has a long history of social media coordinating and marketing, I feel like I’ve grown out of that position and I’m honestly not the best at it because most of my studies were focused on film.

This leaves me at a crossroad. I am currently a volunteer coordinator and I want to make a career pivot. If you were in my shoes, would you pursue a masters in library and information science with the intentions of working in museums libraries, etc. or would you pursue health certificate in medical billing or surgical cleaning tech etc?

1fudbi8,It’s crazy how much stuff you have to know to land an entry  level position as a dev,"Let me give you some background on my journey. I graduated with an applied math degree from a prestigious university, maintaining a high GPA throughout. My coursework included several computer science classes, which helped me build a solid foundation. By graduation, I had become proficient in HTML and CSS, understanding their roles in web development. I also familiarized myself with Git for version control, recognizing its importance in collaborative coding environments.

Post-graduation, I dove deeper into programming languages. Did JavaScript, learning everything from basic syntax to object-oriented programming, DOM manipulation, and AJAX. Simultaneously, I picked up Python, primarily using it to solve LeetCode-style interview questions. To showcase my skills, I even built two projects using React and Gatsby: a color picker application and a personal blog.

Now, as I continue my job search, I'm realizing that this isn't enough. Employers are expecting knowledge of TypeScript, Node.js for server-side JavaScript, and SQL for database management. It's overwhelming!

Does anyone else find the sheer volume of required knowledge to be insane? What's more frustrating is that as I learn new technologies, I feel like I'm losing grasp of the ones I learned earlier. For example, after a couple of months focused on solving LeetCode problems in Python, I'm not even sure I remember how to build a React app anymore.

The tech industry's expectations for new graduates seem to be constantly expanding. It's as if we're expected to have years of diverse experience right out of college.

I finished a kind of a vocation school at 21 - computer technician. Afterwards I started working in the IT support sector - started in helpdesk and eventually got more experience and moved up to system admin & engineering positions. Due to my own mistakes and unfortunate circumstances, I have switched jobs a lot in the past few years. Which leads me to the present day: I am working a customer service job that is not well paid and not in my field of IT support.

However I am finally happy, I have dealt with other issues in my life and can appreciate a low stress job with good work life balance, even though the salary is low. I am applying to some IT jobs from time to time, to see if I can land something better paid, but I am in no rush.

The program is for 3 years and besides having a checkmark that I have a degree, I feel like it does not hold much value for career prospects. So I am wondering if I should just work and get a better job and try to find some stability or go and study. 

Work option would get me in a better financial situation. While the study option is something I would enjoy and be able to get me job opportunities abroad, since many jobs require a degree to sponsor a visa.

1fucslk,18 year old confused on what to pick,"I’m currently in a dilemma about balancing my long-term goals. For the past 2 years I have been building and growing E-Commerce brands. I’ve taken two brands to a high revenue over the past year at around 15-20% margins whilst doing A-level exams/high school. I’m currently 18 years old.

But now I have the 1st year of university doing Economics. I feel like university is a waste of time if I’m not fully focused on getting internships, socialising and networking, and getting a First class grade. 

I’ll be balancing business and education again, and I do think there’s an opportunity cost. I think for me to complete the degree whilst being able to still manage building new brands I’d have to not go into lectures/socialise and just focus on learning the content from the notes online and apply to internships to make the degree worth it.

So I’m thinking I either continue the degree and balance as best as possible, whilst risking the chances of completing a whole degree without internships/networking. Or, i continue building brands but full time, and only end up going to university if I need to and want to make a career out of it.

If I wasn’t to end up doing e-commerce full time I think I’d most likely want to go into consulting at an MBB firm. So maybe going to uni now whilst I’m not fully focused on achieving that would be a waste of time?

1fubng0,Side hustle income has surpassed my full time income. Need advice,"Hey guys, 

Little bit of a long post. But any advice would be appreciated. 

So, the income I earn from my side hustle (not an online business) has surpassed my full time job's income. It has been for quite a while. Around 6 months.

Recently I've taken a paid leave for 3.5 weeks. And a couple of days before coming back to work, I decided to tell my manager and let him know that I've decided to resign. And I've sent an email to HR as well. 

My last day of work will be on 18th October. 

This week I came back from my leave and my team leader suggested that I can still recede my resignation and maybe consider going part time (3 days per week; 2 days in office, 1 day work from home).

One of the reasons I didn't ask for anyone else's opinion prior to making my decision to resign is that I didn't want anyone else to influence my decisions.

Now here are the numbers:

Side hustle income: just under 8k take home
Time spent on side hustle per week: close to 0 hours most week and 2 hours at most in some weeks. 
Full time job income: 5k take home
Time spent on full time job including commute times: 40 hrs per week + 5 hrs commute time (5 days a fortnight in the office, 5 days work from home)
If I recede my resignation and go part time: around 3k take home 
Time spent on part time job including commute times: 24 hrs per week + 3 hrs commute time (2 days in office, 1 day WFH)

My plan after resigning was to double the income I get for my side hustle and at the same time start an online business (for scalability).

I've asked 3 of my closest friends about what happened today (about my team leader's suggestion on receding my resignation and going part time). And all 3 said that's not a bad idea.

1fub2nc,Need urgent advise related to my career!!!!,"I am a neet aspirant, I took 2 drops means I gave neet 3 times. My scores were 412, 522 and this year 595. I was confident enough to get a government seat cause last year cutoff was 580 in my state Maharashtra, or at least I would have got best private or semi government college. But due to rank inflation I am not even getting last seat of any private medical college. Luckily I even gave JEE and Mht cet and my percentile was 90.89 in Jee and 92.24 in mht cet. My siblings and few relatives told me that instead of going to outer state for private mbbs(Like UP which has a budget of 65-70 lacs total), you can do great in Engineering. So for my backup I took admission in Aissms(IOIT) college in IT branch. My college has started and it's a decent college and obviously I was not expecting much from a private engineering college.

My only thing of concern is I have some time in hand to decide whether to continue my engineering college or Choose private mbbs. I am so much confused what I should do. To be honest my parents has capabilities of spending around 70 lac on my degree, but my father has earned that with lot of efforts and I can't look in his eyes and say him for this.I even have two big sisters and one sister is at age of getting married, and we all know the expenses that would go into marriage.

1fuayuu,Korean High School Student Torn Between Pursuing Medicine or Law – Seeking Advice!,"I'm a Senior Year high school student in South Korea preparing for university entrance exams. Here, university admissions are largely determined by a standardized national test called the **College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT)**, commonly known as **Suneung**. Universities rank applicants based on their Suneung scores.

Only the top 0.2% of the 500,000 students who take the exam each year—those who rank between 1st and 1,000th—are eligible for medical school admission. South Korea doesn't have a pre-med system; instead, medical education is a unified six-year program straight out of high school, similar to a combined BS/MD program. Students who get into medical school through the Suneung generally proceed to obtain their medical licenses without significant hurdles.

In Korea, medical specialists earn an average annual salary of around **$200,000**, while private practitioners can earn about **$300,000**. For context, the median household income here is between **$20,000 and $30,000**.

On the flip side, becoming a lawyer is a more complex process. After completing an undergraduate degree, aspiring lawyers take the **Legal Education Eligibility Test (LEET)**, similar to the LSAT in the U.S. Admission to law school depends on your LEET score, undergraduate GPA, and other factors. After three years of law school, you take the bar exam, which is relatively easy to pass.

The most prestigious career paths for lawyers in Korea are:

1. **Joining a Big Law firm**: This involves working over 80 hours a week. The starting salary is about **$100,000 after taxes**, which is considered high here. However, being a partner lawyer is quite challenging.
2. **Becoming a Judge or Prosecutor**: These positions pay about half of what a Big Law associate earns but are highly respected and hold significant societal power and prestige.

Up until middle school, I was interested in various fields, including law and medicine. Under my parents' guidance, I enrolled in a top-tier high school specializing in social sciences and humanities to become a prosecutor. I've spent the last three years focused on this path without much second thought.

However, as university approaches (our academic year starts in March), I've started to worry about my future. In a country like Korea, where the population is declining, becoming a lawyer may become increasingly difficult. Many believe that doctors will thrive in our aging society. Additionally, considering Korea's uncertain future, some suggest pursuing a career that allows for easier immigration—like attending a medical school recognized internationally or majoring in STEM fields.

If I continue with the law, I can proceed as planned. But to become a doctor, I would need to start studying high school science subjects from scratch. In the Suneung, students choose elective subjects. Those who select science subjects like biology and physics can pursue STEM fields. In contrast, those who choose social studies subjects like economics and law are generally limited to humanities and social sciences majors. The science section of the Suneung is notoriously difficult and requires extensive preparation, meaning I'd be competing against students who have been focusing on these subjects since elementary school.

My mock Suneung scores place me in the top **1–1.5%** nationwide. To raise my scores to the level required for medical school, I estimate that I need at least one additional year of study, possibly up to four years. (The Suneung is held annually, and retakes are allowed; some people retake the exam multiple times over several years.)

Given all this, and the fact that I don't have firmly established personal convictions about my future, I'm torn between two options:

**Option A**: Major in law and become a prosecutor.

**Option B**: Study for an additional three years to try to get into medical school (though there's no guarantee that three years of study will be enough).

What would you do in my situation? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

* I believe that the legal and medical fields in the United States are quite similar to those in Korea, so I'm leaving this question in hopes of receiving some helpful advice. Thank you!!

1fuatj1,Career direction or advice would be very appreciated,"I’m really struggling to find a career path and I’m almost 30. 

For context. 

I’ve been working climbing the corporate ladder for 5 years. I recently switched career fields as I was let go from my previous position due to budget cuts. Left on great terms but I was so upset with the news I thought it was time for a career switch. I landed a job after looking for 5 months and now that I’ve made it past my 90 days I realize it’s not for me. 

Additional context. 

I went from working in real estate management to a project manager for a tech firm. Originally I thought it would pay higher wages but that’s not the case. 

That being said I’m actively looking for a new job that pays closer to what I was getting in real estate. I do miss real estate and was thinking about going into construction management however I’m not sure if I stand a chance with my current skillset.

I’m currently working on my RE license, I have my LEED cert. and I’m looking to obtain additional certifications. (Unsure what atm)

I’ve worked in marketing and management for almost 5 years now leading teams and increasing profit margins. I just feel a little lost and was hoping for some advice on possible careers avenues or certifications I can work towards to increase my overall income down the road.

I enjoy marketing, design, and team management. I also enjoy going to different site locations as I get bored in one space easily. 

I hope I provided enough context and I’m happy to clarify if anyone has questions. I’ve never had great guidance in life and I’m really trying to move my life forward in a positive direction.

I graduated two years ago with a degree in psychology and never got a real job. The only other thing I have on my resume is working at a cashier for a year. 

I had a terrible gpa and pursued my own business since graduating but it hasn’t taken off yet. My mom paid for all my living expenses and I decided to stop taking the handouts. 

I broke my lease and moved into my parents house with my abusive narcissistic father. I went no contact for years and barely have spoken the past 5. 

Now, I instantly regret this decision along with so many others this past few years. I need to gtfo for my safety and sanity. 

I’m bugging out right now and my mind is racing on the bullshit that is going to come between me and my family. 

My dream is to just get a job that qualifies me to move into my own apartment. I have zero friends or family to live in with and the idea of random roommates terrifies me. 

Im thinking of living in my car but fear as my parents are instantly surveying me since moving in will just track it (mom is co-signer on lease).

I know that should have worked harder and this is the real world. I’m not asking to be shitted on as I know this is my fault. My whole perspective has changed and have so much more respect for people that make enough to live alone.

What job can I get that will allow me to live on my own? I’ll live in another state idgaf. I’m open to a third party guarantor.

I want to create my own business and I’m fine with working full time just to be rent poor. Please someone give me hope that I can find a job fast that pays a wage that supports living alone.

1fu8xpz,I feel like I have a decent amount of experience but no skills to show for it.,"Here's my situation:

I got nepo'd into a project management role by a dad's old friend. I didn't really want it (I used to be a teacher) but I was told to try and accept with an open mind, so I did.

My job desc: I try to do things (arrange meetings, communicate stakes, plan, make documentation), make lots of fuck ups, and the actual project manager does all the work while taking the blame for my fuckups. I've been relegated to documentation and I still fuck that up because I'm stressed and the project is VERY large.

The situation between my mentor and me isn't the best. Yes, I try my best to do everything she asks me, but I do them slowly with plenty of errors and I get berated a LOT for it, and she micromanages me a lot. She fluctuates between absolutely psychotic and actually nice. I've been getting nightmares and panic attacks about work and am thinking of resigning - it's been one year and I don't really feel like I've improved, nor will I be able to be independent as a manager.

Trouble is, I've completely lost any faith in myself as a professional worker. Sure, I have some experience, but no skills to show for it. I know the basics but I've never been given any responsibility, and I am too scared to get into the nitty gritty.

I’ve always wanted to get really good at coding and build my own applications, but I find myself constantly starting projects only to stop for various reasons. The main issue I run into is that when I get stuck, I don’t know what to do next, and it derails the entire project. 

For example, I’ll run into environment setup issues or random errors, and then I’ll start searching the internet for solutions. That’s when the real frustration begins. I’ll come across answers on places like StackOverflow, but instead of solving the problem, I get even more overwhelmed. Most of the answers are too complex, or I barely understand what they’re talking about. Worse, when I try the suggested fixes, I still get errors, and it feels like everyone else is using a different version of StackOverflow than me because their solutions never seem to work in my case.

I also didn’t go to college for computer science, so I sometimes feel like I’m missing the foundational knowledge that might help me understand the errors and solutions better. I’ve been trying to self-learn, but I’m not sure what the best way to approach it is. Does anyone know of any good YouTube playlists or resources that cover what you’d typically learn in a college computer science course?

Ultimately, I want to land an entry-level software engineering job, but I feel like my current approach is holding me back. My method of handling roadblocks isn’t working, and it’s making me lose confidence and give up on my projects.

1fu6g3s,Did I Pick the Right Job?,"I was on the job hunt earlier this year and have wondered if I picked the right job *(I work in marketing)*. 

In late May, I was able to earn 2 job offers. Each job had the same title.   
  
Job #1 is with a respectable but lesser known NGO. It's a Director's level position - but the position operates more like a manager. The job requires to work from an office 4 days per week, 1 day from home, and the occasional night or weekend shift *(but there is a maximum of 40 hours per week that is strictly enforced).* 

Job #2 was with a notable fortune 500 company. It was a Director level position with a lot of opportunity to apply creativity in my work and grow within the industry. It required travel for events and the occasional work through the weekends - but was otherwise fully remote.  

The salary for each job was virtually identical. 

Job #1 has better benefits, a 10% match (fully vested), a signing bonus, and a 4% annual COL increase. 

Job #2 had a 15% discretionary bonus and a 4% match (vested at 2 years of service). 

I was ready to accept Job #2 - *but here is where things got interesting...* 

Both jobs asked to check references at the end of the interview process. I provided a list of references to each.   
  
Job #1 made an offer after 2 days.    
  
Job #2 took 2 weeks to respond and called me to say that all hiring within the company had been frozen for an undermined amount of time. I was a little concerned about their stability before the call *(they are in an industry that is not growing)* and this felt like a huge gut check. 

In the end, I accept Job #1 instead. It has been good. But at times, it has felt slow. I like the job. My team is full of wonderful people that have worked there for a long time. The culture feels good and the organization is incredibly stable. The only downside is that the work feels monotonous.   
  
Last month, Job #2 informed me that their hiring freeze had ended and they wanted to move forward with an offer. The company's work is more in line with my creative side, but I could not look past feeling rejected by the hiring freeze. I felt like it was a sign of larger issues and I felt that it would be better to prioritize job stability over creativity.   
  
I declined Job #2 - but have had a great degree of FOMO related to my decision. 

**I would love some advice.**   
  
I'm in my mid 30s and care deeply about my career. I have worked really hard over the past 10 years. I want to continue to grow in my career, and feel that Job #2 would have challenged and pushed me farther. But in an era where employees can often seem disposable by struggling companies, I wonder if stability of Job #1 will be better for me in the long run.

Everyone around me still wants to clock in every day, work their way to a ""dream job"" and start making good money well in their 30s. while nothing's wrong with that, it just isn't possible anymore, not alone, not in the physical world.

KIDS and TEENAGERS are making THOUSANDS a month, more than their parents, from online sources. Every day average citizens are making thousands a month from YouTube and/or TikTok automation. The world is evolving, technology is the present and the future. evolution is inevitable. You can have 10 sources of income within a single deskspace, at home, on a computer.

I was planning on going to a tech school for cybersecurity and coding. I recently gave this more thought and realized, I can learn ALL of this information independently online. Why would I waste 2 years at a technical school for information I can get from YouTube and some paid courses? You could argue that having a degree looks better than not and that's true... if you're looking for an employer.

You can learn so many skills online and use them to your advantage. It's October 2024, switching over to the digital world, you could be a serial entrepreneur earning at LEAST 5k a month by October 2025. Am I wrong for thinking this way?

Endless possibilities online, it's a sandbox.

TLDR: The world is evolving into a digital world, making money as an entrepreneur online from the comfort of your home via YouTube automation, TikTok automation, editing, etc is far better than chasing a ""real life job"".",joshbih,1,1.0,0,1727834806,2024-10-02 02:06:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fu5gds/the_digital_world_is_the_best_option/,10,2024
1fu4uip,Mechanical/Electrical engineer aiming to work in satellite/rocket AOCS/GNC,"Hey guys, 

I’m an engineer with a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering and a masters degree in electrical engineering. I have work experience through internships in both fluid dynamics simulations and hardware testing for semiconductors. 

I’m applying for my first full time rn and have been solely focusing on the satellite industry with positions in aocs/gnc/flight dynamics. So far have landed a few first rounds in Europe that have yet to happen as well as a first round at rocket lab in New Zealand. 

I’m a bit unsure of my knowledge. I feel like I understand the math and physics pretty well from my graduate class but am really lacking in practical experience. Do you guys think I have a shot at a junior role? If not, any suggestions of how to eventually end up there? I’m thinking about dedicating some time to writing a 6dof simulator in matlab and implementing a control algorithm just to have a personal project under my belt. Any suggestions on this? 

Also I have a few years of experience in embedded systems programming. If that helps my chances at all…

1fu4ia9,New Job or stay at Current Job,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice on potential job movement’s for myself.

For a little background, I’m currently a CPA in Canada working in Industry as an Accountant. Current compensation is as follows: 

- $65k
- 10% bonus annually
- 4k Stock Option
- 6% Pension Contribution from Employer
- 3 weeks vacation
- 3% annual inflationary salary bump
- 3 day hybrid work situation where I walk to work
- Slower career progression/gov’t adjacent 

Total compensation totals to $76k plus $4k in Employer Pension Contribution

I interviewed for another industry role for a Senior Accountant for a growing company looking to essentially double in size by acquiring more subsidiaries (currently at 8, looking to get to 12-14 subsidiaries by the end of investment cycle) as a PE backed company. The interview went well and they offered me the role with the following compensation base:

- $85k 
- bonus structure not confirmed but being approved by board to be in the 5-15% range based off personal and company performance
- 3% Employer pension contribution
- 3 weeks vacation
- Hybrid working (CFO said he doesn’t care where you work as long as your work gets done, so whatever that means)
- Phone allowance of $100/month
- Gym allowance of $80/month
- lots of room for growth within growing company
- 20 minute commute
- November start date

Heard some things from rumours about the company that their CFO isn’t the best to work with and that it’s also a bit of a shit show there to add.

Total Compensation around $91k-$97k based off bonus structure and $2.5k of pension contributions.

Currently at my company, I’ve applied and failed at obtaining a senior role for the last two attempts, but there is another senior role that I will be applying (and interviewing for, typically a shoe in for internal employees to get an interview). This role’s structure would follow my current positions structure with a salary of $80k-$85k plus bonus and stock option to total to a total comp of $92k-$98k - plus I won’t lose my $6k bonus from 2024 earnings. 

TLDR: offered a position on day of interview for $91k-$97k and need to confirm if I’m accepting next week. Current company paying $76k but other subsidiary has an opening for a senior role paying nearly the same, without losing current role bonus and looking for advice on what to do. Take the offer and move roles, Take the offer and interview for other position at current company, decline offer and hope I receive the other role.

All advice welcome, thanks in advance.",throwaway1095489,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1727831817,2024-10-02 01:16:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fu4ia9/new_job_or_stay_at_current_job/,10,2024
1fu4dow,College student confused about future career goals,"Hi, I’m a sophomore in college currently, 19 years old. When I first went to college, I thought I wanted to be either a physician or a dentist. I did shadowing for both dentists and physicians and when I shadowed, I felt very indifferent about what I saw and had trouble feeling passionate about what I was seeing. For a time, I figured that it was whatever and I would just push through but now I am having serious doubts as I continue to move forward and feel confused. I’ve been thinking about law, as I do really like reading and writing and have interest in the judiciary system, but I also keep hearing that law is a very saturated field with lacking pay. I ruled out engineering because I have a pretty strong disdain for high level math after taking calculus 2. I feel like my strengths are in writing and reading and creativity, and I’m fine at sciences though I’m not very interested in them. I feel like every time I look into a career, I’m either disinterested or run into a high level of unhappiness from people in that profession, or both. Overall, I feel very lost and confused, and keep feeling indifference rather than any strong interests and it is starting to stress me out and was wondering if I could get any advice. I don’t want to commit myself to something that will make me feel unhappy financially or unhappy in my passion, but I also feel the need to make a decision soon.

1fu43q1,"Trying to start my life from scratch at 27, scared it's too late to find fulfillment ","I've been at war with my mental and physical health for 10 years. Dropped out of college multiple times, never maintained a good relationship with any employer (or friend, or family for that matter). My failures have been so loud that I'm getting treated for complex PTSD right now.

I've been really good at certain jobs. I take responsibility serious. Have a good brain for details, problem solving, and general human behavior, I think. I tutored calculus before I dropped out and had a blast doing that. I worked for a gym, and my manager said I was the best towel folder and cleaner that he'd ever seen. Loved working landscaping gigs. Last job was working at a weed store and I have pages of customer reviews that speak glowingly about my care and professionalism.

I thought I would ride that into a managerial career. But then I got a medical diagnosis and psychologically crumbled. The timing was horrible for me. My ability to take care of myself disappeared out of nowhere. Ended up getting in a fight with my boss and quitting no notice. 

This was over a year ago. Since then, I've been determined to find remote work, but failed.

Now I want to turn my life around but know that no good employer would hire someone who's last job was at a weed store, quit, took over a year off, has zero recommendations or degrees.

I wanted to try being a waiter/bartender, but i get chronic rashes on my face now, and thats too distressing to deal with in jobs that looking good is an advantage. I've got weak muscles and fatigue easily so that rules out of making longterm hard labor a goal. Too much ADHD to do jobs that involve standing around doing nothing, that work pushes me towards addiction.

I know I know, I have a lot of stipulations. I'm trying to get tougher. A big problem is that I have zero friends, so there is no ""just working so that I can live my life"". When I am working, there is no life on the side for me. I need the work to be fulfilling.

I have a chance to use the next year to get my associates degree, but don't even know where to begin choosing a path. Like take the shortest route to some certificate that will get me a job asap? Go STEM and try to pursue higher education again? Some arts degree because a goal of mine is to make video essays/documentaries? Skip education and go work on a national park?

Really I just want control over my work. I hate being micromanaged. I hate sitting still. I would love to have work that I could spread out over 6-7 days. Work that can be done with headphones in. Or that the people I'm working with truly support and respect eachother. I'm not asking for all of these boxes to be checked, but one or two would be nice.

1fu3anj,Fresh event executive - is it valid to feel burnout? ,"Hey guys, I am a fresh event executive in my small company and I’ve come to realise that I run practically everything by myself, with my supervisor being the top to oversee the whole planning aspect. This would be my first job in events firstly, secondly, is it normal to have to do many different things at once under 1 person too? 

Here’s what my roles are; 

- event management 
- planning of project timeline, production schedule, call sheet
- coordination of vendors 
- sourcing of and purchasing vendors, decorative etc.
- creating quotation 
- client liaison 
- venue sourcing 
- proposal planning for potential projects (creating of proposal)
- presentation of proposals 
- floor runner / manager
- we rely on the supervisor/founder of the company as the finance person but sometimes have to use my own savings for purchases (claims after event) 
- apply necessary permits 
- setting up of space decors (general event setup) 

There could be more but I wanted to check if this is what event execs do normally, is it me that I feel slightly incompetent to do all of these myself? Am I being used beyond my actual role? 

I enjoyed it at first but realised that I am the only full timer to do all of this alone (“with the help” of the supervisor) the rest are freelancers, is it valid to feel burnt out?

1fu2laq,Should I apologise to my ex-manager or just leave things as it is?,"
For the last 4 years, I’ve been with the same company but had a total of 3 internal rotations. 

To be specific:
- 2020 to Feb 2023: Sales team 1 with manager A; located at office A
- Feb 2023 to Feb 2024: Strategy team with manager B; located at office B 
- Feb 2024 to present: Product team with manager C, handling sales team 6; located at office C

As part of my job in the product team, we work closely with the sales team; hence, while I’m a product manager now, I with very closely with sales team 6 (different product analysts work with different sales team, this is fixed).

When I left manger A, I left abruptly, manager A didn’t know what hit them and just left. Manager A had expressed to me that they were surprised and hurt. As time went by, manager A would give me subtle disappointed looks (or maybe its stink eye, I’m uncertain) whenever we saw each other (which wasn’t often as we were in different office locations, we saw each other maybe 1 or 2 times a month for a minute or less).

Right now, I heard that my ex-manager might manager my sales team 6 as a promotion. This is uncertain but if this happens, it takes place between January to March 2025. And manager A would have the influence to ask upper management to remove me as the product analyst for the team and replace me with someone else; i won’t be fired but ill be reassigned to another sales team but i like sales team C.

I’m wondering if I should talk to her now, in anticipation of the future, and apologise to her. Something like “I always wanted to apologise as I know my leaving the team hurt you and I’m sorry. And everyone I’m in office A, I always want to catch up with you as you gave me a chance. But I didn’t have it anymore and I wanted to apologise so that we can start fresh.”

But I’m uncertain if my actions would undermine my authority in the future.

I never did because in High School, I struggled, especially in my math and science classes, and believed for years that I was stupid. But in recent years, I realized I'm not as stupid as I thought and I've gotten more and more comfortable asking for help if I don't understand something.

So I've been thinking that, once I finish paying off two of my loans sometime next year, that maybe I'll go back to school for a degree in environmental science (or computer science since I like coding). Though I was thinking of going to my local community college first to knock out some fundamentals then transfer to a university for the more in depth stuff.

As exciting as this idea for me, I fear that I might be the oldest student when I transfer to the university, and struggling with chemistry and physics classes.

I’d love some advice on my situation.

I’m currently working as a Commercial Property Manager, overseeing 10 office buildings in Melbourne’s CBD for a Tier B agency. Before this role, I spent two years in valuations and advisory, and a year as an Assistant Commercial Property Manager, so I was relatively green when my company took a chance on me as direct property manager and not as an assistant.

My background is fine except for the fact I have a bad job history (I'm 26 btw).  I'll try to summarize it the best that I can but essentially, I lasted at my first job 2 weeks cause I didn't feel I was a good fit. I was then hired for about 3 months at FedEx, then I quit because there was a conflict with my school schedule. 

  
After this I finished my Bachelors and took a few pre requisite classes after graduation to get my masters, but stopped because I wanted to work a few years before getting my masters. This is when it gets really bad



I was unemployed for about 8 months due to mental health issues. My family supported me through this time because I was in a bad place. I applied for jobs later and got one around mid August this year at a hotel. Again, it didn't feel like the right fit for me, so I quit after two days. Which brings us to today

  
I got a job offer for my dream job and it just hit me that I probably won't get it because of my employment history. I accepted the offer but now I'm thinking of maybe rejecting it so they won't have a look at my background. I can then find X job at a fast food place or something, work there at least a year, and maybe apply later to this job

  
I don't know what to do. I'm super bummed out. It's been a really bad year for me and this finally felt like the universe giving me a break, but it's just another disappointment

1fu0seb,Stuck in Administrative Work with an Engineering Degree: Need Guidance,"
I’m having a final talk with my Senior Project Manager and Vice President soon. I recently tried to resign, but they asked me to reconsider.
A bit of background: I don’t have another job lined up, and I’ve been bouncing between two departments, which has stunted my growth. Despite having an engineering degree, I’ve been doing administrative work for two years. This has been frustrating, as it’s not aligned with my career goals.
During my talk with the Vice President, he praised my work and expressed that he doesn’t want me to leave. He said, “I never heard anything bad about you and you have done good work.” I work in a construction company, and it feels disheartening to see colleagues who started after me doing more project work while I’m stuck with administrative tasks.
I’m currently pursuing a part-time Master’s in Civil Engineering and a minor in Data Analysis. I’m torn between staying in this field or transitioning to data analysis. They mentioned they would accommodate my schooling and either provide more support in construction or help me transition internally. However, I don’t think there’s a data analysis role in my company, although they were hiring a Business Analyst with five years of experience, so probably I wouldnt get this role, but I know a similar role exists. So far, Ive only seen 1-2 people with this job title in my company. 
What should I do? Should I 
1. leave the company (possibly of leaving the door open with the current company) or apply for another job
2. stay in construction, 
3. try to transition internally?

Edit:

I feel like I don’t want to stay in the construction industry.

I moved to Us from Europe. I have worked there in a bug tech company, was great. Here, i work for a small company as a tech guy. It’s been 10 months and i feel awful at this job. It’s a mess, people keep throwing more and more projects and tasks under my belt. A lot of projects i manage with external vendors. I have a cool manager, who’s targeted by the “seniors” too, and all those “seniors” are picking un us daily, with 1-3 meetings where they request even more and complain about us even more. Everybody is bossing me around, and when i ask for clear instructions nobody can give me. 
Lately a lot of tech issue appeared because if the vendors and I cannot do anything about because i din’t have accesses, but everybody keeps blaming me. 
Lately they keep asking me to stay after my shift ends too, or to be available on call whenever the higher management needs it. 
I started to be really depressed because of this workplace, affects my day to day life, started to have headache daily after job too. Even though the benefits from jib are good (salary + others) I started looking for a new job (only for a week tho) but the market is horrible right now. I really don’t know how to proceed forward. I talked with my actual IT manager, he’s in the same boat as me.

1ftzph2,"I referred people to apply for investments from an investment group that I’m a member of, but it’s too soon for them: how to tell them?","I'm a member of a small group of investors.  (No, I'm not wealthy; it's for people to invest in the industry that I work in.) I recently went to a conference on behalf of the group and met some people who run companies that are looking for investors.  The group lets a few people come to its monthly meeting and pitch for investments.

One person who I met then did as I said, contacted the group and asked to come pitch for investments, and the group said yes.

A few other people who I met are too new with their companies to be accepted by the group to pitch.  For example, the group wants people to come pitch for investments if they have at least 1,000 customers and $500,000 in revenues, and these other people haven't met those targets yet.

I assume that I should tell them that before they apply?  If they apply to pitch now, they'll be rejected.

But I want to make sure that they know that I enthusiastic for their applications and I'm pulling for them; I don't want them to think that I don't want them to apply to pitch.  I want them to apply...in a few months.

So, I'll contact them and say, ""Yes, please apply. The group really likes to see such and such revenues and such and such customers so you'd have the best shot if you apply then.""?

1ftyxlm,New job opportunity,"So I’m looking for some advice - I got a job offer to go work in an electric motor repair shop/electrical contractor business. I’m currently a maintenance director at a nursing home.

The pay is the same as what I make now at my current job with a 2 dollar increase after 6 months as long as I pass my license exam.

Some pros I see about taking it are: getting my electrical license - learning more about something I’m interested in and furthering my career and earning potential - better benefits as far as health and retirement go - more money eventually. - no more on call. 

Some cons would be: it’s 40 minutes from my house where my current job is less than 10. - not much opportunity for OT so the pay increase really isn’t the best cuz I make pretty good with the OT I work now - I kind of get to come and go when I please and work on stuff at my leisure with little to no over sight where I’m currently at and I won’t be able to do that at this new place. - starting over and not being the boss anymore.

I enjoy the job I’m at now and am comfortable where I’m at but I feel like it’s a dead end I can’t get licensed or anything here and I’m about at my pay cap limit. I think I’m just scared of change.

I pulled over and looked at maps to figure out where I was going. I gave the right location a call 2 minutes before my scheduled interview time. I explained my situation to the hiring manager and said I was on my way and it would take me 10 minutes to show up to the right location. I showed up and apologized again and they said it's okay it's happened before. My interview is for a retail chain that has many locations. I also think my outfit was really professional and I have good answers to their questions. I was just nervous and I think they could tell. What would you think of this situation?

1ftwr23,Contract VS full-time,"Hey everyone!

Would really appreciate opinions on this.

Some backstory. I worked for a large financial institution in their creative department as an art director for 9 years. Sadly, my department was outsourced and my position was eliminated. Before that I worked in ad agencies and got really burnt out and hated the environment as work life balance was terrible and it became quite toxic. I took a break from it and went internal agency in corporate and turned out to actually really love it. My work life balance returned and i could focus a lot more on me and the work. The thought of going back to the ad agency world makes me incredibly anxious.

Fast forward to now. A competitor financial institution has offered me a 3 month contract (unclear if it will be extended). I'm actually excited about it as I like the banking world and i'm comfortable with it in a good way. Wrench in the plan is an agency has approached me (no offer yet) and is interested in me as well. The pay from the contract is higher than what i made previously (likely because on contract, i don't receive benefits and vacation pay, however i can go on my spouses benefits) and the agency compensation is 1 week less vacation and $10k less of my base pay with no promise of bonus (previous bonus was $10-13k). However, the agency is full time and the contract, is well, a contract. I received almost a full year severance so I have time to be a bit pickier and my partner is supportive of whatever i choose and is pushing me in the direction of the contract as i seem more interested in that. I just worry i'm just making a wrong decision if I choose contract vs full time especially when the job market in my city (and most cities) kind of sucks right now.

1ftwg5t,Do I negotiate a job offer that’s my second choice?,"I received a job offer for an accounting position and the salary is 57k & I currently am making 56k right now. So obviously I wouldn’t take the job unless they are able to give me a higher salary. This offer is with my second choice. 

I’m currently waiting to hear back from my first choice and will hear back with a final decision on Friday. They let me know during my interview that they were really impressed with my resume and they didn’t ask me any interview questions and just talked to me about who I was going to be working with in the department and the overtime schedule and flexibility they offer. Basically just telling me about the job and how much of a good work environment they have. They also told me my skill set is exactly what they are looking for. The lady I’ll be working with mainly was on PTO last week, so they said they would be able to come to a decision by Friday (this coming Friday) because she would be back from PTO then.  They also asked if that timeline works for me and I said yes (I hadn’t gotten my offer from my second choice yet) So that being said, it sounded very promising to me that they were very interested in me. 

Now I’m wondering if I should start the process of trying to negotiate the salary for my second choice given the fact that I don’t have a confirmed offer from my first choice. I have to have an ‘accept or decline’ answer from my second choice by this Friday as well and I will be waiting to hear if I got the job from my first choice too. 

Any advice?? Should I go ahead and try to negotiate salary with second choice now?",zeezy_16,1,1.0,8,1727810163,2024-10-01 19:16:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ftwg5t/do_i_negotiate_a_job_offer_thats_my_second_choice/,10,2024
1ftw3yh,Feeling stuck but ready to pivot ,"I’m a 27y F and have been working in digital advertising since graduating college. I got my degree in business and landed in advertising by coincidence. I have never loved my job but I also have never hated it which is what has been the reason I haven’t done much to change my situation. My job currently has a ton of flexibility (fully remote) and has been the reason I’ve been able to travel and move freely for the last few years. I haven’t seen much development within the role I’m in (minimal pay increases and no promotions) which has motivated me to potentially start looking for a new job. As I have begun exploring new positions I’m realizing advertising (especially working in an operations role) does not excite me and I think I’m too young to be feeling this way. I’m frequently feeling bored and disinterested and want to feel like I’m making more of an impact. 

I’m incredibly lost on what my next steps should be. I’m a very driven, hardworking and a passionate person about the things I love and feel that many of my largest strengths are related to interpersonal skills. I’m super open minded on what to do next, I’m willing to pivot entirely, go back to school, etc. but I’m overwhelmed by possibilities. I want a career not just a job.

1ftvnp4,How to find a path?,"Hello all. I've been deeply struggling with finding a career path, and I'm not sure where to go from here.

  
I've just turned 23. I've been on and off with college over the last 4 years, and worked various odd jobs--mostly pizza delivery (it pays the bills). I'm technically enrolled in university at the moment, but I couldn't afford to keep going (and frankly, I'm not sure I wanted to go back anyways), so I'm currently on a leave of absence with the intent of going to work full time. I previously worked in residential construction for a few months and my current plan is to try and get back into it, albeit I don't believe I want to do it long-term. I do love all things residential though, so I'm hoping carpentry could be a stepping stone, if I manage to make that work.

  
I'm creative, and highly detail-oriented. During my last stint in carpentry, I often got sent to jobsites to do touch-ups, adjustments, and all sorts of random things that the other apprentices weren't good at. I do genuinely enjoy highly detailed work--I'm also a certified graphic designer, and lately I've been teaching myself CAD software (which has been going very well). Long term I do genuinely think something like interior design or architecture could be a good career for me, or if I want to be more hands on, something like cabinetry or woodworking. I'm good at these kinds of things, although the trouble is actually getting into them. I'd love to get work as an apprentice or laborer somewhere like a wood mill or cabinetry shop to start, but I have no idea how I'd even begin to inquire about a job, much less sell myself to them. I have lots of soft skills, but don't feel like any of them are particularly useful in earning me work.

  
So I guess my question is, how do I pick which direction to go? And once I do, how do I set out on that road? I've had no luck so far in my endeavors to get a job as a carpenter again, and other work experiences in the past have typically gone very poorly for me. I'm always worried about making the wrong choice and landing in a shit job again. I don't need the best job in the world or anything--just something that's somewhat fulfilling and supports me (and my future family).

  
TL;DR: College went poorly, and my past jobs suck. I like houses, and I am really good at detail oriented work.

1ftvjnv,Please tell me what to say to my boss who is beating a dead horse,"Hello.

Okay, for context, I work in events management, so my job is a lot of running around and trying to balance that with behind the desk admin time. The higher up you get, the more admin and less physical work you do. I am on a team of four — one coordinator, a line manager, an executive manager, and a director. I am the coordinator, and the director works in the US so she is pretty hands off. It's mainly me and my line manager handling the day to day, and the exec manager handling the week to week and overseeing. My line manager is new. for a year it was just me and the exec manager with no one in the middle. I took on a lot of responsibilities to make it work. 

My line manager came into the job a couple months ago and took half of the responsibilities off my hands, but our job is so ad-hoc and on the go that me and my old line manager would essentially just do whatever needed doing to get the job done. sometimes i'd do something that was 'meant' for him, and he'd do something that was 'meant' for me, just so it'd be done. We'd thank each other and move on. This new manager, though, reprimands me every time i step outside of my responsibilities, and essentially tells me to keep my hands off of his work. This has led to a pretty hostile work environment where I don't want to step on any toes, and end up walking on eggshells. 

Having worked over capacity for basically a year, I am burnt out, exhausted, and over it. My new manager and my exec manager have gotten very buddy buddy and essentially iced me out — every single thing I do is wrong to them. Anyway, I had enough and handed in my notice. I have 3 weeks left at the job. 
We are *very* busy at the minute. Which means I am doing a lot of running around, as my line manager has decided he does not want to do any of the physical work, only the desk work, which means all of the previous work me and my old line shared is now on my shoulders. My line asks me constantly to action email tasks — my desk is next to his and he knows I am not there because I am doing physical work — and today, he reprimanded me and scheduled a disciplinary for not doing tasks exactly when they are assigned, so he keeps having to double check that they have been done at the end of the day. And, to be transparent, many things have been slipping through the cracks for a while on my end because I am burnt out and over capacity. I have told both of my managers this and also mentioned it when I quit. I do everything that needs to be done as quickly as possible, but I am slammed back to back every single day — haven't had a lunch break in months and always leave an hour late.
He has never managed anybody before, by the way. He has also never read my job description or responsibilities — he has told me as much. 

Apologies for the long wall of text; here's the question: what do I say in this meeting?
Here's the honest truth: things are slipping through the cracks because I am exhausted, I am disengaged, I do not care about the job anymore, I have three weeks left until I never work there again, I have resentment toward the team as I am constantly under pressure, stressed and anxious, like, 24/7. I've broken down at work enough times. 
I can't really say these things because I want a good reference — at least not in these words. How do i professionally say these things, and 'eat a dick, get off my back, I have literally already quit *what else do you want*', without saying them? The question posed will be ""what can I do to help you action things as soon as I assign them?"" I've already asked for a reduced workload, for an understanding of my daily capacity, he doesn't actually care. He's asking to make me feel small and so he can feel powerful — he's asking to rub it in. He's that kind of guy. Let me remind you — I have literally already quit this job.

I've been dealing with a sudden chronic health condition affecting me and my brother that is draining my savings, and I need help finding another job. I've been trying and working hard, but just keep getting rejected. I wanted someone to help me with ideas of whether I'm not qualified enough for the jobs I'm applying for.

- BA in Psychology
- MS in Technical Writing
- 4 years at a digital media startup 
- Experience writing and editing short and long form articles
- Experience teaching undergraduate students beginner English composition and beginner technical writing

What I'm doing so far:
- Reached final round for a local science writer position 
- Starting USCB's Copyediting certificate in January 
- Working on earning CELTA to teach English as a second language
- Working on starting a blog to generate more up-to-date samples
- Working on Google certificates in Project Management and Data Analysis 
- Applying to entry level positions without graduate level degree on resume
- Living at home, so not paying rent 
- Applying to teach English overseas for a short period of time 

Do you guys have any other ideas of what I could be doing to make myself stand out as a candidate? I am also willing to look for further education elsewhere, because maybe the issue is that I'm just not skilled enough to hire vs using AI. I was looking at short-term programs like ultrasound technician or HVAC, but am not sure if I'm not thinking clearly here. 

Sorry, I know that I'm approaching this naively, but wanted to get some feedback on what I might change for some better results. You can be harsh. Thank you!

1fttmoz,Sinking ship,"I’ve posted here before about how my company hasn’t paid FTEs (small team) our check that was due on August 7th - for work done at the end of July. Our GM has been asking about the missing check weekly and the CEO rarely responds. 

We have received our other checks since then - mostly on time. Maybe 1-2 days late. 

The company is obviously in a bad position. I’m awaiting an offer letter for a position I recently interviewed for. But I won’t be able to onboard until end of October. 

Two people, holding key positions, tendered resignation today - with today being their last day. 

CEO reached out to me asking where my head is at, regarding the company. 

I definitely do not want to stay. Despite 4/10 FTE have left in the past couple of months - the company is so far in the hole that it’s unlikely raises would come anytime soon. 

I WOULD consider staying very part-time, just for the extra income. But I cannot rely on it for my full-time employment anymore. 

I feel like I have some leverage here, as CEO cannot really afford to lose any more employees right now. We are all long time employees (5+ years) and CEO is brand new to company (less than 1 year). I’m heading several projects + managing all social media/blog posts + covering some customer support responsibilities. 

I was going to respond -

“With the recent resignations, I’m curious to hear your thoughts on how you see my role evolving within the company. While I’m committed to my current responsibilities and the remaining team, I do have other opportunities I’m considering, which may influence my availability for additional tasks.”

Am I shooting myself in the foot for mentioning that I have other opportunities in considering?

1ftshaw,Phone or email to ask for a reference,"Hi there! I am jumping back into job searching for the first time in a while. It's been a while since I last reached out to my former supervisor. I am pretty confident they would be happy to serve as a reference for me, but I intend to ask before listing them. My question is: is it better to request to schedule a quick phone call to catch up and ask over the phone? Or would an email be more normal? I haven't spoken to them since I left the job nearly 3 years ago, apart from a small back and forth over email around the holidays. I live far away now, so grabbing coffee isn't really an option.

1ftscki,Career in Supply Chain management,"I was originally planning to pursue a Master's in Digital Marketing after completing my BBA in Marketing (2024) from a local university in my country. However someone close to me recommended that Supply Chain Management (SCM) offers more job opportunities, especially in the States, where I may move in the future. I also have a genuine interest in it. Now, I'm going to study in London and considering a Master's or MBA in SCM instead.

1fts2x4,Stuck at a field,"I moved to an EU country 2 years ago. Prior to it, I had 10years experience in the building industry and for the last 3 years I was a product manager - originally an architect.
In my previous job, R&D was something we didn't focus on, because company never wanted to invest in it, didn't hire designers and their primary goal was to get fast results mainly by copying market leaders. While working in my previous job as a product manager, I got fed up due to being the middle man between the production and sales/management. The product that I was managing wasn't on high demand and never sold in high volumes, so it was like a small side dish next to the cash cow product. That's why pushing sales to sell it and as well as convincing management to do tests or hire professionals for the product's improvement was almost impossible.
My new job is also in building industry and more technical (R&D) which I like. When I started, I was assigned with a senior developer to make drawings of a new product. Few months later, I got an offer from my manager if I would like to switch to a sub-department that has more of a safety aspect. I was excited because it involved more field work and testing rather than making drawings and on-site learning seemed intriguing. Fast forward to 1 year later, the product manager that I was working with, left the company and a new senior developer was hired. In the meantime, there is no development project left in this dept currently and doesn't seem so for the future. The only shitload of work are drawings and documentation, which doesn't satisfy me at all. Talked with my manager and was told if I can finish these current pile of tasks; by January, I can start being involved with development projects. I am just trying to finish the work that I'm supposed to do, but it doesn't seem like I can cut clear from it so soon. Looks like it will take 6 months or so... I regret my decision to switch to this sub-department and although I learned a lot, I don't want to stay in it which also makes the time spent kind of worthless.",Aliceinanutshell,1,1.0,0,1727799552,2024-10-01 16:19:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fts2x4/stuck_at_a_field/,10,2024

1ftr08c,I am stuck at my job,"I (20, F) currently work as an administrator at a brokerage firm. In the past few months, I have started to really not like it. My job duties and tasks themselves are not bad and I usually enjoy doing them, but sitting at a desk every single day for 8 hours a day is starting to drive me insane. 

I currently take classes for my associate’s degree online. When I started these classes in 2023, I enrolled for the tuition reimbursement through my job. The rule is you have to stay at the job for 3 years after your last reimbursement check or else you have to pay it all back. I am on my last term of school and got my last reimbursement check a couple weeks ago, and total my job has reimbursed me about $9,000, so I would have to pay that all back if I quit before this time in 2027.

Since I’ve started feeling this deep hatred for my job, I’ve started to feel like I’m in the wrong field. I’ve taken countless career tests and things of that sort, and they all point to different fields than what I am currently in. I would love to change my degree and go for something different for a bachelor’s but I don’t think I can afford that either.

Basically, all in all, I hate my job and I’m essentially stuck at it until September 2027 unless I want to go absolutely broke and tank my credit trying to pay them back. Also, as I said earlier, I would love to change my degree but I simply cannot afford that either. I’m looking for advice on how to stop hating my job so much, or really any advice anyone could give me. I hate feeling stuck and I really hate the situation I am in.

1ftqw2c,Let my boss know I needed some PTO (4 hours) Thursday….,"I don’t think this falls under the advice as much as vent.  I’m almost positive I’m not the only person this happens to.  It is definitely something that will have me looking for something else.

I work in enterprise sales and am 100 percent remote.  This morning after our team meeting I asked my boss to hang back.  I him know that my son has a small field trip this Thursday, my sister had originally planned to go as his para (son has Down syndrome, high functioning but still needs a para or someone with him).   Regardless, I told my boss I would be taking 3 to 4 hours off to go.  I could call the school but hate having them rush ti find a para that can go.  

I’m also a single full time dad and my son is 7.

Anyway, here is what absolutely makes me stop giving a shit about a company.  My boss proceeds to tell me “well, I will never say no to a request…. But you need to think about the previous month you had and where you are currently coming into this month.  It’s really your choice.” 

I responded with “so I want to be clear.  You will never say no to a request for PTO but instead hint that there will be consequences based on the decision that I make?  Also, when I was hired you explained that you understand family things come up and it’s not a big deal?”  The response was more of the same as the original answer to my request.  

Now, I have been here for 9 months.  Have not taken one day off aside from a dentist appointment over my lunch break.  My previous month in sales I finished at 55% due to a handful of deals either falling off or being pushed to this month.  My commit this month is well over quota and I am very confident I end well above.  

After this call with my boss I reached out to my old director who was awesome (I chased money for this role).  He said it was about time and they would love to have me back.  I also spent the last hour looking over linked it.  This type of bs way of managing just completely checked me out, at least for today.  

Sorry for the paper but I’m still annoyed.  I can’t be the only one….  If so, how did you handle it?

What is more frustrating is when those of us who are still around take these grievances to our leadership, they write our vexations off. I understand they have to drink the kool-aid.

1ftoslf,Advice Needed: Job Offer from Company B and Uncertainty with Company A,"NoI need your opinion. I'm applying for an accounting staff position.

I have a job offer from Company B (a hospital) for 12,800 PHP per month, and the commute is only 30 minutes from my house. They have given me a time frame until this week to make my final decision.

Company B pros:

30-minute commute

My two classmates from college also got jobs here in the same department.

If I get hired after the 6-month fixed contract, my salary will increase to 14,000 PHP. However, there is no HMO and no other benefits except the government-mandated ones.


The problem is that I'm still waiting for the job offer letter from Company A (a BPO company), which offers 18,000 PHP with a work-from-home setup. It's been a week since the HR said that I passed the interview and that they would like to offer me the position. I have followed up every three days, but the response is always the same: he is still waiting for the approval of the directors. He hasn't given me a timeline for when I will receive the offer letter.

Company A pros:

Work from home

Higher salary

Employee benefits include HMO, free university courses, and gym access.


I have this week to decide whether to accept the job offer at Company B, and I'm afraid that Company A will take months to send the offer letter.

Note: Both positions are 6-month fixed contracts.

Note: I am a fresh graduate. With December approaching, I need money for Christmas, and I have been unemployed for three months. I really want to accept the offer from Company A, but I'm afraid of being jobless for many more months.

1ftog7j,What’s the UK job market like currently?,"For the last 20 years or so I’ve kind of fallen into different roles by virtue of either promotions or knowing people. I’m now in a senior position within a small company which I joined 4 years ago. I know every company will look out for themselves first, but up until recently I thought this company was different. With this realisation, I feel that I’ve mentally checked out and need to make a move.

I guess the question is, imposters syndrome not withstanding, how easy is it to get a new job in the UK now? I’ve looked at the various job sites and if there’s one thing that frustrates me, it’s employers not putting salary ranges in. I’d like to think I know how much I’m worth and despite being in a small company I’m paid a reasonable wage. Obviously more money would be a good thing, but I can balance that out with the role so would be willing to look at opportunities that can offer something other than monetary terms.",mr_k_uk,1,1.0,1,1727790264,2024-10-01 13:44:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ftog7j/whats_the_uk_job_market_like_currently/,10,2024
1ftnzdb,Two Job Offers at Once,"I’ve been at my current job for about two years now, but some good opportunities came up and I managed to time it out so I have offers from two engineering firms. 

I told both of them I had a range of $105-115k. Company A offered $123k + 5% bonus ($129k total comp), which is higher than expected. 

Company B offered $110k, plus 20 + 9 holidays of PTO. Going from 15 to 20 days takes 8 years to do there, so I definitely appreciate starting with that. The recruiter knew I had another offer, so I just told him what it was. He gave out a light “oof” and that let me know that Company A’s offer is high for Company B role’s range, and it’s unlikely he’d be able to match that $120k range. I assured him their company was the one I preferred (maybe bad for negotiation), and that I wanted to see how close they could get. He then offered $115k which had to be approved. 

Personally, I’m pretty happy with this pay and I know  Company B aligns with my career goals better. They also allow you to charge straight pay overtime which Company A does not. Work life balance is better with Company B because it is a true hybrid schedule (two days at home) and a consistent commute when in the office. I’m also going to be licensed next year so that will give me a 5% automatic increase here, putting me at $120750. It’s for those reasons that I don’t really see a need to try to get any more money. 

With that being said, I wanted to see what others would have done differently as far as negotiating, or if you think I did what’s best for my career. You hear about these scenarios happening, but I never thought I’d be in one so soon. The recruiter for Company B is probably glad he only had to go up $5k, and I’m not sure it’s really worth trying to push for more, even though I am in a good position.

I’ve applied to a ton of jobs in my field but I rarely even get an interview, I think in part due to the lack of work experience.

A friend helped me get a job that is SOMEWHAT in the same field, but it’s a few steps removed and probably does not require any education at all.

I have people saying I should keep doing it, it looks good on my resume, it’s at least some form of job experience, it’s flexible, etc. However, I feel like it’s so far removed from the skills I have and really low pay, it doesn’t even make sense to use any of my time doing something like this, that I should just focus on school and/or finding a job that uses any of my skills at all.",DogRunningParty,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1727788446,2024-10-01 13:14:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ftnsg1/am_i_underpaid/,10,2024

1ftn573,"My story from being bombed in Ukraine, losing almost everything to becoming a nomad and fairly successful startup founder :)","I saw a post here about how hard this can be and thought to make another one saying it gets easier.

Honestly, telling my story about escaping Ukraine is still jarring. Please forgive me, I’d prefer not to go into details about the events that occurred or give intimate details of my life, but I’ll briefly write about it. I grew up there, It was the only home I knew and the only one I ever wanted to. At the time, the neighborhood we lived in was said to be safe, my family was not extremely worried, but we were wrong.

Next thing we knew the bombs were approaching our town and my family had to make impromptu(I mean very few hours in advance) plans to evacuate.

I found myself in a foreign country, living in a hotel, nothing to my family’s name and our money was quickly running out. We were desperate and I was a grown man at that time, I had to start making money. I have always been fascinated with tech and tech-related things, ever since I was a toddler (literally) and had been working for a corporation at the time. A few months in, I decided I was going to start creating software and do my own thing, leaving the workforce.

And so, with my little savings, I started my own organization. A few months in, I brought in some hires and have grown even more since then. I'm not a gazillionaire, but we make good earnings. Being essentially thrown out of my country, I suddenly felt like I didn't belong anywhere. I didn't have a home, and as my company grew, I felt the urge to visit more places -bring some meaning into this world and life. I never willingly elected to become a founder and nomad, I was forced. I say that I’m a digital nomad, but if you really asked me, I’d tell you I wish I was back home, running my company from there.

Regardless, I’m more than grateful to be alive, my family is safe, my company’s growth is extensive, I found my love, and I've been to some pretty incredible places. I’m not sure why I felt the need to ‘reveal’ all this, but I suppose there are many other people who are or have been where I once was. Lost, confused, hurt, but determined.

1ftmfz6,I'm sick of being a Web Developer...,"Hi guys, just needed somewhere to rant. I am a Frontend (FE) dev for a company in NZ, but I work from home from another country. I recently graduated a year ago, and this was my first job after I graduated. I started as a full stack dev, but with a bigger focus on Backend (BE) stuff which is where im passionate at. We handle around 2 or more projects everyday.

Cut to few months later the senior FE quit. No one else  could do the FE, and since I was the one who had the most experience I had to pick up the slack and handle bigger and more complex FE work than I expected. I eventually got better but along the way, but I also got sick of handling pixel perfect stuff, office politics, a workflow that had flaws and most importantly the owner, who is so critical of everything and wants to micromanage every single thing.

I used to have a neutral stance on FE, i didn't particularly love or hate it, I just can do it. But being thrown into the frying pan immediately, just made me miserable and now I'm always anxious about getting called in Slack being chewed out on another thing. Its funny but anything that resembles the Slack notif sound or ringtone, puts me on immediate edge. 

I want to get out, but the pay is decent and I currently am the breadwinner and supporting my parents. I've applied to other local companies but either I'm left in the air or the pay is not enough. I don't know what to do now, since I've really lost all my passion in FE and I want to go to InfoSec or BE or Cloud, but companies in my country usually don't train you for it especially InfoSec.

1ftj7b6,Best next step? Leave job / switch jobs / try something else?,"Hi All,

I work as a product manager for a decent sized startup. It's a hybrid setup but my entire team is and all stakeholders are based in other countries, so I don't get to to meet them physically. Been in this job for around 1 year and 2 months.

PROS of the job:

1. Not a lot of post office hour pings/calls etc.

2. The pressure is not exorbitant. The usual pressure of managing stakeholder (ops/tech/business etc.) expectations and  too many meetings that come with the PM job.

3. Manager is pretty decent and rational.

CONS of the job:

1. A lot of stakeholders to manage (and meetings to attend) which leaves little time for doing any good work.

2. Lack of any physical interaction with team/stakeholders means that the relationaship building has been non-existent (this has helped me a lot in previous jobs where a good, amicable relationship with key business stakeholders helps deal witht he pressure)

3. The work is uninteresting and I don't find the industry or the problem statements interesting either.

Problems that I am facing since last 2-3 months:

1. I lack any motivation to start work every morning. I feel sad/anxious every morning, thinking about the upcoming meetings, stakeholder interactions etc.

2. This has also lead to some health issues as well, like I start binge eating etc. to not think about the work in that moment and deal with it later, which amplifies the anxiety when I actually have to deal with it.

3. My work also suffers which adds on to the problem as I feel that I am doing a bad job making it all the more difficult to face stakeholders/manager etc.

What do you folks suggest I do next?

1. Keep drudging through the job and start looking out for something else (I don't know yet what kind of job willl not cause these issues :/)

2. Quit and take a break for a few months (can financially afford to take a break for a few months based on current savings)

3. Any tips on how can I find something that I might like (or atleast don't feel like crap every morning) or tolerate doing?

1fti9zo,How do I transition into Product Management? After an MBA and Tech Experience.,"Disclaimer: This post isn't about me venting or complaining about not having a PM role. I’m not even posting this to land a job. I just want to share my background and the steps I’ve taken, hoping for some guidance or insights from those with experience. Thank you in advance!

I recently graduated from one of the better IIMs (best business schools in India) and landed a well-paying role at an IT company. However, the position is in pre-sales, which I don’t enjoy at all. Before my MBA, I worked as a software engineer for four years, including at a small product-based company where I had the chance to work directly with a PM. That experience sparked my interest in pursuing product management as a career.

During my MBA, I was fortunate enough to learn from a visiting faculty member who was an ex-IIMA grad (Best business school in the entire country) and an industry veteran in product management. His insights were incredibly inspiring, and he even mentioned I was his best student, which is something I’m really proud of. Due to the macroeconomic situation, I wasn’t too selective during placements, and I have no regrets. But now, I want to shift towards PM roles because I fear being pigeonholed into pre-sales.

Here’s some relevant experience I bring to the table:

1. I launched a business with my sister focused on handcrafted products, handling website design, the roadmap, and more.
2. During my work experience before the MBA, I worked at a product company where I was responsible for the full cycle of developing features, from research to launch.
3. I have hands-on programming experience from my software engineering days.
4. I’m very strong with data and confident in my design sense.

Here’s what I’ve already tried to find PM opportunities (aside from applying directly):

1. I’ve spoken to people I already know—unfortunately, that didn’t pan out.
2. I’ve cold-messaged product leaders on LinkedIn, but that hasn’t yielded results either.
3. I’ve reached out to people via platforms like Topmate, but still no luck.

I live in Bangalore, have a strong engineering background, and graduated from one of the top engineering colleges here. Despite my experience and efforts, I’m finding it tough to secure an opportunity, which has been disappointing.

If anyone has any advice, I would really appreciate it. Thanks again!",MousseMelodic9911,1,1.0,0,1727767179,2024-10-01 07:19:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fti9zo/how_do_i_transition_into_product_management_after/,10,2024

1ftew28,Career Path?,"Soooo....here I am at 26 years old and still living with my parents. I'm currently working a 9-5 making decent money, but it's not something I want to do for the rest of my life and not an ideal path to succeed. I dropped out of college a year ago and decided to start working my 9-5 to get some income. Like I said, I'm getting burnt out. I'm sick of living with my parents. I'm sick of living where I do now. And that's why I'm here for some advice.

I don't have much money saved, roughly 15k to work with. I'm willing to move away, and I'm open to careers in which you'd be traveling. Ideally, I'd like to move somewhere warm/hot, I'm trying to stay away from the snow/cold. I'd be willing to do pretty much anything, as long as the money is right. Feel free to also mention an area in which you'd recommend someone who's trying to find themselves and may have a lot of opportunities for success. 

As far as experience goes, this is what I've got that may be useful

1ftetpf,Considering rejoining the workforce after running my own business for many years,"I've run my own business full-time for over 10 years. Have grown and shrunk it. I've been steadily stepping back from it recently and am considering getting back into the workforce. 
My conundrum is that I am not sure if I should continue with what I have my degree in. 
I have a graphic design degree and I have worked in a few different graphics and web design/development environments including government contractors, small design firms, and print shops.
My small business is creating/modifying designs and selling them on things I craft/print on. I've done over a million in sales but I don't plan to fully stop making and selling with the business or attempting to sell it. 
I have had as many as 4 employees working under me directly.
I also teach regularly at a local MakerSpace, primarily printing, graphics, and leatherworking.
I don't particularly want to do graphics for work again. It drains all my enjoyment of my creative work. 
I previously did a lot of web development, but the times change too fast and I just don't feel comfortable diving into it again. 
I live in the suburb of a big city, so quite a lot of big companies and government contractors. 
I would like to find something reactive that will keep me busy on shift, but not follow me home in the evening. I'm ok with down time and intense busy times. 
I would prefer something I can work hybrid or remote. I have been working from home for so many years as it is. 
I like the idea of a tech support position, I'm good with computers and printers and don't find that boring. 
I like the idea of jobs that are specific to a company, so most employees have to be trained up regardless of their experience history. 
Maybe some form of project manager? 
What types of jobs should I look for? Keywords to search? Maybe certs to work on?
I'm considering starting the search now and working on getting some certs. Need to get my resume up and running again, it's been a while since I needed one.   
I'm also ok with part-time work as long as the pay is worthwhile. But would like somewhere with good retirement benefits ideally.

1ften0q,Advice for finding a career?,"Well, I’m approaching the age of being expected to have my sh!t completely figured out- and I don’t at all. 

I have an opportunity where I can spend a little while living rent free with a family member, but I don’t want to just work a dead end job, I’d like to build skills that could help me attain a solid career in the future if possible. 

However, I have a few setbacks that have led me to look for some sort of online courses that may allow to earn experience or perhaps a certificate in a field, but nothing really comes to mind besides IT (which I’m not against).

My main setback is that I live in the middle of nowhere, literally over an hour away from the nearest town (I regrettably don’t own my own vehicle either), and the nearest town isn’t a big town by any means. The best employment you can count on in town is something like McDonald’s or Walmart (not that there’s anything wrong with those, I just don’t want to be a longtime/lifetime Walmart employee). I also don’t have a college degree, unfortunately my family wasn’t fortunate enough to support me in that regard. To top it off, my work history is almost entirely dead end, low paying jobs. Nothing particularly longterm or impressive on my resume. 

With all that said, are there any programs or courses I could study in to help me get some sort of degree/certificate/expertise in a field that may give me an advantage to finding longterm, gainful employment? I understand I’d have to pay for these courses, which is fine, but, I can’t afford to get into college at the moment as I’m not only saving for a car, I also have a bit of medical debt. Am I better off just living very frugally and trying to find something better in town whenever I get a little more solid ground under my feet?

1ftdymo,Whose responsibility is it to have procedures updated ?,"I have worked in a large bank previously where procedures were updated annually. This is pushed by risk and control department and then put into a blueworks flow chart and procedures saved to a database. 

At my new job, I continuously asked for procedures while learning deliverables I had to perform daily, monthly, etc. Many of these were very older dating back over 2 years and not in line with what we due process wise for these deliverables. Sometimes it was entirely outdated where I had to rely on notes while someone trained me. It’s a much smaller company and I understand they don’t have a risk and control department pushing this. 

Recently, the team has been asked for everyone to update every procedure and it is split up for a few per person. It’s no problem to update these especially if you own a deliverable. The issue is there are now pushing deadlines for these to be done and said if we don’t get them complete (there’s a matrix to see who is updating which procedures) that it will affect our annual review negatively. I don’t think this should affect me in an annual review as a lot of the deliverables were in place before I joined and in my mind, should fall to a manager position to ensure they do get updated timely. I am not saying employees should put forth effort to update as well but when your procedure is aging by more than 2 years, this can’t me a team members fault who sits lower on the totem pole.

1ftdotc, How bad would it be to say I’ve worked somewhere longer than I have ?,"
Long story short I went to college late I graduated 6 months ago and took the first supply chain related job I was offered in my last week of school. 

As a buyer the pay is terrible and there is no room for advancement it’s an extremely small company. Turnover is really high. The position I’m in had 7 different people fired or quit before me. 

I have been here for 6 months. And have learned all I can from this specific position. The stuff I purchase is extremely niche and won’t carry over to any other industry. ( I know when it comes to supply chain I’m a green horn and have so much to learn) but for this position I really mean it after month 1 it was all routine and nothing has changed. 

Work environment is extremely toxic. I’ve been working 10 years I know not a long time. But it’s the first time I’m wanting to leave a job because of toxicity and nothing else. 

My question is how bad would it be to list on my resume that I’ve worked here for a year instead of 6 months. I’m going to put the don’t contact employer when applying to jobs. 

The way I see it I have 4 options. 

1.Stay here another 6 months to a year and get a night job to pay my bills since I’m struggling with just the pay from this job. and apply to other jobs once I’ve hit the 1 year and a half mark. 

2.Leave out this job from my resume have my resume as a “fresh” college grad to explain the lack of experience in the supply chain industry. I have other job experience but not supply chain related. 

3. Put that I’ve been here for a year or 2 to help my chances in getting interviews. 

4.just put the time I’ve been here and hope a company doesn’t see it as a red flag that I’m leaving after 6 months.

There is no way up from here and I'm hungry for more in terms of challenges and growth/responsibility. Recently there has been a strong shift in moving towards becoming more corporate and stricter with procedures which caused us all to suffer productivity wise and slow down. Additionally, micro-management is being introduced EOY in terms of tracking everything we do (which is a red flag for me personally). ""If there's no trust I don't want to work here"". 

I've recently started working in a fractional technical director role elsewhere and found it incredibly fulfilling. While it pays very little currently, there's room for growth both in skillset, responsibility and money down the road. My gut tells me to do these in parallel while I let it grow OR alternatively find another main sysadmin gig that would give me the responsibility and eventually the pay I want while doing my fractional role...

Both are remote.

I went into the interview not sure what to expect, it’s for a smaller competitor than I used to work for but I know they have a stronger presence in my industry. The interviewer started by saying he saw the company I worked for previously and decided to take the interview because he was ‘intrigued’. He was grilling me on what exactly my old employer taught me, alluding to the fact he thought they didn’t teach me much of anything. I was stumbling because he was asking me what kind of conferences they sent me to, what exposure I had with the major suppliers in the industry, etc, and the honest answer is that my old employer just didn’t provide those opportunities. He cut me off saying “you don’t need to be nervous, I’m asking you because I know they didn’t provide those opportunities”. Then he told me a story about how he grilled the CEO of my old employer at a public round table and they don’t get along very well. I said “look, I know the reputation of that employer and I suffered a lot of their inadequacies. My experience clearly shows that I made the best out of my time there and I stayed knowing I needed the experience and years in the field to further my career for my next role”. 

He kept grilling me on weird questions that weren’t directly about my experience in the field, he was only trying to figure out what I don’t know and didn’t care about any of my tangible success. He kept calling me “green”, despite having a, quite frankly, very successful track record. 

He then told my headhunter that he likes me because he can mold me and help me grow in this field, ‘take me under his wing’ were his exact words. Yes I know people don’t like headhunters but mine has seriously helped me and I don’t have any complaints. But what I don’t like about this situation is that this interviewer had a preconceived judgement about me because of my old employer, had no interest in what I actually do know and can do, and maybe seemed a bit egotistical. Is this a good assessment, should I tell him no thank you based off our interaction? Are these red flags or am I thinking too much into it?

I just don’t understand if I should stick around or not ",Equivalent_Lab_1886,1,1.0,1,1727741105,2024-10-01 00:05:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ftanv6/automotive_lube_technician_and_could_really_use/,10,2024
