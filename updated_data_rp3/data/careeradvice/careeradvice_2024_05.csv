1d59vws,Finding work after being unemployment yes for a couple years,"I’ve been battling pretty severe depression that took me out of the workforce for a couple of years and need help finding a job that pays me about $60k a year in the Denver area.

I have 2 years of work experience (a year in B2B sales and a year as a financial customer service rep). I have a degree in applied math and economics as well as minors in data science and computer science. 

I have been thinking of analytics or software engineering given my background but am not even sure where to begin. 

I am open to any suggestions and am really just hoping for ideas on where to start.

1d59fv8,I think I suck at my job and don't know what to do?,"I hate that I suck at my job.

I mean this, it isn't fully imposter syndrome.

The job is an admin assistant. I've been here for about a year and a few months. Since I've been in this position, there's been transitions everywhere and constant change. My boss is incredible and supportive and the rest of my team members are awesome people. 
I'm constantly making mistakes, forgetting steps (sometimes important ones), spending too much time on a task, and eventually just dropping things from my task list, etc. My desk and laptop are so unorganized right now. I don't feel like I have time to mindlessly chitchat with folks because I'm so behind in my email and other projects. I do have ADHD but the main ""blame"" is because I had a concussion before this job that has left me with daily chronic migraines. I am seeing a neurologist for these and it's so much of a wait and see game. 

I've not had a performance review with my boss. Partly because they're a very busy person that attends other meetings and partly because I haven't asked for one. I think they'd tell me if something was off and they want me to perform better in a certain area but I also don't know for certain. I did get another huge responsibility and project added to my plate and while I'm excited about it, I'm also dreading how busy I'm going to be.

I just feel so terrible. I wish I could be better at my job. I'm sure part of it is me being hard on myself but the other bit is eating at me. I'm supposed to be someone that the team can depend on and so often, I can't. I really like this job and care about it, but I feel like I suck at it and I feel like everyone knows. I've tried various ideas and solutions for staying organized. I've thought of ideas to help me remember steps I need to follow but I don't have time to implement them or make the things that would help me (I'm hourly). I've signed up for an email from the Assist (I don't find it all that useful). I don't know where to go from here.

How much time do I give to the job before job searching for another fit? I'm positive there are other people that can do this better than me. One of my coworkers thought I was 23 and no, I'm actually 32 (probably because I'm so quiet dealing with the migraines and focusing on other work-related shit).

So any tips or suggestions or questions or advice would be super helpful in helping me generate ideas or just processing this. Thanks for everything.",-epm,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1717198512,2024-05-31 23:35:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d59fv8/i_think_i_suck_at_my_job_and_dont_know_what_to_do/,5,2024
1d58x4z,Why did people ghost me after they said they would help me? ,"I hope everyone in job hunting is doing well.

These days, I am trying to introspect how I work with those in the workplace.

I asked some former colleagues to refer me to their friends whenever they saw the new position so that I could talk directly to the hiring manager, but I haven't received a response. I don't know why they told me they knew someone and could introduce me to them when I needed them. 

When I wrote the post on LinkedIn, someone called me and gave me some advice. He asked me to send my resume to him as he was willing to share it with a headhunter he knew (he is the CEO of my previous job). He said let's talk again the following week, but I didn't receive a response when I contacted him.  He might think I was not worth it to provide that kind of help cause I didn't look that smart, or he felt I didn't need his help.  

So, my conclusion is I was not good, and they wanted to look nice and keep their reputation but didn't want to spend their time. I think this time is a good time to identify how others consider me and who is a jerk.

1d58wer,Advice on experience with colleague?,"I posted something about this recently, deleted it because I liked the advice I got, but realized I want to hear some more opinions. 

Recently, I shut down during an interaction with someone of higher rank who was explaining tasks for me to do. The person was saying it differently than others I work with, who explain things like “here’s a goal, here are ways to achieve it, or “will you please etc” and this person was barking orders. It’s mostly this person’s personality, and I don’t think they intended to make me feel terrible, small and incompetent. Because of it, I was shut off in the convo. I didn’t say much, I had closed in body language, didn’t make much eye contact, and I was walking back with them in silence and got “out of their way” when they were walking behind me because they were walking faster, and they said “oh no you’re fine” and I was just quiet. I could’ve handled it better by asking them to slow down, taking a break, or just processing it afterward. I like this person, despite some small interactions that weren’t great (like constantly slamming their door right next to me, standing in a doorway not making space for me to pass, etc) but I figure it’s just their habits, and I’ve looked past it. I’m concerned this person walked away from the situation thinking that I didn’t want to do the tasks, because I mentioned in the convo how much I appreciated delegating the tasks in the past. I also said it allowed me to focus on tasks that develop my career. I only brought that up because the person came across controlling/domineering and I didn’t feel like I’d have the option anymore. After this, I saw the person with a higher up that they are best friends with and tell everything to. I feel like I need to clear the air but it means bringing up why I responded the way I did. I like this job and feel like I’ve messed up.  Suggestions?

1d58cdq,My extended resume history isn't.... good... is it better to just not list work history at all on LinkedIn?,"It's not really my fault but I lost 3 jobs in a row due to air-borne chemicals and being physically unfit to work some jobs. I was filling out a LinkedIn and it seems like some interviewers really have dug into me based on my past history. Some were even asking ""It says you were a rancher 10 years ago, what were you doing for 7 years between then and the first job you have listed?"" Like damn, lady, I have no clue, I was in my early 20s and stupid. But anyways, yeah, since the beginning of 2023 I have had like 6 different jobs.

Is it better just to delete my work history on LinkedIn until I perhaps get a good career that I can fill this stuff out with? Last 3 jobs? Just don't say anything at all?

1d56h5q,Interview follow up,"Hi, I know similar questions have been asked before but this one is sort of a tricky situation 

I applied to an intern position for this summer. Obviously since summer has already started, it seemed like the company was looking to hire ASAP. I was given an online skills test and then an interview within a few days. 

I followed up with the recruiter a week from the interview and was advised that the lead engineer for the organization would return from break “next week” and that “things were moving”. I was also informed that I was one of the top 3 candidates and was given some follow up legal questions (work authorization, dates etc.)

It’s been a week since the follow up email (two weeks since the interview). Should I send another follow up email or wait to hear back?

I don’t want to be pushy but I will also have to make travel and accommodation arrangements which will likely be expensive and tough to find last minute

1d56f5k,Rent free should I quit my Corpjob?,"Burnt out from my corporate job. Been here for a little over 2 years now. No sign of advancement in my role. Can’t stand the office environment or my coworkers. Have been humiliated and retaliated against when I asked for additional support in my role. I’m irritated and overwhelmed every day. I have to drag myself into work. My sparkle and shine have been dulled by these people.

Mom offered me one of her units. Rent free for a year. It’s a very nice place. However, I feel terrible accepting that offer. I even paid for my own uni tuition because I know how hard she works. I feel like such a brat even making this post because I know her sacrifice.

I had been applying while employed and almost got close to landing it, but it didn’t pan out. During this time I had to juggle my full time job, getting home, submitting applications, editing resumes etc. and then finding a way to schedule the multiple rounds of interviews around my work day because obviously recruiters work during the same hours I do. Not getting the offer was so disappointing because of the amount of bs I had to do to even be able to apply/focus/prep/schedule interviews. I can’t imagine putting myself through all that again while employed so that I can find another job. I have no idea how everyone else does it.

Anyway- should I take my mom’s offer? I could live rent free while applying? I’m technically still entry level. 2 years experience. 

OR. Should I take a day off to decompress, reel back in my energy, & give it another shot?

I currently work remotely as a research analyst and make 75k a year, there’s a job for the state I’m interviewing at that is hybrid and could net me around 90k. Do you think it’s a good idea to make the jump? The trade-off is being hybrid now instead of remote.

now. It certainly feels like fully remote jobs seem much more competitive now.

1d5555j,Advice on dealing with workplace cliques.,"The company I work at is a Series C tech startup, and we’ve recently hit 150 employees. Within the company, there are about 20-25 influential “OGs” who are very close to the co-founders. Most of this core group is in the product/R&D teams, while I am part of the marketing team. As a product marketer, I frequently collaborate with different departments.

However, I’m finding it challenging to collaborate with the product/R&D team. They aren’t open to questions or discussions, and there’s a sense that because I’m not highly technical, I’m not considered knowledgeable. Additionally, there’s an internal clique, and when we go to team dinners or out for drinks, it’s clear there’s some ostracizing happening. It often feels like high school, and it’s been really draining.

I have a great relationship with the CMO, who I report directly to, and I’ve worked with her for years. She’s very busy, and I hesitate to bring this issue to her. Honestly, I’ve started considering other roles because working with this group has been so discouraging.

1d54bnq,Advise on leaving current job for new one?,Currently I work at a corporate owned automotive shop and this has been my first job since high school (started in 2018). I’m planning to leave for a new job to start a new career that’s better paying (planning on starting as an apprentice in a different trade through a union). Since this is the first time I quit for a new job I know it’s important that I land the new job and have a starting date before I give my final days at my current work place but I feel like I should let my manager know at least maybe a month in advance that I am planning to leave for a new job and explain my reasons to him if he asks. I know it sounds like the wrong thing to do because I risk getting fired sooner but I just don’t see him doing that to me. I’ve been here for many years and other mechanics that have been hired in the past years come and go quick (they all have quit )I’m pretty much the last one that has stuck here for the most time. So me getting replaced as soon as I tell him is unlikely because no one wants to work for the pay they’re offering (which is why I’m leaving). The other workers that have quit usually just stop showing up and it would really upset my manager because he would say “why don’t they just give me few days or weeks notice” since it affects our schedules. There’s only been like one or two workers that did give their two weeks notice and they did work until their final day but they didn’t find someone to fill their position till like 5 months later. We are currently short staffed so me leaving will impact everyone else’s schedules and that’s why I want to give a heads up.I don’t talk to him as much but I get along with him as an employee and he considers me one of the top workers in the shop. The only time he has kind of given me a hard time was when I asked for a raise a few years ago because it was going to affect the salary budget he was working with but I did end up getting it and then 2 times I’ve called off this year for being sick he’s told me if I feel better then to try to come in (he usually calls after he realizes I’m not coming in to tell me he put in a sick day for me). So should I give him a month in advance that I’m leaving soon or just wait to give him the two weeks notice.,ozzyp2jz,2,1.0,3,1717184634,2024-05-31 19:43:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d54bnq/advise_on_leaving_current_job_for_new_one/,5,2024

1d52ta9,Worth to move away from my homestead for a higher level job?,"Hi everybody. I've been working in the cannabis industry for 8 years, 7 of them in California. The last two in CA as a manager of a small farm. 

After moving to another state where cannabis had just become legal, I was just looking for a job, I couldn't find any higher job offerings than Cultivation Agent near me. In the interview I talked about my experience and my knowledge not just in cannabis but also in horticulture, living soils and I'm also lab tech for microbiology soil assessments. They seemed exited and promised me something better than just a regular position. Similar things happened in thw two farms I worked at. 

Promises were empty. Leads, supervisors tried to belittle me. Managers seemed scared of me knowing things they didn't know, which I didn't understand why they didn't utilize me instead of pushing me away. I also realized how little experience and knowledge most people, including cultivation managers have compared to me and I get it, it's a new market, but they pushed me down, never come to talk to me about anything and almost treating me like they don't want me to know what they are doing. In the last farm the manager told me several times I'm gonna be a big part of the living soil project because it's new for them. They wanted me to asses the soil, decide amendments, etc. Then no word day after day and one day I hear other people talking about how they are already working in that area and nobody has come to talk to me yet and are keeping in the other side of the farm those days, which I was wondering why I wasn't with the rest of the people, but they put me to pull weeds from pots... I've never acted like I knew anything more than anybody. In the interview the manager seemed very happy with I could bring to the farm. I always said thank you and did what I was asked to do. So, yesterday was my last day.
The last straw was the discrimination going on on the farm towards many workers. I think it was everything. I've been feeling shitty being treated like I know nothing and I'm nothing by disrespectful 20something yrs old kids that have no knowledge of plants in general and no experience outside of that farm. It hurts personally. 

So, my question is. Should I try to get a manager job in California and change my life again? Me and my spouse have 15acres in this state and we've working on the land ,starting to homestead. Spend money in resources like solar, water storage, greenhouses, etc. 

Or should I apply for the last farm close enough for me to work at without having to move away? I would get another cultivation agent position (they always need people,  easy toget) and I've heard awful things from former employees. But I'll make some money and can keep working on my homestead.",Ant_mor3,1,1.0,0,1717180758,2024-05-31 18:39:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d52ta9/worth_to_move_away_from_my_homestead_for_a_higher/,5,2024
1d52ez9,Am I wrong?,"Hello everyone, would need an advice on the matter regarding pay.

Im currently a freelancer employed by an agency part time and servicing one client.

Per contract the pay is on a weekly basis and received every Friday. There have been no delays until recently, from early March I noticed that the pay started to delay from 2 weeks until 1 month, and now more than a month.

I followed up with the agency weekly and they kept telling me that the pay is being sorted, just having issues with the payment facility. Its the same reason everytime I ask them. 

I kept asking if there had been changes to the frequency of the pay, they said no. Its just the platform.

One time I followed up on a Monday and they said that they will sort it out that day but to no avail. Until another week passed and billed them another invoice and the balance just kept on piling up. I follow up with them everyday and I need the money to pay bills. 

Eventually I asked the client if I can stop working for a while since I was not getting paid and the client got confused as she was paying them timely and actually got angry that I was not getting paid. I told her that I don't want to get in trouble by saying this to her. She said she'll talk to the agency regarding this.

When she talked to the agency I got paid on the day she talked to them. Then the agency messaged me calling me unprofessional by speaking to the client regarding pay. I havent replied to them yet.

What should I do? Was I wrong for what I did? What can I reply to the agency?

1d51ae9,Do you agree with the way my company trains lower level people?

So, in my personal view it teaches a new person to do about 75% of their job correctly.  The senior people don't really spend much time mentoring new people because they think the handbook is amazing if that makes sense.

1d4zuvg,I want to do irrelevant work before going for a PhD. Will this destroy my chances of getting into programs?,"I’m 23, graduated about a year ago with a bs in biology and a bs in psychology. I have always been passionate about neuroscience, and I know that is what I want to study in the long run (specifically how mental health impacts the physical body/brain). 

I decided to take a couple gap years to get some neuro related research experience and see if this is what I really want to study for my PhD/further career. I wound up in an academic neuroendocrinology/cellular molecular physiology lab. While I really enjoy the bench work, this lab has a lot of animal work that I am not fond of. I did not have experience with animal work prior to this job, so I did not know just how hard of a time I would have with it. This job (like most academic jobs) does not pay well. I am struggling to pay my bills, and any time a medical expense or car problem happens, I am screwed for MONTHS. All these combined, I just am not sure if this job is worth it right now.

1d4zay8,Should I take a lateral role just to break out of stagnancy when my main career goal is earning a promotion?,"I've been in the same associate-level marketing role for 2.5 years and I'm looking for change. My main career motivation is earning more money and potentially getting a ""manager"" title to go with more money. I've proven myself and my leaders see me as being ready for the next step. Unfortunately, there are just no opportunities to move up on my team, so I've began looking at other teams in my company and keeping my eyes out for manager-level opportunities.

I've been stuck in my career because my company froze hiring and internal roles for the 2023 calendar year. Now that opportunities have begun opening up again, competition internally has become insane since my colleagues (who have also been stuck in their roles) are all looking for new work at the same time.

Though I'm looking for more money and a higher-level title, an opportunity at my current associate level came up on a different team that I'm really interested in. The team works on things that might even be more interesting to me than what I do on my current team. However, moving onto that team would mean remaining at the associate level, not getting a ""manager"" title, and at most earning a 0-5% raise on my lateral move (company policy).

I know titles don't always mean everything, but I'm 31 years old and I'm self-conscious about not being a manager at this stage of my career. I logically understand that careers aren't always meant to be linear, but I can't help but feel like I'm at the receiving end of an injustice by poor luck. I also can't help feel like taking a lateral move would be a ""failure"". However, I'm desperate and my career feels long overdue for change so I'm considering the lateral move just to do something different.

Should I consider taking a lateral move to a team with more interesting work - but with the cost of not getting the promotion I've been after - if it would mean breaking out of stagnancy? Is there any way I can get over this hang up about not getting the title/raise I'm looking for?

1d4yen9,Company doesn’t know what to do with me. How should I pivot?,"I was an analyst doing a very niche role. It involves data analytics and contract management. A small company reached out offering me a huge salary increase and a Senior position. It was consulting, but they had a client that was in need for someone with my skill set.

The easiest way to describe my situation is imagine I was hired by a programming company (not really, but it makes it easy to follow). The programming company was killing it, but they desperately needed an accountant because the client kept requested it. Then the client decided to hire an internal accountant. So the accountant is in this programming company with nothing to do.

That’s me, but with different roles. I’ve sat here for the past week while they figure out what the hell they should do with me. While the likely answer is I’m going to get laid off, they put a ton of resources into getting me hired and they really don’t want to just lay me off.

So I technically have this promotion and much bigger salary. The job market is dead and my role is sort of niche.

1d4yath,Wanting to shift from banking to a role in the Fraud field; any advice?,"Reddit

Hey, everyone! As the title says, I have recently developed an interest in, and want to move into, the career field of Fraud. I haven’t locked in a specific path as of yet (Financial Crimes, Forensic Accounting, Fraud Investigations/Detection/Prevention/Etc.) but nonetheless, am interested. I have done a little research into different roles, but am seeking advice on how to get the proverbial “foot in the door,” so to speak, in the industry.

A little background: I currently work for a bank that is a Fortune 500 company, and have been there for over 3 years at this point. Just over 2 of those years were spent as a “desk banker” (for lack of a better term) and the remainder (~11 months) have been as a Teller. Therefore, I’m familiar with the industry terms, policies, procedures, etc. relating to things like KYC, OFAC, BSA, AML, and so on. 

I’ve looked into, and know that, certificates such as the CFE, among others, would help, but from what I can tell I don’t have the experience required nor do I have a college degree, to meet the qualifications for said cert. 

Anyways, if anyone here happens to be in that field and has any tips/pointers/advice/paths for me, it would be much appreciated! I can provide more info, or whatever may be needed, if necessary.

1d4xd1x,"After 6 years, worse title than when I started","I need some advice. A little backstory:

I started with my firm almost 6 years ago, it’s a small company of roughly 20. I was hired as “Administrative Coordinator” and after about a year in that role, my boss would ask me my goals, where I saw myself within the company, etc and I told her I wanted to be in Client Service. Year after year I’d do my best in the role I had, took on a lot of extra responsibility, learned all the systems, always extended a hand to help and FINALLY, after 4 years of being admin, they told me I was going to be a Client Service Assistant. I already knew a lot of the paperwork, the systems, speaking to clients… I was also about to go on maternity leave so when I came back, I would dive head first into the role. I trained the new admin before I left, had my kid, came back, all seemed great. 

A very short time into my new role, the person training me I felt was fairly harsh, and because she was also my friend, I let her know that she had hurt my feelings a few times. Did not go over well, we had a few more tiffs, we kind of fell off the friendship, she no longer wanted to train me and so I kind of just learned on my own. 

A few months ago my firm decided to hire a new Senior Client Service person. I thought this weird, but I didn’t ask questions (I should have). Someone was hired and I was told my role would now be “Administrative Assistant”
Which is lower than what I started with. I would have all the same responsibilities of assisting wherever needed, plus being the executive assistant to the CEO (sans title and pay raise). My boss told me it’s because I have such great knowledge of all the systems and the clients and the growth of the firm was more important than my professional goals. Basically, my years of knowledge and my flexible and compliant nature were seemingly being used against me.

I know I need to leave because there is no room for growth in the field I want to be in. The person I trained to take over my admin coordinator role, she has no drive to do the work. She’s sloppy with processing, she has had certain responsibilities taken from her (and given to me) because she either doesn’t want to do them or is terrible at them. And yet, my new title is a step down from hers with more responsibility. I’ve been sitting with this for about a month, and I can’t make it right in my head.

Lastly, my husband and I want to try for another baby and so I just keep telling myself to stick it out until that happens, go on maternity leave and just don’t go back. Start the job search after.

I am overthinking and I would love to hear your opinion on the situation.

On the 14th of May I sent my CV to a company, offering a specific position, my CV was checked on the 15th of May and I received a phone call , the same day, for my first interview - online, for the 17th.

The interview went well, and they told me that they will give me a feedback within 2-3 business days - I guess they liked me, cause they gave me a feedback literally 30 min after the interview, asking for a date for the second one - in their office. This happens on the 17th of May and my second interview was scheduled for the 22nd of May.

After the 2nd interview, I received an offer on the 27th of May ( which is literally the next working day for us ), where it was mentioned that I have time until the 29th to let them know if I accept or decline.

On the 28th, a day after the offer, I informed them that I would love to join them, if they offer a little bit more start salary, since I do not want to start a new position with less salary than the current one, on which the HR replied that they will discuss it with the staff and inform me via email/phone call.

Today, 31st of May, no calls, no email - am I silently declined? They had a super fast process, even the HR phoned me on the 28th asking for information before I told her my offer.

I'm a bachelor student studying Eastern Asian Studies (BA) in Germany. I'm doing a year abroad in Japan rn, and I'm doing my first internship  in a small cultural organisation atm. 

I was planning to spend the summer in India to do an internship at a bigger, well-known German cultural institution (Goethe Institute). I wanted to branch out bc I don't want to specialize only in Japan and East Asia. I'm planning to apply for a master's in IR and don't want to work in Japan in the future, but I'd like to work in an international group, firm or organisation. 

The issue is that I just got told I'm among the last contenders for an internship this summer at an embassy stationned in Japan. I had applied months ago, but I heard they only accept master students, so it was really just pro forma. Now I don't know what to do: 
Should I branch into another country to broaden my skill set or take the internship at the embassy, which feels way more prestigious?

I also have some smaller personal reasons for preferring India (I prefer the country and have friends there, general interest in the country) and my parents seem to think India would be the right choice to do. My friends all think the embassy is better for my future career. 

What do I do?

1d4w1y1,Struggling with company re-org,"I \[35F\] am struggling with the announcement that my department is part of a reorg. While I understand this can be a required part of any business, this move seems driven by the new president's desire to make her mark vs actual necessity and has been handled very poorly.

We got the news yesterday that our office was being absorbed by another, eliminating my senior manager's position. He has been with the organization for 30+ years, is a hard worker and very beloved- even employees that have seen previous leadership changes never imagined he would be pushed out like this.

This is the first job I have ever had that I had actual career support and could envision myself growing beyond an entry level employee. My direct manager has been a wonderful mentor and I have never seen a senior manager that cares about every single person under his care like this man does.

Now all that is up in the air. While I have been assured I am too low to garner notice for being cut, every other person that I have been learning from is in the red zone. No one knows what is going to happen, the most experienced staff don't believe the new president even knows what she wants to do with us.

I am anxious and very very angry. I desperately want to broadcast this poor decision, my frustrations, and drag the president's name across any platform I can- but I know this is a terrible move for multiple reasons.

Besides just needing to rant, I have two questions regarding moving forward:

1. How can I deal with my anger over this situation?
2. We will be having a meeting with the president on Monday. What questions (if any) should I ask besides the obvious, ""am I gonna have a job still""? Is there a way to show my anger and diminished respect for her without putting a target on my back?

I had another summer position that requires me to give notice by end of next week. I’m not sure if I should give notice, because I only received a verbal offer and I’ve yet to receive any onboarding paperwork/any correspondence since the interview.

1d4vnjs,Did I make a bad decision?,"
Hey everyone,

I'm seeking some career advice and would appreciate your insights. Here's my situation: I graduated in the summer of '22 and got lucky with my first job as a management consulting associate at a Big Four firm. It was a great opportunity, especially considering I moved to the US four years ago without a college degree, money, or guidance. I pushed myself through community college, and got into a decent non-target UC.

I stayed at the Big Four for almost a year until I was let go due to industry downsizing. Fortunately, they allowed me to stay for an additional two months to finish my project, giving me time to apply for jobs. I quickly landed a position as a first-year analyst in investment banking at a boutique M&A shop. This role aligns well with the knowledge I've gained over the past six years. I work in the lower middle market, helping small companies raise capital through debt, equity, or outright sales. I've been in this role for seven months and am nearing the close of my first deal. I enjoy the work and find it both interesting and stimulating. Not only am I doing sell-side but I am also gaining experience performing an LBO, doing business development and being in the pitch meetings with the decks that I created. I even obtained my licenses in record time and am the only fully licensed analyst at the firm (2 Analysts, 2 Associates)

So, why am I asking for career advice? I took a massive pay cut and moved across the country (LA to NY) to pursue this career. My base salary is $40,000, with a discretionary bonus (which has been $5,000 for analysts in the past two years). Additionally, my role involves a lot of administrative and menial tasks, such as scheduling meetings, managing compliance, interviewing and training interns, stocking the break room, and even cleaning the MD's dishes. This is all on top of my active deals. It takes time away from me to be able to improve my technical skills.

I'm working from 8 am to 10 pm (pretty normal in the industry), Monday through Saturday. My health is declining, and I'm barely saving any money each month—around $50 after all expenses. I don't have a social life because I can't afford it. And to top it all off there are no benefits. I use the government insurance because I can’t afford to pay the company insurance premium. On one hand there are many positives in this situation, but there are some major drawbacks that make it tough, and I guess I just wanted to vent and get some advice from this community.

P.S. I'm continuing my financial education by taking modeling courses over the summer and improving my interviewing skills for future opportunities. I am currently not ready to leave the firm since I lack the technical skills of my peers, but within the next year I should be up to speed and have one or two deals under my belt.

If there is anyone in the banking world who is willing to connect I would appreciate it.

Thanks for reading, and I appreciate any guidance you can offer.",Xfire131,1,1.0,0,1717162178,2024-05-31 13:29:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d4vnjs/did_i_make_a_bad_decision/,5,2024

Had a “coaching action plan” meeting with my manager discussing that there are certain goals I am not meeting with a PDF of our discussion sent afterwards. There is a due date on some of the goals/improvements.

The thing is, our goals are extremely unrealistic with no support from leadership. There is no one on my 4 person team meeting them (literally not one person, even the highest performer or the other person with 20+ years of experience). I am not sure if everyone except the new guy has gotten the same meeting.

1d4vdvk,Follow boss to new job?,"Follow boss to new job?

Long story short, my boss is leaving and told me they want me to go with them as there’s an open role for me there. I’m in a pretty specialized industry that pays my position more than it would an analogous role in another industry, so I’m already making good money where I am and am extremely comfortable in my role, with lots of flexibility. 

My current company is about middle of the pack when it comes to size/revenue compared to its competitors, and the company I could potentially be moving to is one of the “big dogs” so to speak. With that I might be able to expect a bit more stress and hours.

I’d be making 25% more than I am now—at the minimum—in an elevated role. Plus, I’d be a direct report to my boss whom I’ve developed great working rapport with over the years.

However, I really can’t find a single bad thing to say about my current job/company, except maybe I’m getting a little bored. Pay is good, PTO is great, team’s awesome. However, on paper the new position could be considered ”too good to pass up.” One other thing is that it would extend my commute from about 17 minutes to 45.

What say you? Devil I know? Or devil I don’t?

Now today I look at my LinkedIn and my manager who said I can have him as a reference took me off LinkedIn 

It could be due to the fact they posted an opening for a backfill on my role a couple of days ago and he doesn't want me to see that which is really dumb for many reasons 

I wasn't the only person laid off in the company a lot of people were but like it makes me feel like I did something wrong if I got laid off for a business decision which context the company isn't doing that great so maybe they're cutting costs here and there to save where they can like hiring someone to replace me who's cheaper which is fine

1d4tfyr,Found out colleagues are paid more than me. How to approach?,"I recently found out that my colleagues are paid around 25% more than me. 

There's a lot of details but they have been at company longer than I have, ranging maybe 6 months-2 years more. Experience wise it probably varies but I have tried extremely hard to bring in new ideas and work long hours. There is a system to describe what level you are at and I am in the same bracket as other colleagues and have been described as a strong member in the team with expertise in certain areas. An issue is I was hired in a city which I chose to move away from, but I was allowed to keep my job as a fully remote role but it was very much phrased that my job is still a job in that city and I have to regularly commute to that city to attend certain meetings and I have to foot all expenses such as travel and accommodation (need to stay when I am over as I now live about 5 hours away) when other remote workers get this all expensed for them. When I was still in the city it seems like my colleagues were still paid significantly more.

I am upset because even when I was in the city, my overall trajectory for my salary has been 10% increase over 2 years and I would never reach my colleagues salary currently on this trajectory unless I became extremely senior and by then my time at company would be more than what they have currently done.

I'm wary that if I bring it up they will bring up the fact I am remote but in my head if I am paying to still attend the office every 6 weeks for multiple days then that shouldn't really be a factor, plus people in the team who do live in the city rarely go in

1d4ozov,Looking for Advice in Pivoting to Data Science/Statistics,"I am looking for advice about what my options and next steps are for pursuing a masters degree in data science or statistics abroad.

For background: I am a U.S. CPA working in accounting who majored in Business Management Economics and graduated summa cum laude, however most of my courses were in accounting or basic economics. My most complicated stats class was Econometrics and I barely passed vector calculus (and remember none of it). I have no coding experience at all. I loved Econometrics and took a basic stats class for fun in college, but pursued accounting because I come from a poor background and didn't feel like I'd be able to get a job as easily in Statistics as I could in accounting. I graduated in 2019 and since then got my CPA title and currently have a job in a municipal government accounting position. I don't love accounting, but I was good at it in school and thought it would be best to go along with my strengths + good job prospects.

I'm now 5 years into the work force and I don't want to do accounting for the rest of my life. I've always liked statistics and feel like it would be a good match for me as a career. However, I'm aware I am lacking foundations in higher level math courses, statistics, coding, and what I did take in college I don't remember because I've been doing only accounting for the last 5 years. I wanted to hear people's experiences with getting a masters in Data Science or Statistics, as I've heard some stories that masters do a basic crash course in the foundations anyway before moving on to the more complicated stuff. But I've also read descriptions of masters that indicate you need a strong foundation before applying.

As for only being interested in applying for masters abroad: I am in a very lucky position at my current city government. I make good money (about $95k/year) and have good benefits, and my job is easy. I can cruise for as long as I want with no real stresses or issues in the medium term. I am very fortunate to have this job, however I don't see myself having a future in the U.S. due to rising costs of housing, child care, rent, etc. As such, giving up my easy job for a masters in the U.S. that just places me back into the U.S. work force, isn't worth it for me. Even if a data science job would pay more (which at this point I'm not sure is true given how bad salaries are in the private sector-- when I switched from public accounting to government accounting I had a dramatic pay raise despite a much easier position) the 1-2 years of forfeited wages to go back to school and the debt would outweigh it. However, if the masters got me a visa in another country, one where I would feel more comfortable planning to live in the long term, I think it would be worth it. Again, I am very fortunate to have my job, many people in the U.S. get paid much less than me and survive, but for what I want out of life I don't think the way the U.S. is going is going to make me fulfilled. 

I would appreciate any and all input or stories about processes like this. I'm open to taking classes at community college remotely/in the evening to buff up my knowledge, but wanted to get input first on if this is a good use of time and resources.

These these really held me back where I took a long time to self reflect and truly find the real me/purpose of life and 
philosophy/psychology/psychedelic research has been my escape. Though I’m starting to heal and become happy again i realize i have no plan for my future. I lack all motivation and all I have been doing is work my graveyard shift, workout if I have the energy and just chill at home the rest of the day watching YouTube videos/reading. I don’t have friends because I’m not much of a people person. Lost interest in them a long time ago, but with that being said I know I have the time to dedicate myself to a career full time. Watching trip reports/Ted talk on consciousness/philosophy teachings on YouTube have been such fun/insightful experience and I want to keep these things as a main focus in my life.  I can honestly say that after taking this time to really understanding these topics it has really helped me in my personal/spiritual journey. But now I’m conflicted because I still have no plan for my future. I love all these things but i know getting a degree in any of them will be hard for me. I have ADHD and I guess it peaked in high school it because I would be in summer school every year. I couldn’t turn in a piece of homework if my life depended on it.  I just couldn’t sit myself down for 10 seconds and do the work, I always got distracted by the smallest things. Thankfully I was smart to understand the material because I was able to ace my exams and be at a C- average for every class for 90% of the school year.  I know this approach won’t slide in college. And to be honest not ready to handle that kind of pressure because im not passionate about learning the topics apart of the curriculum. So now I don’t know where to start.

1d4oo9s,Not sure on what to do for a career,"So I’ve made some mistakes which have lead me to become extremely anxious about my future and i would like some advice to be able to change my life around for the better. Im 19 years old in 2 weeks and I’ve never had a job. I quit school when i was 16 due to procrastination and piled up work causing me to burn out and i was just like f*ck it and ended up leaving school. Over these last 2 years i haven’t really done anything at all and have just been very anxious due to my regrets of leaving school and my gained bad habits (smoking). Leaving school has caused me to have no purpose and I’ve basically lost my social skills due to not going out much (in my head i didnt seem to have much of a reason to). Ive always wanted a job but as pathetic as it sounds i just couldn’t get myself to invest time into finding one due to the laziness I developed and my lost social skills(can barely keep eye contact but i can basically talk normally). Anyways now the backstory is there I’m curious if there would be any advice on careers to think about going into. I was thinking something like an IT course or a Trade (electrician, plumber etc.) but i want to broaden my options and see what’s available and what people would recommend. Im in the UK so i have GCSEs(pretty good grades) but no A-Levels as i quit a few months into my sixth form journey. Any advice would be very much appreciated as it would quite literally contribute to me changing my life around for the better.

For Americans I’ve searched it up and apparently:
GCSE=High School Diploma
A-Level=Bachelors Degree

1d4onet,Electrician - relocation. ,"Hi I’m an electrician at a large Company who has been doing testing and inspection job role for last 11 years.

They a now opening a new area and  depot and have asked for volunteers which they did not get enough for the new depot so are now selecting people from each depot. 

I have been selected from my depot as I live (22 mins away) closer and they are forcing me to go with no options. They are also outsourcing my job role and offered to give training however I do not feel very confident as I do not know anybody there or the area.

I’ve currently declined to go and asked to be relocated to an area that is still close (26 mins away) on the reason being I have also worked within this area for 11 years testing the sites. I have informed them this will give me a better chance at retraining and starting new roles as I already know this area and have site Knowlege and know the maintence team and operators. 

The only problem is this team is full. However 3 of the team also live much closer to the new depot then I do. 

The full moving situation is massively stressing me out. The thought of a new job role is daunting enough however starting in a new area I’m being forced into feels like they are being unreasonable. I’ve offered to move to a depot that is still close. 


Do I have any rights or am I being unreasonable? Could I still refuse to move. Am not in a union but is there anyone else I could contact for legal advice.

1d4nfoo,I'm 23 and I hate my job. What do I do next?,"I would like to begin this by saying I am fully aware that I'm in a very lucky position. But I've been thinking/dwelling on this for a while now, and I think I need a change.

I graduated college about 1.5 years ago now, and I've been working a job in tech for a little over a year. On paper, this job is *fantastic*; I make almost six figures. I've got paid vacation/sick time, and benefits. For someone coming right out of college and in this economy, it's ridiculously good numerically. I came from a poor background, and I realize how good I've got it right now. I'm grateful.

But I really, really do not like this job. It feels like it's sucking my soul right out of me sometimes; whenever I am at the office, I hate the person I see in the mirror. I can't help but feel decrepit and cynical. It's like ever since I started this job, I've gotten more and more dissatisfied with life. Socially, it also feels very isolating as I'm used to making friends at work and having conversations. But there isn't any of that at this company. About 3-4 months in, I was even beginning to have suicidal thoughts, which shocked me. I've since been in therapy, and I'm working on things, but I can tell the job is playing a big part in the way I feel.

Here's the big issue, and probably my main qualm with the job: there is *zero* growth for me, personally or professionally. All of the things I work on are either outdated or company-specific, which means the ""skills"" I learn and use day-to-day are hardly applicable anywhere else. I'm not gaining the confidence or know-how to find a better job. **If I stay here, this is it. This job is my career.** I simply cannot do that.

I want to leave. But like I said, it feels like my skills I gained in college have mostly regressed. Any job I see online that I qualify for is basic grunt work paying barely enough to get by. Anything else, I don't think I'd make it past an interview. The only things I've really got going for me, it feels, is that I did well in school and have this as professional experience to show I can keep at something. I also live very frugally, so I've put back what feels to me like a large amount of savings in the past year.

TL;DR - My job has zero growth prospects and often makes me miserable. I'm young and doing well financially, but I need something new in life. Underqualified for everything else though... what do I do?

1d4mdvc,Career Advice ,"
Hey everyone,

I'm seeking some career advice and would appreciate your insights. Here's my situation: I graduated in the summer of '22 and got lucky with my first job as a management consulting associate at a Big Four firm. It was a great opportunity, especially considering I moved to the US four years ago without a college degree, money, or guidance. I pushed myself through community college, and got into a decent non-target UC.

I stayed at the Big Four for almost a year until I was let go due to industry downsizing. Fortunately, they allowed me to stay for an additional two months to finish my project, giving me time to apply for jobs. I quickly landed a position as a first-year analyst in investment banking at a boutique M&A shop. This role aligns well with the knowledge I've gained over the past six years. I work in the lower middle market, helping small companies raise capital through debt, equity, or outright sales. I've been in this role for seven months and am nearing the close of my first deal. I enjoy the work and find it both interesting and stimulating. Not only am I doing sell-side but I am also gaining experience performing an LBO, doing business development and being in the pitch meetings with the decks that I created. I even obtained my licenses in record time and am the only fully licensed analyst at the firm (2 Analysts, 2 Associates)

So, why am I asking for career advice? I took a massive pay cut and moved across the country (LA to NY) to pursue this career. My base salary is $40,000, with a discretionary bonus (which has been $5,000 for analysts in the past two years). Additionally, my role involves a lot of administrative and menial tasks, such as scheduling meetings, managing compliance, interviewing and training interns, stocking the break room, and even cleaning the MD's dishes. This is all on top of my active deals. It takes time away from me to be able to improve my technical skills.

I'm working from 8 am to 10 pm (pretty normal in the industry), Monday through Saturday. My health is declining, and I'm barely saving any money each month—around $50 after all expenses. I don't have a social life because I can't afford it. And to top it all off there are no benefits. I use the government insurance because I can’t afford to pay the company insurance premium. On one hand there are many positives in this situation, but there are some major drawbacks that make it tough, and I guess I just wanted to vent and get some advice from this community.

P.S. I'm continuing my financial education by taking modeling courses over the summer and improving my interviewing skills for future opportunities. I am currently not ready to leave the firm since I lack the technical skills of my peers, but within the next year I should be up to speed and have one or two deals under my belt.

If there is anyone in the banking world who is willing to connect I would appreciate it.

Thanks for reading, and I appreciate any guidance you can offer.

Completing this program will enable me to take the licensing exam. I know that graduating from an unaccredited program can be a drawback since some employers prefer candidates from accredited schools.

My goal is to become an LVN and eventually work as a travel LVN. In the future, I also plan to pursue an ADN in nursing after gaining 4-5 years of experience as an LVN.

1d4lvlw,Is it reasonable to go for a counter offer of $40/hr from the offered $37/hr?,"Was offered a position a couple of days ago as an analyst for a small company.

Our team is small and very intimate. My hiring manager/supervisor is a part of my team and we work very closely. I do not want them to think that I feel they are undervaluing me and I’m still getting the hang of these new responsibilities. Industry average for an analyst in this position is about 79k/yr.

I don’t want to taint any relationships by asking for a counteroffer. Also for context since I was an intern for about a year we never discussed salary in the interviews leading up to the offer and it was not on the job description.

There is a job open that has essentially been my dream job for years. 

It’s semi ‘entry level’ - even on the ad it says they are really looking for passion, enthusiasm and energy.

This is a huge corporation. I saw on the LinkedIn ad they have at least 200+ applications…and that’s just LinkedIn. It’s posted on multiple sites. I think they wouldn’t even bother to open all the resume’s.

I want the job so bad, I’ve applied, and sent the resume to the hiring manager on LinkedIn.

Would it look bad if I also dropped off my resume or cover letter at their office? I basically just want to make sure they see it.

While none of my managers have directly confronted me about recent performances I feel like they are waiting for it to build up or are waiting for a suitable replacement to appear.

A gentleman I work with has been with the corporation in a blue-collar position for 20 years and was recently promoted to a new role, which involves working closely with me. Over the past few months, I’ve tried to stay friendly with him, but I've had difficulty communicating with him. He often belittles me and talks down to me, he has a sense of arrogance to him. As a result, I try to limit my interactions with him. He has lived in our small town his entire life, and I have noticed he doesn't like anyone that isn't born and raised here, which I am also not. Anyone that we work with who he's known his entire life he never has anything negative to say about. 

Things have worsened since our boss went on maternity leave. He’s been pressuring me to send contracted work to his friends' businesses, which is frowned upon in our government job. Recently, we hired one of his friends for a project. I am the main contact for this work, which they know. His friend initially told me he would complete the work in a few weeks but didn’t commit to a specific date, despite my request for one so I could inform other stakeholders.

Without notifying me, his friend finished the work and communicated only with my coworker. He also completed extra tasks outside our scope of work and will be asking for additional funds, which I wasn’t aware of and not sure how to handle. My coworker later told me that his friend laughed at my scope of work document, saying it didn’t make sense, and criticized my request for testing results to ensure the work was done properly. I reread the document and don't see anything wrong with it, nor did my boss before she went off work. 

My coworker has plans to hire his friend next year.

1d4iidy,What kind of job to apply for with absolutely no direction?,"I separated the military after a decade and pursued a few IT certs (network, linux, security, AWS) since my friend did the same and got hired a few years ago. I can easily be on a computer for the whole day and it seemed to be a good field that my security clearance would benefit. It wasn't really because I found the field interesting or had any experience in it--my military career was one that doesn't translate to any job outside. Unfortunately and unsurprisingly, after hundreds of application rejections over six months I had basically given up, and six months later of living off of savings doing nothing to improve my life here I am. I have also forgot everything I studied to get the certs so I am not even *barely* qualified for those jobs anymore.

So I'm at square one again. I have considered using my GI bill to go back to college to get higher than an associates, but have no idea what I want to do or which college to go to. I'd love to just take some general classes but without a major and going full time I'd be going out of pocket. Do I choose some random college in a random state for some generic degree? I don't want to squander the opportunity.

I have no idea what kind of job I want, and I have lost so much self-confidence. I think I could probably get a job stocking shelves or working in a warehouse, but I guess i haven't been ready to accept that that's all I have for my future.

But the question remains: in what settings are certifications more important than *actually having done the thing?* Once we work this out, it's much easier to inform long-term skill acquisition and career moves.

Any input would be great appreciated. Thank you for your time.",willbradley_,2,1.0,4,1717111857,2024-05-30 23:30:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d4hkj0/which_is_better/,5,2024
1d4hj7o,How can I find a job I love that I can live comfortably on?,"Hi there! I am starting college this fall and I am pondering my choice of career. I have a passion for animals and science, and I want to go into wildlife biology. I have researched different jobs in the field, and I can possibly live comfortably with it, but it’s not guaranteed. I have been conflicted because I want to study animals, but I don’t want to be poor. How can I maximize my earnings in the field? And if that doesn’t work out, how can I go about finding a different field? I don’t care about being rich, but I don’t want to be living paycheck to paycheck and I want to live alone. I also have depression, so if I had a job I hated I would have a hard time getting the motivation to go.

1d4h1wr,"Feeling ashamed to bring up unpaid invoices a year later, what should I do?","Hi Redditors,

Last January (2023), I was hired as a part-time university research assistant on a consultancy contract. The contract was until 31 March, but I had verbal understanding that it would be renewed if I continued doing work for the team. 

I was required to log my hours and issue my invoices every month, or at the latest, 20 weeks after work had been completed. Invoicing involved sending a bill to HR and having my hours confirmed by the Director of the research program. 

I was paid for my work in January, while completing everything expected of me for February.

Fast forward to March, I fell into a state of deep depression. This led me to dropping the ball on my work, not responding to emails on time and not issuing my invoice for February. As I wasn’t really being chased for any of my work, I I “got away” with wallowing in my sadness for the entire month.

I picked myself up again in April, trying to undo some of the damage of having gone MIA the previous month. I was given research tasks here and there by members of the research program until May, which I carried out relatively diligently, but I was feeling increasingly wary of doing work that was outside my contract until March. 

At the time, I should have raised this contractual issue to the program Director. However, I felt my lack of professionalism / disappearance in March was an unaddressed elephant in the room that would have tainted my conversation about contract renewal. I felt too ashamed to confront all of this, so I ended up slowly going MIA just as research tasks for me slowly dwindled. As such, there was never really any closure to that professional relationship. 

In July, I submitted my February invoice to HR, just before the 20 week deadline. I felt I had the right to submit this bill since it was work done during my contractual period. However, I received no reply. I followed up with HR with two further emails about my invoice, but again didn’t receive a response. 

Once again, I knew what I had to do was to email the program Director about the situation. But I just felt it was too awkward to broach the topic so many months later. I’ve therefore left all of this hanging since, both the unpaid invoice in February, alongside the work in April - May 2023 which I never invoiced.

I just feel so embarrassed by all of this. But I also want to stand up for myself and get paid what I’m owed, at least for February’s work. 

However, I am struggling to figure out how I ought to bring this all up with the program Director more than a year later - both the unpaid invoice and for the work I did outside of contract in April to May.

Would appreciate any advice you guys have, including how I can go about drafting an email that can effectively address the situation and see if any money can be paid.

TLDR: I don’t know how to bring up unpaid invoice / work a year later, especially when I let the professional relationship end in an awkward way.

1d4gjxg,How to survive in a (very) toxic work environment,"Hi,

I have a complex issue that I would like advice on.

TL;DR:
Im a Mid-Rise VDC / BIM / project coordinator. Im uncertain wether or not I should change my job or wait two years until the building is finished. I dont like my job environment at all but I'm learning a lot

context:

I work as a VDC / BIM / project coordinator for a high rise development company in Toronto. It has been my first job here in Canada and have been there since I graduated from college, the company has been supportive of my migrational process and I feel Im learning a lot while having a tolerance margin for screwing up. I would like to complete the current building im working at since it would be a huge improvement to my curriculum, but I feel completely drained and wasted mentally. Has someone gone through this process?


The people within the construction industry is completely the opposite of what I am. I used to work as an interior designer and I also did a degree on visual arts. My perspective on the world and my ethos clashes with my coworkers, especially the project manager of the site. She is very opinionated and usually comments on my body, makes fun of other peoples accent and throws racial, sexist & transphobic comments often. (im a short tattooed kind of queer latino dude). The good thing is that she avoids working from the site as she prefers to stay in suburbia and work remotely, I also had a change of attitude and stopped replying to her comments on things that werent strictly professional and I think she picked up the hint, but It took me a year full of mental anxiety, stress and feeling like shit to have the guts to take action. my other coworkers are okay-ish, but I crave a different type of environment and conversations. 

Even If i choose to quit, I would have to wait more than 4 months due to my migrational process (I had to close my work permit and Im waiting for IRCC to approve my status. Sometimes I feel so desperate that Im considering flagpoling to expedite the process in order to add more points to my Express Entry Profile)

I am a 25 year old male from Chicago suburbs and I have no clue what next steps to take in life. I have a Bachelors in Philosophy and don’t know what to use it for. I have been debating on getting a masters in something more specialized, however, I don’t want to go back to school and get more debt to be put in the same position. I also don’t want to get into a career that requires me to work at home and be away from family a lot. I want to have a decent work/life balance as I plan to have kids one day.

I do not have many interests, however, mental health, criminal justice, and education have always been fields that stuck out to me. These fields also tend to get paid the worst. I come from a background where money has always been my biggest concern. I do not want to go into a career where that will continue to happen. I’m not trying to be rich, I just want to be able to live comfortably and support my family one day. Are there any pathways you think would be good for me? I can provide more information if needed, I just don’t know what to do with my degree as it seems I am getting the same exact job offers as before I even got a Bachelors which is depressing.

1d4eix0,Am I getting screwed?,"I work for a small company doing contract work in a niche industry. Lately, our contracts have been for IT work since there's a lack of IT folks in our small world right now. Our company has four employees, including the owner, and I'm the only IT person.

Realizing this adds value to my position, I recently asked for a raise for the first time in 27 years of working for this person. They've been really hard to pin down on what they're willing to give me, but they've been talking around a number that's roughly half of my billing rate. I feel like that is still kind of low, based on the fact that we haven't had offices in 15 or 20 years, so the overhead is much less than what it might be for a more traditional workplace. 

We had another talk today about the rate, and my boss is now saying that I already get paid that rate and that their calculating it by including my dental and medical benefits, professional organization dues (which is an organization that the company belongs to, even though I go to the meetings), computer equipment, and the employer portion of payroll taxes.  

I can see the medical and dental benefits being a part of a benefits package, and even the professional organization dues I might consider a benefit, since it will benefit me when I'm no longer working for this company.  But I think that's separate from an hourly rate. An hourly rate is one thing, a benefits package is separate, right? And then when we get into computer equipment and the employer portion of payroll taxes, isn't that overhead? 

If they roll all of this into my hourly rate, it seems like my hourly pay rate is absorbing all of the overhead plus my salary, so that roughly 50% of my billing rate is profit for the company.

1d4e6xk,Confused between 2 SCM jobs- Demand Planning vs Procurement and Purchasing,"Confused between 2 SCM jobs- Demand Planning vs Procurement and Purchasing

Hi! I have 2 Summer Internship opportunities with me.

1 is a Demand Planning role- all about forecasting, AI models, insights and continuous improvement using those insights. It is at a midsize manufacturing company that is on the decline, growth and learning curve is slow, pretty chill company with good work life balance and is a basic demand planning role. It is in the Bay Area (huge pro for me)

2- is a Procurement and Purchasing role- working with supplier evaluation, selection, onboarding, Oracle ERP, MRO, production planning, supplier risk analysis, supplier conformance, support on production, invoicing, checking and adjusting invoice discrepancies, SLAs, Gantt Charts, Digikey, and a bit of inventory management like resolving stockouts. This is at a start up and they are doing really well and growing quite rapidly I observed almost all interns and employees are from top tier universities in the world. Also in a very good location in California but not Bay Area.

AT both places, I have good chances for full time job and everything matches well. However, the first company since it is declining (eg. their stock shares have only declined and declined by 20-40 percent since 5yrs) there are lesser chances of full time. Industry-wise- both are good and I like both.

What do you guys suggest I go with?

1. I know basics of SCM, familiar with the terms, but no professional SCM experience. I have 2 yrs work ex, I am 24. I know I like it from what all I know and hence am open to both roles. Therefore, trouble selecting.
2. I am looking at this internship from long-term perspective as it will decide the path in SCM for me- hence which is more sought after and higher paying but also not tooo stressful and hectic, and better scope for growth, also wider so that later I have options atleast to branch out to different relevant areas if needed- Procurement or Demand Planning?
3. I would prefer to have a role involving more interpersonal skills like communicating, negotiating rather than learning Python or techy.
4. If I go to either, how hard would it be to switch to other areas of SCM?
5. In the future, I do want to grow to Managerial positions, so which area has better scope for it?
6. I do want to learn, but am also scared that what if I cannot match the steep learning curve at a startup and fail to get a full-time. My previous job was very chill, fully wfh, very simple and I used to work barely 4hrs a day. This is fast pace environment.
7. And if I apply to other full-time jobs- which experience can be more valuable? I believe Procurement needs real-world experience to crack interviews whereas I can do a Demand Planning group project and that would be equivalent to the internship at the first company.",Status-Echidna-3295,1,1.0,0,1717102299,2024-05-30 20:51:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d4e6xk/confused_between_2_scm_jobs_demand_planning_vs/,5,2024
1d4e2qq,Experience at Work,"Hello Reddit. I’m seeking insight on an experience I had at work because I really want to approach it the best way. 

This is long, but thank you for reading. 

I’ve been at the job for almost a year now, and I’ve really enjoyed it. I’m a manager for more than one department. The other employees in the department have higher credentials than me and essentially task me with things that need done. I do many things on my own as well (since I’m managing). 

All of my interactions for goals or tasks of things needed completed have been communicated to me in a very collaborative way. “X needs one, here are ways we could do it” or “Hey, will you please do X?”

Recently I had an interaction with a colleague  (isn’t my supervisor, but the person outranks me and is the current head of one of the departments I manage under, and when I say head I mean for one of the teams, not the organization) 

During the interaction the person was telling me things that need done. But instead of the approach everyone else has had, the person rapid fire’d at me in an assertive voice “You’re going to do this, and you’re going to do this” about several things and then essentially said kapeesh? 
 
During the interaction it was intense so I shut down. I felt small, and terrible. I felt incompetent and that I had been stripped of being a manager (not that anyone should be talked to that way). Now, this person has this personality in general. Additionally, I mentioned during the interaction how helpful it has been in the recent past to have support on these tasks and I think the person may have taken it as I didn’t want to do them (which isn’t what I meant, considering delegating these tasks is part of the job description) but I said it because I felt stripped of being able to have options for myself with how I was being spoken to. I’ll be honest, I cried after this. I had felt really great in my role beforehand. 

Shortly after this I saw the individual with a member of the team that I’ve worked more closely with. They’re close work friends. They talk about everything. I’m concerned I was portrayed as not wanting to do the tasks, and that that’s why I had shut-down body language. 

I really like this job and I don’t want this person to hurt my reputation or make it look like I had a bad attitude about the tasks. 
I also don’t feel comfortable around this person after how I was spoken to. There were always small things that happened with this person that I looked past (slamming their office door right next to me, not moving out of my way so I can pass, abruptly and loudly asking something of me without saying hi or my name, yelling out “where is X!?” instead of “hey can you find x please?” But I’ve looked past it. 

I feel like I should talk to the person and the other team member for sake of not being portrayed badly and it hurting my job, but I’m concerned about their friendship double teaming me. I’m coming from an understanding place, not a combative one. I could also go to someone else. 
I overheard one member called this person rude at one point.

1d4adnq,How do I ask my reference to fill out the same survey about me again?,"
Recently, I applied to several jobs and have had interviews with three of them. Two of the jobs have already offered me positions, including the one I interviewed for today. However, I'm still waiting for a final decision from a previous job interview, where they haven't offered me the position yet and have instead asked for references to complete the application process.

Here's my dilemma: the references for the previous job needed to fill out a survey about me, which is somewhat tedious. These references have already completed this survey once but because I applied for a different position within the same company at a different location they are needing to do it again. If it wasn't for the fact that the previous job has not yet offered me a position and that I think I may like the job I was offered today a little bit better I wouldn't bother asking my references to do the survery again. (As of now,  I am still unsure which job I may go for if I do get offered the position as I do not know the pay for the previous job.) 

I am concerned about asking them to do this again, as I don't want to annoy them or confuse them (I fear they may ignore the request as they think they already did it).

How should I approach my references and explain that I need them to fill out the survey again? If you could also possibly give a email header that would clarify that this isn't the same survey (it is but it isn't) they have already completed so they don't ignore the email that would be great!

1d49foo,29 y/o gay man stuck in construction. In school. Does anyone know of a bachelors/career that suites my needs? ,"Hello. I am a 29 year gay old man currently working full time as a junior estimator at a storm damage company while in school part time. I’ll be able to transfer to a 4 year next spring. I’ve dealt with quite a bit of  homophobia in this industry and need to get out after I graduate.

At age 19 I dropped out of a nice 4 year after one year because I wasn’t ready. Then spent much of my 20s being suicidal, trying and failing school several more times, and being in a regretful relationship. 

Well I got on the right meds, surrounded myself with successful people, am now passing classes, but I’m struggling to find the right degree path. Years ago in a failed college attempt I had dropped out of 2 coding classes and a web design degree so anything computer science doesn’t feel right. I’m a great figurative artist but struggle with marketing myself and haven’t made art in years. I hate being around sales bros and feel nauseous around blood/needles, so sales/healthcare doesn’t feel like a fit. Thinking about accounting but I hear it’s not very lucrative and is a dying field.

I’m making out $55k/year, which is a lot better than the $33-40k I made pre Covid. But I dream of making over $100k like my closest friends are (one’s a nurse and one in the sciences). I know $100k doesn’t happen for most people ever, and for many not until their late 40s/50s. I want to eventually be able to afford a $300-350k house/tropical vacation. Does anyone know what degrees to look at? I live in the Midwest in a mid sized city. What the heck should I do?

1d49emu,Should I take a low-paid 6-month ESG analyst internship as a graduate looking to start a career in finance? ,"Should I take a low-paid 6-month ESG analyst internship as a graduate looking to start a career in finance?

I (F,25) just graduated from my masters in International Affairs & Public Policy. I recently applied for an internship in sustainable finance (ESG analyst) in Paris and, following a successful interview, I was offered the position. The company is a small but growing boutique investment company.  The role involves updating the ESG scores of 850 companies, conducting comprehensive financial and extra-financial analyses, debriefing my manager, and attending ESG meetings and seminars. The working hours are from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and the pay is €1,000 per month. My rent is €500, and the cost of living in Paris is very high. I am hesitant for several reasons:

- With such a significant workload, I believe the salary is very low.
- I asked about future opportunities, and they confirmed there is no possibility of being hired after the internship.
- They mentioned that they believe I’m overqualified and could easily find a ""real"" job, and they also indicated the job is boring and repetitive.

I aspire to work in the finance industry and eventually move to London, but I currently lack real work experience in this sector. This internship could provide valuable learning opportunities. However, I'm concerned about committing to a low-paying role with no future prospects at the company.

Should I accept the internship but actively keep applying for better-paid, full-time jobs while gaining experience during the internship?

1d47rvz,"Struggling as a New Team Lead: Should I Stick It Out, Step Down, or Look for a New Job?","# I find myself at a crossroads in my career and could use some advice. Almost a year ago, I got promoted to Head of Customer Success/Team Lead. I'm leading a team of four, including myself. I've been with the company for almost four years, while my teammates joined last year.

I knew being a team lead would be tough, but things got harder than expected. My team started distancing themselves, making it challenging to motivate and lead them.

During this time, I participated in a Managerial Accelerator Program with several 2-3 day courses spread over the year. They were helpful, but applying what I learned was hard because our department was poorly structured by my predecessor (who's now the country manager). Still, I saw this as a growth opportunity.

This year, the company hit a major financial crisis, owing hundreds of millions to clinics. As Customer Success Manager, I had to handle complaints about suspended services. It was clear the company couldn't pay its obligations, leading to ongoing service disruptions. We had to mislead clients about the situation, which sucked.

My team got super frustrated and demoralized. They complained about creating new communications for clients, and with management's ever-extending timelines, it was impossible to provide good solutions.

Adding to our misery, our Portal/App was riddled with bugs. New bugs popped up daily, and the engineering team was too swamped to fix them, only patching some and backlogging the rest. Bugs multiplied faster than they could fix them.

So, we were dealing with two major problems with no clear solution. My attempts to motivate the team and get their input didn't help. All my teammates are female, and I'm the only guy, which might be a factor.

Today, I met with my country manager and asked about my confirmation as the Customer Success Head. He said I wasn't ready yet but praised my potential, passion, and serious approach. He appreciated the bridges I built with other departments and my efforts to streamline processes and escalate bugs efficiently—something overlooked before I took over.

However, he pointed out that I hadn't gained my team's respect as a leader, so he couldn't appoint me as the department head yet. Instead, he proposed a six-month extension to see if things improve. I've genuinely tried to improve team dynamics and create a positive environment, engaging in non-work chats, lunches, and various approaches, but it seems my manager sees their lack of trust in me.

I suggested if I couldn't be confirmed as head, I'd be interested in an assistant manager role. He was open to considering this after their upcoming top management retreat.

But now, I'm having second thoughts. I'm the only one in the Management Accelerator Program to have completed all the tasks, including interviewing top-level managers, but I still haven't been confirmed. Other participants passed, but one doesn't manage anyone, and the other oversees just one person. I feel unfairly treated since I've managed a team of three and facilitated communication with other departments, taking on a significant workload and dealing with difficult interactions.

I have to decide by tomorrow:

1. Stick to the plan and push through the next six months, hoping my team will eventually respect me enough to get confirmed.
2. Request to be confirmed as an assistant manager (there's no current Head of Customer Success, so I'd work with the country manager).
3. Become a sole contributor and give up my acting manager responsibilities from the past year.

Honestly, management wants me to stay on and keep expanding my current responsibilities without real confirmation. I think I should go back to being a sole contributor and start looking for a new job since there's no point in taking a lower-grade assistant manager role while still doing the same work as a full manager.

Any thoughts?

\*\*TL;DR:\*\*

Got promoted to Head of Customer Success/Team Lead almost a year ago. Faced challenges with a distancing team, a company financial crisis, and a buggy product. Despite efforts and completing a Managerial Accelerator Program, I haven't gained my team's respect. My country manager suggested a six-month extension before confirming me. Considering either pushing through, requesting to be an assistant manager, or going back to being a sole contributor and looking for a new job.

1d471mm,"Do I keep my hopes up, or do I throw in the towel?","Yesterday I just had my final round of interviews with company A for an Operational Excellence Internship Position. Let me give you all some background prior to this interview.

When I applied to company A, I originally applied and interviewed for a Supply Chain Internship. During the first interview, I was speaking with HR. As the first interview progresses, they felt like I would be a better fit in another position. I disagreed as I thought I was losing out on an opportunity, and wasn’t sure where it was going. 

A couple weeks later, HR calls me and tells me that the Operational Excellence Manager wants to meet with me, and that interview was today. From my understanding, she seemed to move me to another position where she thought I would do well in.

Fast forward to yesterday, I had my interview for the position and it seemed to go smoothly, for the most part. The manager asked me if I had experience in AutoCad, and I unfortunately didn’t so I said no. The position prefers you to have experience in Autocad and Solidworks (I have experience in Solidworks). However I explained to the manager I would be willing to learn the basics before the position starts, so that way I come in with knowledge. Other than that, I checked every box from the questions the manager asked me.

I have a feeling that just because I don’t have one skill, I won’t be able to match up to the positions requirements, which makes me feel I missed out on an opportunity.

I talked a couple people today, and they think I got accepted because the HR person saw me, saw my qualities, and moved me to where they thought I would be successful. Additionally, I think they are making the final decision in hiring. 

Lastly, I sent a follow up email to HR and the Operational Excellence Manager thanking them for the opportunity to speak with them. I highlighted my soft skills in the email, and hoped they’d consider me for future opportunities if not the one I interviewed for.

With everything that was said, I feel hopeless against the two other candidates i’m going against (there is 1 opening for the position).  I did everything I could do. Other people think that i’ll be successful, but after the amount of applications I sent to companies, as well as a repeating cycle of rejection and interviews, i’m not sure how to feel at this point. I could be overthinking, but i’m not sure.

Please provide me with some advice if you can. But like the question says, should I continue to hold on or throw in the towel?

1d46pth,Needing advice regarding my confused career outlook,"Hi,

I am a 28 y/o male with a BS in Business Intelligence and Analytics, and currently a Office Supervisor in a medical department in a well known regional hospital. My pay is significantly lower than nearby hospitals, at least by 40%. Over the last 2 year I have applied for hospital IT/IS positions and cannot get an interview due to in experience from what I can assume. Have had several interviews outside of my current organization for high paying positions that did not go by my way and I am starting to worry my supervisor experience isn't enough (4 years as a supervisor). I did get to a third interview for a position within my current employer, but could tell the moment I entered the office the V.P. was not interested, call my crazy but you can read the room, especially when it is a position you really want. Anyways, I want to get into a position that is not supervising but is in the realm of IT/IS or Project Management. Any suggestions as to what I should do to assist my inexperience?

Lastly, I accepted an interview for a medical organization with sub-par glassdoor reviews. It would be for a $12 raise for me while doing the same duties I am doing now with some extra duties like managing grants. Should I take the interview, especially with the reviews? I am interested in the taking the position to make more money in this tough economy until I can land a position in the desired field.

1d451nv,Boss just called in to a meeting from a vacation resort,"My boss is on vacation. Only a few people knew she is on vacation; I was not one of them. Her calendar is just full as her calendar is always full. She's responding to my emails and teams messages. But she's actually at a resort. 

This morning at a meeting at 9am, a colleague of hers on the call teased her about it and them I'm like... wait a second. I could hear kids in the background, she sounded like she was outdoors and I realized why for the past two days her meetings were always off camera. She'd been saying her internet connection was bad ... but she was at a resort! 

Everyone deserves to take vacation and time off but when you do it like this the message you are sending me is that if I am on vacation and there's a meeting I need to be at then I better be prepared to get on that call. Because if she can get on that call then I should be able to respond to her messages and calls and meeting requests at whatever day and time. And that the reason she makes literally 3X my salary is because she is willing to get on calls from wherever the hell she is and whatever she is doing. 

This is so toxic. And I get this is why she thinks she makes a huge salary. But its her TEAM that makes her look good. The people working day in and day out who are making things happen. And when they are on vacation, they deserve an uninterrupted vacation.

1d43nmt,"BS in Economics unhappy with first job out of college, wondering my best course of action","Hi there! This is coming from a throwaway named after Paulie Gaultieri's mom from the Sopranos.

**The Hiring**

Anyways, in December I graduated from UMASS Amherst with a bachelor's degree in Economics and a concentration in Business. I graduated with a pretty good GPA (3.7) and was able to get out a semester earlier than the people I started school with. I worked two jobs while at school, a dish room supervisor job starting in September of 2021, and a Solar Panel Sales job starting in January of 2023.

I began searching for my first career job around September and was not getting anything promising until around February (to be fair I was initially using Indeed, which is a pretty bad platform for finding career-type jobs). I used a connection I had from High School to get into contact with the BDR Manager at HubSpot, but we played phone tag with each other for over a month (people are busy, it happens). Anyways, while I was waiting on the HubSpot guy to respond to set up a time to talk, I got a message from a friend of mine's father (call him John) who runs a small commercial real estate brokerage in Eastern Massachusetts. He mentioned that he would like to interview with me and potentially give me an opportunity to work for him. I confirmed a meeting with him as his firm as been around for over 25 years, and although it is a small company, he has done very well for himself.

Our first meeting was very preliminary, but John fluffed up the job that I would be doing to a high degree. He said that I would be working alongside him for 3 months in an internship environment. He said that his guys get into the office between 8-9 (which is very reasonable), that I would actively be working towards getting my Real Estate License during work so that I did not have to focus on it while at home, and that this is a great opportunity for anyone that is interested in Commercial Real Estate. From the first meeting, I knew the risks of working at this firm. I did research and found that the longest-serving member of the firm (apart from John) was his daughter's boyfriend, who had been there for only 2 years (very nice guy). According to LinkedIn, the other two brokers (in CRE Agents are called Brokers) had both been at this firm for under a year. Despite all of this information, I still agreed to coming in for a second meeting with John a couple of weeks from my first.

Right after my meeting with the CRE firm, I was able to hop on a call with the HubSpot BDR Manager. We had a great conversation. He was transparent with me about the hiring process, and I was transparent with him about the position I was likely being offered in the coming weeks. He told me to try out the CRE position and if I didn't like it, I could come talk to him about interviewing at HubSpot. I thanked him for being honest and kind to me, and planned on taking whatever offer John at the CRE firm gave me.

  
**The Beginning**

I was offered an internship position by John getting paid very little ($800 a week) and working long hours (initially he wanted 55 hours a week but I talked him down to 50). I told him that I would do it, but that I had to be trained as well as I would be at a large firm. He assured me that my training would be **better** than any large firm, as I would be working directly alongside him. I had a start date of March 18th.

The first month wasn't bad. I was learning a lot, going into the field to see how leads are generated and deals are started. I was also learning the basics of the CRE industry, how to type out agreements etc. However, I started to notice the problems around the 4th week.

**Problems Arise**

As I began to notice problems with the firm, the entire internship began to get worse and worse. 

**1. John would not let me do my Real Estate Course while at work like he said. The way the course is structured, you can do 19 hours of on-demand learning, with the remaining 21 hours being live, scheduled hours that occur around 5 times a week, usually during work time. This meant that I was limited heavily by the scheduled classes, as if they occurred before 5:30pm, I would not be able to attend (my boss did not know how the class was set up). If I asked to do a lesson during work hours because it was live, John would say ""I'm not paying you to do that.""**

**2. There was no structure for the first month. Once John realized my internship needed structure to continue being effective, he made me a schedule that I could follow if I was not busy at that specific time. John marketed this first month as ""the orientation month"" which I saw through immediately as ""we weren't prepared to have you here but now we are trying to catch up""**

**3. The items on the schedule were never explained to me. I would have to go out of my way to ask other people at the firm how to perform the items on my schedule.**

**4. After the 3rd week, John began taking long vacations. Since April 15th he has been in the office for 1 week and was on vacation for 4, forwarding me emails that are way out of my purview and telling me to figure them out. Yesterday I was told to call a town water company and schedule a final meter reading for a property closing. I mentioned it to one of the brokers and he said ""why are you doing that? That is John's job, not yours."" (I successfully did it anyways).**

**5. I drive a 2006 Subaru Outback with 188,000 miles on it. Even with my horrible wage that comes out to $16/hr, John told me that I need to get a new car at my own expense. He then recommended a Mercedes SUV, saw that those cost $80,000, and said ""I guess it may be a bit out of your price range""**

**6. John overall does not know how to manage people. The two office workers he has are overworked and stressed out. John will say one thing one day, then do a complete 180 degree turn and say another thing the day after. He asked me to write out an agreement for a client while he was away. I responded saying ""I will get right on it"" and he responded ""please stick to the schedule we gave you."" When he gave me the schedule he said ""this schedule is for you to refer to when you do not have anything to do""**

**7. There is some nepotism going on at the firm. John's middle daughter's boyfriend works there, and John's youngest daughter's fiancé will be working there starting in June. John has spent the last 2 months developing his future son-in-laws territory for him while the kid finishes up college (has never done brokerage before). John would compare me to his future son in law, saying ""well Mike would come in at 7am and do his real estate course every day. Why can't you?""**

  
I have spent the last month going over what I could have done differently, and what I should do when my internship is finished on Friday of next week. Should I continue at this firm? Should I call back the guy at HubSpot? Will it look bad for my resume if I leave after only 3 months or will it not matter because the Internship itself was only set to be for 3 months.

1d43mmy,Working on a strategy for returning to the workforce,"Background: Late 50s, looking to return to work after 2 year absence related to my own health condition. Following surgery last week (thyroid, so not easy to hide) I should be cured. 

I have a bachelor’s degree (psych/math) from a highly selective college from back in the day, and a teaching license from Texas, where I no longer live. I am a displaced homemaker, and returned to school for an associate’s degree in accounting in 2008. I worked clerical jobs for a while, before landing in payroll. I have over 10 years experience in that field, and would love to be able to return to that, but understand that I may not be able to. 

Besides my age and the fact that I haven’t worked in two years, I have a couple of major sticking points for any application, so I would appreciate help forming strategies to get ahead of these things so I can get my life back. 

One thing is that I was fired from my last position for snapping (verbally) at my manager. At that point, I had already been sick for a year and was in a lot of pain. I acknowledge the incident but also hold that it was completely out of character under circumstances that I hope never occur again. 

I had another period of unemployment from Aug 2019 to August 2020. I left a payroll position in 2019 to care for my mom for six months or so, and then the pandemic hit. The interviews I had 2 years ago, before I got so sick I had to stop looking, gave me the impression that this gap would be tough to overcome. 

I also have a reference problem. I had a great relationship with one former supervisor, and stayed in touch until he passed from COVID. I don’t have any other supervisory references at present. 

In my area, even temp positions require tons of application and interviews. I’m certainly willing to do that, but I’d like to have a strategy. 

I’m sure I’m forgetting some crucial bit of information so ask away. I’m going to post in a couple of subs in hopes of having a variety of perspectives.

1d42pps,Should I leave fully remote (underpaid role) to take hybrid role?,"As title says, potentially leaving current totally remote (no return to office ever) role which is underpaid, and slightly dead end due to the company I work for. However mostly stress free and one that I know like the back of my hand, for a different role within the same industry although a pivot to a different specialty and therefore will require training/somewhat starting from the bottom as it were. 

**Company A (new company)**

* The new role is with a very well respected company, but has a corporate presence in my city. 

* The role is hybrid - 3 days in office/2 WFH. The commute is about 30 mins each way (traffic dependent). They do seem extremely flexible with this too, and allow flex time and if you need to just do a half day in office that is fine and counts.  

* New role is 40% increase in salary, however with PTO broken out is slightly less than my role now which is generous with giving us longer than average holiday breaks (half day on Friday of MMD and Monday off for instance).
 
* During the interview process, I couldn't help but notice a lot of the managers being quite young IMO (mid-20s males) with the same amount of experience as me in the industry most started there as interns and were hired on and moved up, and as an mid 30s female who would be reporting to them, feels odd?? 

* During the interview process I met 7 people - 1 was a female, to me that felt notable. 

My family and I have discussed and although the increase would be great, it wouldn't drastically change any circumstances, except be a nice boost as my partner is the big earner. Aka, we would maybe be getting a new car for me and it wouldn't feel like a stretch. We are DINKs but there is potentially kids in the future. We own our home and have being homeowners in our city for only 6 months, so we do not really utilize the whole WFH thing to do anything crazy.

**Current Company**
* I am not even sure I want to stay in the industry I am in, but I do wonder if it's largely because of the company I work for and small team I am on - making it feel overly insular. 

* I really enjoy WFH, but have been doing it now since 2020 and I do feel that my social life has suffered, I am already a homebody and with WFH I have to push myself even more to even get out.

* There are no more growth opportunities, and I am paid below average for someone of my experience and for the role itself

* I was told by HR I was at the bottom of my salary band - all this with ""exceeds expectations"" on all performance reviews in the past 4 years.

* My company does know that I received another offer and they stated they would not and could not compete. That meant literally - nothing. Not even more PTO or slight bump in pay *even* with a supposed pay review in the coming weeks. I am assuming that it is because this salary I revealed is close to what my manager makes who has never left the company and according to her has never looked at Glassdoor etc to see their market value.

**Additionally...**

To complicate matters - I now have an interview with a company I really would like to work for (even more than the other), for a role I could easily slide into - no change in what I was doing for the most part, and would be a potentially entering into 6 figure salary, and nearly doubling what I make now. It is also hybrid - 3 days in office, 2 days WFH. Similar commute, however with the pay I would find it easier in a sense to muster through and make that change. I would rather work at this company, but as I have an offer with the other company and actually have a set start date mid month, am I pushing my luck? 

I have not put in my notice, as when I do they will let me go same day so I am bidding my time while all of these things bounce in my head. 

Any insight or input would be lovely.

1d42lzm,Industrial eng or Accounting,"Hi all,

You may have seen my post comparing I.E to CS, now i’d like to compare accounting

Just to recap:

I’m currently a 2nd year CS student considering switching into either accounting or I.E. 

I was wondering which degree would be better to pursue.

My father owns several successful liquor store businesses and my ultimate goal is eventually take it over and expand/ or even start a business of my own, whether its liquor or something else

The purpose for my degree would be more so for: 

1.  I can learn skills which I can apply to a business or make a business out of it

2. build some early capital in which I can invest and fund into businesses 

3. to have a stable ""backup"" degree if for whatever reason owning a business doesn't work out for me. 





I also see  quite a bit accountants making a shitload of money, even sometimes on par with doctors/surgeons.  

Industrial Engineering seems like a good option too. Being such as versatile degree. 

However, I’m not sure what business I can make out it, such as an Accountant can own their own firm.  Nonetheless I’m sure I.E will also teach me skills that can be applied to business.

Also, i don’t plan on forgetting how to code, I’ll likely pursue a minor in CS since I already fulfil it 

please let me know your thoughts !

I've been at my company for around 4 years in 3 different job roles, the reasons for the moves were usually just normal rotations as I was brought in as a trainee.

I passed probation fine and have been in my current role around 6 months.

I've recently been anxious that I'm getting fired, or that I'm going to be made redundant etc. This is mostly because I have very little feedback from my manager or boss and sometimes feel like I have made small mistakes and missed things.
Furthermore, my boss, (I'll call her P) has recently been having lots of meetings with HR, and also a two day seminar about having difficult conversations with employees.

When I've asked my line manager (I'll call her M, ) for feedback, its mostly been positive. This made me feel better for about a week, but now I'm back to worrying. I even asked M if P had given any feedback and she reiterated that all was fine.

Help? Am I going mad? Should I be worried about these meetings?

I was promised I’d be in a job working with a senior member of staff / commercial team. They are well aware of my skills and certain areas I am lacking in. 

Still they’ve put me on a £10million project with no support. The people suppose to help me just ignore me or give me very little advice or support. The operations team are awful and don’t help with anything related to the commercial side. This would be ok if I wasn’t alone. They sold me this project because they said the ops team get involved in a lot of the commercial tasks. They do not. 

The company I am consulting for have changed job costing systems and recently lost all their server information. I was told one specific task would be done by another member of staff but as she is remote, it’s fallen on me to do. They refuse to do anything remote. But when I am on site, I get nothing. Always palmed off, told they are busy. Nothing is getting done. 

I am so stressed I wake up in the middle of the night every night. I dread work. It is effecting my personal life. I am numb to all of this and I hate that I left such a good job for such a sh!t show. 

Please how do I ask to be moved on to another project? I know I run the risk of them just getting rid of me but at this point I do not care I cannot do this anymore. I am on the verge of having panic attacks. 

Please can you help with any advice? I do have another job lined up but I turned it down as wasn’t sure I was capable and also I didn’t want to switch so soon.

1d3zatc,What career choices should I make?,"I am (24M) living in Socal. I want to seek some advice about my career choices. I have an associates degree in Automotive Technology(Basically electrical side of car industry) and an associates in human behavioral science(genuinely don't know how I got this degree) . Right now I am deciding on 3 career paths. I've dabbled in a few career fields. I have ""decent"" electrical knowledge as I know ""enough"" to wire up a car and tuning(ECU, A/F ratio, fuel tables, ignition tables). I did 2 years of nursing major in college(it was alright). I also have a decent knowledge in computers(not coding). My current job is physical security. I sit in a room and watch the cameras by myself and noone bothers me, literally. Paid 21/hr.

Here are the career paths and how long it would take to complete

1. Electrician(join through IBEW union, paid apprenticeship starts at 21/hr and caps out at 45/hr, about 4-5 years to become licensed and make +52/hr)
2. Registered Nurse/ADN(will probably take another 3 years to complete and get an associates degree, starting pay is above 40/hr, no limit on top salary)
3. Cybersecurity(If I go this route I will have an associates degree and comptia certs finished in 6 months, starting pay is around +20/hr, no limit on top salary)
4. If all else fails, voluntarily become homeless.",xyzoof,1,1.0,0,1717058442,2024-05-30 08:40:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d3zatc/what_career_choices_should_i_make/,5,2024
1d3yome,I’m in my late 30’s and thinking of starting over. Am I too late to start a career in advertising?,"I’m in my late 30’s, married to a phenomenal woman and we have two kids. I make about $60k with my current job and my wife (early 30’s) makes about $80k. I feel terrible that my wife makes more than I do. She’s amazing so she never makes me feel bad about it, she never complains, or even brings it up, but I would love to make enough money for her to relax a little bit and let me take the majority of the financial responsibilities. Cost of living in our state is one of the highest in the country with no signs of slowing down. We make enough to pay our bills and have a little extra to have fun with the kids— but with our income, we cannot afford a decent house (homes in decent areas, near decent schools are in the $600k range in our state). And it’s true that my income will increase with regular raises, but I would be pretty much topped out until retirement if I stay where I am. I’m in school and will have my associates degree in a year. My wife has said that if I want to go get my bachelors then she will be in full support of me pursuing that, and she will support whatever field that I want to go in to.

I have been thinking about PR and Advertising. I am extremely creative, I’ve played music my whole life and used to play professionally, but there is almost no money in performing. Advertising is a far cry from what I do now. I work in middle management for a logistics company and I love my team, I love the company, but it’s a family run company and I just don’t have a future there. And I feel like PR and Advertising would scratch that itch that I feel to be creative.

Am I too old to pursue a career in advertising? I’ll be in my early 40’s by the time I graduate. Am I going to be this weird old guy who is applying for junior advertising jobs where I’m competing with hip young 23 year olds?

And my last question is; even if I took a pay decrease to start out, could I end up making more money ($90,000+) within a few years?

I do have a backup—if it wouldn’t be feasible to start a career in advertising, my plan is to go to school to learn how to code and do web development. (Maybe I’m too old for that too??)

1d3y4go,Masters decision ,"Hey all,

Presently I have over 3 years of work experience in finance. Now I’m planning to do my masters for my professional development. 
Recently I have a peaked interest in business analytics and I’m considering to pursue a Masters in Business Analytics. After the completion of my masters, will I get an entry level position (since I have no prior professional experience in the field) or is it possible to get a management level job?

My other option is the obvious Master’s in Finance. But I feel I would have to take up more certifications such CFA, CIMA etc. later to keep growing in the field. Is what I’m assuming incorrect? 

What would you guys recommend and what are your opinions regarding the above.

1d3xrrc,Confused about moving countries for education!!,"So I will be studying my masters degree in United States starting next month. I am an international student from Asia. I made this decision of moving to the United States because I don’t want to settle down in my home country. I wanted to pursue higher education somewhere where “education” was better. 

I decided to move to the United States because the quality of education and job prospects seemed better over there. Now that it’s almost time for me to move to the states, I am so confused on whether I have made the right decision or not?? 
For me earning money and the quality of education I’m getting were always important factors but the more I do the research the more I am inclining towards European countries, considering the quality of life/work life balance, safety and other benefits. 

I have come to a conclusion, as now that I have made my decision move to the states to pursue my education. I will do that and work there maybe for a couple of years and then in the future look for moving to a country where the work life balance would be better.

I don’t know how this would work out as the more people I talk to everyone seems to recommend me studying at a place where I see myself settling down in future. 

I’m so confused!!!!! 
Am I wasting my money?  am I just wasting my time??

1d3whva,The start of me buying a house was some random girl I worked with.,"There was this girl I was working with. We were both on low wages. Something like 25 an hour I dont remember. And I saved up money and bought a playstation. I usually had just enough money for bills and food and booze and what not.

  
And we were talking and she just nonchalant throws ""im almost up to 25k saved"". And I didnt believe her. I thought she was lying. I asked her to prove it. Sure enough in her bank account she was just about to hit 25k saved.

I asked how she managed to save it and she said she just didnt buy anything for a long time. (so obvious right? LOL)



Anyways that girl ends up spending her saving on a trip overseas. Personally I consider that a waste but you only live once so spend it the way you choose to spend it. Now, some years later, she married and does temp jobs with her hubby in random rural areas. Seems pretty fun actually lol.

  
But that taught me something HUGE. You can save money. No matter what your income is. As long as its higher than your expenses.



I started not going out on the weekends. I started eating cheaply. I started buying NOTHING. For years all my belongings fit in a backpack. I swapped cars to a bicycle. I saved on rego and fuel.

  
I got enough money to start a side hustle. That side hustle completely fell apart and I ended up losing money. But whats crazy about equity.... is you keep it.

  
Over a 2 year period I built up 100k ish of equity and ended up losing 35k in the end. Was a horrible year. I felt like a loser. I felt like all my dreams fell apart. I almost had this business. Covid killed me basically.

  
I pieced away the whole business. And had a little under 100k.



  
What I'm trying to convey here.... in long drawn out ramblings.... me working towards a goal gave me the motivation to save my pennies and reinvest everything into a business. And even though that business failed it left me with a huge amount of money which I recently have put as a down payment on a dream home.



I may be back to the 9-5 grind. But I know exactly the path out of it.",Electronic_Milk6415,2,0.5199999809265137,10,1717046423,2024-05-30 05:20:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d3whva/the_start_of_me_buying_a_house_was_some_random/,5,2024

1d3w9po,22M who cannot stop stressing about the future.,"Hi all this may be a longer post so I will create a TL:DR for anyone not wanting to read it all.

(Apologies in advance for any formatting flaws, I’m using mobile)

TL:DR - Have 2 college degrees and got a job as an electrician, but want to go into med school to become a physician. Worrying about losing the opportunity to become an electrician, how to schedule classes and work, and how I will afford life the next few years. 

For anyone wanting the details here it goes. I just graduated with masters in business management after getting my bachelor’s in psychology. I have also been working trade-like jobs since I was 16 so I know my way around blue-collar work, but have credentials for white-collar work. Ever since I started college I kept tossing the idea of medical school around but never pursued it (which I regret). 

Just recently I got a job with the IBEW, an electricians union where I start my apprenticeship in July. I have also decided to pursue med school on top of the apprenticeship. Now I know I cannot do both at once, but my dilemma lies with my salary and the time I have to fit things into my schedule.

The salary I get will be low, almost too low to live on my own which sucks. The other issue is I need to take my chemistry pre requisites before I take the MCATS and apply for medical school, which would take me 2-3 years if I slacked a bit. The issue is, with trades your work isn’t very flexible and I worry that the chem classes I need will not be available at times that I need them, or I won’t be able to rearrange my schedule for work to fit my class schedule.

I have found a few jobs that pay more and are affiliated with the university that I will most likely be taking classes at, but this means I will give up the opportunity to be a part of a highly sought after apprenticeship program. It’s an option but I’m not sure if it’s the right one. 

Lastly, I am 22 turning 23 soon and if I were to grind out pre rec classes I could technically apply to med school by 2025 or 2026 meaning I would start med school at 25 years old (if accepted) and be done with everything by my early 30s, WHICH IS IDEAL. But what is eating at me, is I will have to give up the opportunity to become an electrician. 

Now looking at this post it’s easy to just say, “choose one or the other you can’t do both” and you are right, but WHAT IF I could be educated for a few years as an electrician and then go to med school starting early enough that I would become a physician by my early 30s. 

So I guess to try and make things easier to understand, I’m worried about these things:

1. How can I fit in classes with my work schedule at 40hrs a week?

2. Do I stick with the Union and try to make both work until I need to solely focus on medicine? Or do I get a less stressful job to supplement pay for the next couple years? 

3. I really like the opportunity to become an electrician and learn a trade but I don’t want to start med school too late. 

I really hope this all makes sense, and it’s not incoherent rambling. I would really appreciate your thoughts, and thank you for reading (if you did).

1d3vgku,How to follow-up: after the final interview,"I’ve been unemployed for about 5 months. I’ve had three rounds of interviews, after each one, the recruiter said I was their number one choice. He told me I was the first candidate the VP liked after six weeks of interviews. The last interview was with the VP, Senior Management and C-Suite. Total, there were ten people on this “panel” interview. For a Director role, this may have been overkill and was certainly intimidating. But, the feedback I got was awesome and they told me they’d have some good news to share at the end of the week. Because it was a holiday on Monday, I wasn’t surprised I didn’t hear from them. The recruiter sent me an email on Tuesday saying that they had another candidate to interview this friday and they’d be back with me on Monday. This is counterintuitive to what I was told: the recruiter told me they had no other candidates and I was perfect for the role. Setting that aside, should I send the VP some sort of email reiterating my interest in the role? I have sent thank you emails after every interview, but not sure how that would come across here.

I worked at (redacted 🤬) for three years, and my experience was overwhelmingly negative. The management is incompetent, particularly my manager, who took pride in not knowing how to use Epic yet was somehow responsible for managing Epic analysts. This lack of knowledge trickled down, creating a chaotic and inefficient work environment.

A prime example of the poor management practices was the frequent ""team bonding"" sessions, which were just an excuse for the manager to drink during work hours, from 3:00 to 5:00 PM. These gatherings were not only unproductive but also unprofessional, contributing nothing to our work or skills.

Speaking of skills, there was absolutely no training provided. None of the staff could get the certifications or badges required to meet Epic standards, leaving us ill-equipped and unsupported. Despite being online, the team's communication was abysmal. Asking a question would often be met with silence, making it nearly impossible to get any work done efficiently.

As if things weren't bad enough, the company has now outsourced their IT department.

I honestly wasn’t great I didn’t want to make the tough call or make ppl mad which doesn’t work for sales. I have great customer service skills I have great phone manner but not sales. After 4 months my boss basically offered for me to take a different position or leave. Because of pride I left my life spiraled in terms of career I didn’t have a back up and was jumping job to job because I was miserable everywhere. 

I have been working this bilingual scheduling coordination job ( I feel like a receptionist tbh) at a doctors office. I hate this office,my co workers get in my nerves and the doctor is sooooooooooo RUDE he has his moments when he’s a nice person. The office is ran terribly every time I pick up the phone someone is complaining and they always have new rules about something.


I reached out to my old boss and basically asked if he had any open position in the business office. He off the bat told me the chances of him rehiring me were slim but I still decided to0"" forward with a meeting. 


After talking he basically said he would want me to do a different customer facing role but I would be making $5 less than I make now. My current job doesn’t offer any benefits besides pto. My old job has ALL of the benefits. He said he would let know in 2-3 weeks. I obviously would be comfortable in my old job since I was there before and as far as I know I’m mostly well liked but low key I would be a little embarrassed since it’s taking a step back because this role he talked about is imo equivalent of a receptionist. Also ppl I trained and started with would be higher up than me. At least he said after 6 months I could move up.sorry if I rambled


If he offers the job is it a good idea to take it or not? It’s less money but full benefits but the other job is more money and I’m getting a different type of experience.

I just don’t know what to do and am just looking for advice. 

I don’t mind putting in the work, but time is valuable and I don’t want to invest myself so heavily and end up wasting the effort when it could’ve been better spent elsewhere. 

I’m open to other industries as well but essentially just looking for a way to earn no less than $60k remote work. 

Please help me.

1d3tp35,Share your work blunders and the lessons you've learned! What advice do you have for others?,"

Hey fellow Redditors,

I've been stewing over some work blunders lately, and I thought I'd share my story here. Maybe some of you can relate, or perhaps you'll just get a good chuckle out of my misadventures.

**The Backstory:**

A few months ago, a senior colleague approached me with a favor. He needed help ingesting some data into a different platform—an area outside my usual job description. But hey, I had the knowledge, so I dove in. The trouble started when I didn't follow the data ingestion team's naming conventions. Oops! 🙈

Fast forward to yesterday. I was quietly minding my business when I received a private message. Turns out, I had mistakenly changed default role permissions on a project to a role where anyone who has link to the project can see its content ."" It happened when I was testing a script I was instructed to write to automate project role permission change , at that point that was the only project I had permissions to change the role with my token . I thought I'd reverted the permissions back to its initial state, but clearly, I missed something. Double oops! 🤦‍♂️

**The Fallout:**

The data team lead caught wind of my naming convention mishap and revoked my permission to carry out such tasks. Cue the email call-out. Then, the architect (who apparently moonlights as a detective) discovered my permission slip-up with the project roles. Now, my access has been restricted there too. 🚫

**The Emotional Rollercoaster:**

I'm feeling a mix of embarrassment, frustration, and self-doubt. Why didn't I double-check those naming conventions? How did I miss that permission change? And why does the universe seem to conspire against me months apart? 😩

**The Silver Lining:**

But you know what? We're all human. We make mistakes—sometimes big ones. It's how we learn and grow. So, if you've ever felt like a bumbling fool at work, raise your hand! 🙋‍♀️

And hey, maybe my blunders will serve as a cautionary tale for someone else out there. Check those naming conventions, folks! And don't assume anything when it comes to permissions. 🕵️‍♂️

---

*P.S. If anyone has tips on bouncing back from workplace blunders, please share—I could use some wisdom right now!* 😅

1d3tk8f,Seeking some advice as to what to do post-college,"Hello everyone,

I'm a high school senior who is graduating in a couple days. I just wanted to explain my situation: I was accepted into a good number of colleges, some public and some private, and I have had to pivot my dreams elsewhere after getting rejected from an art program (I initially wanted to be a graphic designer/illustrator). Now, after coming to terms with that news, I decided that I would go obtain my Associates degree in Liberal Arts & Sciences, and then finish a Bachelor of Science program pursuing Professional Communications. I specifically am thinking about a concentration in writing for television (i.e. script-writing) and media reviews for news outlets. 

However, like most high school seniors, my head is swimming with ideas as to which path to take, or where my future is heading in the first place. I have many interests and things that I am skilled at. However, after much deliberation, I realized writing would maybe be the most realistic and lucrative job for what I want to do. Would anyone have any advice or input with this path that I am now going down? I should add I'm also minoring in English, and wish to get my Master's degree in the future.

I decided to accept her offer as she hired me 1st and the other company rejected me initially and chose me secondly. 
I start with the new company tomorrow and am wondering if it's okay to bring doughnuts as a nice way to meet the team and show my new boss that I appreciate her and the higher offer.

1d3srzv,Current company offering me more pay after talking to them about new role with different company,"Currently I work in tech and have a strong position with the organization but with economic hardships we have been having tons of layoffs to different roles and have gone through a bunch of re-orgs. But recently I got a similar role with the Government (under union) which offers similar benefits and a higher salary + pension. BUT they needed my current managers reference which I had to speak to him about - Before giving the go, he mentioned to speak with him and Director to see why I want to leave and how they can fix that. And being honest my primarly reasons are stability which government provides and money. 

They mentioned they can work with the money portion and get back to me in the next couple days. My manager also agreed to provide the reference to the new employer and they have been in contact. The thing is that me and manager had been in disucssions in the next 6-8 months to get to the next level by setting goals and objectives so the increase in $ was coming soon but just not now. 

Now my question is, if my current employer goes higher than what the governemnt role provides, should I stay and accept the earlier increase in pay from them? My manager and director do no want me to leave as they see the talent and high performance but I could also be at risk to be the next one to be let go. I think my current role will be around 7k+ because of the bonus portion which would help but it would still be unstable while the government job allows me to be more stable but with a bit of lower salary. I have yet to give any notice and waiting to hear from my current team but some advice would be nice.

1d3sf74,"Jack of all trades, master of none","Hey guys, seeking some advice here. About 8 years back, I ditched a job at a mid-size company to join my friends tiny video production/photography setup. It's been a whirlwind – I've handled everything from bookkeeping to web design. Now, I'm juggling 2D graphics, accounting, and marketing. My friend/boss has been cool with me trying new stuff, but I've got this nagging imposter syndrome about taking on big design projects solo without mentorship of any kind.

Cut to now, I'm burnt out from the randomness and feeling like a jack of all trades, master of none. Money's alright, but I'm craving mastery in something specific. At 35, I'm having a mid-career crisis, feeling like I'm stuck in a 25-year-old's job. There are only 3 full time employees including myself, but we subcontract a few.

Complicating matters, my boss is practically family (although our personalities clash quite a bit). Leaving feels like bailing on the whole gang. Feeling pretty down and directionless.

Anyone been here? Should I stick it out, go freelance, or maybe start something of my own? Dread the idea of going back to square one in some corporate gig. Appreciate any insights!

My interests as a married childless 35 F:
- cooking/ baking, 
- Nutrition and healthy lifestyle
- Interior design (designed and Aframe cabin which is now a very successful airbnb!)
- Design in general, love any chance to be creative
- I have a desire to have my own business but worried I’m not smart or disciplined enough
- I love my Mexican heritage
- Genuinely Making people happy 
- Solving problems and/or helping someone 

What I don’t like:
- Any kind of super salesy type jobs
- Having to force fake relationships for the sake of business 
- Public speaking and having to over communicate. I’m a shy introvert with social anxiety 😑
- Kissing sucky peoples butts 
- Being told what to do 😬
- Sitting at a desk for long periods of time…I physically feel like crap and get headaches

1d3qemq,Stealing time?,"What are the consequences of stealing time at a job?

For example, my coworker and really good friend clocks into work an hour early. (Our work hours are 8am-5pm.)

She clocks in on her phone at 7am when she wakes up. Takes short lunch breaks despite still eating. Then clocks out whenever she arrives back home after work which is 6:30pm. 

I clock in everyday on the specific times of 8am-5pm and take the hour lunches even if I’m not eating.

She’s gotten so many more hours of overtime and her paycheck is really big. Despite her earning less than me hourly (she showed me her pay). 

My coworkers and I were talking and they were telling me to do it to. Like “man my supervisor doesn’t care at all. I clock in and clock out whenever I feel like it. I stay clocked in until I get home AFTER work.”

I’m scared to clock overtime without permission. I tried asking my supervisor for permission to get overtime after work and she responded with “why do you need more time? Are you not caught up?”  

I’m worried for my friendly coworkers. Am I missing out on more money? Should I just clock in more? What are the repercussions of this if caught?

I’m currently working a 9-5 office job and my position is getting eliminated to save costs. Luckily for me, someone on the team got fired a couple weeks ago and my boss offered me his position instead so I can stay on, but I would still be expected to do that job and my old job at the same time with no pay increase.

Since I’m not hitting 40 hrs a week (I say I average 35 hours probably), they’re not looking to give me a pay increase until I fix my habits (I leave when I have nothing to do and I’m salaried) and look at it again at end of year review where they “might” look at giving me a pay increase then (which is valid).

My 2 year anniversary is coming up in August and tbh I thought about using all my PTO that I receive on my anniversary, but I’m not sure if they would make me liable and pay the PTO back as I would quit soon after. Has anyone quit right after using their PTO? Or been in this sort of situation? 

Either that or I’ll just quit since I’m pretty burnt out and look for a new job then.

1d3piwi,My already overstaffed team just onboarded another new hire. Is this a good or bad sign?,"I work in an office support role. I was hired to replace someone who left the company. When I joined, I was the 8th member of the team. When I got out of training and started working, I quickly realized that the team is overstaffed. There simply isn't enough work to keep everyone busy. After a year on the job, I'm putting in maybe 50% effort and about 15-20 hours of work a week max, and I know for a fact my work output is on the high end for the team. I *think* management thinks my performance is fine. I just had my first annual review and received only positive feedback and a 6% raise.

But I was surprised when my manager recently announced that they are hiring *another* new team member. With our workload already spread so thin, I'm not sure what to make of this new hire. On the one hand, they convinced the CEO and HR to approve a new addition to the team. I'm also no longer the lowest rung on the seniority ladder. But on the other hand, I am already frustrated with how little work there is to do because of us having such an overstaffed team. And adding another person into the work rotation is just going to exacerbate that problem and make it even more apparent.

1d3o7hz,My hours are being cut for no reason. (To my knowledge),"This is a long one so buckle in. I work at a bar, when I started I worked 21 hours a week and everything was going amazing, the owner is very involved, helpful and friendly. My co-workers were also very nice I easily made friends with all but one who I will get onto in a minute. All was well for around a month until all of a sudden my hours dropped to 7 a week with no warning, when I asked the manager apparently a co-worker had complained about me saying I didn’t pull my weight on the shift and that I was lazy when collecting glasses around the bar, he didn’t specify which co-worker it was but I had my suspicions, I’m not the type of person to sit on this news and speculate, so the first thing I did was talk to the 3 co-workers whom I had been on shift with up until this point, I will call them Dave, Jane and Twat,( I had talked to Jane and Dave and both of them despite my concerns of them not being honest seemed genuinely surprised that I had gotten these complaints , one even went as far as saying that I did it the most out of anyone) immediately Twat was the first one that came to my head, the first complaint came at the exact time that I first worked with him and he is also a terrible person to be around, he is condescending, he is a couple years older than I and therefore he is on more money and he never lets you hear the end of it, multiple times he has said inappropriate things to the women that work there and yet the worst he has gotten is a slap on the wrist, he is constantly complaining about others despite him being comfortably the worst employee by far, he claims to have a huge amount of bar experience yet never actually specifies where and when. The night shift which is the only time I worked with Twat usually gets quite busy on a Friday and Saturday and this to me is nothing unusual I have worked in bars like this for years and it’s not necessarily easy but I’m comfortable doing it, Twat however slowed the entire flow of the bar down, with it just being me and him, he slowed the bar down so much, in the time it would take him to get one drink order make it and take payment from the customer I could have done 2-3, and the other co-workers could also have done 2-3, but Twat was incredibly slow. I never took my dislike for Twat as a reason to get him in trouble, a majority of the things about him that I know, have came from other people who have had these experiences with him. So I would only critique him to the manager from a professional standpoint and I was very lenient in what I said about him because I don’t believe as nothing more than an employee I have no reason to be tearing down my fellow co-worker with complaints. If I really wanted to do this I have many things to say about Twat, alongside being slow he also did things that seemed very unprofessional, for example one night the bar was quiet so we were both stood behind the bar and a customer came up to the bar, he started ordering from Twat, I remember distinctly he ordered a double rum and coke , mid sentence Twat pointed at me and walked away from the customer out of the bar to apparently ask the live singer to turn the music down? He could have waited until after the customer had ordered or simply said to me that he thinks the singer needed to lower his music down ( the bar is underneath some apartments so we need to adhere to strict rules about how loud our music is). I also forgot to mention that he acts as if he is the manager when he isn’t, whenever I work with someone I always let them know what I’m doing, if I’m collecting glasses, filling fridges, getting ice or simply popping outside for a breather whilst we’re quiet, which whenever I did was for max maybe 3 minutes just to cool down as the bar gets quiet hot. But Twat seems to think I’m asking for permission when I am simply letting him know what I’m doing so he doesn’t start doing the same task. Anyways I talked to the owner/ manager and they said that they would give me hours back after I told him what I knew and what Jane and Dave had to say, and I did I got back up to 21 hours and I was very happy. The I hear from the new hire that Twat still complains about me saying when I close down of a night he has to clean the whole place again in the morning, no one else has had this complaint the manager comes in at the end of the night to lock up every night and is very adamant on the place being spotless, so I think that this would have been brought up to me if it were true, I found out from this new hire that Twat complains about literally everyone for the stupidest reasons. We serve breakfast of a morning and usually it was Twat working this shift alone, he would on a busy day over a 4-5 hour period get through 20 breakfasts, but we were always flooded with complaints of quality and time, (one customer waited 50 minutes for 2 bacon sandwiches) and then we hired a new chef and on their first busy day they got through 50-60 breakfasts which just brought to light how terrible Twat was at his job. Anyways fast forward to present day and again my hours have gone down to 7 again despite to my knowledge I have never had a customer complaint and I have made maybe one mistake on shift. 

I need the hours I was getting yet for some reasons I keep getting the lowest amount of hours between everyone Twat works roughly 25-30 hours a week and some of the newer hires are getting more hours than me. What should I do from here I really love working in this place (besides being anywhere near Twat) but I will do what’s best for me as I need to work these hours.

1d3nubw,"To start looking elsewhere, talk to manager or try and cope with a feeling of incompetence?","Lately my job has been feeling like a never ending mudslide. On the outside I am thriving. I even got promoted recently without any real pursuit from my side. The pay is more than great for my experience, and my manager lets me to believe they think I am doing great. Yet I feel like I am no actual use in my team and lack any real world skills.

I used to like my job as it varies a lot and I get to learn something interesting every day, but now it feels like most of the stuff I am responsible is not going as it is supposed, and I have no faith I have any idea what I am doing even on things I am supposed to know and was comfortable before. My tasks vary a lot, and I feel I am overreaching (sometimes feels like there is no choice) on stuff I have no real competence. On the other hand I feel there is no opportunity to do so as a few days later I am doing something very different anyway, and coming back to the current things months later. I also struggle with social stuff, which I have been forced to do more lately. On the evenings and weekends I mostly try to escape the bad feelings with tv or sports, as I feel I have no energy to do anything else, and thinking about life feels overwhelming.

I am a recently gradusted engineer with 3yoe (2y 20h/wk or more, 1y full time). Started as a summer internship in a startup, which was later sold to a big org where I am still employed working with the same people. I've been thinking of switching jobs, but I feel I lack valuable skills to be employed anywhere else. Stuff I do is pretty niche. There has been only a handful of relatable job openings in a year. This leaves my options to stay and hope things will work out, or try and switch my career to something else. 

There is not much I know that interests me more than the current job. I am currently earning way over the local market with a similar experience, so switching would probably cut my salary a lot too. I don't feel too good about looking for a job, as I have no clue wheter this is a me problem or not. Changing, taking a salary cut and realizing nothing changed does not sound very exciting. I don't know what to do, but I know I cannot struggle like this forever. Should I try to talk with my manager about how I feel? Feels like it is just a fast lane to PIP and unemployment.",Alternative-Bass4872,1,1.0,0,1717019814,2024-05-29 21:56:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d3nubw/to_start_looking_elsewhere_talk_to_manager_or_try/,5,2024
1d3nriu,Company let me go but want me to freelance,"I was the only remaining person in my department and the company i work for just let me go due to financial downturn. Their plan is to rehire me (restart my dept) in the future. Thing is nobody else knows how to work their proprietary system. They also know this so they’re asking me to stay on a few more days as freelance to finish projects and document my process in case i find another job before they can rehire me. What’s the smart move here? 

More context: The job and employer have been good, I’m not looking to burn bridges but i am not confident the company will improve enough to ever restart my department.

The people who built & taught me this proprietary system moved on years ago and i have individually tweaked/improved the system significantly since; the creators might not remember or recognize any of the system now. The IP is not useful anywhere else. 

My previous life as a freelancer i charged clients 3x the rate i got as a salary employee at this job, they definitely cannot afford me at face value. I took the job because of benefits and consistent pay.

1d3nitr,2nd chance at new internal job.. possibly,"TLDR: applied for an internal job, had interview, got rejected. 4 weeks later hiring manager reaches out for another position on his team. Need advice how to navigate convo/steps this go around 

I work for a large healthcare company. I applied for a new position outside my division about a month ago (let’s say Thursday PM). By Friday AM I had an invite on my calendar for that Monday for interview to speak to 2 people on the team (one was the person I’d backfill and another is a stakeholder). I thought interview went well, sent my thank you emails, they both replied and said great to meet me etc. and didn’t hear anything further about the job. 

2 weeks later I get an automated rejection about the job. Disappointed because it was an internal position and I felt they would have been more open about hiring someone else. I chalked it up to me being the token interview/ HR requirement check mark to say they talked to someone else but really had someone else in mind. 

Last week I get an email from hiring manager that there’s a new position on the team and if I’m still interested I should apply. Said they really enjoyed my background and slightly leaned to someone who had more experience with the space (understood).

We are talking tomorrow about the job, kind of like an informal chat before I apply. Is there anything I should ask in particular in this convo? I really don’t want to go through the same cycle again, but I feel like it means something to some degree since he reached out to me. 

I’m going into it kind of like a casual coffee chat since I already interviewed with him before technically.. and I’m assuming there will be more interviews to come.

1d3mq20,Should I take the job? ,"I’ve been working at a biotech/biopharma company for over 2 years now as a lab tech for their quality control department. There was a massive layoff at the end of last year and I have been considering leaving the company because of its toxic environment for almost a year before that. 

I recently got the opportunity to interview for a lab tech position at a chemical manufacturing company in their research/development department. I live in central Texas where there’s a decrease in biotech jobs, but the chemical field is booming. 

I was offered the position out of 5 other candidates but here are the downsides: 6 month minimum contract (they can’t promise I will be hired full time at the end of the contract but they believe it will be in the budget…) and the hourly wage drops $4 (I could still pay my bills). 

For context, I started at my current company as a contract worker and when I was hired full time, my pay went up $3, so I’m hopeful this is what would happen if offered full time at this new position. Upsides: I can escape my current work environment, switch to a more lucrative field, and get experience in a field that might offer more for me in the long run.

TLDR: Is it worth it to leave my toxic job if my  hourly wage drops by $4 and I’d be a contract employee for a minimum of 6 months? ",theillfatedheroine,1,1.0,2,1717016725,2024-05-29 21:05:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d3mq20/should_i_take_the_job/,5,2024

1d3iyqf,Am I overreacting? ,"I’m not sure if this is the right sub. Idk if this a good flair to use.

I work for small business. I honestly do enjoy my job but my I’m not sure about my employer. 

I started off as hourly. Since then, I’ve become full time. 

The beginning of my employment was a little odd. My employer confided in me about some employees he wanted to fire and asked me how to go about doing that. 

I was taken aback by that question but didn’t think anything of it. I now know that’s seriously wrong. 

I was offered a salary later on and I took it. I also got health insurance. 

I am the only employee that works full time. I am the head of a department. I take on A LOT more hours than everyone else including my employer. I work 6 days a week.

He also like to contact me on my one day off. 

When things are swamped, my employer refuses to help out and will come up with an excuse for why he can’t do it. 

I recently found out that I’m making the same as everyone else in the business. This made me upset but I haven’t said anything since I’m not sure I’m overreacting. 

Recently, my employer called me to tell me about adding more work. Instead of telling me right off the bat, he decided to start off with everything he pays for. My taxes, my health insurance, my pay, my parking spot, etc. I felt like I was being coerced. It was like he was saying I owe him for paying for all this stuff. But I’m thinking, isn’t that the cost of doing business? If you don’t want to pay for an employee, then don’t hire and don’t offer a salary and don’t offer a parking spot. 

He has a high turnover rate with employees. He’s constantly scrambling to find new hires because he can’t keep anyone. Since I’ve been there (less than a year), 5 people have started and quit. 

It was the conversation about my expense that’s made me rethink this job. 

The thing is, I work with clients at this job. I care about all of them. I’d feel bad for leaving. I’m also the last person standing at the business besides one other person who only works one day a week. My employer depends on me. If I quit then I’m not sure what would happen. But I also feel that that’s not my problem. 

My friends tell me to get out of there. But I feel like I’m just not the kind of person to just up and leave everyone to fend for themselves.

1d3ixie,Possibly switching from underpaid remote job for Hybrid role 40% salary increase - is it worth it?,"As title says, potentially leaving current totally remote (no return to office ever) role which is underpaid, and slightly dead end due to the company I work for. However mostly stress free and one that I know like the back of my hand, for a different role within the same industry although a pivot to a different specialty and therefore will require training/somewhat starting from the bottom as it were. 

**Company A (new company)**

* The new role is with a very well respected company, but has a corporate presence in my city. 
* The role is hybrid - 3 days in office/2 WFH. The commute is about 30 mins each way (traffic dependent). They do seem extremely flexible with this too, and allow flex time and if you need to just do a half day in office that is fine and counts.  
* New role is 40% increase in salary, however with PTO broken out is slightly less than my role now which is generous with giving us longer than average holiday breaks (half day on Friday of MMD and Monday off for instance). 
* During the interview process, I couldn't help but notice a lot of the managers being quite young IMO (mid-20s males) with the same amount of experience as me in the industry most started there as interns and were hired on and moved up, and as an mid 30s female who would be reporting to them, feels odd?? 
* During the interview process I met 7 people - 1 was a female, to me that felt notable. 

My family and I have discussed and although the increase would be great, it wouldn't drastically change any circumstances, except be a nice boost as my partner is the big earner. Aka, we would maybe be getting a new car for me and it wouldn't feel like a stretch. We are DINKs but there is potentially kids in the future. We own our home and have being homeowners in our city for only 6 months, so we do not really utilize the whole WFH thing to do anything crazy.

**Current Company**
* I am not even sure I want to stay in the industry I am in, but I do wonder if it's largely because of the company I work for and small team I am on - making it feel overly insular. 
* I really enjoy WFH, but have been doing it now since 2020 and I do feel that my social life has suffered, I am already a homebody and with WFH I have to push myself even more to even get out.
* There are no more growth opportunities, and I am paid below average for someone of my experience and for the role itself
* I was told by HR I was at the bottom of my salary band - all this with ""exceeds expectations"" on all performance reviews in the past 4 years.
* My company does know that I received another offer and they stated they would not and could not compete. That meant literally - nothing. Not even more PTO or slight bump in pay *even* with a supposed pay review in the coming weeks. I am assuming that it is because this salary I revealed is close to what my manager makes who has never left the company and according to her has never looked at Glassdoor etc to see their market value.

**Additionally...**

To complicate matters - I now have an interview with a company I really would like to work for (even more than the other), for a role I could easily slide into - no change in what I was doing for the most part, and would be a potentially entering into 6 figure salary, and nearly doubling what I make now.

1d3iro5,Wife doesn’t understand how good we have things?,"Wife and I have a 15 month old baby. We both agreed that we didn’t want to put her in daycare for a while.

We both work from home and make good salaries for the MCOL area (80k and 70k)

My wife’s job is full time but her boss is very lax and she probably only puts in 25 hours or less a week in the quieter times of year. Sufficient time to watch the baby for some of the day.

We have a baby sitter come for about 8-12 hours of the work week, split over 2-3 days. The rest of the time we watch the baby.

My job needs me for the full 40 hours and is high touch.

My wife is trying to get me to get a better paying job so that she doesn’t have to work, or just part time work. I have told her that she’ll feel a quality of life hit in that case…and that it would be silly anyway since she essentially DOES work part time, from home even!

Who is right here? Does my wife really not see how good we have things? Or am I being insensitive of her mental load with semi-full time work and a larger share of the baby duties?

I have offered to increase the amount of babysitter time to accomodate her workload.

Keep in mind her dad works and her mom works part time with summers off, so she might see that as her model…",SquallidSnake,163,0.8399999737739563,285,1717006217,2024-05-29 18:10:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d3iro5/wife_doesnt_understand_how_good_we_have_things/,5,2024
1d3irdm,Time Off Requests,"Can someone please tell me if my boss is being petty, or am I overreacting?  I am the only one in the office with a supervisor (accounting, under the controller), everyone else reports to the VP of our company. When I got hired the VP told me that as a salaried employee, appointments here and there are fine to take without using PTO, and up to half days as long as my work is finished.  But I don’t think my boss is aware of this. 

Last month, I tried to take a half day as we were taking a red-eye out for vacation and she told me “I have so much work to do today, I don’t know how you’re going to be able to leave at noon”. I got stuck until 3:00 and had to rush to get to the airport. I also recently asked to leave 15mins early to beat traffic to get to my brother’s bday dinner and she told me I should have come to work early to account for it.  Now I have to email her to add doctor’s appointments and time off to a calendar she manages, even though we already had a shared calendar where she could see my appts.

But I did some research and came to know that the material I have to study will be a lot. So, instead, I embarked on a data scientist specialisation which achieved two objectives. First, it gave me a chance to revise stats, maths and probability concepts which I completely forgot. Secondly, I gained a few concepts related to ML and learned about tensor flow and stuff.

Now once I am done with the final exam, I want to stick with the knowledge I gained and apply as a junior data scientist or data analyst. But I am wondering:

I recently graduated (Spring 2023) from undergrad at a top university with a degree in Data Science. After getting my full-time offer rescinded due to market circumstances, I've been looking for a role for months, mainly in software engineering and technical consulting. I recently got a verbal offer for a Data Analyst role offering 85k/yr after I said my salary expectations were in the 90k-100k band and I am preparing myself for negotiating once the official offer comes through.

I understand times are hard right now and I am very grateful that I am getting a chance in today's job market. However, I think I have some leverage in the fact that they are looking for a very versatile employee since they're looking for a decent amount of automation and custom solutions and I have experience with building complex software from scratch, which is a skill that many data analysts are uncomfortable with or may be unfamiliar with. 

My question is, do I even bother with negotiating given I don't have any competing offers as a new grad or do I have enough leverage to get a 5k-10k bump in salary?

1d3icnb,Choosing the best resume for new opportunities?,"Quick background, I recently left a Development Coordinator role (Non-profit) with an organization I had been with for 18 months because they had increased my responsibilities over time and refused to adjust my compensation accordingly. After a long search, I finally found a Manager-level role that aligned with my skillset and started the position a few weeks ago! While I was enthusiastic to start (mostly to depart from my previous role), I've found the office environment to be be quite alienating and as a relatively young individual in the workforce am realizing that I am not quite looking for the level of responsibility that this role has.

My question is: ***What would be my strongest resume for new applications?*** Would it be a bigger detraction to use my ""old"" resume that it says I ended with my previous organization in May 2024 with nothing after it? OR if I was to update my resume, might it look worse to Hiring Managers and Recruiters that there are not any notable accomplishments in the position or that I am looking for another opportunity so quickly after joining a new one?

I know one guy who is a quick worker, but when asked for help he will intentionally be as awfully slow as possible. He will explain like a turtle. In the quietest voice possible. Anything to frustrate you so next time you ask one of the other 4 instrumentation guys. 

Another person tries to get everyone else to do their work, they just compile the results, send in the final email to the boss….. as if they did everything.

1d3i1fx,Higher pay but lower take home amount. Is the switch worth it?,"My job at the moment currently pays me 5k less then what the starting standard should be for my position. However  because its a medium size company, the healthcare cost are average. I have a potential new job. The pay is higher but the healthcare cost are over 4x what I pay now. New job is offering 10k more but with taxes, the take home amount will be half of the 10k and the healthcare will pretty much eat that up but I want to know if may be I’m not analyzing this correctly. Is this new job a financial loss or fail.

***CURRENT JOB***
Yearly pay: 75k
Monthly insurance premium: $104.07 + an extra $5 for vision and dental
Specialty doctor visits: $50 (I have atleast 2 a month, sometime 3)

***NEW JOB***
Yearly pay:85k
Monthly insurance premium: $488.90 (this is their lowest tier. The highest is $670.72)
Specialty doctor visits:$80 ($40 with their other tier options.

Ok, so when I plug in the #s, in the new job, insurance will cost me approximately $4,617.96 more per year then my current job. I also estimate I have approximately 30 speciality doctor visits a year (for on going needs). New plan would be $3,400 spent in a year and currently its $1,500 give or take. Thats a $900 difference. This means the new job would cost me about $5,517.96 more a year (unless I calculated wrong). New job does not come with vision or dental so I would have to get that myself. Everyone thinks I’m crazy because I am not taking a new job with a higher income but when I break it down, it looks like I’ll actually be losing instead of winning. Any thoughts?

I enjoyed my first two Jack of all trades enough at non profits but I no longer live in a city where non profits pay a liveable wage. I have steadily become more and more depressed. I work from home and make great money but cry at work a few times a day because it feels so pointless…so I feel like I have golden handcuffs. Ive known this wasn’t the career for me since sophomore year but was desperate to get out of college as fast I could and just kept doing it. I’m trying to find a new career but everyone I know is in corporate. They mean well but I’m not sure being an auditor will solve my problems. 

At my current job I enjoy stakeholder meetings. There is nothing about the field of marketing or corporate America that interests me beyond that.  My favorite jobs ever were pre grad - resident commm at an old folks home,  food service  , and childcare at a church. I like all people pretty much 100% of the time from kids - elderly, being active, gardening, shopping, problem solving, being in charge of things like a paint project for a friend or moving deputy, planning and hosting parties, travel, reading, hiking, and volunteering with kids/animal shelter dog walking/bingo with the elderly. So really being with people and doing tangible activities. 

I know I’ll have to go back to some kind of  school and as such def want to start around $55k/year bcuz it’ll all be loans.

1d3gmao,I got a 2 year degree and it looks like all I'm going to get is a paycut,"I got a 2 year degree from a local community College to try to advance at my job. 2 of my other coworkers both got the *exact* same degree from the same college the year before I graduated. I know one of them is making $25. I don't know what the other one is making, but he told me that he got a good raise after he got his degree. I'm making 18.80 plus a shift differential that comes out to 95 cents an hour, but it sounds like I'll be losing the shift differential because they're changing how the scheduling works.

I've tried talking to HR, and they both told me that I need a lot of improvement before I can get any raise at all. HR told me that the maximum that I can make is $23 an hour, but only if I'm performing at the same level as my coworkers with ten years of experience. They also said that with improvement I was more likely to get a dollar or two more per hour, but that's what my coworkers *without* degrees are making. I agree that I could use some work, but I've asked and got turned down for additional training because nobody thinks I show any promise.

I know I *could* get another job, but I don't particularly want to because most places want you to start out doing nightshift, and I honestly don't think I could handle that at all, especially not during the summer. Besides this pay bullshit, the job I have now is basically perfect for my life. Besides, if both of my coworkers got raises but I didn't, I feel like this points to this being a me problem. Both of my coworkers are men and I'm a woman, but I don't think that makes a big difference because I doubt a big company would be so blatantly sexist.

Do I just need to accept that I suck and won't make anymore money? Is there some secret to asking for a raise that I'm not understanding?

1d3gf9x,Looking for some guidance/recommendations,"25 Male stuck in a bit of a rut. I currently work at my Dad's sand and gravel business and my main duties are to drive/deliver materials, bill customers, make billing adjustments, submit reports to the various state departments, and perform end of the month financial statement analysis. Unfortunately, the company is struggling quite a bit. Disgruntled employees, cash flow problems, aging equipment, etc. My dad sees the issues as well, but is fairly reluctant to make changes that would remedy these problems. I have recommended reasonable solutions but we haven't worked toward implementing any. I recognize it very well could be attributed to my presentation and overall lack of experience in the industry. As of right now, I feel that I am not really growing, learning anything, and or driving change that will make things better. I also work in a very isolated environment, which I think is exacerbating my perspective on work/the business even more.  

He has aspirations of transitioning to building homes, and while it sounds appealing, I am having a very difficult time seeing how we will manage a faltering business while synchronously growing another. I have had conversations about this with him and it seems as though there is no logistical step by step process in making the transition. He just claims that we will figure it out. Please keep in mind I have an undergrad in Finance, with no building experience. My dad has experience building condos when he was younger, but has been out of practice for the last 30 years. 

I am a very driven individual, was selected to commission in the Navy, but was unfortunately disqualified due to vision problems (visual acuity is fine). Unfortunately, I didn't really handle the disqualification too well,  hence making the easy return to the family business. I was working at an Energy company prior before leaving to make my OCS date.

I guess that the main issue that keeps coming up in my mind is that my progression really depends on my dad's and I don't have the experience/authority to navigate the issues of fixing a business while simultaneously looking to start what would be a new one. I don't want to leave my dad, but I think that I am struggling to maintain a positive perspective on the future. 

Anything you guys have to say will help. Thanks for taking the time to read this. 

Supplemental information: 

- Living at with my parents in order to save for a home. 

- Working through a pretty serious breakup, which I perpetrated and heavily regret. 

- Seeing a counselor to work through these problems, but I think I've plateaued.

The field and what i would be doing sounded great…but It’s a Monday-Friday 9-5 job and that is not what I am looking for! i am looking for more of a nursing type schedule. like 3 days 12 hour shifts or 4x10’s. 

Would it be rude to ask the hiring manager if there are other positions more suited to my schedule preference that she can refer me to?

Mainly heavy lifting. 
Some count jobs with warehousing and some basic maintenance. So now to the question.

I started working at a finishing construction company (flooring, tile, etc) for new homes, in a basic office position. But recently because of my hard work, and someone transferring, they gave me an opportunity to train in the purchasing department. I’m doing good so far despite not having the experience. But down the line there is a potentially opportunity to be an estimator for the company. They don’t have an opening yet, but I have good relations with the estimator and the manager. Not sure the pay scale/difference within the company. I’m a bit lower than I’d like to be atm. Which of the two would have more transferable skills despite not having a college degree? I’d love to make a better living down the line after getting some experience but see mixed things on both career paths. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

1d3e3se,"[Advice Needed] Struggling with New Boss - Feeling Lost and Undervalued

","Hey everyone,

I'm feeling really disheartened and could use some advice. I've been with my company for 5-6 months, and my new boss (previously my colleague) has been making my life difficult since she took over. Recently, she assigned us a presentation task. I spent a week preparing and felt I did a great job, receiving positive feedback from the team.

However, during our first 1-2-1 meeting, she told me she was struggling with me because I seemed too quiet and aloof, and that I didn't seem to enjoy the job. I was shocked because I thought I was doing well and disguising my shyness effectively. When I asked about my presentation, she acted like she barely remembered it and couldn't give me any concrete examples of how I was underperforming.

We've had two more 1-2-1s since, and she keeps harping on about my 'personality' and suggests I attend more work socials and meet-ups. My role was advertised as fully remote, but I don't mind occasional travel if there's a good reason. However, she never gives me a reason, just tells me to arrange 'working days' with colleagues who live far away from me. I have a disabled dog, so arranging travel is a big deal for me.

My previous manager never had any issues with my performance and said travel was optional. I feel like I'm left in the dark and am considering looking for a new job. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you handle it? Any advice on how to navigate this situation would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

TL;DR: New boss (former colleague) criticizes my personality despite my good work. Feeling lost and considering a job change. Advice needed!

1d3bp4p,Thinking about requesting to go to part time from full time...Customer Service ,"I have been debating with myself for some time if (or when) I should ask management to go from my FT to PT. 

I'm working a customer service job currently, its not my career goal however my previous job laid me off with a terrible severance package and I needed another job asap to afford where I live. This job pays well and the team is fantastic however I hate the customers and hate being on phone calls 8 hours daily. 

My mom passed this past August and I inherited her home. I plan on selling very soon and with that money I can continue my education as I never got to finish my degree (My dad passed during my college years and then my mom became sick so I started working full time and never finished). 

I'm struggling about this decision only because I was temp to perm and haven't been at this company a year yet. They hired me FT this past October. I admit I was reluctant to accept but I did and now enjoy the FT benefits. However the nature of this job is really affecting my mental health and since this isn't my career goal, I've been strongly leaning on requesting to go PT so I can actually focus on what I want to do with my education. 

The nature of the job is answering calls and emails from customers. Its not pressing matters or projects with deadlines, just very basic stuff. I just have a fear of stepping on toes with this request as we are still quite busy with a smaller team (less than 20 people) however I would like to go from 40 hours to 25/30 hours a week. 

I am going to wait until I receive the money from the home before placing the request which will be after my 1 year mark but I keep talking myself out of it. I think I just need the push to do it.

1d3bkpo,"English speaking job in a foreign country (Europe), is it possible?","Hello,

I'm interested in hearing your opinion on whether it is possible to find a english speaking job in a foreign country (Europe - Netherlands, Germany, France, Austria, or any other other bigger country...) in (bio)process engineering or similar industries (biotech, pharma, molecular engineering, chemical engineering, clinical studies)?

I come from Croatia and after my studies I would like to explore my options in an international market. I would be willing to learn the language but as of today I know only english and croatian on a level that can be useful in a work environment. After my bachelors I will be a bachelor in biotechnology and for masters I'm considering molecular biotechnology or bioprocess engineering. Both interest me and the same question about availability of me working in a foreign country using english as my primary language arises. I'm writing this for you to know that the question of this post is not related solely to one branch of engineering jobs but rather to the pharma/chemistry industry as a whole. As for work experience - I had 2 student jobs, one was in regulatory affairs which I had for a year and the other one is my current job in clinical trials.

I know that in other industries like IT, language is not the biggest obstacle, but I have a feeling that jobs in chemical industry depend on people interacting with each other daily so the language barrier could be a bigger issue.

Please, tell me your experience on this topic.  
Were you in a similar situation? What were the options you had at the time? How did the interviewers react to you not knowing their language? If you managed to get the job - what is the company you work at, is it a international company and if it isn't, are work colleagues treating you differently because you don't speak their language?",Shablah00,1,1.0,0,1716987485,2024-05-29 12:58:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d3bkpo/english_speaking_job_in_a_foreign_country_europe/,5,2024

1d3b2g7,Regret switching to Salary,"(I'm 31F, immigrant that graduated 3 years ago) I stayed with with my employer since I graduated AND they're helping with visa. 2 months ago I was working 50 hours per week and paycheck was alright with overtime. Management decided it would best best if I moved to salary. They offered a 6 digit salary which had calculated the the overtime I was getting. During this time I poorly attempted to negotiate as my supervisor didn't really encourage negotiation.  
Well after that conversation our company went live with a new erp system that I'm working on and my workload jumped to 60+ hrs per week for the last 2 months which bumped my paycheck more and was actually happy about it. 
Well my supervisor brought up changing me to salary again last week. I said sure, since he said he'll revisit the ""amount we had discussed"". On our one on one meeting he had brought up the original offer but did not consider or factor in my new hours/overtime. It was a still 6 digit salary, and I was late to the one-on-one meeting so felt bad already and signed the ""Payment Change"" form (not a contract). It's working retroactively so the 120 hrs I had worked as hourly got reduced to the salary amount and essentially lost 1K in my paycheck. 
I'm thinking of working just the 80 hours and be behind on my workload since I really don't want to be underpaid. But I'm also kind of a workaholic and don't mind the work, I just am super bitter of the pay-cut essentially. I want to talk with supervisor about it but I just signed last week. Not sure how to increase my salary to match what I used to get paid via hourly.

1d3avzm,Any advice on your former workplace impacting your new workplace?,"I have been working at my current job for about a year now and about 3 months ago I got a “new” boss. This “new” boss is a boss that supervised me 2-3 years ago. For my job, I oversee a handful of sites and support their contracts. Out of the blue one of my sites got reassigned. Mind you, Its one of my top sites. The site recently hired new managers. I asked my boss why was I reassigned and they mentioned that I don’t along well with one of the new hires even-though Im currently working at another site they over see. I quickly rebuttaled and reminded them that I am professional and will not allow some friction interfere with me doing my job. My boss also isnt fond of this person and we’ve actually had multiple conversations about how this person is unfit for the job. When I asked her to elaborate she was dismissive and moved on to something else. Fast forward to this week, I find out the other new hire, that is still in the hiring process, for the site is one of my bosses friends that also worked with us at the former organization 2 years ago. She’s expressed that she doesn’t ever want to work with me- a mutual friend told me long ago. Her and I had totally different perspectives of the work- Im in a social services field and we bumped heads. Now, shes being hired through another branch of our organization and is being over-sought by that team. Then today the person that would be supervising my bosses friend asked me when I would be going back to overseeing the site and I informed them that I wouldn’t be. They were kinda confused then went about their day. Is there anything I can do in this situation? My boss is allowing her friendship and past work experience impact my work. I have great rapport with the existing staff and now have to start over at a new site filling out all new tools. Plus she’s telling me Im being reassigned because Im not doing well with the service provider when I am. Is there anything I could do or any advice on if its worth taking a stance on?

1d3aank,Can This Young Financial Analyst Get Some Advice?,"I’ll start off with what I currently have going. I have a bachelors degree in Business Administration/Finance. I get around $53k a year as a financial analyst at a university in Philadelphia, and I have no debt atm. I live in the city, renting, and I plan on sticking it out at my current job for about a year or so to get some experience under my belt. Especially because I’m only 23.

Now, here are some of my general goals. I’d like to make more, obviously. I’d like to either have my own business one day, or have some nice remote/hybrid job that makes sure I don’t have to worry about bills. My long term girlfriend and I have talked about moving down south to the Carolina’s by the time that we’re 30. I like working in finance, but don’t want to become a personal financial advisor. I like doing budget work through my current job, but I also enjoy the more tech end of finance.

Here are a few ideas I have to spitball at you all and want to hear your input:

1. Masters degree: Big commitment but could be done while working. Certifications could also go under this category. I don’t feel like I need one, but I know it would help. Most likely one in preferential order, most to least; Finance, Data Science, MBA (only if it has a concentration), Statistics or Actuarial Science (if actuary is realistic, see below)
2. Fintech: Fintech has always fascinated me, but it’s always been hard for me to get my foot in the door. I talked to someone about it before who worked in the field, and he recommended doing stuff like learning code and working on technical projects at work when I can. 
3. Middle Management: Stick it out long enough in financial analysis to become a manager. Really not my favorite option, but is the back up plan right now
4. Actuary: This is a recent thought, and I know it takes a lot of work, studying, and experience to get into this role. I do like math quite a bit, but I know if this is where I want to be; I need to be 100% dedicated to it. Masters not required but would really help.

Before anyone adds anything, here are my no-go’s. No accountant, my brother is one and I always hated accounting classes. I do some accounting work right now, and it’s always my least favorite part of the job. No sales, I’ve never been a salesman and hate the idea of depending on commission. I know if you own a business you need to be a bit of a salesman, but some businesses are far more salesman-like than others. 

I’d love to hear your feedback on any of these topics. I think any level of suggestion or even constructive critique would help me out. Especially if you work in one of these fields.

1d36mf3,I hate the job my career path has guided me,"
I'm a 25-year-old woman and I need to change my career path. It's a tough decision for me to make, but I feel like I don't have any other option. 

I currently work as a Microbiologist at a big city hospital. I have my ASCP (M) certification and a bachelor's degree in Biomedical Sciences. The lack of care for patients at my workplace is shocking and unethical. My supervisor has been falsifying maintenance and quality control records for months, and no one seems to care. 

I've tried my best to address these issues but it feels like nobody is listening. The disregard for patient safety has led to investigations into unexpected deaths, and it's heartbreaking. Instead of focusing on fixing the real problems, everyone is more concerned with passing the CAP inspection by any means necessary. 

Working here is taking a toll on my soul. When my supervisor made a joke about not bringing their grandmother to the hospital, it was a wake-up call. People trust us to care for their loved ones, and it's not a responsibility I take lightly. 

I know people might suggest finding a job at a different hospital, but the other major hospital in town is nearly as bad. 

I've been considering my options and looking for advice on potential career paths in the science field that don't involve research or clinical lab work. I'm open to going back to school to gain new skills and knowledge, because I know I deserve better than what I'm experiencing now. It's not just about finding a new job, but finding a workplace where I can truly grow and make a positive impact.

1d357th,Would you reimburse tuition in this situation?,"Hey all,

I am currently awaiting response from HR regarding my tuition reimbursement for a course I am taking this summer.  It’s been a few days and I’m getting a little anxious about their response. 

I am doing an MS in Computer Science as I work full time as a software engr in a research branch. Our company’s policy is they only approve of reimbursement if it’s relevant to the job. In fact they set a new rule recently that I have to ask permission before enrolling for a course. 

I am currently taking a cognitive science course in the program that is still CS oriented and teaches topics relevant to my work. But it has an open ended research project that allows us to explore different facets of cognitive science. The project can be done as a literature review, an experiment, or code related.

Because it’s a very fast summer course and I’ll be in the process of closing a house and moving for the rest of the month, as well as wedding planning I figured I’d take it lightly. I am taking the literature review route and focusing on psychology/learning based research that is enjoyable to me. Unfortunately it’s not relevant to my job except that I am conducting research and practicing it actively throughout the course. 

 If you were responsible for approving tuition reimbursement, would you approve me in this situation? My concern is that they’ll ask me for my research paper by the end of the semester and deny it just because I wanted to focus cognitive learning in cats instead of AI, neural networks extravaganza lol.

1d34yof,Vague bad performance review?,"My company is small and doesnt seem to follow normal work procedures (im in the uk).

My old manager was on a long contract and was very uninvolved, but he tried to help push me to get a promotion before his contract ended. Nothing happened, and i effectively worked without a manager for 5 months.

The project i was on during this time had a lot of issues and poor communication from other teams, and no one in my own to support me. Other teams were borderline bullying in their responses plus there were multiple examples of my work being presented by other people. I wasnt alone in having a mental breakdown whilst on it.

I had no manager/senior support or 121s, no feedback. 

My team finally got a manager a few months after this.

My appraisal was 4 months late, didnt go into any feedback given and was vague on pay increases. They just were interested in discussing new objectives and my strengths.

Yesterday it emerged that my team mates had received a payrise and i hadnt. In the meetings with seniors they said it was due to bad feedback and me not working to my performance targets, this is time to be self aware and change. I had 2 meetings and still dont know what feedback even said, and what markers my performance is judged against. The KPIs my old manager set had been hit, so it was deemed down to feedback including from client (the client has been complained about and is on a performance review).

I want to look for other jobs but my industry is notorious atm for not hiring, and i feel i will do badly in any job i get anyway.

I’m an R&D engineer at a semiconductor company and I'm seeking some advice on my current situation. My company recently went through a major re-org, and I now have a new manager. This is my fourth manager in the two years I’ve been with the company. Unfortunately, my new manager has no idea who I am or what I do, and it doesn’t seem like he cares.

However I'm not that type of person—I like to create things and be productive.

The job pays very well, but I don't particularly enjoy it especially due to the hours. Many of my meetings are on Asia time (5-7PM my time) which cuts deeply into my personal life.

Hi all. Thanks in advance for your help.  

I'm looking at the accounting or HR fields.

BACKGROUND:  I am planning on returning to work after a 10 year stint as a SAHM.  I have a 2008 bachelors degree in management from a now defunct liberal arts college in Vermont.  I was the valedictorian. I have 3 kids and need to make a professional salary.

Until 2014, I worked doing welfare benefit eligibility for the government.  This included SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, etc.

I did an HR internship in college and really enjoyed benefits work. Around that time, my college advisor wanted me to switch to accounting. I took one course and he said I had the potential to do well.

I have the ability to go back to school for either field.

Which field would be more accepting of an older worker?  Discrimination is real.  At this age, which field would allow me to make the most money before retirement?  

As a victim of 2008 layoffs, I'm also concerned about the job market.  I have heard that getting an HR job can be tough as there is a lot of comepetion.  I've also read that HR employees are the first laid off.  Then again, I've been told accounting jobs are at risk to outsourcing to and AI.  There are pros and cons to everything in life!

She asked if i can reschedule for the following day and I told her that i could not, as I already had meetings at work that I couldn’t cancel or not be part of. She then asked if there’s any way i can accommodate their schedule, I again said no. She later says that they can’t interview me for another two weeks, so I said okay and told her my schedule for that week. She said that she can possibly see if Friday works.

1d2z2rf,Spiraling After Deciding to Resign,"
Hey everyone,

I'm in a bit of a career crossroads and could really use some advice. I'm a 28-year-old female who has been working in the restaurant industry for the past four years. I started as a lead server and eventually worked my way up to become the general manager at my current restaurant in Columbus, OH.

Recently, however, the company's sister restaurants have been closing down, and my owner is facing financial difficulties. Despite my efforts, I've noticed the standards slipping, and it's been a tough environment to thrive in. Given the circumstances, I was offered the option to continue, but I made the difficult decision to resign.

Now, I'm feeling a mix of emotions – relieved to have made a decision for my well-being, but also anxious about what's next. I was earning $71k a year in my role as a general manager, and I'm worried about finding a comparable income elsewhere, especially without a college degree.

So here's where I could use your help: Do you think it's possible for me to find a similar income level in a different city or industry? I'm open to exploring new opportunities, but I'm unsure about what options are out there for someone with my experience.

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!

1d2yv5j,Self employed business consultant ,"Hey! So- I am getting a masters degree next year- and I have owned and operated my own business consultancy for the past 12 months. I really enjoy it. 

Here is a little background:

I want to do more but I need a bit of guidance. I struggle to charge a better rate- I feel bad if I charge people (for example) $550 for a wix site. Though I’m certified, have 6 years of professional experience, and have built over 150 sites- I feel guilty. And I undercharge ($120) I knowwww very low.

I also struggle to work with larger clients. I work mostly with small businesses owned by older women- and I teach them how to be self sufficient. I just started working with nonprofits and I love that too. 

But in terms of advice for acquiring large clients that have larger budgets- what should I do? I was thinking of marketing my services in gyms like Crunch- they have a business partnership program where your ads can be viewed on the monitors at 6 locations with over 1,000 check ins a day. They also have networking events and you can set up your business in the lobby. 

I would love to work with gym influencers, nonprofits of any kind, clothing or makeup brands, and event companies. 

So- what advice would you give me that could help acquire larger clients, hone my skills, and not sell myself short?

1d2wvfr,How to find my niche?,"Hey everyone,

I'm reaching out for assistance in identifying my niche.

I (25M) who completed my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from SRM University, India in 2020. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, campus interviews were canceled, and I couldn't secure any virtual interviews either. However, in December 2020, I landed an internship at a startup where I spent two years. During this time, I honed skills in leadership, strategic project planning and execution, marketing, and customer success. I played a pivotal role in problem-solving for clients, receiving commendable feedback. As I demonstrated my capabilities, I earned trust from senior management and was entrusted with crucial projects. However, layoffs within the company prompted me to leave on my own terms.

Initially aiming for an MBA, I sought admission in universities abroad. However, my two years of experience fell short of their requirements, which typically demanded five years or more. Undeterred, I pursued similar programs and will soon commence my MBM at the University of Waikato in July. My goal is to venture into consulting or other corporate roles to secure stable income for loan repayment and personal stability. I seek your guidance on maximizing my master's degree and university experience to land a desirable job, particularly in strategic or turnaround consulting. Currently, I'm enhancing my skills through a Google data analytics certification before starting my masters.

During my tenure at the startup, I reported to the Chief Business Officer (CBO), who also held positions as a partner and Managing Director of a consulting firm. Working closely with him, I gained valuable insights into business operations. The more responsibilities I undertook, the more I recognized my knack for delivering results. While my role wasn't strictly technical, I thrived in corporate settings, enjoying collaborative endeavors across departments.

Consulting appeals to me for its wealth of knowledge and diverse opportunities. Pursuing a business degree complements my previous experience and aligns with my aspirations to engage with startup incubators, accelerators, and Fortune 500 companies.

This marks my first venture abroad for academic pursuits, and I welcome any advice to navigate this transition successfully. Despite the broad nature of my request, any insights that bring me closer to realizing my business aspirations would be immensely valued and appreciated.",Taurus99512,0,0.5,0,1716936173,2024-05-28 22:42:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d2wvfr/how_to_find_my_niche/,5,2024

1d2wfzv,Management consulting - Exiting & blocking colleagues on LinkedIn,"Hi all

I have been in my career for 6 years.  As I am preparing to exit my current firm (my last week is next week), I am moving from a management consulting firm to a publicly listed company (client-side) as my next move.  It is an exciting change and move.

I will be in charge of appointing external management consulting firms.

I am currently the only woman in my team. The rest of the team are men.  I wanted to block three of my colleagues in my current team, as they were absolute f\*\*\*ing bullies during my time at my current company (for their own reasons).  All three of them were in my team, but all of them flat out refused to even maintain a professional relationship while working.  A few examples include:

* All of them catch up during work and outside of work
* Refusing to even grab a coffee for 5-10 minutes outside of work.  At my last firm, I never had any issues making friends in my immediate team or the broader firm. 
* One out of three of the colleagues actively sabotaged me trying to get a plum job approximately four moths ago, for which i haven't been able to forgive him for.  During our time working, this same colleague was so f\*\*\*ing competitive that he would often withhold work product and/or information from me while working with him, to ensure he was prompted over me this coming year. He often swindled any projects that I was working on out from under me, and I felt so hopeless and shit because of that.

I kept trying to be friendly, professional etc, but they would sometimes ignore me when I would say 'good morning' to them.  They exclude me from conversations they have, it's incredibly hurtful.

All of them made my mental health deteriorate significantly and leave my firm.  I never ever want anything to do with these people again in my career.  If I cross paths with them again, and I have the opportunity to not appoint my current firm as external advisors, I will ensure not to.

I want to block them so they never see anything I am up to again.

I know they say not to burn bridges etc, but what's the point of me continuing to try to maintain a positive relationship when these guys have already made their mind up about me?  Is there any disbenefit to me to blocking these colleagues?",cupofjoe001,3,1.0,1,1716935032,2024-05-28 22:23:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d2wfzv/management_consulting_exiting_blocking_colleagues/,5,2024
1d2wfyj,Career Switch - Need Advice!,"Since 2013, I've been in Tech. I started out in development but my goal was to always go into management, except I had the worst manager who screwed me over basically and held me back in my career. In that job, I also met a lot of unhappy people and never felt like I connected with anyone at work (a lot of infidelity, competition, and politics distorted my beliefs in humanity overall). 

I left in 2020, basically I needed a break because I was so burned out but still wanted to stay in IT so I didn't stray too far with my degree. Went back into the workforce for another company and even though, I saw similar behaviors in people (I learned to tune that out and just get paid to pay for my lifestyle I wanted). This time around, it wasn't as bad but I hated what I was doing. I have always hated corporate and it really never suited my personality.

Although, I have been very successful in my career (from what felt like working 50x harder than others) and working for 2 very large companies that most people would envy, I'm so burned out again. I've worked for a small startup and did the big top tech companies too. This life just doesn't make me happy. I'm incredibly grateful but this isn't what I imagine doing much longer.

I'm a people person, I want to walk around and move at work; not sit behind a desk, in meetings, or at home working remotely. I've been thinking about going back to school in healthcare. Does anyone have experience in MRI Techs or Rad Techs or Anesthesiologist Assistant? Any other fields in healthcare that you could recommend? Job stability is important to me too. 

Any advice?",thepulse20,1,1.0,0,1716935029,2024-05-28 22:23:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d2wfyj/career_switch_need_advice/,5,2024

i got a summer internship at the HQ of a big government department, and it sounds like i’ll have a lot of extra time and they expect me to be proactive with finding things to fill it.
the dept mostly deals with environmental protection/history/education etc. 

i just finished my first day and met everyone. as of now i’m thinking i could go ask some folks what i can help out with, but are there any other things i should to do? my supervisor has some research projects & shadowing/meetings planned for me, but she’s leaving a lot of it flexible. i have the option to telework, travel using dept vehicles, sign up for any trainings i’d like etc. i would really like to explore everything and fill my time as much as i can. i think i’m just having trouble knowing exactly how to start reaching out to other people, and what specific skills would be beneficial for me to work on. i’m nervous because i don’t know everything and i’m very inexperienced but i don’t want that to stop me from learning. any general advice or specific ideas for what to ask to do would help a lot!!",Ok_Permission_3628,1,1.0,0,1716934810,2024-05-28 22:20:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d2wcv3/what_should_i_ask_to_dohow_should_i_reach_out_to/,5,2024
1d2w267,Do I have a chance at finding a good career? ,"I started college in 2018, thinking I wanted to be a veterinarian but had that dream crushed when I couldn’t figure out basic chemistry. I changed my major to psychology then quickly realized there wasn’t much future there, so I ultimately dropped out in 2020 due to COVID and not knowing what I wanted to do with my life and honestly just bad life decisions in general. I worked in restaurants during this time and just kinda floundered. Finally decided I needed to go back so I did, wanted to go for computer science but didn’t get accepted, my advisor told me maybe I could choose data science as my major so I said sure, I’m 24 now and just want to graduate with something. I like the material enough, not really a dream career for me I guess but it seemed like something that would allow me to work from home and have a good salary. 

I won’t graduate next year until 25 and feeling anxious that I won’t be able to find a job. My questions are, is it possible for me to find a job not necessarily in the field my degree is for? Are there some careers that you just need any bachelors for? I’m also feeling anxious I have nothing to really show for myself besides restaurant work and my degree.

1d2vuhh,"CS BSc Degree, No Offers 6+ Months","So, I graduated in Dec. 2023 and have been searching and applying steadily on Handshake (through a school account) and on LinkedIn, although I feel like the postings on Handshake are more legitimate. Are these the places I should be looking/are best?

- Older student, I'm in my early 30s with a lot of non-software/programming related work experiences. 
- I have a 3.73 GPA, graduated Magna Cum Laude from a well-ranked private university. 
- I've detailed a few projects on my resume, LinkedIn, and made them available to view on my Github, one of which is an on-going personal machine learning project that I'm really proud of because its pretty extensive and took me a long time to develop. 
- I have a fantastic letter of recommendation from one of my professors that I took 4 separate classes with posted publicly on my LinkedIn.
- I've supplied employers transcripts and references when asked.
- I have, what I consider, a great cover letter.

I want to work in data with programming in Python, but I'm not picky! Any software dev/engineering position would be great. NYC or anywhere, just not a CA fan. 

I've had a couple companies do an initial screening and ask me to take an online assessment. I'm not a wiz with leetcode yet, and I work a full-time low-level job to make ends meet, so I don't have a lot of time. I am however trying to grind them out whenever I can between shifts. This is an area that I could definitely improve but I'm not a crap programmer by any means.. The assessments are timed. Some have math competition level questions... 

My family has been encouraging but they didn't think I would have as hard of a time as I've had! And I didn't either.

My biggest regret is not doing internships during the summers, but I didn't think I could afford them if they were in other states/cities. 

Posting this is a long-shot, but I don't know what I'm missing/not doing. What job boards should I be looking at that I'm not already? I filter by entry level on LinkedIn, but it really seems like they are lying that they're actually entry level.

1d2vigo,Co-workers not accepting one ounce of criticism despite being more than glad to dish it out to me - stay in this role or transfer elsewhere?,"last post i made didnt get a reply so here's a shorter version lmao

- have been working in various roles over the last 20yrs (datacenters, some active duty AF, some HVAC, super interested in electrical theory & am reading the EPRI manual

- am new to a role on a team of 6 others who will gladly critique me any time in any way they see fit yet when i critique them, oh hellllllllll naw. they will push back very hard if you critique anything, ESPECIALLY *the new guy (me)*, even if im 100% right, even if i go about it in the most professional of ways

- mentality seems to be: ""new guy hasnt sat in this position, not in training, and therefore doesnt know shit so whatever he figures out we can all disregard, why, because WE have been here & HE is the new guy

- i work closely with EE's and some of our oneline's are dead wrong which are the things im pointing out (and they get corrected asap when i do)

- was told ""my job isnt to go correcting maps - its to be an operator."" well part of being one is relying on accurate mapping, so if i can, then i have to investigate to find out what truly is correct. but alas, **""thats not what i was hired to do........"" like what? our fuckin schematic is wrong and we deal with voltages well above 120v, so it IS a problem.**

- a higher level boss even commented directly to me that one thing i found was particularly unsettling b/c it is an issue but on top of that, *the new guy* found it so it's even more embarrassing for the current crew

- long story short, i get the sensation the majority of the crew has now kind of turned on me and i really only have 2ppl of the 9 actually, in cluding the boss, in my corner.

- mitigating factors: my immediate supervisor is fucking amazing. legit the best boss ive ever had and probably ever will. i would love to stay on this team but in a different sort of role which there is no clear-cut ""job"" for and to make one would take months as the company would have to justify it, etc.

so the question is, would you stay in this department where this is the environment or quickly seek out a new position within the company? im not entertaining looking elsewhere bc of the moving stipend and other factors. all around i like the company a lot, just issues here. 

can add in more details if i need to to clarify things.",SeamoreTiddeez,2,1.0,0,1716932667,2024-05-28 21:44:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d2vigo/coworkers_not_accepting_one_ounce_of_criticism/,5,2024

Someone internally from the company will be taking over some responsibilities from my position and another position, while I will be promoted within the team.

Then they stated the promotional salary. I did the math afterwards and it does not even amount to a 5% raise…. Disappointed is an understatement. In the moment I stated I was super greatful, which I am, that I am considered for this promotion. However, I was expecting at bare minimum a 10%. This promotion has been in the works for months, I had heard from multiple sources that the higher ups speak highly of me.

1d2vfe1,Can’t decide if I should leave my job for a new opportunity ,"I’ve been working at my current company for close to two years - I truly loved this company when I started as it was more of a start up feel and had great culture, pay wasn’t great but it was somewhat made up with loving the environment. Fast forward to now, I can tolerate working there most days but the bad days are becoming more frequent. I’ve been interviewing for different companies, I just don’t know if i’m making the right decision financially and for my career.

Current Job:
- Make around 70K a year (this is not enough to qualify for a 1 bed apt in my city)
- No bonuses are offered
- Have been given quite a bit in company shares valuing around 40K at the current moment to be vested over the next 3 years
- Absolute micromanager for a boss
- No growth opportunities available in the near future
- Managers make you feel bad when PTO is taken, still have to work most of the time on PTO
- Generally just unhappy

New Job:
- Offering 90K a year with bonus plan available 
- Fully remote so I’d be able to move to a more affordable city
- Research on the company shows really high growth predicted, similar industry that I am currently in
- Can’t speak on the culture or management, but given that I’d be at home I feel i’d be significantly happier

Just a little background on me, I am 24 and 3 years out of college. The only thing truly holding me back is the shares I have in my current company as I have a significant amount of student loans but I don’t know if it makes more sense to take a higher salary instead.

I'm having a difficult time getting a internship/ entry-level full stack roles, or software engineer roles. Unpaid, paid, all tried.

1d2tbff,Lost on What To Do,"Hello all! I have a complicated situation with my workplace, and I’m going back and forth between two options: asking for a raise based on my workload & history or find somewhere else to work. This post is pretty long so TLDR at the end.

For background, I work in mortgage. I’m 26, and have been employed here since October 2021. I am the youngest in our office & work in operations, not sales, so doing all the behind the scenes work helping people buy homes. When I was hired, my position was entry level & no experience needed.  Originally, there were 4 people who shared the same role (me included), Processing Assistant(PA), and 3 others who shared another role, Loan Officer Assistant(LOA).

With the housing market being as awful as it has been since COVID, our company downsized greatly in early 2022- to save money is really the only reason. Mind you, I work for a local bank & not a large corporation. The PA role was downsized to just me and a colleague. We took on the teams & workload that belonged to the 2 others who were laid off. The LOA role had also gone down to 2 employees. I had only been at the company for 3-4 months at the time. Hours were cut to 32/week and have been since then. 

From there, I spent about a year learning my role, understanding smaller tidbits of mortgage, and seriously expanding my knowledge of the industry. I had been receiving many compliments and acknowledgements from my peers and higher level colleagues. During my first annual review (October 2022) I was promoted to an LOA, and began learning that role with one Loan Officer whilst keeping the responsibilities of the PA role I had. When promoted, I was supposed to earn a $2 raise and every loan that closed under my name, I would receive a $25 incentive. Because the way the market was my boss informed me that they could only give me half for now: $1 raise and a $15 dollar incentive, but we’ll check back in 6 months and evaluate your performance then to see if you get the rest of it. The other LOAs received the $2 raise and the full $25 incentive when they were promoted (around the same time I was). My performance remained where it was and I earned the rest of the raise in April 2023. I now make $17.39/hr with the $25 incentive. 

Eventually I gained 3 other Loan Officers and my workload greatly expanded. I was taking care of many things from taking applications for my Loan Officers, requesting documents from our clients, obtaining titles, insurance, ordering appraisals.. so on and so forth. Basically everything from application up to closing. In total there were 3 LOAs, handling just about every Loan Officer we had in our specific branch, about 12. So we each had 4 Loan Officer teams we were working with.

In February of this year I asked my boss for a raise. Our hours were still at 32/week & with inflation and everything going on in the world, the wage I’m earning is barely enough to survive (yes I budgeted everything I could and got rid of all frivolous things). My boss basically did not answer my request. Around then the other 2 LOAs resigned. & now I am the only LOA in our office, assisting 10 Loan Officers. Boss upped my hours to 40 & said now that you have all of the Loan Officers, your incentives will be higher. My boss was not allowed to hire another LOA to even out the workload.

Now to the question of the post.. am I wrong to go back to my boss and request a raise again? Over the almost 3 years I’ve been employed with the company I have shown that I am reliable, quick to learn, and efficient. Roles that once belonged to about 7 people have all been pushed to me. I feel as though my workload itself calls for a raise but taking in my history as an employee over the last few years..  I think I’m far overdue for a wage that is fitting for the responsibility of the role I now hold. I’ve also considered requesting that I work from home or at least hybrid as 95% of my duties can be done from home. Just to save on cost of gas and other things.

Or, on the flip side, should I find another employer in the mortgage industry? I drive 1 hour to work & 1 hour home everyday..  so I could (maybe) find something closer to home or even WFH.

There are other things that play into all of this, too. It seems complicated to me and I am a passive person so I’m lost on what I should do. Any kind advice is welcome.

TLDR; Hired in October 2021 in the mortgage industry. There were once 7 employees who held the role(s) I now have. Over time the company laid off many people & cut hours to 32/week. I was promoted once to a Loan Officer Assistant & have spent my time with the company greatly expanding my knowledge of the role and earned praise for the work I was doing. In Feb of 2024 I asked for a raise and did not hear back from my boss. Some employees resigned & as of March 2024 I am the only LOA for our branch assisting 10 other Loan Officer teams. Do I asked for a raise again based off my performance and history with the company? Do I ask to WFH too? Or do I find another bank that can even out the workload and pay me what I deserve?

Give me a Figma file and I'll develop/program it pixel perfect. I feel very confident with React and css to make a badass UI.

The UX team we have is only for the commercial services for final users but for the tools inside the company there's none. So they wanted me to use my ""ux expertise"" to follow the design system guidelines from commercial team. They know shit what UX actually mean. It's just a bunch of changes they want.

Worst part is, I like the company. It's a big international company. Very flexible with work/life and we have a lot of vacation time. My team and colleagues are also incredibly nice. I'm a foreigner and it took me forever to find a company where I feel I belong. But fuck do I hate to do design work. I'm the happiest when I code.

Talked to my boss once and said it'd be less design work and more programming. But it hasn't been like that. I'm jealous that my colleagues do get to do programming work while I'm there...

1d2s0bs,I’m really stuck between these two jobs,"I’m thinking of becoming a nurse or an accountant. I’ve already been accepted into multiple nursing programs but after doing some research I’m second guessing myself.

It’s not easy to do but simple to understand, and I’ve always wanted to help save lives, but I’m seeing that nurses absolutely hate their jobs. So I started looking at accounting. It’s a government job so that means I’ll get good benefits, they make more money than nurses in the long term, and they don’t get physically harassed like nurses do. Any advice on how to decide?

1d2ro8a,Company offered me new position and then the compensation team dropped my pay 32k a couple days before it was meant to be official.,"Long story. I do sales at a company. I also run my own business where I run people’s marketing and CRM. I do AI consulting on the side with that.

I use to make 150k a year working 4-5 month summers in sales.

I got burnt out and took a corporate desk sales job. 50k salary with 24k guaranteed commission for 18 months. So 74k.

I started programming tools that caught the eye of my VPs and a conversation got rolling - ended up getting offered an AI/ML Product Manager role.

They offered me 120k on contract work vs employment. So losing benefits, but way better pay and doing something I love.

Couple days ago I find out the compensation team veto’d it because technically my salary was only 50k, and 120k is a ridiculous increase.

The VP was apologetic and ensure me they’d make me whole and would try to get bench marks to get me back up.

Honestly from a corporate view I get it. And if they had offered me 90k initially I probably wouldn’t have even questioned it, as I do want to grow in the company. But 120k is still less than the value in genuinely believe I will bring - which may sound ridiculous, but I have a very clear line and am confident the niche they’re bringing me in for I will be a huge value add. Like keeping them from losing huge market share.

I have some ideas on how to approach this and have a meeting in 2 and half hours to discuss this more with the VP.

My goal is to negotiate that 120k back, without hurting any relationships. 

**Has anyone had a similar experience and able to give some advice?**

I don’t need any accusations thrown towards them trying to scam me. I’m familiar enough with the company and the leadership to know this isn’t them specifically trying to take advantage of me. It’s just a VP seeing value, promising a wage, and then corporate not being able to see the full picture and just seeing them taking a recent hire and randomly trying to give a 240% raise in their eyes.

Problem is I'm currently very unmotivated and very bored.  I know some of the reasons why. One is that it's project work and the project I am on has been vastly reduced in scope due to budget constraints and there are frankly too many cooks in the kitchen. I'm a senior leadership person and there are a few of us and there's simply not enough senior work to go around. 

The other reason is I'm starting to get tired of the person I report to. She's just so old school and just one of those people who seems to always be talking loud and talking fast. I cringe when I hear her voice. And she's such a micromanager... 

And then finally I don't feel valued. I'm left out of key meetings. When I'm in meetings I'm not respected. Just this week one person was going around the room asking for everyone's comfort with a decision and just completely ignored me. Skipped over me entirely.

i could quit and make ends meet with some savings or selling stuff, which i would love to do, but i’m scared of where that could go wrong. i mean, i’m turning away a well-paying job for a whole lotta nothing and i have nowhere to go for rent-free living. i also am concerned with how quitting after 6 months may look on my resume as this is my first career job.

the alternative is toughing it out for 6 more months, which i know is probably laughable to you who are thinking “how bad could it be?” but trust me if your brain felt how mine does, 6 more months down this road feels unfathomable.

-Some sort of computer tech related skill where I could work from home

1d2pvb3,How can I decide whether or not being a psychiatrist is for me?,"I‘ve mostly known this for a while but tried to stop myself from thinking about it because it does hurt, but I think I should now before I make another large mistake.  
Since I was younger, I did not truly know what career I wanted to pursue. Sure there were ones that came and went that I wanted, but nothing concrete. My parent has strongly suggested to become a doctor. After so long, I can’t think of anything other than that.  
I‘ve also noticed that some people have strong hobbies or interest in something like cars. Of which can be turned into a career.  
Other than that, there’s only one thing in my life that I have ever found an immense amount of joy in, that being learning a language. However, I do not find a career directly utilizing it to be particularly what I want.  
I want(ed) to become a psychiatrist, primarily citing the true, but surface level thought of wanting to  understand the human mind, why and how people do and decide to do things, the small idiosyncrasies that permeate daily life and moment by moment existence. Understanding this to a professional degree. (No pun intended.)  
However, in the past two years especially, I think that it is more about having self-doubt, self-conscious, and insecurities. These things being put into the context of interpersonal relationships, causing some of this (my own fault, the way I internalize things), and affecting them as well. These factors interacting with my disorder has not made that any better.  
Less about helping other people and more about trying to understand myself and improve with that information. But again, having extensive knowledge about psychology, to a professional degree.  
I thought about researching, wanting that to be my focus, but there is only so far I can with that. How much interest do I truly have with that?

1d2oqz6,A unique situation going on at work but one that I would like your input on as to whether it's best to stick it out in this position or transfer within the company,"first i hope this is a good enough sub to post a question like this despite my account being so new. i do like cliff notes so here goes:

- have been working in various roles over the last 20yrs (datacenters, some active duty AF, some HVAC, super interested in electrical theory & am reading the EPRI manual, also  at one point i was a police officer for 3 years but that was at the beginning). finally found what i liked w/my current role.

- got hired & was paid a moving stipend and work on an 8-man team where a few of them are 10+ yrs younger than me and a couple 5-10yrs older

- problem is, the power or authority the job allows you to have, from what i hear, kind of goes to your head (ive been training for 4mo & come out of trng and go in to it fulltime in a month), so it supposedly drives up your ego and the vast majority of the guys in my dept. will push back very hard if you dare critique anything, ESPECIALLY *the new guy (me)*, even if im 100% right, even if i go about it in the most professional of ways.

- people in this position are not at all reacting well to discrepancies im finding in our database which 100% must be corrected - there is no doubt about it. my boss agrees, my team mate agrees, legit everyone agrees but alas, the pushback and excuse-making don't stop.

- also seems maybe a psychological factor is at play, IE, ""new guy (me) doesnt have the right to question this or second guess that because he hasnt sat THE DESK"" where all the action happens with its ops that are 24-7-365 despite whatever experience i bring to the table

- if anyone has read this far and is a lineman or similar, some of our oneline's are wrong and switch A is on our maps but isnt actually there or switch B is there but it's not on our maps, or switch C is in the field and on our maps but is in the wrong place on our oneline which is an issue b/c we always need to know where we can segment live conductor.

- so far ive found probably 10-12 oneline typos or where switches are placed wrong on the maps and the issues ran so deep my bosses told me to stop digging because i was finding so much. i was legit told to ease up because ""my job isnt to go correcting maps - its to be an operator."" well part of being one is reying on accurate mapping, so if i can, then i have to investigate to find out what truly is correct. but alas, **""thats not what i was hired to do.""**

- the words verbatim from a co-worker are ""so you think youre a super apprentice of something?""

- there's clear and obvious pushback anytime i basically do anything, especially if it's a typo here or there but we use abbreviations a lot, so a typo would actually mean wire A, on paper, shows it goes somewhere completely diff. than it actually does.

- long story short, i get the sensation the majority of the crew has now kind of turned on me and i really only have 2ppl of the 9 actually, in cluding the boss, in my corner.

- the other guy on my shift swears that all it is that they just cant accept that a ""new guy"" has found all this and its a hit to their ego. looking at things how they are i cant disagree thats what it looks like.

- a higher level boss even commented directly to me that one thing i found was particularly unsettling b/c its an issue but on top of that, *the new guy* found it. 

- so the question is, stay in this department where this is the environment or quickly seek out a new position within the utility company? im not entertaining looking elsewhere bc of the moving stipend and other factors.

- mitigating factors: my immediate supervisor is fucking amazing. legit the best boss ive ever had and probably ever will. i would love to stay on this team but in a different sort of role which there is no clear-cut ""job"" for and to make one would take months as the company would have to justify it, etc.

- lastly, i was told by a senior workmate that the stuff ive caught really shows i have an exceptional ability to analyze this or that so i am doing the right thing.

1d2lj6d,How to make up for no management experience?,"Hi all,

I’ve been working for around 10 years in various positions, and I recently changed career paths. This year, I’m going to be completing a master’s degree that will allow me to be qualified for supervisory roles within my field (librarian, if you’re curious). Once I’m completed with my degree, I will have loads of experience in the professional and academic world that will qualify me for the position I want. My only concern is that the position is supervisory, and I’ve never had any management experience. 

There’s a few reasons for this. One, my old job that I was at for 7+ years onto employed supervisors who had been at the company 15+ years. Two, after I left that company and started working for libraries, I became a military spouse, so I now never have the chance to work anywhere long enough to be promoted to a supervisor.

Is there any way I can make up for no management experience? Is it worth it to enroll in management classes? Will my lack of management experience even matter?",floralportraits,1,1.0,0,1716908361,2024-05-28 14:59:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d2lj6d/how_to_make_up_for_no_management_experience/,5,2024
1d2lg06,"Military leaver, wants to do something that matters","This isn't for me, asking for a friend.

He left the military a few years ago - didn't want to and wasn't medically discharged because they gave him an out, but it wasn't what he signed up for so he reluctantly chose to leave. Since then he's worked various jobs including retail, care work and most recently a venupuncturist in the NHS. He studied for a degree in counselling and made great progress but wasn't able to get enough clients due to location and work commitments to pass.

He wants to do something that matters, but gets frustrated at being paid so little for enormous responsibility (that's why he left care). That's stumbling block one. The second one is his self-confidence is shot from failing his course and from feelings of worthlessness his entire life (yay military upbringing), which means he's reluctant to study another course or strike out for fear of failure.

I think he needs counselling, and I feel sorry for him because it's bloody tough out there. The military provided structure and a progression path, but he was stuck between a rock and a hard place and was forced out. He didn't take advantage of resettlement because he didn't think he needed them, he thought he'd be just fine but it's been a few years and like I said he's still struggling to adjust a bit.

He loves working for a good cause and he doesn't even want to be highly paid, just paid more.

Can anyone suggest could career routes starting from venepucturist experience, maybe in the private sector? Or veterans' services that help with resettlement, even a while after? He was in the logistics branch, if that helps, but we're worried too much time has passed to make the most of it.",PitifulParfait,1,1.0,0,1716908129,2024-05-28 14:55:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d2lg06/military_leaver_wants_to_do_something_that_matters/,5,2024

1d2kuk1,Which option should I go with for now?,"Hi peeps this is my first post to any Reddit ever but I could use some advice. My current job I’ve been at for 3+ years at a car dealership. I started as a service driver picking up and dropping off customer cars, dropping customers off etc. I got “promoted” to the detail department a little over a year ago. I say “promoted” because it was a department change but I was under the same pay ($15/hr) cut to a couple months ago I was then “promoted” to the parts department under the same pay still. After I got promoted I brought up the conversation of a raise. Service manager said he’d let me know by the end of the week. 3 weeks later nothing so I brought it up again, he said he’d review it with my parts manager and let me know by the end of that pay period. Cut to another 2+ weeks later and still nothing from service nor parts manager. At this point I feel like it’s downright disrespectful because even through the “promotions” I still get sent to the other departments to help whenever they need it. So I’m technically in parts/car wash/detail/service driver all under the same pay. I have a friend that just started working at a gas station, he’ll be paid weekly and his first check is gonna be right around $650 after taxes working the same amount of hours weekly. So he will be around $1,300 biweekly and for reference my last check was $985. I’m going to talk with my parts manager today to see if I have a for sure outcome but I’m thinking if they give me $1 raise that I’ll go work with my friend. Do you guys think I should tough it out and keep trying to stick with and grow with the company or just go with what makes the most money now? Also something to note when they hired my friend (it could be bs but we’ll see) they said they were in great need for managers so they’d train him for a few months, promote him to manager and transfer him to a store that needs one and promised the same for me.

1d2kfrg,Growing gap and confused how to proceed,"

""Hi, I started my career in IT as a backup administrator at Wipro from 2019 Jan, working with tools like EMC Networker and Avamar, along with some experience in Veritas NetBackup, primarily for supporting or migrating to EMC Networker or Avamar. My responsibilities included performing restores, configuring servers, and troubleshooting issues. I worked in this role for three years until April 2022. After that, I interviewed for a cloud engineer position at Innominds Software, where I had successfully completed AWS SAA and AWS CP certifications. However, I spent three months on the bench, during which they expected me to complete five proof-of-concepts (POCs), which I was unable to do. Consequently, I had to resign from the job and was relieved in December 2022. Since then, I've been searching for opportunities and attempting to obtain more AWS certifications, albeit unsuccessfully. From December 2023, I transitioned to Azure data engineering, focusing on ADF, Databricks, Python, and PySpark SQL. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to secure a job yet, and I've been actively searching for employment with an acknowledged gap in my resume from December 2022 to May 2024. I'm feeling the financial strain and becoming a burden on my parents. Should I continue pursuing a career in IT, or should I consider other options?

1d2j8c3,Thinking about taking a break from work to explore other options. Maybe travel. Advise needed.,"Been feeling increasingly burnt out. Stressed. Anxious due to my job. I'm in my late 20s. Have been in my (retail) company for just shy of 8 years have been a store manager for just over two years. I live with family, and have a decent amount of money saved at this moment in time.

My reasoning for wanting to leave are:

Job is physically demanding and I spend most of the my time needing to recover and have very little time to enjoy my time off. 7:30am starts with a 45 minute commute certainly don't help this either.

Company keeps cutting hours back, increasing pressure on all staff members. Hours budget has been cut back by 30 hours in the last two months alone. For a smaller team of 9 people this causes a pretty big disparity to where we were before.

Higher ups will still hold us managers accountable when standards and numbers slip due to lack of staff. Threatening HR action in some cases.

With the recent minimum wage increase, sales assistants in my company are now on not much less than I am as a manager. Genuinely making me weigh up whether this higher responsibility position is even worth it anymore.

Thinking about taking some time away to possibly travel, and explore new career options. At just shy of 30 I feel like now is probably the time I want to think about making this change if I ever do.

Does anyone else have any experience in this?

1d2i310,Running a successful business but not sure if it’s the right choice? ,"
I currently run a solo cleaning business, I only have a few years of college, no degree but I am a knowledgeable cleaner. It pays pretty well but it will never make me rich (gross after tax is around 40k under best circumstances). I don’t have a lot of bills so it works out and I still have extra cash, but a few things bother me, such as

A) people around me make more; I have similar skills as them and feel like I could apply them at a higher paying job


B) I’m not interested in having employees. Aside from liability (damaging property, such as cabinets/floors/counters could be thousands of dollars, I have business insurance but some of the houses I clean are expensive), high turnover rate, the possibility that they leave and steal my clients (do not competes are rarely valid in my state) there are so many pitfalls in hiring out. Say I have an employee, add on new accounts, and they quit. Now I have several accounts with no cleaners. Add to that the cost of training, new equipment, getting customers, it’s not worth it imo. I’ve seen many other cleaning businesses that have expanded and just collapsed


C) If I hurt myself, I’m basically screwed. Self employment doesn’t apply in my state so I couldn’t even get unemployment.


D) no befits such as health insurance/401k, it’s up to me to fund that 


My reasons for running my own business are:


A) I make my own schedule and choose my clients, I don’t work holidays and it’s the most freedom I’ve had. I don’t work in an office and see new houses/drive to cool areas a lot



B) cleaning keeps me physically active and (mostly) in shape


C) the overall freedom in comparison to other companies I’ve worked for 


D) not being in an office! I find offices depressing and like traveling, even if it’s local 


E) no weekends or holidays which is huge for me, used to work 6-7 days a week before 

My reasons for wanting to leave:

A) I’m afraid if I hurt myself, I’m essentially screwed because I can’t get unemployment, and injuries are common in my field (essentially repetitive motion injuries such as shoulders, knees/back injuries, etc) 


B) I’ll never get rich off it or make a ton of money unless I expand/hire out which I’d prefer not to do 



I’ve explored other jobs but it doesn’t seem as good as running a business in terms of schedule freedom/overall happiness. I don’t know what the best next move to make is, all therapy does is encourage me to pursue new things, but they don’t give me business advice, so I’m not sure who to ask ",Aintnobeef96,2,0.7599999904632568,1,1716898727,2024-05-28 12:18:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d2i310/running_a_successful_business_but_not_sure_if_its/,5,2024
1d2i1kz,Leave permanent job for a temporary job that’s higher pay?,"23M 1 year out of college. As soon as I graduated I got a job in advertising sales for 65k a year in nyc because it was the only job I could get an offer for. In top of that, I have a side gig managing YouTube channels that makes me another 32k a year remotely. 

I recently got an offer to work as a lead Creative Stratest for a YouTube production company for 96k a year, remotely for 1 year and then I would have to move. I’ve only been at my current job for 10 months. Im nervous that if I leave my current job that is stable, and I’m let go at this new job after the 3 month trial period, I’d be stuck with a pretty terrible “lack of commitment” history with jobs. That being that I haven’t been at my current job for at least a year. 

Also to note, I’m currently going for my masters degree in analytics at Georgia Tech so there’s that. 

If in the worst case scenario this new opportunity doesn’t pan out, would I be a red flag / have an extremely hard time finding employment given my age and experience?? I love digital marketing and strategy, I HATE advertising sales. I wanna move more into strategy and I feel with my current YouTube work history I coulddddd do that?

1d2gk44,Would I be an A-Hole if i confront my former employer and to keep it professional ,"
Apologies in advance as English is not my first language and I’m a terrible storyteller.

I (F,25) am currently working as an operations executive at a forex brokerage. Before this, I was a sales associate in partnership with my current company.

About a month ago, I was offered the position of Business Development Executive at a bank. Everything went smoothly. I went through 2 interviews and also passed the background check. Then came the reference check. I was asked to give 2 references: one from my current company and another from the company prior to this. So, I have the contact information of my director from the current company, let’s call her Bella (whom I see as an older sister who takes care of us), and my previous sales director, let’s call him Karl.

But there was a small confrontation that happened between me and Karl about a week before I was asked for an interview. A little backstory on Karl, while I have to admit he is good at his work, he is also a convincing manipulator who uses people around him for his own benefit. He always made overly sexual jokes with his employees, most of whom were females. We usually would just ignore him or laugh awkwardly to make him go away.

The conflict happened when a group of us were discussing creating a short video for social media to attract customers. This is when Karl chimed in and said, “you girls should wear short skirts. It’ll show your legs, and when you jump, people can see your asses.” I was shocked, but I tried to remain calm and so I asked in a half-joking tone, “are we shooting for content or OnlyFans here?” Very quickly, he responded, “for content, of course.” I asked again, “if it’s content that we are discussing here, then why would you tell us to show our butts?” Then he said something that really flipped a switch in me, “you know what? You’re gonna be in the video, so it doesn’t concern you. It’s just a joke anyway.” At that point, I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I said loudly in front of everyone to him, “this is not about me; you can clearly see the other girls were uncomfortable. Is that your definition of a joke?”  And that’s where we left things.

Fast forward to earlier this week, I received a call from HR of the hiring company saying that the comment from one of the references was really bad, and that they would not proceed further with me. I was really disappointed, still am, because I was really excited about this opportunity. I do not regret the things I said, if anything I would have said more. Would I be wrong to confront Karl and ask him to put his personal feelings aside and keep it professional?",Anxious_Barnacle_445,2,1.0,2,1716893433,2024-05-28 10:50:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d2gk44/would_i_be_an_ahole_if_i_confront_my_former/,5,2024

1d2eclp,Advise Needed,"(27m) Currently feeling stuck in making a career choice and deciding to go back to school.

After graduating HS in 2015, I made the decision to take a break from school, mostly because it was not that interesting for me and I didn’t do as well as I would have liked to. Decided to take an opportunity to move out of my hometown to teach dance, because that’s what I grew up doing. I ultimately chose not to continue this because I wasn’t happy with the work or pay, plus there was never any availability for health Insurance/401k/etc. I bounced around to a few different companies (Starbucks, Costco) to support myself as I continued to figure out what I would like to do. 

Fast forward to last December, I was referred to an entry level IT staffing company that had a slight pay increase ($45k and quarterly bonuses). This excited me because I have grown an interest in the field (specifically Cybersecurity) and have been taking my free time to study. 


My question is: Would anyone be able to give me some advise on what an ideal career path would be for someone in my situation? (No prior experience/no background in IT/basic computer skills) I understand that Cybersecurity is not an entry level IT job, so I would most likely need to start with something like help desk for (hopefully) a few years before I could have an opportunity. I’m also willing to shift my path depending on the attainability of jobs in the field. 

Ultimately, I am at the point in my life where I want to be able to challenge myself more mentally than physically, and I see school as an asset for that.

1d2aee2,"Turning down a 6 figure job for my own happiness, am I crazy?","I could make this post into 10 pages, so forgive my if this is just a little all over the place. Give some background first:

  
27, F, USA: BS in PSYC, Paralegal Certificate, MBA (currently pursuing). 

Work History: Retail, Tourist industry, Legal Assistant (end of BS program, stayed for 4 years, pursued paralegal certificate). Left position due to burn out (toxic work environment), couldn’t find another job (live in rural area, little prospects), landed a job in higher education (not in my field, or anything I wish to do) just needed the health insurance, stayed for 1 year and left position. Never made more than 30K at either positions.   
Personal aspirations/career goals: Being a Professor (adjunct mainly), being my own boss in some capacity, opening my own business (dream business: bar, tap room, brewery - have experience in all areas and consultants who would be willing to take it on with me).   
Current personal situation: Live in low cost of living area, recently married, supportive spouse with a decent income, stable enough to maintain our home we bought 2 years ago. This area has very low job prospects and we do hope to move eventually but he needs to finish out work contracts and also very close to getting his student loan forgiveness through that job. 

  
Well with that being said, I currently am about to be unemployed (possibly). I am full-time in my MBA program and about to be finishing out my last year. I recently got a job offer that pays a 6 figure salary but would require intense work hours 60+ a week. Tbh, I cannot see myself going back to an in-office job again nor an 8-5.  It is for whatever reason something I just cannot handle. I like working, if its on my feet and not stuck in an office. I couldn’t imagine doing 60+ hours, 40 is too much for me. When I worked in the tourist industry, I LOVED MY LIFE and was working  60+ hour weeks during peak time, and loved it. I miss being on my feet. Well, I am considering turning down the 6 figure job and have interviews for bartending positions within the tourist industry. People think I am crazy for that, and believe me I think so too. But I have been so incredibly unhappy all my 20s. The 30k income was fine, it was not the money that was the issue. It was being inside an office, under terrible light, having that consistent 8-5, stupid small talk and always putting on a face and my personal life just fell because of it. I became more lazy. 

  
Sidenote: I have a good savings, good retirement I have been building since forever, and I inevest wisely and heavily in the stock market and see great returns and reinvest that into retirement. I do VERY well with my finances and am very picky on what I spend. I can live off nothing just fine and almost prefer it. 

  
Idk, do you think I am crazy?

1d2a2yo,Unsure where to go from here ,"Hi, as the title states I don’t know what to do :(. 

I graduated last year from university and have spent the last year applying to jobs - I worked a summer job from Jun to Aug and was hired at a non-profit in Feb. The job search has been brutal and this past year hasn’t been fun :(

My current job is sort of miserable, I don’t really enjoy my work (although it’s not particularly difficult), the pay is not good, and the work environment is quite frustrating to say the least. I’ll spare you all the details of the last few months but it’s safe to say that I have no intention of staying here for very long. I’ve been actively job searching for the last 2 months. 

The most recent issue is about a sort of ultimatum that my boss has given me. He wanted to renegotiate the terms of my contract in an unfair way and if I don’t accept… well I’m kind of out of a job. I don’t feel this is worth the legal hassle of fighting the unfairness of the situation so I’m really left with two options: 

1. sign the new contract and continue working for the experience until I find something else 

2. quit and continue the job search from home (at least ending this workplace misery)

I don’t have any major bills at the moment and I live at home so I’m quite lucky in this respect. However, the job market is quite difficult for new grads at the moment and I worry that quitting my current job before having something else is a mistake. I don’t know what to chose at this point… 

Any advice is appreciated! I’m really confused right now. ",ObjectiveTradition51,0,0.5,1,1716867148,2024-05-28 03:32:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d2a2yo/unsure_where_to_go_from_here/,5,2024

1d29q62,Give my two weeks now or later?,"I am in a bit of a conundrum. For context, I have been with this company for less than a month. In that time, I’ve realized that they are poorly run and they’ve let go a ton of people who my manager has introduced me to as experts or important to the company prior to them being let go. The big red flag is that instead of training me to do the job I was promised that would utilize the skills I gained in college, they are training me to do something completely unrelated to fill in for someone who is going on vacation in the next coming weeks. This person is also paid a ton more than me as I am a temp to hire and they are vital to the operation of the company so there is a big push to train me. My issue is that the person training me is a really great person and I’d hate to put their vacation in danger because literally no one else in the company can do what they do and they are short handed from all the firings that they wouldn’t be able to train someone else in that time. They also offered me the job and waited for me to graduate to fill the position when they could have found someone else in the 6 weeks they waited for me. So, the company has displayed a lot of red flags and my paranoid side is telling me I was played by the director with promises of doing what I went to college for them when in reality, they just need me to temporarily do this guys job while he’s out of country. In turn, I don’t want to waste my time with them any longer and get back to searching for a job. But on the other hand, I don’t want to jeopardize this guys hard earned vacation so should I stick it out till he’s at least gone or should I just put in my two weeks and let them deal with it?",Madeup251432,2,0.7599999904632568,4,1716865958,2024-05-28 03:12:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d29q62/give_my_two_weeks_now_or_later/,5,2024

I graduated from a college, hoping I'd earn some money as a translator after I graduated, but this never worked out. I wasted approximately 8 years as a language teacher. And I graduated three years ago.

A lot of sales management job offers are quite demanding and I'm worried that it may be too late for me. I am not a college student anymore, so I can't pull the lack of experience card, because then the reasonable questions regarding what I was doing during the three years after graduation and why I didn't think of it sooner would arise. Currently, I have some decent theoretical knowledge, I could explain the know-how if I had to. But I lack the aforementioned documented cases of successful sales.

Long story short, I was an intern with a sports media company last year while also going to school full time. At the end of the internship, they offered me a part time role within the company, I accepted and have loved it. Now, I just graduated from college and they offered me a full time role in a higher position.
The work is not THAT much more than what I currently do, but it does come with more pressure and I have been told by numerous people that an issue with the position is that it's a real grind and the people previously in the role had a hard time having a work/life balance so they ended up leaving the company and experienced burnout. I was a Kinesiology major in college and this work is more in marketing. I would love to stay in the marketing field, but am wondering if it's wise to take the full time role, get more experience since most marketing jobs require a related degree or X years of marketing experience and look to grow that way, or do something else. All of this had made me pretty anxious.

1d226w3,"Experience and work gap, please advise","I want to share my story and seek advice from professionals because I'm feeling lost and helpless. 

I studied computer engineering in college in the Middle East, where I developed a passion for programming, software engineering, competitive programming, and problem-solving, and I was quite good at it. I was supposed to graduate in five years, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I ended up taking an additional year and a half.

After graduation, I spent an entire year searching for a Software Engineering job in the US. Unfortunately, because of my foreign degree and lack of experience, I couldn't secure a position, which felt like a wasted year. Eventually, I landed a Software Development Engineer (SDE) job with Amazon in my home country, so I returned and started working there.

I spent 1 year and 9 months in this role before relocating back to the US. During this time, I was part of an away team model. This meant that my team didn't own any products or services; instead, we worked on projects owned by other teams. This model was challenging, especially since my team was newly formed when I and another teammate joined. Our manager struggled to secure meaningful projects for us, so most of our work involved internal tools, minor tasks like testing, enhancing existing features, and generating reports.

I was eventually assigned a couple of promising projects that could have provided valuable experience, but unfortunately, they were canceled last minute for various reasons (the typical away team struggles).

One project, however, allowed me to do my first system design and full implementation, which was a great learning experience. Sadly, after completing and handing over the project, the owner team decided not to take it to production due to internal reasons. Consequently, I was left without any tangible results from my efforts.

I feel like the experience I gained during those 21 months is equivalent to only about 6 months. After relocating to the US, I hoped to gain more experience, become part of a service owner team, and work towards a promotion. However, my new team had a huge backlog of tickets, making me feel like I was brought in primarily to fix bugs and clear the backlog rather than focus on my personal growth.

Six months after the relocation, I moved to another team. During this time, I struggled with depression, anxiety, and ADHD, which severely impacted my productivity and deliverables. As a result, I spent a year in this third team without accomplishing enough and ultimately ended up getting terminated for performance issues.

It's been almost a year since my termination, and during this time, a lot has happened. I went through a divorce, faced family issues, and dealt with personal struggles.

I've applied to countless jobs, but only one company has interviewed me so far, and I ended up being rejected. I feel that my work experience is more about familiarity with different technologies than actual accomplishments.

I feel lost and unsure of what my next step should be. Should I focus on fixing my resume, continue applying for jobs, or pursue certifications?

Thank you for reading this far, I would greatly appreciate any advice. I've already lost many years and am trying my best to get back on my feet and salvage what's left.",Creepy-Database-661,1,1.0,0,1716843650,2024-05-27 21:00:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d226w3/experience_and_work_gap_please_advise/,5,2024

M23 working in India, I'm currently senior analyst (2yoe) for climate risk analytics team for a banking firm. I recently got to know my salary isn't even inside salary bracket range of 15-22LPA(Lacs per Annum) for a senior analyst, maybe I internally got promotion. 

Was working in a extremely non-friendly environmental team(I don't want to say theT word) and went through a lot past 2 years. At one point, I lost temper, cried, suffered and applied internally as I immediately wanted to move out of team. I got the team, but even for internally changing my manager made me to stay for 3 months. During these 3 months my problems increased 2x times with added anger towards me and couple of others switched the team because of the team environment. 

Now I'm going to shift to a risk modelling team internally next week. So now I'm confused on couple of things, as I suddenly got an opportunity to give an interview for a Big4. I'm anxious for past couple of days and have queries, please help in whatever you can.

1. Should I focus on getting CFA esg or GARP SCR certificate and try to move towards Climate risk related analytics work stream? I really like my work and understand Climate risk even though I don't have professional degree towards it.

2. Should I stick to generic data analytics and not go specific like climate risk or banking? What do you suggest? But I feel Climate risk is something going to be really the big thing going forward, luckily I'm in there and have experience, I fear losing this golden opportunity, I want to Excel and dominate in my niche of climate, risk and analytics.

3. Is it really worth shifting to service based company or startups losing personal life for few years? I'm not interested to lose my life just focusing on work. 

4. I just have engineering as my bachelor's degree, should I do masters really to upgrade my corporate career? If so, I'm thinking of sustainability or risk management or totally data analytics in Canada or Europe (not confident if I can get placement/visa in US). If you were in my shoes, what would have you done? 

5. Is it good to swift the company after an year(3yoe)? To climate risk related itself or normal data analytics? To banking firms itself or consulting? What should be my ideal salary range to search for? 

6. Is it possible to get genuine safe remote jobs? Where to find? Or is it possible to directly apply abroad jobs? 

Sorry if I missed any details, please let know any additional information is required. And yeah, I'm just anxious at the moment.",Elliot_025,1,1.0,0,1716838882,2024-05-27 19:41:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d205yp/really_confused_need_your_advice_please/,5,2024
1d1zyrh,Seeking Advice: Unsure About My Career Path,"Hello everyone,

I'm a (20F)-year-old student, I live in Belgium and I don't see myself staying here. I'm currently in my first year of a bachelor's degree in marketing. However, I must admit that marketing wasn't my first choice, and it doesn't align with my true passion, which lies in the fashion industry.
Unfortunately, my dream school in Paris is financially out of reach for me, with tuition fees amounting to 10,000 euros per year. Additionally, my financial situation is precarious, and I rely on a scholarship for support.

I initially considered pursuing a career in communication, but the schools offering relevant programs were located far from my city, and I couldn't afford to relocate. Consequently, I settled for marketing, but I find the traditional educational system overwhelming. Spending eight hours a day sitting in lectures for three years feels like a waste of time, especially when some courses seem unnecessary and merely added to fill the curriculum.

I'm at a crossroads now. On one hand, I want to quit school and explore alternative paths that allow me to generate income while pursuing my interests. On the other hand, leaving school would mean losing the financial support I receive from my country's welfare system. I'm torn between finding a new direction or carving out a career that aligns with my passion for fashion and makeup.
I also love everything that involves organizing events. This year I surprised myself by liking certain courses where we had to create content for a project. The teacher gave us instructions to create a business of our choice, to create a communication strategy as well as social medias for the « company ».

1d1zynd,Struggling get back in work following toxic employer and unremarkable career. ,"I won't bore you with all details but after finishing masters in 2016 I had string of roles in Admin working low level and minimum wage positions, initially as result of my focus being elsewhere, as I had several family issues I found myself stuck in trying to sort. I finally started making active change only to be delayed by covid, I made progression in 2022 being recognised for my contributions and being made an operations manager, however as result of the size and issues that going on director side, I made decision to return to previous role which despite leaving for micro managing, I was ensured that would not be the case as he was merging with his brother company and I would be treated as manager. Despite that they did try lowball me on offer and eventurally they matched my salary which was still low side £26K, but was told I would see a raise follow probation which would be three months, since they had been chasing me and I had been working on the side for them for close to a year at that point. 

Roll on 2023 and everything falls apart, I had stayed in what had become a failed relationship with someone emotionally distant and on some cases had been physical and emotionally abusive. Someone who I admit had stayed with as I was financially unable to and something they knew too.  With this rocky foundation for my life. when I lost the person closest to me, it all came apart. I had been raised by my grandparents, my granddad had died two years prior and my Nan died last year in January, I had stayed night as she was unwell only to awake to find her having stroke and had to go with her in the ambulance alone. only to watch her die in hospital. 

The relationship under this pressure and lacking any support, led to it ending in May last year. Filling for divorce after one final argument, I will not repeat what was said but one thing her stating that I could not survive financially without her. As a result of being unable to process grief and to avoid dealing with my ex I had thrown myself into work, what started as a few hours here and there balloned to 100 hour work weeks. This would continue for months myself also blaming myself for high turnover, as it was my fault that people leaving if I implemented better training and procedures. My May the entire team had changed in period of 3 months. Despite the director saying it voluntary mostly to avoid paying (I was not paid a single penny for any of the overtime I did for the company and they used same excuses to not pay my expenses despite traveling across country for the work), I was penalised when work that sent across at 8PM to be processed for next morning was not, note I should finished at 5PM. 

By June I was losing my sight, I was unable to keep food down and had lot 30lbs in less then three weeks, despite never smoking I was smoking every day putting the butts out on myself, I had colleagues,, clients, friend and doctors telling me to stop but I couldn't. The team was still struggling mostly as result of what I found was the directors action had created toxic environment, lacking support mired by sexist comments and a belief that all workers were expendable. 

Following a heated argument that erupted in the workplace following pay coming through increasingly late, incorrect and none team having received payslips since starting. The instigator was called and verbally assaulted over the phone I caught tail end of the conversation, only find recording call had been deleted by time I returned to office, where re-entering office I slammed the door behind myself overwhelmed by everything that happened angry at the directors and at myself for letting this happen. When questioned why all I said this can't keep happening only be told I shouldn't worry about x employee. 

Three weeks I was pulled in meeting no notice told it regular only be told it displinary, I was given no representation, and was told slamming door is gross misconduct, how they had complaints from owner building ( had in writting this did not happen), people were intimidated (everyone in office stated not the case having messaged me after the day of the door slamming telling me to take holiday or sign off, as they could see me burning out and worried for me) and how slamming door could have caused someone to die. Amongst that there were comments regarding things I said in confidence regarding how felt following my nan death and my divorce). They told me I had to take pay cut brining me to minimum wage and with all my money tied up in house I brought my ex and having recently moved out I was in no financial position, barely making by on my current salary. 

I left the office and took certain actions that resulted in me being hospitalised, during my time in er I was messaged telling me to return office to sign the new contract. I signed off on sick sent email stating I did not agree and would not discuss till I had been deemed well by doctor. Only recieve email stating my contract had been terminated with date that I started wrong stating March when started Jan. 

  
Since then I lived off the half of my money I got from house during divorce but struggled find work only getting odd admin or warehouse temp work, making a bit so not using my saving but not enough to cover myself. 

It been year and starting to think they were right and I was not capable and my ex right and should have just accepted what was going on in the marriage. All I want is job that pays bills and I can live independently, one where I can afford small flat and put money back so might even buy something and little spare cash. I live fugally I have gym and concerts I help work on in my own time and that it. After doing masters and 6 years admin and having management experience, I don't think it much ask for but I keep on struggling find anything.  I rewritten my cv hundreds of time and at this point it bastardized version what it is. 

I just need some guidance, I just need to know that despite my mistake it was not my fault that I am worth more then what I had in that company and previous relationship.

1d1yrkp,Seeking Advice: Unsure About My Career Path ?,"Hello everyone,

I'm a (20F)-year-old student, I live in Belgium and I don't see myself staying here. I'm currently in my first year of a bachelor's degree in marketing. However, I must admit that marketing wasn't my first choice, and it doesn't align with my true passion, which lies in the fashion industry.
Unfortunately, my dream school in Paris is financially out of reach for me, with tuition fees amounting to 10,000 euros per year. Additionally, my financial situation is precarious, and I rely on a scholarship for support.

I initially considered pursuing a career in communication, but the schools offering relevant programs were located far from my city, and I couldn't afford to relocate. Consequently, I settled for marketing, but I find the traditional educational system overwhelming. Spending eight hours a day sitting in lectures for three years feels like a waste of time, especially when some courses seem unnecessary and merely added to fill the curriculum.

I'm at a crossroads now. On one hand, I want to quit school and explore alternative paths that allow me to generate income while pursuing my interests. On the other hand, leaving school would mean losing the financial support I receive from my country's welfare system. I'm torn between finding a new direction or carving out a career that aligns with my passion for fashion and makeup.

I also love everything that involves organizing events. This year I surprised myself by liking certain courses where we had to create content for a project. The teacher gave us instructions to create a business of our choice, to create a communication strategy as well as social medias for the « company ».
Here's the link: https://www.instagram.com/mkeventpro?, maybe you could give me your opinion.

If anyone has been in a similar situation or has any advice to offer, I would greatly appreciate your insights. Whether it's suggestions for alternative career paths, advice on navigating the fashion industry, tips on managing finances while pursuing my dreams, or feedback on my project, I'm open to any guidance you can provide.

1d1ynz8,Don't want to continue my Architecture degree.,"I'm an architecture student currently in the 8th sem which is the internship period. So I have backs in almost all the semesters so far, except the first two semester. I have one back in a theory subject in 3rd sem, In 4th sem I have one back in practical and one theory subject. And I didn't give any exam in 5th, 6th and 7th sem. And now it's my internship which is gonna end next month. And I don't feel like continuing this degree because of the backlog and honestly I don't think I'm capable enough to clear all the backlog in next one year and I'm not interested in this anymore.  
And the other part of the story is that my parents don't know about most of it. They only know about 5th sem backs. And I don't have guts to tell them, because it's my fault that I messed all of it and wasted all their money that they've invested in me so far.  
Even if I try to continuing it I won't be able to clear all the backs by next year plus it takes hell a lot of money so again I don't know how will I get that.

1d1yhkb,Would I be crazy if I told my manager I need a pay increase or I’ll need to find another job?,"I started this job just over 2 1/2 years ago when my current role was newly created, so I was one of the first few to join.

During the negotiation process, I expressed nervousness that this job would be a significant paycut from my job at the time but I was assured due to the growth of the company I should expect to make much more within 6 months. Yes, that didn’t happen and always get that in writing.

Though it was a paycut, I had several reasons for making the switch: much better benefits, work/life balance (I was previously working a minimum of 48 hours and up to 75 hours with almost no PTO), and opportunity for growth.

2 1/2 years later, the company has gone from being a scrappy start up to being a serious contender in the industry, and about a year ago was acquired by a much bigger, extremely well-known company for an insane price. Right now I am currently the most senior in my position and have helped onboard and train the team we have now. Recently my manager asked me to take on an additional project that has a lot of executive eyes on it because he feels I’m the most experienced and qualified on our team to handle it.

Awesome, right? Well, my salary is the exact same as it was 2 1/2 years ago. Not only that, after they hired me the they steadily increased the pay band for my role. Not only am I making over 50% *less* than everyone else on my team (I know this for a fact), *I am $7k below the lowest end of the position’s pay band*. A few months ago our company went through our promotion/raise cycle and I took this opportunity to bring up my pay discrepancy to my manager and asked him to seriously consider a pay raise for me. He said he would do his best, but word was that the promotion/raise budget was much lower this year.

For context, my current manager is not the one who hired me and following the company acquisition there was a restructure that put me under a new report. Before this reorg, I had a different report who reported into a VP, Clint, who has since finagled his way to one of the leaders of the company. No complaints here, as Clint is honestly one of the most abusive people I’ve ever worked for and the reorg gave him a larger to spread out his abuse. My previous manager was pretty inept, but I also know he was struggling underneath Clint and was taking the brunt of it (though I and the rest of the team definitely got out our fair share). Clint is really good at what he does, and is also really, really good at psychologically breaking people down. Not only that, he is vicious when he feels someone is undermining his authority/control and will go out of his way to make things hard for them, especially if they move to a different department. He has made quite a few people in other departments quit without having a backup job. I recently comforted a 21 year old intern, who is in a different department, because she came crying to me after he looked up her personal number and called her to berate her about what a terrible job she did on a project (of which she was not in charge of). I have worked in many fields that are known for difficult bosses, have dealt with plenty of bosses who screamed at or threatened me, and I’m very good with handling difficult personalities. But Clint is on a different level. I do think the acquisition, larger team, and promotions have forced Clint to soften his approach.

So, with that context, I have a lot of trust in my current manager, but I do need to be mindful that he reports to Clint. Well, about 3 weeks ago, which was two weeks after salary raise information was supposed to be communicated, my manager told me that not only did I not get a raise, *no one* in the 75+ person department got one. In fact, this was a decision Clint made in January, nearly a half year ago, and did not bother to communicate this to his leadership team under two weeks *after* the communication deadline. You can’t make this shit up.

Despite Clint, I truly enjoy my job and the team I work with. That said, I literally can no longer afford to work at the salary I currently have. On top of effectively making less than when I first started due to inflation, the acquisition resulted in worse benefits. I’m not even wanting a merit raise, I want my salary to reflect my niche expertise and seniority and at the very least meet the minimum salary band of the job. I don’t want to leave, but at this pay, something needs to change as I’m barely scraping by.

Is this something I should express to my manager? I want to approach it sensitively, but I also need them to know this is no longer a workable situation for me financially.",Physical_Orange2197,0,0.4399999976158142,14,1716834890,2024-05-27 18:34:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d1yhkb/would_i_be_crazy_if_i_told_my_manager_i_need_a/,5,2024

1d1yfcj,I am a brand new manager and the store is filthy.,"I am new to a store near me as a flavor of manager, I won’t get specific. This is a very slow time of year for this business, so expect maybe $300-400 USD in sales a day. No reason to leave anything unfinished. 

I spent some time observing everyone and their habits - the few employees we have spend their time on their phones when customers are in the store. They eat lunches visible to customers. They don’t clean. I don’t know how to explain to you how gross it was, how CAKED IN DUST AND LINT, on the table where you are meant to have your lunch. Nobody informs customers of sales, even at checkout, so they aren’t trying to justify being there by boosting sales, either. 

Reddit, why is everyone lazy? 

How do I go about fixing this nicely? I should not need to explain to them to clean up. I outrank most of them. How do I speak to my bosses about this considering they are also part of the problem? I think if anyone in corporate has been in the store, they’re on my lazy list, too, because it was has clearly been years since it has been cleaned and they should have gotten onto everyone already about it. 

I have people below and above me to “manage” apparently. What do I do? What do I definitely not do? Please keep in mind, I am effectively a baby manager (little experience) and am typically non-confrontational. Thank you!

1d1xax2,Electrical Engineering Advice,"Hello,

I’d like some input on a couple options I have coming up:

Background - M28, in BC, Canada.

I recently got diagnosed with adhd and started meds, which really gave me an objective view on my career and want to make some improvements. Currently working for a large engineering company as an Engineering technologist (electrical engineering diploma), nearing an assessment that should get me around the 100k CAD mark. But i have a few options that are making me question if continuing here is my best option:

- my city offers a bridge program that will allow me to complete a degree in engineering BSc. This will obviously open more doors and with my experience increase my pay. But this will involve student loans and loss of income during this time.

- I am nearly complete my apprenticeship as an electrician, and the combination of journeyman and electrical engineering technologist is very desirable

- I was a project manager for 4 years with a good record and broad experience, current job market is really good although harder to get in without a degree or trade ticket. Salary cap is very high.

Mainly looking for insight on if it’s worth going back to school. I don’t want to work as an electrician, but finishing my ticket is great for my resume. I have jumped around from management to trades to engineering and I’m looking for something sustainable with a higher salary cap. 

Thanks in advance!

I wasn't able to think of a specific example to the question: *Tell me about a time you've miscommunicated in a meeting, and how you handled it.* Instead, I walked through hypothetical, and acknowledged that it wasn't the answer they asked for, and could definitely feel the tone shift.

  
Apparently this was enough to give me a negative mark, and seemingly as a result, other candidates were added to the round. The team is apparently very impressed with one of these new candidates, while I am at a 'leaning yes'. I know this because the referral manager is transparent with my (Bless him). He said that he will rpvode more feedback regarding my interviews when the process is over, and in the meantime is 'still rooting for me'.

I feel robbed. I am certain that the Communication skills that I displayed were very strong throughout the rest of my interviews. The manager has explicitly stated that he wants me for the role, but who knows how much sway he actually has. In my final interview, I was even told by the interviewer 'Sounds like we'll have to hire you to hear more.. Hurry up and join the team so we can grab a drink'. Why tf would you say that to someone unless it was a sure thing?



What should I do now? It isn't unrealistic to say that another opportunity like this won't happen again for me. I want to request another opportunity to showcase my fit. But at this point, I don't know what is crossing the line, and if it's inappropriate to ask my referral manager for anything more.

1d1v8z8,Supervisors harrassing me?,"I recently got my first job and everything was going well except for the favoritism and hierarchy power struggles. 

There was some extra work in the office. This happens often, it’s just leftover optional work that you can do in your freetime. 

I volunteered to take on the task. My supervisor was kind of like “yeah get it done in your freetime. Here are the files. Thanks, all is good”. 

I start working a lot more hours because I took on this extra training that happens in a couple cities over so that I can become qualified for certain activities at work. (Court training). 

My supervisor messages me PRIVATELY on teams about the extra work in the middle of the week. I responded saying “ah I haven’t been able to get it solved this week. I’ve been extremely busy” he’s like “yeah it’s all good. No rush man”. 


Now, this weekend is memorial weekend. I go out of town to visit a sick elder family member and just see him for probably the last time. 

During my drive to the destination, my supervisor texts me again but this time he does it publicly in the teams group chat and then privately messages me and I see both these messages hours later after my drive. They consist of:

“Hey, I need that work done as soon as possible. What is your eta on it? The files are important for next week’s activities” - IN PRIVATE INBOX

PUBLIC GROUP CHAT- “hey OP, get those files finished up so we can get the outing scheduled :) “

I was confused? He didn’t give me a deadline or make this seem like some urgent time sensitive work when giving it to me. Why is he making it public? Feels like he’s trying to put me on blast and pin so much responsibility on me. 

I responding to the group chat text he sent with “I am out for the weekend to attend a family matter”, everyone saw it. 

Over the weekend another kind supervisor that I get along well with was kind of pressuring me. Texting me at night asking the progression on the filework. 

I kept responding saying like “ok I’ll get to it asap. I understand. If I knew how urgent this was, I would’ve done it during the work week. “ he and the mean supervisor kept texting me reminding me how urgent it was. 

I had a horrible weekend because of it :/ I tried messaging close coworkers (that joined the job through me) but coincidentally they agreed to help then retracted their help saying bs reasons of “ah I actually can’t help today. I’m gonna help my sister put a shelf together today”. It felt like they were leaving me hanging to leave me in trouble. 

I came home Sunday night and immediately started working on the file work at night. I was half asleep until I got another text “have you started? We can give the work to someone else. (Big big boss) wants this done asap. Can you send me the files?” 

I told him I was up late doing them. He said “sorry for bugging you. We really needed this”


I feel like quitting. Give me your opinions and speculations on this please. I don’t know if I’m wrong for not automatically working fast on everything. Or if this was rude of them.

After that i got into programming, had some interviews for software developer internship spots but didn’t land any of them because of my portfolio( my test assignments were good, but i didn’t have really anything to show, totally understandable). Now lately been thinking what do i actually enjoy doing.

When I was 18, I took a charge for a guy I was dating (stupid I know) but I had no idea what I was messing up for my future. 
I went to school for medical assisting and phlebotomy. At the end of my externship I had 5 job offers. But all of them turned my employment down when the background check came in and said that with the felony on my record there was no way I could ever work in the medical field.

 I was told that the only way to move past this was to have it expunged off my record. But that’s expensive. And with mine. I’d have to get a pardon from the governor of my state.

1d1qkwq,what kind of jobs will hire me??,"i got fired from my restaurant job 3 months ago for something that was not my fault (i protested the store staying open through a severe health code violation that put customers and staff at risk) and have not been able to find a job.

I graduated college in 2022 and had several internships with highly notable companies in my field, that thoroughly trained me for the entry level positions of my field (assistant/executive assistant roles). I also have extra accomplishments at each of them, one of the most notable being I was contracted post-internship by the most notable company to delivery an educational panel on a certain aspect of the business.

And yet nobody will hire me. I’m fully trained and equipped to be an assistant but nobody will give me a chance. Even assistant jobs in other fields won’t call me back. Not even receptionist roles will. How am I supposed to break into a job that I’m already fully trained to do with notable early achievements and company prestige to back me up?

i can do all of the things an assistant is meant to do, but apparently that’s not good enough, so what entry level office jobs CAN I get??

I ALSO have 4 years of customer service/food service/retail experience ranging from this local restaurant that fired me to macys and dunkin’ donuts. I really do not want to do these jobs again because I am transgender and the level of disrespect i receive from customers post-transition takes a huge toll on my mental health. Those ugly work uniforms make it so much harder to get gendered correctly, and at restaurants they make you wear your hair up, which does me no favors either.

1d1qhif,Which path should I take?,"HI all,

I am currently a CS student that is about 1.5 years into my degree.
Recently I've been considering switching to Industrial Engineering because of the growing saturation in CS, not having a true passion to code ( I like it but can't see myself doing it forever), and  having a stable job market.

My father owns several successful liquor store businesses and my ultimate goal is eventually take it over and expand/ or even start a business of my own, whether its liquor or something else
The purpose for my degree would be more so so I can learn skills which I can apply to a business, build some early capital in which I can invest and fund into businesses, and also to have a ""backup"" degree if for whatever reason owning a business doesn't work out for me.

Many people are telling me to finish the CS degree because apparently it can still be useful even if I don’t code, and I can always get a masters in I.E. Although I’m not sure how CS could apply to any business I’d want to do besides creating websites. Can I even start a business based off CS? And what if I end up losing my business and will need to get a job? won’t i be stuck with a CS degree with no value considering I would have took a long hiatus and forgotten to code and not up to date with modern code.

I know I.E is kind of the “underdog” when it comes to engineering disciplines, but I do hear that they are very versatile and can work anywhere (not as difficult as CS to get a job either).
Plus I feel like the optimization skills can come quite handy in business and can be applied to any businesses I may want to pursue.  Plus correct me if i’m wrong, but I’d still have the option of becoming a SWE if I really wanted to. 

The only downside to switching to I.E is I technically will have to start over, where little to no credits will transfer towards the degree.
If I do switch to  I.E i was planning on pairing it with a minor in CS since I can already fulfill it and I also don’t want to let go of CS completely. 

Also would it be better to stick with bachelors in CS and just get a masters in I.E? or a bachelors in I.E with a minor/masters at in CS?

And ultimately, I was wondering which degree cater better to my goals and purpose?

1d1pz44,BSc Psychology > MSc AI  > What next?,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 27M living in the UK, originally from Spain, and I could really use some career advice. I've been living in the UK for the last 4 years. Due to personal circumstances, I've been working since I was seventeen, mostly in low-wage jobs. In the UK, I've been working as a head chef.

I consider myself a ""multipotentialite"": I love learning across various topics, and I have a wide range of interests. I graduated with a 2:2 in Psychology in Spain and then switched to an MSc in AI in the UK, where I managed to achieve one of the top GPAs. While studying has always been my strength, I didn't find my undergraduate studies in Psychology particularly challenging, hence my lower grades.

I'm now looking to build a career in AI/Data Science as it seems both challenging and interesting. However, I'm feeling a bit lost about my next step. The one-year duration of my master's program has left me feeling underprepared to compete with computer science grads in the job market.

I’m considering three main options and would love to hear your thoughts:

1. PhD in AI & Psychology / Cognitive Science: My supervisors believe I have the potential for a PhD. I enjoyed my MSc dissertation and like conducting research. Plus, the stipend would be helpful.
2. 2nd Master's in AI: This could help solidify my knowledge and provide networking opportunities. I did well in my first MSc and could potentially get a scholarship to cover fees. However, I would probably need to keep working as a chef to cover my expenses.
3. Entering the workforce through an internship: I've been focusing on this since graduating, but I've only had a couple of interviews and no job offers yet. I'm wondering if my unconventional background is a barrier to landing a data-related role.

I feel highly motivated about my next move but can’t seem to find a clear path. I’m anxious about wasting my potential by staying in a job that’s no longer for me, even though it pays well. If I don’t take risks now, I worry I might get stuck in the kitchen for life (nothing wrong with this career, it's just not for me anymore).

Any advice or insights you can provide about my situation would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!",astonz,1,1.0,0,1716811549,2024-05-27 12:05:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d1pz44/bsc_psychology_msc_ai_what_next/,5,2024

1d1oj6i,"Offered an internal move but now regretting it, too late to back out?","I am 25 and live in the UK. I have a permanent employment contract with my employer (investment banking). 

An internal vacancy came up and i spoke to the hiring manager. It was mutual that I would be a good fit. I asked her if there’s a pay increase and she said I would be able to get £65k (i’m currently on £60k).  The move will be good , and i’m interested in that department, so i applied for it. 

I’ve received the offer. After negotiating, HR only gave me £62k. They initially didn’t want to even increase me from £60k. They say if i was to apply for that job externally, thats how much i would get. 

The role is not a promotion, it’s a lateral move. I probably would have moved for the 5k. 

Now i’m thinking, is it worth starting from scratch again in a new department, having to learn new things again, all just for 2k?

This move does have better career development and a pathway to senior management, but I feel like i’d be stuck and not be able to leave again since i’d have very little experience in that new field.

1d1lzgo,How to impress a manager that's never there?,"I am working at a classic office as a inside sales representative but want to get a promotion to become fields/outdoor salesman, or at the very least applications specialist. Problem is the manager who I have to go through with this rarely ever is seen at the office. That's not to say he's lazy it's just that if he's not working from home he's at meeting somewhere in the big office. Normally the entire team is working right next to each other, so as a sales rep I've been assisting the field sales and the tele sales with technical details, customer contact and relations to a big degree and I've even received praise from all of them including the other managers. 

However, the one guy I'm supposed to impress never is there to see it. I've been trying to get his attention during some biweekly meetings but I feel like it just comes off as business as usual for him. Even if I pull bigger quotes than my contract expects and have expanded my role to include even more responsibilities than I initially had to (yes I did get a pay raise for it so no worries). But it's not a full on promotion and more that I work as both inside and tele sales now. He knows my ambitions but it doesn't seem to be any eagerness from him to give me the opportunity, all he says is that I should look at our publicly posted vacancies (there are never any relevant ones there)

1d1inni,Team lead is fired - what is the next best step?,"On Friday evening, I learned that our team lead, for the product I am responsible for marketing, is fired from the company. 

He was working really hard and was doing a great job. All performance metrics of our products are on positive and ATH records every month. However, we was very direct and sometimes very emotional about bad decision of the management and her/his peers. There were some discussions & power plays going on in the background.. I can understand the management because she/he was giving hard time to them, talking about the problems of the company openly and without any filters.

They also wanted to let team lead go because they are restructuring the department, so there will be no replacement for his/her role. This person was doing almost everything herself/himself and they don’t want to have someone like that anymore.

We had a good relationship with her/him and although I was reporting to her/him, we were working more as partners, with a shared vision. Because my role is marketing based but I was in the product team and mind you, this is a e-commerce company.

Long story short, now I have lost my “partner” and department management didn’t really think too much about the marketing aspect of the things. 

Our company has a marketing department but their structure is not that great and turnover is high. They are also using ancient marketing strategies and not really open for change. For example, department had no director for a few month and director before was very hands off and was not up to the task.

My current department (product) probably will want me to more to marketing department, but there is nobody in that department who knows specifics of the marketing I’m doing.

I am doing (alone, all by myself) CRM, paid media, marketing analytics and SEO for my product and the marketing department has all this on different teams. I have around 8 years of total experience as a specialist but didn’t really had any manager roles in the past.


I thought I could do something like this but I am also not 100% sure:

1 - Talk to CCO (he is reachable and we had some small exchanges in the past. He is a nice guy in group calls but on 1:1, he is a big “tough) and ask for a “coaching” sessions to lay out the status. He might give me some hints about the best possible approach but even he can’t, I want to give the impression that I am open for his guidance. I think he was not involved in the decision of letting team lead go, because decision was coming from CTO.

2 - Ask him if “it’s a good idea” to form my own team within the marketing department and take charge of my topics alone, reporting to marketing director. (Marketing director started in our company around 2 weeks ago)


My questions to the experienced veterans of this sub are basically:

1- Does this plan make sense?
2- ⁠How would you approach to this situation?
3- Alternative to all this, would be to not do anything, just keep on doing my job and waiting for a decision to come. Do you think it is better for me?

⁠I am not sure if I’ll like being a manager or if I will have better wage.
Obviously having no financial benefits from this doesn’t make sense. I think my salary is good for what I am doing, even compared to managers in the marketing department. That’s why I am a bit in between about because I have no “real” information to compare my salary with other managers in the department.

I'm in tech at a Fortune 200, earning around 100k in a high cost of living area. I like my job, company, and management but feel insecure due to a lack of specialization. Recently got a BS in IS management and entry-level AWS/GCP cloud certs.

**Skills Overview:**

* **Programming:** Basic knowledge in Java, Python, JavaScript; deployed websites as a hobby.
* **DevOps:** Know Git, Docker, cloud deployments; would likely be considered junior level.
* **Data:** Familiar with SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle); not an expert.
* **Network Engineering:** Extensive experience but not passionate; would need certifications.
* **Project Management:** Worked in a PM role, considering CAMP or PMP certifications.
* **Side Hustle:** Started a small business, makes some money but risky to focus on.
* **Other Skills:** Learning Figma, Photoshop, DSLR photography for web design and product photos.

Feeling at risk in my current role and unsure which path to specialize in. Should I focus on project management, DevOps, programming, network engineering, or my side hustle?

1d1ennp,50k salary vs 73k salary,"Hey guys. I’d like your opinion on a possible job change/career advice. 

50k job

I am currently working in a help desk role where I remotely troubleshoot software issues for automated warehouses.  2 days in office (1 hr drive back and forth) and 3 days remote. Theres days where I barely do anything, and the remote days are really nice. I have to work the entire weekend once a month which sucks… I also feel like I’m not respected as a help desk engineer even though we do some cool stuff. There’s not a clear path for growth from this role. I work with many customers in this role. 

73k job + 6k relocation 

Id have to relocate halfway across the country and work on site 4 days a week, 10 hr shifts and work for one company. There will likely be a lot of overtime since the site is new and will undoubtedly need assistance. I’d be working in person so I get to actually see the things that I have been troubleshooting remotely. This is a 18 month contract so there’s no guarantee what happens after those 18 months. I got it in writing that my company will have a job for me afterwards if the customer doesn’t offer me anything after the 18 months. My company will be paying for my move. It’s near a big city so I planned on living in the city and my commute should be about 30ish mins. I’ll be the main guy and be counted on to fix the software issues, versus at the help desk I am able to work with a few other engineers. 

I mean I feel like I know the answer. I gotta take the risk to try to help advance and grow my career. I am just hesitant on leaving a relatively easy role with a lot of down time vs. me having to work on site and fix a lot of issues since they are a new site with new equipment. 

TLDR: am I making a mistake from switching jobs to a contract job where the future is unknown but I should be able to gain a lot of experience from the role?

1d1dvfu,Looking for a Switch: Best Field to Transition Into from a Biology Background?,"Hello everyone,  
I’m seeking advice on a career transition and would greatly appreciate your insights!  
Background:

* Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences.
* One year of experience as a Technician in Agtech, working on phenotypic technology.
* One year of experience as a Research Associate in a sequencing lab.
* In the sequencing lab, I worked on sequencing DNA and post-processing tasks such as quality control and data analysis.

Both positions were within the agricultural industry, but I am looking to transition out of agriculture.  
Additionally, I have an Associate's degree in Database Development and am currently learning how to code and query in SQL and Python.  
While I’ve gained valuable experience, I find that the field doesn’t pay enough and I’m considering a change. I’m open to going back to school if necessary, but I’d like to leverage my education and work experience in a new, more lucrative field.

As far as passions go, it's a hard question to answer at the moment. These may not be relevant, but I like to make music, production/guitar, and I have been teaching myself Touchdesigner as well (thank you bileam tschepe), and I do like technology -- programming is rewarding. This goes without saying but I also do like biology, but the field and industry just isn't right for me.  
Questions:

* What fields should I consider that align with my background and education history?
* Are there any specific industries or roles that offer better pay and career growth opportunities?
* What additional education or certifications might be beneficial for making this transition?
* Any personal experiences or success stories of similar transitions would be very helpful!

1d1clvc,"Dream job slipping away, losing my mind","For several months, I have been in touch with the manager of a position that was set to open under him. This opportunity is my dream job and, after much anticipation, I finally started the interview process one month ago. 



All of my interviews went very well with the members of my prospective team. The only interview that went sub-optimally was the interview with another team's manager, and was focused on soft skills (communication). I wasn't able to think of a specific example to the question: *Tell me about a time you've miscommunicated in a meeting, and how you handled it*. Instead, I walked through hypotheticals, and acknowledged that it wasn't the answer she asked for, and could definitely feel a tone shift. 



Apparently this was enough to give me a negative mark, and as a result other candidates were added to the round. The team is apparently very impressed with one of these new candidates, while I am at a 'leaning yes'. I know this because the referral manager is transparent with me (bless him). He said that he will provide more feedback regarding my interviews when the process is over, and in the meantime is 'still rooting for me'



I feel robbed. I am certain that the Communication skills that I displayed were very strong throughout the rest of my interviews. The manager has explicitly stated that she wants me for the role on other occasions but who knows how much sway she has. In my final interview I was even told ""***Sounds like we'll have to hire you to hear more.. Hurry up and join the team so we can grab a drink***"". Why tf would you say that to someone unless it was a sure-thing?



What should I do now? My dream job is slipping away, I want to request another opportunity to showcase my fit.

1d1abny,Do I stay or leave for other companies ??,"I'm 25ys old (F) who got to work in a good company right off the bat as an intern. 
I started out at this company three years ago as a summer intern and got promoted really fast to a managerial position in marketing.
 I'm proud of that but due to the fast promotion rate, I didn't get the full package of the managerial level due to lack of experience in the field - they said they saw potential in me and that this was an opportunity.
I am really grateful for the opportunity and realize fully that not everyone have such chances early on in their career. 
I have been learning the ropes for this position for the last year and I'm now at a stage where I feel a bit more confident in my skills and ability. With that I came to realized two major things 

One: I feel really undercompnsated with the current salary package that I have... which is at least half of what I should be getting.
Second, I don't like the industry the company is in. I have no passion for the products and to be honest could care less if they sold or not... Which impacts my work values.
I want to switch to other companies but I realized that with only one year experience in managerial position and marketing, it could be weird for other companies to accept me in the same level as I currently am..
So, right now I'm unsure on how to move forward, do I just stay in the company and try to develop myself while negotiating the best I can to get higher salary... Or do I go to another company and widen my horizion and try to see what I really like to work in? 

I feel like either way there will be a loss for me, but I would like to hear other people's opinion and advice... especially if they went through the same thing as me

1d19nk5,"Accepted a temporary contract across the country out of desperation. Supposed to leave tomorrow, but I advanced to the 2nd round of interviews for a really good job in the meantime (and also just had a 1st interview for another good one). What should I do?","I'm a 36-year-old woman with a challenging work history due to past drinking issues. Almost my entire family died between the ages of 20 and 34, and I did not handle it well. I've managed to secure decent jobs, but my unreliability led to quitting or being fired. However, I quit drinking in 2019 and have remained sober since.

After being unemployed for years and receiving financial support from family, I decided to pursue a master's degree during the pandemic, which I completed last year. Despite applying for jobs after graduation, I didn't receive any interviews. I admittedly fudged some dates on my resume in hopes of securing interviews.

To maintain my remaining savings, I moved across the country to live with my dad. Shortly after the move, I was offered a temporary six-month contract for a decent job paying $22 an hour with a hybrid work arrangement. I accepted the offer, thinking it would provide experience and references, but the onboarding process took seven weeks.

In the meantime, I continued applying and landed two promising interviews:

1. A job in my academic field at a large state school in a city I'd like to live in, with a starting pay of $60k.

2. A position at an appealing nonprofit in another desirable city, offering $90k a year. I've advanced to the second round for this role.

I'm supposed to leave tomorrow to start the temporary job, which involves a four-day drive and signing a lease. However, I'm unsure of what to do, as signing a lease complicates matters if I secure one of the better positions. 

Additionally, both jobs require in-person interviews, which will be challenging to manage during the first weeks of the temporary job.

While I feel the need to leave my father's small house in the middle of nowhere due to our strained relationship, the two other opportunities, although not guaranteed, are genuinely promising. Now that I'm years sober, I believe I can make a positive change.

My friends in Engineering are very intelligent ones(so lucky that I have such people around me), they are doing very good in their careers. They don't like the government jobs much as they think the work is boring and monotonous and there's no growth. And I also felt the same. So I felt for how much time will I be wasting on pre-mains? out of, hopes/ambitiousness I again decided to change my career path towards preparing for CAT
Now I have been preparing for CAT since 4 months and I have no work experience. And When I will be applying for Institutes on 2025 there will be 3 years gap on my resume. Which I think will create a lot of hindrance in me getting admitted in the best MBA college. And some people also say thet this much gap will also cause difficulty in getting placed inside IIMs. That makes me more worried as I will have to take education loan to finance my MBA. Now I feel that I should again start preparing for government exams, and do government job as getting it is easy for me provided PWD has lower cutoffs. But my ambitions to develop personality, be with the brightest minds of the county doesn't let me give up on CAT preparation.

I also worked as a forensic account at an big 4 accounting firm and learned a lot but again not for me.

I really like market risk management and I don't have an FRM, should I continue to pursue this dream of mine, I also want to note that I'm not doing my masters at an Ivy league.

Also I've begun to take an interest in investment research which is what an analyst does for the asset management business unit of a BB investment bank or hedge fund.

My skill set is: Data analytics, Statistical modeling using ML algorithms, Financial valuations such as DCF, Python, R, Tableau, MS Office and a bit of SQL.

1d164x2,Mid30s looking to requalify for HRM. Wise or not? ,"Hi,
First off, I'm in Ireland and I know the job market here is different to elsewhere in Europe, so I recognise that a global subreddit may not give all the answers I'm looking for, but any insight or perspective from those working in Human Resource Management would be really welcome. 


Tl;dr: i am in my mid-30s and looking for a career change. I have flip flopped through different roles and industries and now need a clear career path. I think my existing experience and personality make me a good fit for HR, but I need guidance. Please help!


I have an Honours degree which is useless for me (in the media field). Halfway through the course I decided the career wasn't what I wanted, but decided having a degree was better than none so stuck with it, and got a good final result. I have broad experience, working different roles in different industries. I had hoped to find my vocation but I'm realising not everyone has a vocation and I will probably be better just to find a niche and stick with it.

Currently I'm an Operations Manager within the tourism and hospitality industry, which is very demanding with little reward. I work most weekends, and it's affecting my family life (I've a toddler and a newborn) and I also feel like I'm hitting the ceiling in terms of progression, unless I gain specific experience or additional qualifications. I could move sideways and be a manager elsewhere but I think it would be some time before I climb up more than a rung or two of the ladder. 

I have always been interested in HR, but never considered it as a career (mainly due to aversion to further study). I appreciate a certain amount of bureaucracy to ensure everyone's on the same page, and I am fairly black and white about a lot of things. I'd say I'm just about anal enough to be suitable for the role without being a total fun sponge. 

I do a fair amount of HR in my current role, managing up to 40 staff in peak season, and overseeing the vast majority of recruitment, training, development and disciplinary processes. There is a HR manager but he's really for escalation, each department head is expected to manage their own team internally.

To go back to college and study for a Masters degree in Human Resource Management will take a year full time (no income!) and cost me upwards of €10,000, or I could do it part time over two years. But I would have to negotiate time off with my employer, and I wouldn't be looking to work in HR for this current employer, so they could very well deny my request. 

I guess what I'm asking is, if anyone reading works in HR, am I wise to be pursuing this as a career, now in my mid-30s? I've another 35 years to go, most likely, and I want to make smart choices for my future. I never had good career advice from my parents or my school when I was growing up, and despite that I've done alright, but I need to do better. For myself and for my family. I want to find my niche and progress, and I can't see myself in my current line of work for another 30+ years. But I don't want to go through the expense and time of qualifying into HRM and then down the line finding there's no work, or its not suitable for me. 

Can anyone offer any advice? ",Brizzo7,1,1.0,0,1716743732,2024-05-26 17:15:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d164x2/mid30s_looking_to_requalify_for_hrm_wise_or_not/,5,2024
1d15wrv,extreme career anxiety 28yo,"First off, let me get the emotional side out of the way and maybe you can give some advice or even assurance. I'm 28 and feeling extreme career anxiety - I'm just not nearly as far along as I feel like I should be. I can't stop comparing myself to people I went to school with and people I worked with in the past. 

  
I went to college and got a bfa in visual art (I know, useless degree), and wanted to work in fashion. While I was in my undergrad, I took on about 4 different internships related to ecommerce and styling. I was hoping to get a job in something related to my internships but after applying to a decent number of jobs, admittedly, not as many as I should have, I ended up just working retail at a clothing store for a couple years. Pandemic hit, and I retreated back home to live with my parents and collect unemployment. Decided I wanted to pursue my MFA and applied to schools, ended up starting in the fall of 2021. It was a 3 year program and I completed the first two, but for the past school year I've been on medical leave. At this point, I'm recovered enough to the point where I can no longer use my medical ailment as an excuse for doing nothing. 



I am planning to go back to school in the fall to finish my final year and just get another useless degree. So by the time I'm done, I will have pissed away 5 years with only an MFA and unemployment earnings to show for it with no career prospects after I graduate in June of 2025 (at which point I will be 29). 

  
With all my career anxiety, I've contemplated a few different paths. The one I'm leaning most towards, which I also happen to have no experience in is being a therapist, which will require another 2-3 years of schooling. I'm thinking of applying to schools for the fall 2026 cycle so I have time to accumulate volunteer and POSSIBLY job experience if I can even land a job. I've also considered revisiting fashion. Problem is, I live in LA and there are next to no jobs related to styling (I've found 1 listing so far and the pay is absolute shit), so I'm also considering applying to jobs as an assistant buyer. Problem with the assistant buyer thing is, I've only done one internship that was loosely tied to buying, so getting a job would be challenging. I'm seriously considering fudging my CV and saying I did a lot more in the fashion buying than I did, picking up some excel skills and learning some buying terms.  

  
All is to say, what the f do I do with my life? Or can someone literally just console me? I'm struggling.",Flat-History-6867,5,1.0,2,1716743116,2024-05-26 17:05:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d15wrv/extreme_career_anxiety_28yo/,5,2024

  - Safer and more stable career path.
  - Less financial strain on me and my family.

Cons:
  - Medicine is not my first passion, but I would like to be a doctor
  - Takes about 10 years to finish studies

Option 2: Study Finance in Europe

Pros:
  - Finance is something I’m genuinely interested in.
  - Higher potential for international career opportunities.
  - Studying finance in Latvia is considered a poor career choice with limited prospects.
  - I do enjoy math and it would say it would be a more active career path mentally

Cons:
  - Significantly more expensive
  - Higher risk with uncertain job market outcomes.
  - Need to adapt to a new country, culture

Has anyone faced a similar decision or have any insights on either path? I’d appreciate any advice or personal experiences that could help me make an choice.

1d14077,Heavy Diesel Mechanic looking to pivot into Mechanical Engineering in some way. Looking for movement advice,"Hi all,

I'm 28 and I've been an advanced level dealership mechanic for 10 years. 7 of those years have been on Heavy Diesel/Tractor Trailer/Transport/Equipment.

I'm currently going back to school starting this Summer to start on my BSME. This will likely be a long road as I still work full time, but I'm trying to take as many classes as I can without overloading myself.

I'm really wanting a career change. The mechanics side doesn't appeal to me any more for a number of reasons, and the design/engineering/building/failure analysis side appeals to me greatly. I don't really know where I can begin with building up a career in Engineering, I know most students do an internship while they are are in their last year or so. Are there any jobs that might peak a recruiters interest? Or jobs that will help me start to develop and understand Eng Theory? I know automotive mechanical and electrical theory very well, I would just like to grow professionally and retire from the daily wrench in a productive way.

1d12tvg,Staying in Sales or Moving to PhDs,"Hi there,

I am graduating International Relations in September, and I've also been recently fired from my job in Sales. 

I worked in Sales for a couple of months, and initially wanted to do that because of the money and adrenaline rush that it gives. The role I took though, was far from ideal, and to perform I had to work unethically, which I didn't. I wanted to leave, so before I was fired for low performance, I already was interviewing for SDR Positions (my last job was in Telesales), and potentially got a job after 3rd stage for $60k.

My only concern now, however, is that I'd not like it. The money and adrenaline rush is great, but the job is quite stressful, high-risk when it comes to ethics and not intellectually stimulating. I started considering alternatives.

After a bit of thinking I started to think that PhD and working at university may be a way to go. This however requires me to do Masters (1 year, where I'd have to provide for myself financially), and PhD (3 years, potentially funded with $22k/year).

I don't know if I should accept the offer with $60k, which means no masters due to the job's nature, or if I should look for something while I do Masters and then PhDs, which means a huge pay cut.   
  
Is there any advice you could share?

TLDR: I got fired from my Sales job recently, got another offer with good salary, but I'm not sure if I want to work in Sales anymore. I want intellectual stimulation at work and need ethics to perform, which makes me think about working at university. That means I have to work for very little money for the next 3-4 years before I get PhDs.

It was never appropriate in a corporate environment, it still is not. We are not at war; we're gathering to solve some issue or managing a project or monitoring something important. We are not at war. No matter what they tell you. None of these things are a battle to win. If lives are at stake then you are dealing with an emergency, not a war. If you aren't in the military dealing with an armed conflict, we are NOT AT WAR.

I have asked around my friends and peers and they gave varying answers

Friends that supported Beckman thinks that it is important to gain practical skills and a longer duration for deeper learning,

On the other hand friends that supported Palo emphasize the value of the Palo Alto name for opening doors and building a network in a tough market. 1 friend pointed out that BA don't require v technical skills hence there is no need to go so deeply into skills.

  
My gut feel is leaning towards Beckman as I feel that I haven't really got the exposure on the technical skills (like sql, data manipulation etc) in DSM-Firmenich as I had only used Powerbi and Excel. But, at the same time, I also think that technical skills exposure can be substituted by learning on my free time and name is hard to substitute. 

I am torn between the technical skills vs prestige name

What do you think? Which opportunity would provide a better balance of skills development and career advancement? Any insights or experiences with either company or similar roles would be greatly appreciated!

1d0zscr,Where to start from?,"To give some context about myself. I completed 2nd level in Chartered Accountancy course( there are total 3 levels and we become a certified Chartered Accountant after completing those in India) and joined a company for internship which I hated as I didnt like the work. I left the company after working for 4 months and also left the course post which I went into depression and was not able to do anything for 2 years. I started learning programming(python) which I liked and wanted to continue on the computer science path and eventually become a software engineer but the problem is the degree I have is pretty much useless( Bachelor of commerce from a useless university which let me complete bachelors in 1 year as I completed 2 levels in chartered accountancy). I also learned basic web development (Javascript and React) and searched for entry level jobs but couldn't find any.

 Then I decided to apply to universities abroad. First, I applied to masters programs but due to my bachelors being in commerce, almost all universities rejected my application except one public university in Japan( Masters in computer science) which considered my application and accepted my degree but I am yet to hear a confirmation from them. I started exploring Machine learning and Deep learning and I was really fascinated with the subject. I started learning some basic fundamentals and did beginner level projects like creating a recommendation system, making predictions etc without learning much about the ml algorithms as I did those projects by watching YouTube tutorials.

 At this point I am considering to join a university abroad for bachelors in AI, but the problem is I am already 25 years old and don' t know whether I can make it and get a job in this domain. I already feel like a failure considering all the wrong decisions I took in my life which ruined my career despite getting excellent grades in my school. Can anyone please suggest what should I do?

1d0z8sm,"I'm having a hard time choosing two ""once-in-a-lifetime"" offers and I really don't know what to do.","Hello guys...I'm facing a tough decision and wanted some advice from people in the field.

I'm really concerned about this and it's giving me a hard time, very hard time.

i'm 26M and just two exams away from graduating in control theory engineering. I've always dreamed of working in the space sector. Last year, I started looking for internships and jobs in this field, and to my surprise, in December I got an offer for a thesis and internship at one of the biggest aerospace companies in Europe (Airb\*\* Space). This opportunity is abroad for only SIX months, with the potential for a job afterward (but not sure ofc) Initially, the topic wasn't my favorite, but I grew interested over time and saw it as a chance to learn new things.

However, a month ago, a Spanish space ""big"" startup ( +10 years in the field, 200 employees, already developed a small launcher, working on reusable launchers) offered me a full-time job with a good salary (€30k) and a few months to finish my exams. This company is very innovative and aligned with what I wanted to do before the Airbus offer.

Here are my pros and cons:

**Company A (Airb\*\* Space)- internship:**

*Pros:*

* Prestigious company, very hard to get into (even for the internship there is competition).
* Great work-life balance (potentially, if you get in).
* Mobility between projects and countries (if you get in, it's easy to change project and they do a lot of interesting stuff)
* Involved in major EU space projects.
* Learnin topic outside of Control theory

*Cons:*

* Only a six-month internship for now.
* no assurance to get in after.
* Topic interesting but not my first choice, though it has grown on me and I like the fact that is more toward research than ""just sell to make money"" .

**Company B (Spanish Space ""big"" Startup)- full time contract:**

*Pros:*

* the kind of work I wanted to do before the airb\*\* offer.
* I find the topic very interesting
* ""famous"" startup in Spain, received founding from gov, esa etc.
* Full-time job with a not bad salary.

*Cons:*

* Still a startup, relies on funding.
* Possibly poor work-life balance.
* very low flexibility, is the job that I wanted to try, but they do only that it's a niche.
* full time contract in another country so I need to be there at least for some time.
* Mixed reviews on Glassdoor ( even though the guys I contacted, working there are talking good).

My dilemma:

If I choose B, I fear it will be harder to get into top-tier companies like A in the future. If I choose A, I might regret not taking the job that I think in the present is more interesting.

Also, A seems like a safer choice for my resume and in long run may give me more flexibility ( I really like the potential ""job flexibility in A) but it’s only for six months now.,

and I'm afraid I will have difficult entering the space sector even though the internship would be great.

also in 1 month, I should start in A, even though no contract has been signed yet.

Any advice on how to decide would be greatly appreciated.",Western-Ad5526,2,1.0,1,1716722616,2024-05-26 11:23:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d0z8sm/im_having_a_hard_time_choosing_two/,5,2024
1d0yxl2,Been out of the army for almost a year and need your help.,"Hello everyone, 26M vet here - got out last year after 4 years of service. I did a coding bootcamp towards the end of my contract, thinking I'd chase a career in tech after getting out. Which didn't work out.

I've applied for countless tech roles and bombed more interviews than I can count, the old story everyone here has heard a million times. No luck breaking into the field so far. For the first 6 months I was out, I was riding the unemployment train which was a mixed bag. But those benefits dried up, so I've been hustling with gigs like DoorDash and odd jobs to pay the bills.

I'm enrolling at WGU (paying out of pocket) soon to get a tech degree since I can finish that in under 6 months with the credits I already have. I know having a degree is more of a checklist item these days, but I figure it's better than just having a high school diploma to show a potential employer, at least that's how I feel when I show them I have a GED.

But here's my main question for you fine folks - any recommendations on potential career paths a younger vet could transition into? I was an Army medic, but honestly, at this point, I'm open to any and all options. Don't care if it's a blue-collar gig like working on an oil rig or an entry-level where I can work my way up. Just need to get back into the workforce and have a job where I can work really long hours and get fairly compensated for my time if that makes sense. I do not care if I need to go to Alaska or China for that job, go out for months at a time to some remote location in the arctic hunting whales or relocate somewhere where i have to live out of my car (which ive done in the past) I just want to boost up my savings and feel like I'm not watching life go by. I also don't have any kids, recently divorced, and can live off mre's for the rest of my life if i had to, im basically a stray dog surviving on scraps lol. Trying to save as much money as possible until my income is stable again.

Reenlisting is pretty much my last resort option. I was hoping to make it on the civilian side. But I'm definitely open to any advice or ideas you all might have! Still young, motivated, but definitely need to find the right career path. Hit me with your thoughts.

I know it's weird to be asking this on reddit, but I literally have 0 friends, and I feel like a lot of young people who got out recently might be in a similar boat. So hopefully this can also help another vet.

1d0xuit,The pressure of a great job :(,"Hi! I just started working at a car manufacturing plant because it pays well, and has a union in place. The benefits are perfect, the starting pay is solid, with in-place raises, allowing me to make $40/hr in just 3 years! The work-life balance is awful, but hey most people would kill for a job like this. Personally, I feel like I made a mistake.

I'm 20 years old, and about to obtain my BS in Cybersecurity at WGU. I've got the main 3 CompTIA certs, and I feel ready to start a career. However, finding an IT job has been very difficult, I live in the KC metro area so there are many job openings, but it feels like they all ask for 3-5 years of experience. 

I've applied to dozens of basic IT jobs (helpdesk, network analyst, repair) before working at the manufacturing plant, perfectly crafting my resume and cover letter to each job post. I am in desperate need of some money, and that's why I applied at the plant. After landing the job, I found out about all of the benefits and raises and union stuff, and told my girlfriend, family, and friends. They were so excited for me, and now are pressuring me to stay and one day retire there, regardless of me explaining my entire life that I want to work with computers. I've already asked people at the plant if there is a path to IT, and they explicitly told me no. I'm fine with staying there for a year to build up my savings again, but I can't imagine staying there any longer than that.

I'm sure in the next year I can find a solid IT job, but I know nothing is going to match the benefits of my current job. Personally I'm fine with that. Everyone else is not. I don't have any kids, I'm not married, and I'm lucky to be living with my parents still. Working at this plant means it's going to be incredibly hard to develop my skills further and gain volunteer experience because of the harsh schedule. 

I know I'll be set for life at the plant if I work there for 30 years, but the idea of that makes me depressed. I want to be able to earn a living while doing something I'm passionate about, but I also don't want to disappoint everyone around me for not sticking with it. I know what I want to do, but I just can't get anyone on my side of things.

 Currently I have a job offer for ($40k) working for the state assisting with child support medical/ID verification The other job is a nightshift healthcare job ($63k-$83k just depends on how many extra hours I do)

 The state job is a typical 8-4 sit at a desk and talk to people regarding child support situations, I would have holidays off. The healthcare role is 3-4 12hr shifts, nights, on my feet a lot, lives at stake, obviously Iwouldn't get holidays off working at a hospital but I would get paid 1.5 times my normal hourly pay on holidays.

 The reason why l'm questioning the higher paying job is because of my anxiety. Working in healthcare can be very shitty (no pun intended) on your mental health. I graduated, got certified but I stalled out and soon left each role I accepted. I tried working this healthcare jot at three different hospitals and for one reason or another couldn't hold it and left to try and pursue something completely different within the first 2-3 weeks of being hired.

 I now have a baby boy to raise and im in a pretty rough spot right now with debt (approximately $30k). Honestly, I would take the easier less stressful job if I didn't have a new son and the debt.

My main goal was to travel and I have been lucky enough to do so but now I am stuck at a cross roads on what career I want. I am quite an anxious person and struggle making decisions which is quite obvious from this post . I just can’t seem to find something that I gravitate towards and have no idea what my skills are. I have always wanted to have a career I am passionate about and enjoy but I am really struggling finding what that is. I know I am good at writing, admin duties and giving people advice. The one career I have always had in the back of my head is a therapist but i think I’d struggle as I am very sensitive and emotional myself and that doesn’t seem like great traits to have for that job role. Jobs that I have considered are relationship therapist and a job that involves writing. I also really enjoy learning about psychology and human behaviours. Any advice would be appreciated.

We’ve been planning to close the distance for some time now. I feel like I want to take a break from working for a year, and finally close the gap.

1d0snxw,I burned bridges with my old job. What should I do?,"Here's a story that happened to me recently. For 2.5 years I worked in a local IT company. Also, during these years I studied at the university, which cost me my health. At work, I was burdened with double work because a lot of people were leaving. I started working during lunches and weekends. But I loved my job and the people I worked with, so coming to work was a joy for me, despite the fact that the company was introducing cruel performance tracking systems, salary cuts for some employees, and the environment itself was full of rumours and drama. Once I was even publicly ridiculed by the director for what I ate for lunch (she didn't like the smell of certain foods).

Three months ago, I found out that I was paid the lowest salary, although I was constantly praised for my productivity and was also involved in mentoring other employees. And at that time, I received a job offer from a larger company. I wasn't sure about this step, but I decided to try it anyway, and many friends and family members persuaded me to do it.

During the process of leaving my job, I found out that the company had plans for me: a managerial position, more responsibilities, and involvement in training new employees. But the number of interesting projects and events in the company itself has also increased. So I doubted my actions, I didn't want to leave my team in a difficult situation, and I had a lot of respect for everyone. But I still went to the new company.

The new company turned out to be good: modern technology, encouragement for continuous learning and gifts from the management, the manager and HR were constantly asking how I fell, if everything is okay , and how they could help me. But the online work was too much for me, I couldn't stand passive-aggressive CEO, also I was exhausted after working at my previous job and my recent diploma defence. For two months at my new job, I hardly slept, deeply missed my old job, and couldn't cope with the workload. So I decided to go back and give myself a break, because I start getting massive health issues. After I contacted my old job and agreed to return, many people from my new job began to persuade me to stay and were shocked to hear the news, because I fit in well with the team and did my job well. Later, people who used to work for the old company called and said that it is just step backwards in terms of development, and that my old place did not value returning people, actually making their lives a nightmare. In addition, I was informed that the salary I was promised could be reduced at any time. So I got scared and cancelled my return, and the new company was very happy.

But now I'm beating myself up a lot. I promised to come back, but I didn't keep my word, I let people down who hoped for me. I really wanted to come back because I liked the projects, my team, my routine, my friends and the opportunity to grow in company. I realised that I had no chance of returning. I apologised to my old HR, but she told me that it’s okay and I’m still welcomed in the future (which is not true, I know). I feel so terrible and second guessing my behaviour. I wish I could be more strong in my decision. I cause so much trouble. My family said that I look horrible right now and I should really grow up, accept the situation and make better choices in the future. And I should focus on new job only.

Do you think it is a valid reason to request a 2 week delay to a job’s start date due to medication adjustments? 

I got a new diagnosis, starting a new medication, and I’m titrating up by only 25 mg a week, and the medication in question becomes therapeutic at around 100 mg at least . All of this I explained to my new employer. My original start date is June 3, and I’m asking to postpone it to June 17th, and by then I will be on 125 mg doseage. And that’s assuming no harmful side effects occur.

 What do you think the likelihood is of my new employer approving my request? 

I guess I find out next week anyway, but I still wanted to run it by this board and see if it sounds reasonable.

1d0qwgg,A girl who needs help! - Should I Quit the Job I just Started,"Hey everyone! 

I would genuinely love some honest perspective. 

I recently moved to a new city with my fiancé. We are both in our mid twenties. We needed a fresh start and a more peaceful lifestyle, and wanted to live somewhere we love that has a lot of nature activities. We have not found our forever careers yet, but we have both worked for some great companies in the past and have always managed to create a steady flow of income that allows us to enjoy the things we love, as well as the necessities. 

We both had a hard time finding jobs before moving, because all employers understandably wanted us to be already living in the city before they would even consider us for a phone interview. Once we moved here however, I suddenly had many job offers. I jumped on one that seemed like it would be good pay with an additional commission amount (it is a sales job). 

  
The interview went great. The only problem was that the base pay for the position was muchhh lower than my previous job that was also sales. It also seems that the commission pay will also be much lower from what I have gathered from other employees. 

  
I mostly took the job knowing about the low pay because I know that I do not have to stay at this job forever. I also figured I could make it up in commission from sales, because I have had a lot of experience in this and have always been a top seller at other jobs. The lady who interviewed me also told me the company offers great benefits and that there was a lot of room for growth in the company. I thought this would be a great chance to gain some more business experience while I'm finishing school. 



But, I also found out from colleagues once I started the job that this is not true. The guy who is currently assistant lead of the department told me that he had tried to get higher paying job in the company at another location. He has worked for the company for a long time and everyone says he is a great worker and department lead. However, he was looked over and the company hired someone with no experience, who is now making more than him. 

  
He also told me that the company will tell us there is room for growth but there isn't. He said that a regional manager makes more than higher up positions by an extreme amount, and does less work. He elaborated on the favoritism and unequal pay raises. He also said that it takes decades to even be considered for a higher paying position, and that raises were unheard of for any lower level employees. 

  
I have only been here about five days, and I'm already seeing some red flags. I have not gotten my first paycheck yet. I am estimating the commission amount I will receive based on the percentage they told me during the interview that employees earn, plus my barely minimum wage base pay. I know that I will be getting paid barely anything, even selling an obnoxious amount of product. 

  
The other issue is that there are not as many opportunities for commission as I had hoped. So even if I could sell alottt, I wouldn't even be touching my hourly pay from my previous sales position. 

  
I also do not really like anyone I work with and they do not seem to like me. I have tried to be friendly, not overly share opinions or joke around too much to where I seem unmotivated. I have been made fun of for a few things in a ""jesting"" way, that didn't really feel like a joke. When I need help with something (because I am still in training) I get a condescending answer or I get stared at like I'm an idiot and then told something like ""remember, its this, we went over this"" - yeah maybe one time two days ago!! 



I know the new people at a company usually have to get acclimated to the environment before it gets comfortable for them or for the elder employees to get used to having new employees around. However, from previous work experience, it seems like I am already headed down a path that wont get much better. 

  
The previously mentioned assistant sales lead also seems to favor the other new hire over me. We started at the same time. I feel like I have made more of an effort to show up on time, in uniform, take notes of procedures, be friendly, etc. While the other hire was almost sent home for being out of uniform, is already trying to boss ME around (when we started at the same time), is constantly flirting with the assistant manager (she has a boyfriend and a kid; he has a girlfriend), is rude to the department manager, etc. 

  
I am trying to give her the benefit of the doubt and put my best foot forward because I don't know her or really anyone that well yet, but I already am getting a bad feeling. The other new hire acts like a pick me girl and its frustrating to have to work around. I am contemplating whether I should go ahead and find a new job before things get worse. And also to find a higher paying job. 

  
It kind of makes me feel like I am wasting my potential too. It seems like a dead end company with no room for advancement. I currently have my bachelors degree and am working towards my masters. I wanted to finish school before getting another job more relevant to my degree, because it would be very difficult to work some jobs full time that would be relevant while also still studying. However, I am considering it if it means a more professional or even less chaotic work environment. 



I do have a lot of work experience and skills for someone my age. I am usually well liked at a company because I work hard and pay attention to details and am generally well motivated and kind. I try to always give my coworkers the benefit of the doubt and just be kind and helpful to those I work with. But at this company there is also another employee that has a stale attitude towards me and is very condescending to me, and I have no idea why. She acts like I am a piece of dirt with no brain when I have three times the work experience and an education. Not that education is everything, but I do feel as though I am way more qualified for the job than her, even though I would never say that to someone. It drives me crazy that she is acting like I am not good enough or something, especially when it is a position with such low pay and that requires less skill. 

  
I don't know if I should just get a new job and quit without notice too. I don't want to screw anyone over, however no one has really been nice to me or helps me when I have a question about job proceedings. It seems like I was just hired on to do management tasks at entry level pay. A lot of the work they are requiring me to do is outside of my pay range and job responsibility. These tasks also take away from my already small commission amount. 

  
I kind of want to just leave and never go back. The city is pretty big so I don't think I would really have to run into any of these people ever again. I don't like to quit a job with no notice, however I think they will most likely just be rude and indignant if I do put in my notice, and I really just don't want to really give them that when they have been so weird and unkind. 

  
Sorry, I know this is a lot. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. ",hatefulbitz,0,0.33000001311302185,2,1716688109,2024-05-26 01:48:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d0qwgg/a_girl_who_needs_help_should_i_quit_the_job_i/,5,2024

I'll be graduating soon and I already have some experience in my field from an internship where I learnt a lot. I can probably find a job if I try hard enough (This is in south-east Asia). I have already got an interview upcoming and am still going to apply some more. But to be very honest, I really do not want to be attached to a 9-5. During my internship, those 4 months were really hectic (which ig is a good thing), but now I really don't want to be limited in when I can go out because of being attached to a job. Part of me knows I need to work and gain financial independence, but the other part of me is like, yes I really want to gain financial independence but not while being attached to a job. I want to go out and explore the mountains, go on long trips on a motorcycle.

Honestly, I just want to attain financial independence (so I can get married asap) while not being attached to a job. Especially if that is in a country where I don't want to live. I am not a fan of the weather here, If it were somewhere in Europe for example where it's a lot colder (and gets lots of snowfall, I love snow) I might be okay with a 9-5, well at least that's what I think for now. But it's very unlikely a fresh grad can land a job in Europe since they'd need to sponsor the visa and shit.

Idk, I'm just confused about how to proceed with life. FYI, I'm in the field of robotics so a remote job is unlikely a thing. In the long run, I want to have lots of freedom and free time to explore, but I just do not know how to get there. As you can probably tell by now, I am confused.

Long story short, this place is toxic as all hell. I know it's not my responsibility to stay and fix other people's problems, and that's not really my concern. The issue is that it's a tightly-knit industry, especially in my city. I'm going to run into these people, and occasionally have to work with them (even if I'm at another company). 

I've only been there since August, and I'm expected to stay at least until November. It's going to be really hard for them to replace me and train someone at this point in time. But I seriously cannot handle it anymore. I'm having crying meltdowns every other day, my relationships are suffering, and I'm getting sick all the time. I've tried in vain to get things to change, but nothing works. I just can't do it anymore. 

But I know they're going to be pissed. It's one of those companies that acts like they're doing YOU a favor by giving you a job, and quitting is seen as a betrayal (I know, because I've seen the rampant turnover and the things they say when people leave). 

I'm just worried that it'll carry over into my next career move, since they'll still be around in some capacity.

I know these are the prime years of my life and the choices I make today will impact my future. I don't have any passion or hobby to pursue. I didn't go to a great A tier college. I haven't achieved anything yet that I am proud of or happy about. I believe that there is still time and if I push myself towards the right direction, I will be successful and happy. 

The options I am currently considering 
1. Get a better, new job
2. Go to study abroad for masters (I live in India) 
3. Try my hand at business
(feel free to add any other suggestions) 

I am lost, I hat do you think out of the above three options, which direction I should put my efforts in?",Manchownoodles,1,1.0,0,1716673360,2024-05-25 21:42:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d0mbfp/how_to_know_what_to_pursue_as_a_26_year_old/,5,2024

1d0l782,New Job Offer - Advice Welcome,"I have been laid off from my job for a few months now. I used to make $140K base + 10% bonus. This new job offer is $105K base + 10% bonus. There are other perks with this new job - it's a remote position and seems to have less responsibility and stress.

The pay band they offered for this position was $65K-$105K for my area. California, NY, etc all provided a much higher pay band due to cost of living. 

They also offered 560 shares of incentive equity units. 25% would vest the first year and then the rest would vest over three years monthly. The strike price is around $30. The company is expected to go public within the next year.

I would love to negotiate to get something more. Can I negotiate salary if they met me at the highest part of the salary band? If not, should I ask for more shares, a quicker vesting period, maybe a sign on bonus (in this economy?!)?",Suspicious-Copy-6498,1,1.0,0,1716670096,2024-05-25 20:48:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d0l782/new_job_offer_advice_welcome/,5,2024

1d0kc6g,Promotion but back track on pay agreement?,"Hi everyone, 
I am new to this subreddit and I am in a bit of a tricky situation. I started working with my current employer since mid 2022 in a position that was basically a machine operator (it is a manufacturing plant part of a bigger organization). In mid 2023 the plant manager and I basically reached an agreement where I would be working in Maintenance and Process for the plant and I would get the title and employment letter stating my updated duties but my pay never getting a bump. This went on for a while and the plant got an award as well as I got some notoriety for getting things done and helping everyone out in general. Well, the time came and I asked for my employment letter as I needed it for immigration purposes. A lot of back and forth ensue and basically my plant manager’s boss and the head of engineering on the bigger org side go to bat for me to get me a position and pay. I am offered something which is a bump in both salary and position. They offered me 90k which is on the lower side of what is the range in the company for that position but I was happy to take it as it was a 50% bump from my current salary. Here the kicker comes in. One week after I signed this agreement, they come back to me and say that the salary offer is pulled back by our compensation department as the company does not offer more than 10% raises but they are willing to offer 15% which is 68k. My soon to be manager and the head of engineering really went to bat for me for this as well but someone higher up I guess doesn’t like me very much. At this point, I don’t know how to proceed further as it was never about the money but all this backtracking about everything is giving me a lot of skepticism. My soon to be manager also ensured me that he will conduct an early performance review to get me at least on par with what I was offered in the first place (I kinda believe him as I find him to be an honest and good man). So, I guess my question is what would you do if you were in my place??",BlasterX11,1,1.0,1,1716667559,2024-05-25 20:05:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d0kc6g/promotion_but_back_track_on_pay_agreement/,5,2024

I'm really interested in freelancing and my family is not in a good financial so I want to help them as soon as I can instead of waiting for a job after 4 years. So after looking into a little I found out that there are a lot out there. I really want advice from someone who is experienced. First option was video editing, second was graphic designer but I know I'm not creative enough to dive into those fields. Then I heard about data science and data analytics. Since it's also the current trend and people say it's the job that's gonna stay for years and not run over by Al. But upon further researching I found that data analytics requires a lot creativity (correct me if I'm wrong), which I don't think I can pull off. That's why I'm asking the experienced people to give suggestions. I'm willing to work hard to the bone in whatever the study or the job is, I just want it to be something I can do and pays good.

1d0ii0a,Led on about management & chauvinistic male colleague may leap frog me as I head on mat leave,"Seeking advice: our team’s manager recently gave notice after several months of bad mouthing the company and leadership, and overall mismanaging the team. 

For many months, she promised she would put me in management training and that we would partner on upleveling the team together. Neither happened. 

In fact, over the last couple of months, she has instead been bolstering a male colleague on my team who is far from ideal as a potential leader eg he has poor craft skills (even my manager acknowledged this to me privately), has an anger problem, and is chauvinistic. I happen to be pregnant, and he told colleagues that he wished he was so lucky to take maternity leave because he deserves “a break.” I also have routinely outperformed him; my manager once asked me for tactical tips on how to uplevel him 🙄 

Well now I’m about to go on leave and leads have decided to make him the interim leader of our team. I believe they would’ve tapped me based on tenure and seniority but alas I’m about to pop. I’m worried about what I’ll be coming back to when I return from leave mainly that he is going to leap frog me in terms of becoming a manager. 

My questions:
- What would you do in my situation?
- Any tips from people who’ve gone through something similar?
- Should I look for opportunities during my mat leave?
- They want me to do a knowledge transfer to this male colleague before I go on leave. How would you handle this? (He has always been rude to me - yelled at me in meetings, ghosted me on asks, tried to discredit my work, etc) 
- Any words of general support?

1d0id1g,summer job: food service or bank teller? ,"I (20F) am a rising junior college student double majoring in English and Education. I intend to get my masters and become a teacher after graduation.

I have a dilemma about where to work this summer. Previously, my summer job has been at a bakery/ice cream shop that pays pretty well ($15/hour), gives me a flexible schedule (I prefer evening shifts and can take random days off if I really need to), and has amazing coworkers who I look forward to seeing each year (most 16-22 years old, so on the younger side). 

However, as I’m 20 and halfway done with college now, I’ve started feeling like I should get a job that’s a “step up” from food service. A lot of my friends have gotten internships and more prestigious summer gigs that have made me feel like I’m behind, so I applied to be a seasonal bank teller. I wasnt expecting to get the job because it’s competitive and I’m a little under-qualified, but I must have done well on my interviews, because I got a call that I got the job yesterday.

I feel like I SHOULD accept, but I really don’t want to. The pay is only slightly better ($17.50/hour), the hours are a rigid 8-5 Monday-Friday and 8-12:30 every other Saturday (mornings and more hours than I worked at the bakery), and I’d be working with a very small team of much older coworkers (30+, so I wouldn’t be surrounded by friends). For the first 2 weeks I’d also have to work at a branch of the bank an hour away, which is not super feasible because my family only owns one car (both the local bank and the bakery are in walking distance, so I never needed to drive).

I probably need to just suck it up and take the job because it will look better on my resume, but I’m having a hard time rationalizing it when there’s so many cons and only one pro (that it’s a “better” job). My summer would be so much better and more fun at my old job, but I also don’t want to hurt myself later by being a baby now. Part of me is also wondering though how much a “better” resume even matters if I’m just going to be a teacher.

I’d really appreciate some advice on what to do. Should I take the bank teller job or stick with what I’ve got? I need to give the bank my decision by Monday.",inblueivy,2,0.7599999904632568,3,1716661952,2024-05-25 18:32:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d0id1g/summer_job_food_service_or_bank_teller/,5,2024

1d0gma9,Advice on how to move forward,"Hello everyone! I was recently let go from a job and I just feel so disrespected. To start, the job was a consultant role based on billable hours. The company was constantly struggling to meet the originally scoped hours on every project and they regularly had projects where hours were switched to non-billable. In March, I was told that I would be put on one project that would take up 100% of my time. I was also told by the acting Account Manager that if anyone asked me to work on something else that I was to deter or refer them to him. The CEO told me that at the end of this project, in mid-April, I was being considered for a lateral move to another department that would better suit my skills. About 3/4 of the way through the project I switched managers from the CEO to the newly appointed Director of my team. This Director had no prior people management experience. In our first one-on-one, I asked about the lateral move and she said they’d love to move me, I just needed to work on my volume of hours. I was confused. They just had me on a project that was supposed to be my sole focus? Did they want me to take more on? I asked to speak with the CEO about the move and suddenly their were two reasons for me not being able to move 1) the volume of hours and 2) an unwillingness to take on new projects, but in both meetings said “but the quality of your work is impeccable”. I was flabbergasted. When I asked for an example of the unwillingness (maybe I was doing something I wasn’t aware of), new Director cited a time when I asked a team member to consult with the acting Account Manager of the big project prior to assigning something to me - something I was told to do. So from then on, I just kept my head down and did my work. I didn’t go above and beyond. It was clear I wasn’t going to get moved and had no ability to change the outcome. My Director fully controlled my projects assignments and my schedule. I ended up having about 1-2 projects a week, which was still not enough to raise the volume of hours needed to be moved. At this point, I was in our resource management Slack chat once a week asking for more work. I even announced in stand up one week that I didn’t have enough work to make up the week and was later told that based on what was assigned to me, I was fine. It still wasn’t. In my second one on one with the Director - over a month and a half after the first one, she stated again that I wasn’t meeting the volume of hours. But at this point no one in the company was. I honestly had no idea what to do, so I just asked politely “I and unsure of how to make requested hours when the assignments are completely out of my control, how can I fix this?” Three days later, hey then assigned people to my projects, who siphoned my hours and I was let go that morning. So my question is this: How do I recover from this? How to I phrase this interview that doesn’t make me sound like a disgruntled employee? How do I move forward when I feel so disrespected and like my name has been tarnished?

TLDR: I was let go from a job and the job blames me, but I had no control of the outcome. I don’t know how to move forward and phrase this if another company asks me why I was let go or what to say. I don’t want to sound like just another disgruntled employee.

1d0e2vp,Misled about responsibilities = underpaid,"I’ll try to keep it as clear as I can, sorry it’s a long post. Two weeks ago I took a role for basically an events coordinator. I have experience with that from before starting graduate school and it was the only offer I received in six months. I just graduated with a Masters in Analytics. That job market is so over saturated (at least where I live), I had no options there. 

During the interviews, the team made it pretty clear I was only getting a chance because they need someone to work on some analytics for the department. What we discussed was just some advanced stats type stuff that I knew would only take me a week or two (regressions, clustering, visualizations). My offer was <$50k. Fair salary for coordinator role, not remotely fair for an analyst. The mini project would be easy for me and make it easier to succeed in that coordinator role, so I was pretty chill with it. 

On my first day, they threw me in a meeting with the senior director and outside consultant to discuss a project. The scope went way beyond what I was expecting and what we discussed in the interviews. I was fine doing the level we agreed to, but I am not fine with going up and up on the project they want for this compensation. In less than a week and a half I sent out my key findings and visuals for what we initially agreed on prior me starting. Have a meeting with those high up people again next week. 

If it’s still on the trajectory they told me on the first day, I will need to either set firm boundaries or renegotiate compensation. Both would be super uncomfortable to do within the first few weeks. They totally view it as a project, so I feel it would be hard to argue for a “raise”. If senior directors and the CEO are wanting this done, I feel like there ~may~ be some room to try. I really dont know what to do or how to go about it. Any advice would be really really appreciated.

1d0drpd,"As a fresh accounting and finance graduate, how can I transition to marketing?","
Hi everyone,

I am graduating with a degree in Accounting and Finance, but I've realized that my passion lies more in the creative and strategic world of marketing. While I appreciate the skills and knowledge I've gained, I'm eager to pivot my career towards marketing. I would love to hear from anyone who has made a similar transition or has insights into how I can make this move effectively.

Here are a few specific questions I have:

1. Skill Development: What marketing skills should I focus on developing first? Are there any online courses or certifications that you would recommend to boost my credentials and knowledge in this field?

2. Leveraging My Background: How can I best highlight my accounting and finance background when applying for marketing roles? Are there any particular areas of marketing where this background might be especially valuable?

3. Entry-Level Opportunities: What types of entry-level marketing positions should I be looking for? Are there specific job titles or industries that might be more open to someone with my educational background?

4. Networking: How important is networking in the marketing industry, and what are some effective ways to connect with professionals in this field? Are there any communities or organizations I should join?

5. Gaining Experience: Are there any volunteer opportunities, internships, or freelance projects that could help me gain practical marketing experience? How can I find these opportunities?

I'm really excited about this career shift and eager to learn and grow in the marketing field. Any advice, personal experiences, or resources you could share would be incredibly helpful!

Thank you in advance!

1d0cehx,I feel overwhelmed and guilty,"So I'm not sure how to feel about this. I graduated 2 years ago with a Bachelor degree in Management and was lucky to get an internship in corporate in the Risk department. I have a couple more days till my contract expires but the executive of corporate affairs has offered me a 6 month contract extension with a salary increase (3x what I'm getting now).

Problem is we are preparing for audits and my mentor/coworker has gone on maternity leave and manager has been booked off sick for 4 months leaving me with a sh!t load of work. The handover was pretty sloppy and rushed. There was so much I didn't know about the tasks because it was work that my mentor did. I don't know wh she didn't allow me to assist with all the work pertaining to the department over the 11 months. Now not only do I have to start doing that but I also have to deal with external auditors for year end and to make matters worst, there's deadlines that I know I won't meet. It also doesn't help that I'm not really the most liked by HR because I just keep to myself, work and go home. (HR shares a space with my department)

When I had a meeting with one of the external auditors, she figured that we were short staffed because they've added more people to their team whereas we have less this year. She laughed when I told her that I am the only one in the department doing the admin work and it's so much. My executive said I should mainly focus on the audit but I also shouldn't fall too far behind with my work. My brain is scattered. 

Sometimes I walk into the office and don't even know where to start. I'm getting queries left right and centre about the audit but how can I assist when I dont even fully understand myself. I mean managers, accountants, regional financial managers are all calling me asking what the external auditors are expecting and yet they've been working far longer than I have. The executive has brought in other managers to assist but they just there to assist with reviews and do jacksh!t about admin.

One of the financial managers that we brought in to help even Said that the problem with this company is that they're training isn't efficient and I feel like I'm not capable. 

I've started applying for other companies because mentally I've checked out. It's the weekend and I don't know if I should put in the extra hours and work overtime and weekends despite mental exhausting. My work is an 1hrs drive and by the time I get home I'm finished but I feel guilty. Even when I'm working, I feel like I'm not doing enough.

1d0559j,Need help figuring out what to do,"Hello, 

I’m seeking advice because I don’t know what I want to do in life. I’m a recent college grad, but I don’t have any work experience. I’ve been looking at different jobs, but none of them seem remotely interesting/fulfilling. 

I’ve tried personality tests (ISFJ/INFJ seem to bounce between the two), DiSC assessment (I’m a C), career counseling (currently going), and just constantly looking through job boards/pages. 

Am I doing something wrong? Is there something wrong with me? I always dreamed that I would finish college (student is the only thing I’ve ever loved being), get a good job, work then retire and enjoy the last years of my life. Now, I’ve done the graduation part, the rest seems like a fantasy. 

I live really rural so there’s not any opportunity around me & I don’t have any money to move yet, so I’m looking for something remote which I know is difficult to do when you don’t have experience, but I can’t materialize money or experience out of thin air (if I could I wouldn’t this issue, lol) so I’m doing the best with what I have. 

Aside from no experience, I survived a stroke as a child. Subsequently, I cannot do strenuous physical labor due to damage of the spinal cord and risk of re-injury with too much straining. While I can walk, nerve damage makes long periods of standing/walking nearly impossible (knees buckle & foot starts to lose sensation after awhile), and my hand clubs from too much handwriting (though computer typing doesn’t impact me at all so I can do it long term). For the positive I’m good at organization, file management, told I’m a good writer (I don’t know), and being a student.

So, any advice on other things I can try in order to potentially narrow down something? Anyone else been in the same situation? If so, how did you break out of it & what do you do now? Any hope for me? I know I sound like I’m on a soap box, but I’m stressed and lost at this point. It feels like I’ve done what I’m supposed to do, shouldn’t I have answers? 

Thank you to anyone who helps! I appreciate your time and consideration! ",Tired-Octopus-22,1,0.9900000095367432,3,1716616081,2024-05-25 05:48:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d0559j/need_help_figuring_out_what_to_do/,5,2024

I currently attend university to get my BSN degree and have always excelled academically. My hospital offered six nurse intern positions and I applied to three. I'm in good graces at my current job within the hospital, I'm kind to everyone, I've never been written up, everyone knows me, I have perfect attendance and overall am a great employee. Not only do I have three years of direct patient care experience within the company, but I feel I'm realistically extremely personable. I rocked my interview, the interviewer said I have an outstanding shot at landing the job but that it's very competitive. The interviewer was non stop complimenting me and telling me so many details about the job. I nailed the interview, I had perfect responses to every questions and made sure to not come across to rehearsed. I brought copies of my resume, said I would be interested in working on other floors, expressed that as a CNA I float to other floors so I know how to mend well with many different dynamics to achieve teamwork, sent a follow up email thanking her for interviewing me and continued to follow up. NOT ONLY did I get rejected for all three I applied too but my own manager filled the position externally. I honestly have no idea what I could have done differently.

I have a feeling other floors may have not hired me because they thought my home manage would, which he did not. However he is brand new to this hospital (as of two weeks) and we haven't even met yet. We were without a manager for a month. I also have a feeling other managers thought I another floor would have already claimed me, but then they all thought that so I just got disreguarded. Either way I'm totally distraught and have no idea how I didn't get this job. It was competitive though, there were 6 positions for 2 weeks of open interviews. Ugh I'm just so upset.

1d035qi,Should I try to negotiate my salary for my first real job?,"TLDR, I expected something in the range of 36-38k annually but am being offered 35k annually for an entry level job. Should I negotiate for another 1k a year or just let it go?

For background, I (24) graduated college last year with a degree in history. During school, I planned to go on to a PhD program to become a professor, which I believe I would find fulfilling and enjoyable, and my summer experiences focused on research to advance a possible grad school application. However, during my senior year, I took a more serious look at the somewhat troubling state of the job market for academics in history, and decided to try out something else to see if I liked it before returning to the idea of applying to PhD programs. I ultimately settled on editing in the publishing industry.

My job search did not go well. I worked doing landscaping over the summer after graduation, then worked construction part time during a job search which stretched to 7 months long before finally securing an interview for my current position. I had only one other interview for a position in publishing in that time.

That background is all to say that outside of the current offer, I have pretty much given up on breaking into publishing. I don't know what I was doing wrong job applications wise, besides being slow in applying, but over the 80 positions I applied to this is the one of only two which emailed me back. So I really want this job.

When this current job offer asked what my salary expectations were, I gave them what I considered to be a pretty low range so I would have a better shot of securing the position, 36-38k a year, which is slightly less than similar administrative assistant roles at larger publishing companies. I sort of thought of 36k as my bottom level for accepting the job.

Their current offer, however, is 35k a year. My dad thinks that because its an entry level position and I have little directly relevant experience, I should take it and negotiate a few months from now for something better, after I've established that I'm competent. But I feel like they are hitting me with a low number to see if I'll take it, and I should at least ask for something higher. I also had drawn up a tentative budget for 36k a year and their offer is below the bottom level I had considered accepting.

For an entry level position with little experience, is it reasonable to engage in salary negotiations?

1d02ynx,Where to go next - mechanical engineer,"Hello guys, 

I am a mechanical engineer with 6 years of experience in the same company. 29 yr. Currently, I’m in the packaging machinery industry. My career progression has been 52k —> 63k —> 73k —> 82k. Same department, and job title. Just increased responsibility.  In a LCL/MCL city. 

I have dealt with machine development from manufacturing to spares parts. All stages (sales support, marketing support, service, technical writing, 3D models, some design, layouts, assembly personnel support and more…). The part I like the most is the big picture of a project… seeing the impact and money involved. Taking to different people to accomplish something. However, I do not feel passionate about design development/detailed design. So, I’m not great at it. It does not help that I’m in a manufacturing facility. I can do it some, but I’m just not a rockstar at it… This has been a setback for me mentally specially. I’m strong in everything else tho. 

I am very sociable, can speak well. I do get anxious under pressure sometimes, but getting better with experience. I started to deliver and supervise tasks/projects for newer engineers within my team. Also, train them on company procedures, software skills and a variety of others things. Also, participated in more meeting with higher ups, where I give my opinion on several things. I have delivered many projects under my responsibility alone that were 300k+. The technical side and communication with suppliers part of them. I like these types of projects. It’s a more plug and play different pieces of machinery rather than product development. 

Having said all that, I feel that I am not using my strongest skills in the position I’m in. I have been wanting to transition to something else. I have been reached out by some companies. I have been refusing roles that lean too much into design engineering. I have passed on a job to possibly manage a machine shop engineering team. The one job I found interesting was a project manager or product manager in a consulting engineering company in the industry I’m in, which I am pursuing. I have been seeing jobs offering me from 95-120k. I would only leave my current job for 110k+. Lots of design engineers jobs reaching out tho… 

I’m also considering
- sales
- other types of management, such as business management roles
- I am very tech inclined, but never learned programming, but some role in tech is not out of question… 

Could you guys advise some high paying roles I could apply to? Job titles? Companies? Really looking for something with potential for high income and growth. I feel it will take a long time to grow more in my current company. I’m having a hard time finding the right roles/jobs to apply to. Thank you for the help!

1d02ry5,Technical Sales Roles (Engineering),"I've been working as a consultant MEP (building services) engineer for about 2.5 years (since I graduated). It started out great but, the hours are long and I can see in those older than me that progression is highly competitive and seems to be slow/limited. Deadlines are also always unrealistic and highly stressful. Overall, I'm getting a bit bored and burned out. I'm still young so I'm looking for something with better compensation and lower stress. I'm sure there must be something out there!

In my spare time I've been learning a lot about marketing through helping one of my friends with the marketing on her small business. I actually really enjoy it but I don't want to just make a career change into marketing consulting, because it's likely going to be many of the same issues.

Prior to becoming an engineer, I used to sell high-end goods such as luxury furniture part time. I did reasonably well with commission - I'm not amazing but I'm also not terrible at sales. I could definitely get better. Customers can be a pain, but 90% of my days went fast getting to talk to different people and it was generally a good time.

I see that there are a lot of roles out there with seemingly high compensation and good benefits, in technical sales for engineering products. My background is in electrical engineering, but also being interested in marketing I wonder if this is a good fit?

Does anyone have experience with these types of roles? I really can't understand why more people aren't taking these roles up. The idea of not being stuck behind a desk for 40 hours of the week, meeting new people, selling decent products and still maintaining some technical aspect sounds amazing. Is there something I am missing here? Why are all my peers prioritising consulting roles?

I currently reside overseas but will hopefully be moving to the US in about 1-2 years through a spousal visa. Tell me everything - the good and the bad please I want honest opinions.",Responsible-Fig6594,1,1.0,0,1716607221,2024-05-25 03:20:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d02ry5/technical_sales_roles_engineering/,5,2024
1d02ra8,How can I make more money fast? What skills do I even have?,"I am 31F and feel I screwed up my career a long time ago. 

I currently make 52k as a customer operations coordinator / supply chain support rep. Career history below:

Company A
2016-2019 customer service assistant
2019-2020 customer service rep

Company B
2021-2023 global planning support specialist

Company C 
May 2023-present customer operations coordinator/supply chain support rep

I currently use JDE to enter and manage customer orders. I reply to customer emails. I work with 10 different departments to get orders out the door. I analyze production and demand schedules to determine when something can ship. Etc. 

I have a BA in Communications.

I’m so desperate. I’ve applied for hundreds of jobs over the last six months. Had a handful of interviews, one for buyer planner, one for buyer, one for project coordinator, one for account manager. Talked to many recruiters. And nothing. 

I really need to make more money. My clock is ticking and I want to start a family. I want a house. I’m broke. I work so hard. My current company is horrible and it’s way too much to get into but it is extremely understaffed and extremely high turnover and extremely dysfunctional.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m sick of being rejected. I want a high paying job. I’ll do anything I need to do except go back to school and get even more in debt. I need help. My current job is so stressful that I’m having stomach aches and chest pains. I’m a hard worked but this company is so poorly managed and managers are so abusive, constantly threatening us.

1d02otj,PTO request - no one to cover? Too bad,"I am a nurse practitioner working at an inpatient psychiatric hospital. I work full time as the sole medical provider.  I am on call 5 days a week, 24 hours a day.  Since January, I have taken 2 scheduled days off. I recently requested time off with 30+ days in advance (required by my company). I also sent an email to my supervisor letting her know of the request. I never heard anything back (which is the norm) and saw PTO on my schedule for the dates, assuming it was approved. My PTO has always been “approved” in the HR system a week or more after the PTO occurs. 

I am now being told that since coverage cannot be found, I am expected at work. I am told this is typical in full time jobs (I’ve never heard this outside of restaurants) and they’ll try to cover my PTO requests, but its no guarantee and I should “plan things” around when coverage can be found instead. We have a few prn employees who are either retired, or working other jobs, with no requirement of shifts to work. 

In my prior jobs, including those that I was the sole provider, PTO is requested/approved and THEN coverage found; PTO has never been contingent on coverage. It is not about travel or anything like that, I haven’t booked/planned anything- it was more just scheduled time off with family that can be rescheduled, but is more the principle. What about those events that I cannot plan around? Or that I have little say in, such as a wedding? What if there is no coverage those days? I miss out on important life events? 

Is this a thing? That if you request PTO, even months in advance, if employer cannot find coverage, it’s yours to work? I can understand last minute PTO requests and needing to find coverage yourself (and being SOL when you can't), but this seems a little absurd. Another example: I put in a request 3 months ago for August that has not been yet addressed; though when coverage isn’t found, it’s my responsibility? Of note, has never been expected or communicated that I find coverage for these PTO requests. I also know there are things that can be done to help this, that are not being done, such as offering monetary incentives, or hiring a locums provider, as both of these were done in this situation at this same company, with a different leader, in the past.  I looked through the employee handbook and asked for documentation of this policy, which was not provided and I was told “this is just how it is.” 

I do not see how one person can be expected to work 5 days a week, and in the rare occasion of requesting NEEDED time off, expected to plan it around company needs / hope someone will cover. Of course the main issue here is that my supervisor is ignoring PTO requests leaving this ominous interpretation of what is okay and that is a whole other topic.",lgag30,1,1.0,0,1716606918,2024-05-25 03:15:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d02otj/pto_request_no_one_to_cover_too_bad/,5,2024
1d016fx,Put on a 2-week PIP,"I was met in person by HR and 2 sups and given a document in person outlining codes of conduct I had breached with unprofessional communication at work, no specific scenarios were cited and all the instances in the letter were vague. Nowhere on the document did it state it was a pip, there was no signature line and I was not asked to sign it.  My sups swore up and down it had nothing to do with my technical abilities and that they really want to see me succeed at the J.

I emailed HR after the meeting to confirm if it was a pip being issued to me, and they confirmed it was. I asked them what the timeline was for this pip and they responded they are setting a meeting up in 2 weeks to discuss and we will go from there.

Will the meeting in 2 weeks officially be the end of the pip period? 

Also there were no specific or measurable goals for what changes they wanted to see in my performance. I was directed in the letter to change them immediately and permanently or I could face termination.

I have thought about calling an employment lawyer as this came out of left field and I was given no previous verbal or written communications from my sups that my communication at work was out of line.  I have been at this J for years and have been having some miscommunication issues with my new supervisor, which I have tried my best to resolve with them, verbal and in writing and as a last resort going to HR to seek counsel. Half of our department has left over the last 6 months and I can’t help but feel this is the J trying to push out old blood that isn’t getting along with new leadership.

Any thoughts or advice on this would be greatly appreciated. This is my 1st pip I have been on and this was my 1st corporate job out of college so I am feeling pretty devastated. I have been reading things online and am making necessary arrangements bc I am pretty sure hearing everyone else’s testimony this is the end of the road for me here at this J.",Expensive_Opposite26,3,1.0,10,1716601793,2024-05-25 01:49:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d016fx/put_on_a_2week_pip/,5,2024

1. International rescue committee where I will be a fundraiser and technically they already hired me. I’d make about $30 an hour but it’s an hour commute from where I live and Id be out in the sun for 6hrs a day. This would be a super meaningful and impactful job that I’d usually be excited for and also has good moral standing and i’d be making good money for a young person at a summer job 

2. Boeing offered me another internship doing some sort of physics and I’d probably be working in the space and defense field since it’s customizable to my major. This would only pay me $16.30 an hour but i live close. I don’t agree with some of the stuff boeing has done lately which has dampened my enthusiasm a bit. But this would also allow me to participate as a freshman in research opportunities at my university. I asked them to match the hourly of the other offer but haven’t heard back.
 
the  rescue committee pays way more but boeing provides more opportunities but also i’ve already interned there!

1czymyk,The position for my one-up is open and the hiring manager is letting me help interview and taking my thoughts into consideration. Can I suggest someone I really like for the role who contacted me on linkedin?,"My boss was promoted up two roles from me a while back and is hiring a new person to be my one-up. I already talked to them about me taking the position but they were honest about the fact that we really need this new position as soon as possible and I am not ready yet and need a little more experience, growth, and development. This is actually not a backfill by the way so I can still be promoted to my old boss’ position in the future when I’m ready. I hope the role hierarchy makes sense.

Anyways, we’ve been struggling to find a candidate that meets all of our minimum requirements and are currently interviewing the one candidate that meets most but not all. In my interview with the candidate I did not think they were fit for the role. My former boss is on a time crunch to hire someone and feels we should settle.

Someone reached out to me on linkedin, not really asking for anything specific, just wanting to chat about the industry. However, the conversation turned to me telling this person about the position and they sounded very interested. They tick all our boxes and I really like them and encouraged them to apply. I let them know I could not promise anything but that I would let the hiring manager know to be on the lookout for their resume.

Is there anything wrong with me going to my former boss and explaining that I found a better candidate on linkedin and I think they should be highly considered? Would my former boss dislike that I found someone for the role? Is there anything wrong with this from a conflict of interest standpoint? Or any other standpoint?

1czx61j,Possible HR Meeting?,"

Hello,

To lay the framework, I have lived in the same small(ish) town for my whole life, I’ve been involved in about everything you can think of. My first jobs were desk positions at rec centers, lifeguards at the community pool, camp counselors etc. I now attending college in the same town. Because of my connections with the city, and previous employments with a department, I was invited to apply to a higher up (supervisor) role within one of the departments. I saw myself starting to mature and in need of more responsibility so that I could grow as a person, so I applied. I went to interview and I felt like I knocked it out of the park, their reaction was well and communication was very positive. A few days later I was called into another interview with the higher up, which seemed off to me. Nevertheless, I went in and did my best. The interview started well, very similar to the first. Then, she sets aside her notepad, and starts talking to me. She says that my interview was great but she had a problem. She says 1, that she pulled security footage of me working at the front desk at the rec center and saw me rolling around in a chair. And 2, that previous male *supervisors* had not done well in the position and that it makes them skeptical for my potential. I was baffled, didn’t know what to say, speechless. I later followed up with an email concerning my discomfort in the interview, she never replied. Now it’s about a year later, I still work with the city but I’m about a year away from moving away. I was considering maybe taking it to hr, but since I still have a job with the city, I don’t know what I should do.

1czwdx6,Communications/Web Design or Business Administration Bachelor's Degree?,"I'm almost finished with high school and need advice on whether I should go for a bachelor’s degree in business administration or a communication design.  
  
I have already some knowledge in user interface and user experience designing because I attended an arts high school and decided to pursue Communication Design for 2 years. I really like the idea of doing UI/UX, but I am worried about getting a job in the future. Besides this, I would also like to work abroad if possible (I live in Europe), for which reason Business Administration might seem more appropriate.  
  
Business Administration on one hand seems to offer better career prospects and it seems to have more global opportunities but on another side what I really enjoy / what i already know i enjoy doing is doing Ui/UX  .Another option that crossed my mind was taking a bachelor’s in design course before going for a master’s in business administration.

1czvm8u,When should I expect onboarding process to begin?,"On May 16th, I signed a written job offer contingent upon passing a background check with a tentative start date on June 3rd. (Offer also incl. salary, manager I report to, benefits).

May 17th, the HR coordinator sent new hire packet and completed background check details (however I didn’t fill out any bank info for pay). On this day, I also sent an email being upfront about bad credit history but was super vague (just said I had a 98% payment history and some cc debt). She never responded to this.

On May 20th, my BG check came out clear and completed after business hours (my credit wasn’t even checked!!)

On May 22nd, I emailed my recruiter to see if he heard anything on his side about my BG completed and if he needed anything. No response.

Today, May 24th, I called my recruiter but no answer so I left a VM. No call back.

When should I expect my onboarding process and first day instructions? They never mentioned an onboarding process either. It’s Memorial Day weekend, so I’m worried things could be delayed.

1czskea,Brainstorming Help: Disabled,"Long post, but I’m at a loss and could really use some help brainstorming ideas!

Unfortunately university is not working well for me. Each semester I’ve had to drop more and more courses, and I only started in September of this year. I was recently diagnosed with an intermittent severe cognitive impairment, and I also have treatment resistant severe depression, anxiety, and OCD. I am still trying to find improvement, but it’s not going away any time soon, and it’s preventing me from doing school (college presents the same issues as university). It is still declining, but I am hoping that finding some work may help.

I am also physically impaired. I have moderate to severe joint issues in most of my joints (and all major joints). I am unable to stand for extended periods, and repetitive movements can cause severe pain. Due to allergies, I’m unable to work around food. I am also very prone to heat exhaustion (>25C for 60+ mins) so would be unable to work in hot environments. 

I am 23F in Ontario, Canada. My only work experience was a gymnastics coach in 2017, prior to my health declining, and a nanny in the summer of 2020. I became a primary care paramedic in 2020, but health issues ramped up very shortly after graduating, and I am now unable to work in the field (no longer meet physical requirements, and it became a severe OCD trigger). I also worked at an amazon warehouse for 3 days before being forced home on medical leave due to becoming unable to walk after two 12hr shifts (2022). I can walk perfectly fine now, and can walk for several hours, but standing is very difficult on my joints, and walking for hours on end every single day is also very difficult. The cause is unknown, I’m on a 2yr waitlist for a special clinic.

I’ve been trying to brainstorm ideas, but I’m at a loss. I would love to work in the trades, starting with an apprenticeship. I’ve read that electrician work is easier on the body than some other high-paying trades. But it seems it’s nearly impossible to break into the trades without first working as a general labourer somewhere, which I’m physically unable to do, or knowing someone who works in the trades. I am looking for a future career, not just a job. Something with an eventual salary potential of $80-100k (preferably starting at least $40k. For reference, minimum wage is $16.50 here).

Pros: I’m artistically inclined. Very logical and detail-oriented. I enjoy working with my hands and I love solving problems. I enjoy puzzles and learning how things work. I can work both on my own and with other people. I also have natural leadership skills, and am extremely organized. I would love a job that keeps me moving around some, though I understand that options with the right balance are very limited.

1czsgn0,Is this a fair course of action (complaints about me),"Is this right to be put under investigation for?

I work for a brilliant company for 3 years, and and mostly loved it. Last year in summer, I was put on a PIP due to collective feedback on my management style, which was 2 months long and I turned it around, passed with flying colours and took it on board. 

I got promoted last month, with all good stuff since then. 

Instance1: 
A few weeks ago, I was pulled up for some comments I made to team member about a new manager who had upset me, apologised and said ill be more mindful. 

Instance 2: 
Yesterday, I recieved feedback from someone I work closely with who hasn't been delivering work, missing deadlines and not communicating, saying that I have been making her anxious, upset and not talking to her very nicely. From my POV, Ive had to chase  and feel i have been polite, and flag issues with her work. Yesterday when this was flagged, I felt terrible and asked for a meeting to apologise, set boundaries and see how we can move forward and both improve. 

Today: 
Today my manager called me and said due to both instances and some new comments that came to light today, I'm under investigation as they're worried about my behaviour and comms slipping back. I haven't got specifics yet in the new complaints and ive been really thinking about what i may have said or done and hate that i've upset anybody. I've not had any other feedback apart from the above. 

I am completely dumbfounded, confused and would be greatful for any feedback and advice here. Let me know any other context I can give.

1czp5l3,career advice to a medical amd engineering student,"Hi everyone,

I am a first-year student in the MedTech program at Politecnico di Milano and Humanitas. This six-year program will award me a medical degree and a three-year bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering. While the program is interesting, I have discovered a strong aptitude for problem-solving and innovation. I am considering (and still actively thinking about) switching to computer engineering and starting over.

I initially chose medicine because I wanted a career that would positively impact people, and I was good at science in high school. However, I have always had a passion for technology and computer science (I won the computer science olympiad in high school). I hoped this degree would combine my passions.

I also love traveling, video editing, and design, but I didn't know how to ""combine"" them. So, I chose MedTech. However, I realize that this program is heavily focused on training doctors to use new technologies and understand their functionality, rather than designing and innovating them.

On the other hand, a medical degree is a valuable asset. I am still trying to figure out if I would enjoy being a doctor, but lately, I have only heard negative opinions, especially about hospitals. The future scares me.

I currently have two options in mind and would appreciate your opinion:

Switch to computer engineering at Politecnico as a sophomore and try to find a lab that allows me to apply computer science to healthcare, and then pursue a master's degree abroad.

Continue with my current studies while participating in engineering projects at Politecnico (which I am very interested in). At the end of the six years, I could aim to enter a MedTech or HealthTech company or another company. Alternatively, I could continue studying by pursuing a master's degree in engineering (which I can access with my biomedical engineering degree) and then enter a field that allows me to use all my knowledge and skills.

I know it sounds crazy, but I have the opportunity to study and be ""supported"" in the meantime, which is not something to be underestimated. And even if I switched, I would still graduate at 26 (all things going well), so what are two more years with a medical degree? Maybe I can still do some medical internships or locum work during my master's degree to earn some money, or take a course in aesthetic medicine. Then, if I enter the world of computer engineering and realize it's not for me, I can always go back and specialize.

I'm not sure what to do... What do you think?

Thank you so much!

1czo73b,Advice for a Young Ad Professional,"Graduated end of ‘21 with my BS in PR/Marketing. Landed a job at a massive advertising conglomerate working on one of its biggest client accounts (automotive). My role is very niche in title, managing sports/media partnerships for the client while also getting great exposure to other teams. The experience is great, and in theory it’s my dream job.

That said, I have been absolutely ground down to the bone by managers who demand a lot, and give very little — a company wide epidemic tbh. Been there 2 years with no raise, title change, etc., only for my responsibilities and workload to grow more each day. On top of that, I’ve been onboarding and coaching my new manager within the last 6 months.

A year ago I was on a “unofficial” PIP for voicing concerns over a toxic work environment. Today, I am being fought over by different teams who want more and more of my bandwidth, but no mention of paying me more. My manager told me in my review in March that they had no money to offer me.

I just had an interview with a local advertising shop, for a role with higher pay, and more “responsibility” but I can’t imagine it be higher workload than my current. The client and SOW would be smaller as well.

The question: At what point should I ditch the “better experience” at a renowned company in my industry for more pay? I’ll be 25 in March, and quite frankly my goal is to maximize my earning potential. Do I stick it out for another 6-12 months, or take the money when I can? I feel extremely under appreciated and burnt out 2.5 years into my career. Is this normal?

1cznea1,Need advice and input about my situation ,"So about 10 days ago, I received a job offer from an organization which I eventually declined.

The reason behind my decision was not related to the offer it self, the offer was even better than I expected actually. My reason was that I was offered a promotion to a supervisory role by my current manager, after informing him of my possible departure. Now, the new supervisor role still pays less than the other offer that I received (almost half), but I decided to stick with it because it has more flexible hours, which would allow me to continue my education and residency while working, in addition to wanting to obtain experience in a management role, as well as the good workplace environment in my current place. The only positive about the other offer was the doubled salary (which should be a good enough reason alone) but it meant that I will stop my residency to work in a field which does not have a clear long term career plan.

A week after my decline, I saw the position I was offered was listed again, and I was told by someone on the inside that they were not able to fill the position with any other candidate. Seeing the position again made me second guess and regret my decision, as I cannot get over having double my current salary and missing that chance.

My question is, what are my chances in having a positive response if I decide to contact the HR in that organisation regarding reconsidering the offer that I already declined for that postion? Is that something that can be done? If so, how should I go on with it.

Also what would you choose in my situation?
Half pay with continued education or more money for years but no long term guarantees?

Any input from previous experiences would be appreciated as I do not have any experience in a similar situation, and do not know how it would be viewed from the management/recruiter's end if I do reach out.",Katatafish298,1,1.0,0,1716564366,2024-05-24 15:26:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cznea1/need_advice_and_input_about_my_situation/,5,2024
1czndpy,"Would you give up a great job and home country for a new country, excitement and uncertainty?","I’m at a crossroads. I just went through a significant trauma and I want to start again. I had a bit of a mental health crisis and lost things dear to me. I recently underwent an unwanted abortion and my ex dumped me shortly after to travel the world. It was awful. I want to get away so badly. So badly. My job however is amazing. It was not easy to get at all. I studied for 5 years and spent a lot of time and dedication to get there. It is a very niche field I work in as well. But I’m terribly unhappy and lost. 

I have the opportunity to live in The Netherlands (Amsterdam to be specific) as I have a valid residence permit. I wouldn’t even say the Netherlands is “new” to me as I actually already lived there for 4 years. I don’t think the grass is greener or my problems would be solved by getting away. But I know what I benefit from. 

I am a British and Australian citizen. I cannot keep my current job and live over there, however. I have friends out there and I used to live there for university. It’s a home for me in many ways. But it would create uncertainty. It would be a risk. I don’t speak Dutch fluently. My current job would allow me to live in London which is also a great option… or anywhere else in the UK. I’ve been living in the UK most recently and it would be a cheaper and more straight forward option. Alas my heart is set on the Netherlands. I prefer everything about the country from the lifestyle to the people to the music scene which is my biggest passion. It’s not a perfect country and I know it comes with its difficulties. But man I just wanna escape. 

I don’t want to make a mistake but also don’t want regrets. Either way maybe there will be regrets. I’m currently living with my parents trying to figure out this mess. I’d take any advice or tips. Thank you.

FWIW, I’m 26 with both a Master’s and Bachelor’s from world class universities with 1.5 years professional work experience.


Edit: my job said I can go for one month max if I wanna “test the waters.” They can’t allow more remote work than that due to the nature of our work.

1czn8xe,Somewhat fulfilling career with average to below average pay or risk going elsewhere for something better?,"Some context: I am a general manager that oversees both operations and sales at a local moving company. I have started and sold another moving company before getting this role so I am proficient in the workings of the industry and business. I make $75k/yr plus profit sharing bonuses and salary raises with each million dollar benchmark of $5k extra per million. I am in an high cost of living area.
It is fulfilling because I feel like I have a direct impact on 1) how the business performs, and 2) my employees lives and the skills they develop. I enjoy the challenges of most of my duties too.
To put it lightly, my boss (owner), is solely the money (from his spouses company) and is a solid networker. He has very minor input here and there in small and big decisions, works about 20-25 hour per week, and fills in where needed when I and our other office staff are out of town (though we have to fix a lot of mistakes when we get back). I respect him but I don’t necessarily look up to him as a person I want to try to emulate or as a role model. 
I enjoy the management, direct impact, operations, accounting, and sales oversight aspect but am questioning the compensation, growth, “surrounding yourself with more successful people” mindset because I don’t have that network at work, and if there are other better opportunities out there. 
Does anyone have experience with this or guidance?

The problem is, besides basic math and algebra, I SUCK at math. My math grades have never been the best. in fact, I got an F last marking period in my college alg class. Partially out of lack of skill, partially out of laziness. I'm NOT planning on taking calculus for my senior year. It seems hard and I might not have schedule space.

So I recently was given more responsibility in my role that requires managing people and working as an equal to leaders in the company.... However I was not promoted to a leadership position. My boss basically just told everyone verbally I am the lead in my area now. No title change, nothing.

1czkvn3,To stay or go? And how to negotiate terms for better working environment,"I'm starting to feel burnt out. That's a lie. I have been burt out for some time. Most of the people on my team are. We all work as managers at a company that makes a product we feel passionately about and take pride in building. We like each other and we're friends outside of work (with one exception).

Unfortunately, we've had quite a time finding and keeping a production manager. At some point, the company just gave up looking and put someone in the role who has only ever managed a team of one or two people because he's been with the company a long time. Now he's managing fifty, but he has absolutely no idea how anything works. He refuses to learn. He reads at a about a fourth grade level. He has no problem solving ability. He's a walking HR complaint and a vehement sexist. He condescends to all the women and talks over everyone at meetings without managing to articulate a single useful piece of information. 

We've complained to the director. We've complained to HR. We have politely brought up the concerns we have to the VP. Nothing has been done. They will not fire this man. It's been two years and we've basically resorted to working around him and doing the critical peices of his job for him just to keep things moving, but we are so tired and so stressed. This job used to be fun but we're all miserable. This dude is almost universally hated by us and his subordinates but he doesn't have the social grace to step down. Good people keep leaving because they hate him and it creates more work for me and my team.

Adding insult to injury, my group is underpaid by about 20k. We live in a high COL area and the company refuses to believe that their wages have not kept up with the price we pay to exist in this city. I won't get into the specifics, but I'm highly qualified and I have a very specialized set of skills plus more than a decade of experience. I'd like to move into a director role, but I have a hard time believing that would happen for me here. 

I really love my group. I like the work. I have very little supervision, so it's not all bad, but the resentment I've been building is palpable. Recruiters have taken an interest in me and the jobs I'm being sought out for would jump my pay by between 30-50k which would be a whole new lifestyle. Is there a way to salvage this relationship?

I’m responsible for a huge amount of customer-facing content, far too much for one person to handle, and I’m not allowed to grow a team to help me. I’m expected to be both strategic and actually create the content too.

While I love my role and the people I work with, it’s been a stressful time because I simply can’t produce work that I’m proud of. But the company is happy with rushed work with gaps in it, and my manager and I have a great relationship.

I’ve recently been offered a role in the same area, but as a team leader, working strategically to direct a team to make content. 

Salary is the same, or a bit lower if I drop down to 4 days a week. which is an option. I’m not financially motivated much but want to be fairly compensated.

But the new company is significantly smaller and doesn’t have the same prestige.

I’m worried that if I take the new opportunity, I’ll be happier in the short term but worse off in the long run. Maybe I should stick it out and wait for a similar opportunity at another big company?

1czjvzj,Would you criticise your manager in a review meeting?,"I have a yearly review meeting with my team lead where he evaluates my performance. He always asks ""So what did you think of my management in the past year?"" and I generally just tell him what he wants to gear, plus highlighting things he did well.

However, in the past year, he's been acting increasingly passive aggressively and without trusting us.

For example, we work remotely. We used to have a team meeting every morning. Then he went on a business trip for a week. In that week, one team member broke up with her abusive husband and often had the status ""away"" on Teams, especially in the afternoons.

When he returned, he gave me a call to ask me about this. I said I didn't watch her online status and that she was in all her scheduled meetings. Then he announced we would move our morning meeting to the last half an hour of the day for ""better efficiency"" and asked us for our feedback.

Both I and this coworker raised valid concerns about this and asked to move this back to the mornings. Then he told us sternly ""There is no way in hell that this will be moved back. Never."" (despite specifically asking for our feedback). This was obviously not done for better efficiency, but as a silent punishment - he never actually spoke to her about being away from her desk that week. Now we have those end-of-day meetings that always overrun, meaning we have to do overtime regularly for no reason, just because he mistrusts us.

This wasn't the only situation. This petty behaviour used to happen occasionally, but this year it's become quite frequent. The job is otherwise good, so I won't quit, but I wonder if I should address this in my upcoming review.

More recently this person has also been copying my PowerPoint slides. If you are familiar with PM work, a large part of the job is communicating complex ideas to stakeholders and being able to tell your story is pivotal. So I spend a lot of time creating slides that are thorough, visually appealing, and hold a lot of data. This person would occasionally take my slides and repurpose them, but would at least change the context and information on them.

We are currently preparing for a large meeting and I have spent weeks preparing slides for it. It is something I am exceptionally proud of. I have had to share the slides with certain groups already for feedback, and this person asked to use the template I created so that our slides would be consistent. I agreed. This person actually took my slides, changed a few words out here and there, and packaged it up as their own work. They are planning to *share the same slides as me, that I created, in the same meeting that I am sharing them*. I already told the person the slide content is mine, I created them, and I will be sharing them. So they need to create their own slides to use.

Not sure if this is the sub for this, but I’m writing this post on behalf of my Supervisor (not me, not my problem, but it bugs me).

Naturally he’s pretty nervous about it because if our company gets called out on it, all of the questions are going to be deferred to him and our ‘manager’ is undoubtedly going to leave him to the wolves- if and when that happens..

So this ‘manager’ and the president of our company jerk each other off all day, so that kind of makes the situation worse if my super’ gets on his bad side. We also all know that HR does absolutely nothing to protect the employee, so we dunno if he should bring the matter to HR.

I’ve recently seen a job listing for a job that literally sounds the same as my current job but paying more than £10k more. As I’m getting ready to apply for it I keep feeling guilty, is this a wrong move? Overall seems pretty obvious that I should go for the opportunity since my role is a bit niche and £10k a year more would certainly help.

However, with tech innovations always going high and higher (AI, blockchain, robotics...), I am wondering if I should go for a GAFAM/FAANG company instead, as a Manager or Data/Business Analyst.

I specify that I'm a fresh grad of 25 years old at the tipping point of her career path. Also, my long-term project is to be a consultant at McKinsey or at the BCG. But I would like to acquire experience through internships first.

Pondering the environment, the near and far future, what advice would you give me for my career choice ? Thank you.",outhinking,0,0.5,0,1716551888,2024-05-24 11:58:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1czizzo/top_school_students_investment_banking_or_gafam/,5,2024
1czitip,Is translating cheap erotica books bad for someone beginning a career in translation/copy editing?,"Hello, everyone! I graduated a few years ago with a degree in modern languages, and while working as a school teacher, I decided to apply for a couple of freelance jobs in translation and copy editing in an effort to kickstart a potential career in materials/textbook publishing.


I built a small portfolio through volunteer work, and recently sent my first round of emails to publishers. The ones I really wanted didn't reach out to me, but one I applied for randomly through LinkedIn just sent me an email asking me if I was interested in doing a test. 

After checking out what kind of books they published, I found out they do erotica/fantasy books. I don't have anything against the genre, but I'm a bit squeamish and I don't really like reading that sort of thing, let alone read it thoroughly enough to translate it or copy edit it. 
The rates they are offering are bad, too, and I worry that their content could potentially harm any teaching jobs (maybe that's just me overthinking things, but I don't really like thinking that I'll have an Amazon translator profile linking to a bunch of light BDSM werewolf books). 

I'm also unsure regarding the optics of it for other publishers. Maybe it show that I have previous professional editing/translation experience, but it may also seem as if that experience is only on X-rated B-books.

Am I overthinking it, or should I give them a try? I still haven't agreed to do the tests, but considering how badly edited their *published* books are, the screening process doesn't seem to be very tough.",sad-beast-throwaway,1,1.0,0,1716551241,2024-05-24 11:47:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1czitip/is_translating_cheap_erotica_books_bad_for/,5,2024

1czhv3f,Am i stupid for choosing a difficult course?,"So this i question I’ve been asking myself for a very long time while pursuing a professional degree. 

Choosing a professional accounting course over other degrees in the industry can often lead to doubts and questioning whether it was the right decision. The length of time and effort required to obtain certifications such as Chartered Accountancy (CA) or Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) compared to a Master of Business Administration (MBA) or Masters degree can make one wonder if the extra difficulty is worth it in the long run.

An MBA or Masters degree typically takes around 2 years to complete, while a professional accounting certification like CA or ACCA can take anywhere from 2.5 to 5 years to obtain. The time commitment and rigorous studying required for a professional accounting course can be daunting, especially when compared to the shorter duration of other degrees. This can lead to feelings of doubt and questioning whether the decision to pursue a professional accounting course was the right one.

One of the main concerns that arise when pondering this question is since both parties are sometimes offered the same job title/position, whether there will be any significant salary difference between those who hold a professional accounting certification and those with an MBA or Masters degree.

It is natural to wonder if the extra time and effort put into obtaining a professional accounting certification will result in a higher salary or better job opportunities compared to those with other degrees.

Somebody who has been in the industry PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let me know. I am losing all hope and on the verge of giving up. 😭😭😭",NoBit3965,0,0.5,0,1716547720,2024-05-24 10:48:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1czhv3f/am_i_stupid_for_choosing_a_difficult_course/,5,2024
1czhh3n,Can I get fired over the phone for missing only one day due to an arm injury and smoking on my lunch break at work?,"I’m 21 and just recently worked for a liquor store chain in Connecticut. I’ve worked for them a little over a month, and my attendance has been flawless up until this day, coming 30 minutes earlier even sometimes because the bus line in my town comes once every hour. 

After about 4 weeks, I was fired because my boss went on vacation and while he was away, I had a bit of a rough week. I missed a day because I had an argument with my mom that led to me punching a hole in the wall out of frustration, causing me to tear a muscle in my shoulder the night before I had work.
But I didn’t feel the pain til the next morning, the same morning of which I had a shift at 10 AM. I called my boss once I realized I would not be making it to work and told him, “I’m sorry but I hurt my arm, I’m going to the urgent care, I may be late or may not be able to make it today.” To which he said, “That’s fine, just keep me updated.” After discovering the intense pain in my arm, I also discovered mice in my BEDROOM. Long story short, I wasn’t able to be seen at the urgent care center for my arm because my insurance was discontinued, spent another hour in the car trying to file for my own insurance and once I got to the end, I received a message saying, “unable to create account, please contact customer support.
 The rest of the day consisted of me getting rid of the mice and tending to my arm. 

The next day at work, I happened to misplace my pre-roll container and torch in front of the break room once returning from smoking a joint on my break. One of the replacement managers found it and gave me a warning about smoking ‘on the job’ even though we sell THC infused beverages and I’m a 21-year-old man. Mind you, I worked at Wal-Mart prior to this, where the manager told me herself, “It’s fine if you smoke, especially on your break, that’s fine.”

So today, I get a call from my manager, saying he’s letting me go because of my attendance (which was perfect up until i got hurt), and for ‘SMOKING ON THE JOB” which I would never do. I quickly rebutted once he says that, asking when he’s referring to. He then says another employee found a BLUNT that belonged to me, which is clearly untrue because I smoked it on my break… I try to plead my case but there was not much I could do. Now i’m jobless and out of a good job. I’ve been beating myself up about it, thinking there were things I should or shouldn’t have done, but I’m pretty sure that this was not right and want to take up legal action if possible.

1. **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate**
2. **CompTIA Security+**

Would these certifications be beneficial for someone in my position? Are there other certifications or specific skills you would recommend to improve my chances of landing a cybersecurity internship? Any advice on making myself a stronger candidate in the field would be greatly appreciated!

1czgede,Filled with regret after accepting new job,"Previously managed a facility in the healthcare industry. Unfortunately I unintentionally offended one of my higher ups which resulted in retaliatory actions done against me. I was not in a position where I could ever succeed where I was at and it became clear that things would be best if I found another place of employment. 
I accepted a position at a competing company that was horribly misrepresented during the interview process. Still in the same field but essentially I unknowingly took a major step down compared to where I was at. I don’t want to act as though I’m above a job but I went from a salary position where I determined my own hours and lead major projects without any handholding to a position where I have to ask permission to use the restroom. 
I’ve always been extremely passionate about my career and the nature of my field. Most things that I loved about my type of work it was implied I would be doing so at this new company but that turned out to be completely false. 
I’m miserable and left feeling crushed. No where in my area is hiring for my field and returning to my original position is not an option. I feel stuck and alone. Even more frustrating there are positions much better aligned with my experience within this new company however they are planning on downsizing that department and I’m bound by policy saying no internal transfers until after 6 months of employment so by the time I could try to move within the company none of those positions will likely ever be open.

Got in at 22 as a client support rep at a Fintech company and did that for a year and a half. Then transitioned into a small venture backed Fintech startup (10th employee) as the only support rep and business operations generalist. Learned a ton more here.

Did that for 2 years before jumping into a Sales/Business Development role at another somewhat larger fintech startup. Got let go due to performance after 5 months. I was unemployed for 6 months until I landed another job which was as a Sales Operations analyst at a big public Fintech company. 

I did that for 8 months before deciding I hated the work and left to do a coding bootcamp. Finished bootcamp after 3 months, was unemployed for 5 months while trying to land my first software developer job (I interned at an extremely small startup in this time but work was unpaid and primarily a stepping stone to gain experience to get a real developer job).

Somehow landed a software developer job at IBM but was let go 9 months later and have now been unemployed since February. 

I’m still hunting for developer jobs but beginning to question if this is the right path to stay on. I’m hoping that maybe having a finance degree can help me restart on a different path somewhere but I’m afraid it may be too late at this point.

I shot myself in the foot by doing too much and them taking advantage of it.

Now with the offer almost in hand, and they have hired people to take my current workload so I can move to the next step, I’m wondering if I should ask for a signing bonus or some other incentive for the last year to help with my resentment of them dragging this out for so long and doing work that wasn’t my responsibility? I’m willing to walk away from the promotion, so long as they are aware I will no longer be doing the “extras” I’ve been doing. 

What would you do in my situation and how would you approach the negotiation?

1cza1gb,Advice on work dismissal,"
Recently dismissed from a job I worked at for 11 years. Appealed and went to first appeal meeting.

Before 2nd appeal which is next week had a call from a union rep who said either take a package of 2 weeks wage (which is an insult considering 11 years service) or go with appeal number 2 and still be dismissed with 0.

Told the union rep the package is not good enough and pretty insulting regarding my service and couldn't you negotiate for a better one, his reply was ""probably not"" bearing in mind i think that's no way near good enough.

What would you guys do? Take the package, pester them for a better package, go to appeal no.2 and risk 0 payout or bring in a 3rd party? I'm not too clued up with these types of processes. [M 30 first dismissal]

1cz9py4,"Looking to break into pharmaceutical sales, any advice on how to?","Hi Everyone, 

So first things first, let me keep it short. I’m a newly graduate from SDSU with a bachelor’s degree in marketing specializing in professional selling & sales management. I’m about to turn 25 years old and was thinking of breaking into pharmaceutical sales or just any type of sales that is lucrative and help me have a decent career. I’m very passionate about helping make a difference in peoples lives and health. 

My experiences are not much but I currently manage my family business which is a high end liquor store, and I basically speak with sales representatives and make orders, generate sales with new products , and have increased the profit margins in a lot of product categories for the business. I also currently also assist a liquor company with their website optimization and web development. And lastly, I’ve worked at a market. 

Any device would be appreciated! Thank you.

1cz9hg0,"Have only Sales experience, want a different career path but don't know where to start","Hello everyone

I am a 32M living in a developing South American country. I studied Commercial Engineering at uni, which is a degree a bit unique to South America and it is basically a blend of Business Administration and Marketing. I am also studying an MBA, and due to finish next year. Thing is, so far I have only been able to secure Sales or Customer Service roles, with the most notable exception being my last job experience, where I worked remotely for a US-based software development company as a recruiter, although the position was still largely made up of calling duties, and 3 months where I worked at a local software development company as a Technical Writer, but was fired after 3 months due to ""attitude issues"", which I'm afraid will always remain a mystery to me as I was denied the chance to talk to my then manager about it and was immediately escorted out of the building.

While I was never afraid to speak to people and put myself out there, and even briefly sold cinnamon rolls that I made (I love baking) directly on the streets, when it comes to closing, I always struggle. I can't help noticing often people doing half the effort as me and selling more, while I always struggle to meet objectives. I am currently working remotely, again, as a cold caller for a security systems company. I struggled to adapt to the position, as I was shocked at how rude people can be to cold callers, but I believe I am learning to handle the stress of it better. Problem is, I still can't get meetings, and my bosses are now starting to demand I book sales meetings, which I understand since, well, that's the objective of the position.

All this constant stress about putting in the work but not meeting objectives makes me think that, in the end, I'm just not cut out for sales, or ""born"" for it, as I heard an acquaintance of mine say (of course, he had way more luck in sales than I did so far). At the very least, I want to leave cold calling (definitely not for me), and ideally, I would like to move forward to what I believe would be a more stable career in Marketing or HR, which my degree enables me to do, but the problem is that, with an absolute lack of experience in those fields, I won't be able to get a remote job, which would be ideal to me as they pay way better than local jobs, and in my country nepotism is rampant, therefore it would be very difficult for me to get one of the nicer local jobs. 

While starting my own business is not something I would discard, unfortunately I don't have any capital, and to be honest, I lack the financial discipline that would be required to handle it. I guess that's a bit of another issue altogether, but the point is, I think I still need to work as an employee for a bit longer before venturing solo. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thank you and have a good one.",Personal-Sky,1,1.0,0,1716514914,2024-05-24 01:41:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cz9hg0/have_only_sales_experience_want_a_different/,5,2024

1cz93wc,I'm going to go fucking insane ,"I (male - 20s) have been working at a medium sized insurance firm for about a year and a half. 

I got hired while I was in school and was immediately disillusioned with the level of pay and the desire to prove myself. I worked nights and weekends and took in a monolithic amount of information, improved processes, implemented things people years into their career wouldn't do only 4 or 5 months in. 

I somehow have given management the green light to abuse me mentally. I have not taken a full weekday off work, but my coworkers are having the time of their life taking weeks on weeks on vacation. I'm burnt out, overworked, and stressed out of my mind. I've lost 70+ pounds working this job - I can't eat I'm so stressed. 

I kept getting told ""oh, I was trying to vouch for you"" - when I got the same raise as everyone else. ""just the budget"".  My coworkers who started the same time as me are getting promoted, I'm not. 

I have a project we're working on, that's fine; several of the SMEs are going to be out on vacation for the duration of the project. Outside of our control the deadline was pushed to August. My manager, against my knowing, bullies the leads to keep the deadline at July. And guess what? He's  pushing everyone to leave it all on me to get done. I'm so absolutely sick of this. I cannot stomach going into work anymore. I've made up excuses to come in late because I'm so depressed I can't get out of bed. The thought of going back again and again makes me physically ill.

1cz8n9b,Looking for salary negotiation advice,"I am in my mid 20s and after completing an internship, I have fortunately been offered a full time position. While I still have to go through the application process as a formality, it is pretty much locked in, provided I don’t totally bomb somewhere along the way. 

The position has a salary range of $26-$38 an hour, and is in the banking industry. I have no prior banking experience, but have shown a real desire to learn, which I think is what got me this far.

My problem is I don’t know what to ask for with a range this large. I have a rough understanding that the majority of the team makes somewhere in the middle of the range, but I have no previous banking experience while all of them do. 

$26 is more than I have ever made in my life, but I feel like I would be doing myself a service by asking for the bare minimum. On the other hand, asking for near the top end is probably unrealistic. Does anyone have any general tips on salary negotiation? I was given advice that when the recruiter asks what I am looking for in salary, to say “while I am certainly flexible, I was hoping to make somewhere between $29-$31, or something similar. 

I have never done this before and tend to overthink these things. Obviously I would like to make as much as possible, but I am struggling to determine what is reasonable for someone in my position to ask for, and how to support my reasonings for asking that much.

I understand if this is too vague for anyone to provide an answer on, but really any interview/salarh negotiation tips would be sincerely appreciated.

1cz8k4t,Am I too harsh on myself for missing a study abroad opportunity or I’m just a hard to please asshole?,"
I recently missed an opportunity to join a two week summer course in Oxford. The course was random stuff on arts and classics, something I’m not much interested in, but the fact that is Oxford is one of the biggest reasons why I would have applied. However, I didn’t due to miscommunication within my eligibility from the faculty. When I realized that I was eligible to apply I got really pissed because the deadline was the night before I received the notice. 


I feel extremely bad not because I missed the course, but also because during the past years  and until now my career has been escalating in a ridiculous way and even knowing that, I still want more. I won a scholarship for study abroad for one year in a top university in Europe, attended several (and fully funded) international debate competitions, got an internship in a FAANG type of company (and earned shit tons of money on the way), I submitted an collaborative academic paper that was indexed in a famous journal, won a research grant for my thesis, and I’m even going to an Ivy League university as a fully funded research visitor by the end of summer to work on a project that fits my career path so well. Currently, I’m waiting for some other responses from really big research institutions I applied to work with, and looking forward applying to a funded postgrad in UCL/Cambridge (I know they’re hard af but I think I could make it).

My resume is extremely powerful and my value in the academic bubble (also industry if I put a bit more effort on it) is ridiculously high even before being awarded a BA degree, as I’m graduating next month (this made me also think I may be a bit too old for focusing on a summer course lol). Despite all of this, I’m still ass pissed due the fact that I missed out this chance of studying freaking gardening and Shakespeare for two weeks in Oxford and experiencing the university. I know sounds stupid, but I feel terrible because I realized maybe is not because I think it was a life changing chance to internationalize my career (I’ve been doing that pretty well), but just an ego problem or maybe a me problem of being a hard to please type of person. Also it’s been my dream to study in the UK since I was very young, but fees are so high and scholarships very few for me -an international- to be able to afford. 

You can be as rootless and unhinged as you please with your opinions about my situation. I’ll appreciate them a lot.

Here is the issue though. The higher I go, the less I really like it, and the less enthusiastic I feel about it.

1cz7lmr,"My boss is not responding to any of my personal chats and emails, what should I do?","I received a message from my boss that I'm ""snow jobbing"" him for the past 9 months. I've been very unproductive since I experienced burn out last year. I tried fixing it by telling my boss my issues (organized tracking and transparent/fair assignment ot tasks) but it was not addressed. I sent him a reply that I'm not snow jobbing him and that I think he's invalidating my health condition when he said that. Now, he haven't responded yet to any of my messages (even client related tasks).

I think my burnout was caused by my feeling of having no progress on my skill. My boss kept assigning special tasks to my one and only colleague, while I always receive the traditional tasks that I'm always receiving. He also tells my colleague things that he didn't share to me and it affects the workflow sometimes. We were very disorganized as a team lately, he randomly switched to a new software a week before the busy season without room for us to adjust. I told him about these as well after he sent me the ""snow jobbing"" message.

Last Wednesday, I'm getting his approval to allow me to take a 1 week leave to organize things and fix myself 'cause maybe I can come back better. But I didn't get a response about that. I also sent him messages re. queries on tasks but he also kept ignoring them. He admitted that he's ignoring my messages because he's too tired of my excuses whenever he gives me a file. He thinks I'm lying when I say I'm sick or not feeling well. I admit, I'm not into a healthy state emotionally lately and I keep it transparent with him. I receive late to no response on client files lately, which makes it late. We also don't have any fix internal timeline or turn around time for our outputs, and I suggested that we should have one since it's affecting our timeliness lately. He always gives random deadlines for files, and I think it's not healthy.

Now, I'm sending him invites to have a call and we discuss our issues and I also want to apologize since I think I gave an unprofessional approach to the last message I sent him. I mentioned there that I was not given fair opportunity to have growth on my skill and that he was also a source of bottleneck since he's ignoring my messages without me knowing that he has that problem. He haven't responded yet on this, I think he's really ignoring it.

I filed a sick leave for Friday, since I'm having a high fever atm. I still notified him about this even I don't receive replies from him. I also asked my colleague to help me with communication to my boss since she receives replies to him and was not ignored. 

I'm not sure how I'll reconcile everything if my boss will keep ignoring me. If I resign, I want everything to be okay and reconciled. What do you think of my situation? If I were you, how will you deal with it?

1cz7c3x,Employer Won’t Pay Owed Wages ,"Hi. What a long, drawn out, complicated mess I am in.

I’ve served as an RN Administrator for a local home health agency that has been on its last leg since before I started. The owner recently “sold” the company yet there has been no legal change in ownership, primarily just control. The new owner came in with pipe dream promises from salary + shares to raises and full benefits - too many to list here.

When I joined this company a year and a half ago, a clinical manager also joined with me and is facing the same mess - there was never any notion or hint that this company was in financial ruin. The original owner knew the ship was sinking and made false promises to have us blindly join her team. Since, she has had one issue after another that has affected our reimbursement. The lack of revenue has not been an issue, her business sense and spending has. We have worked hard and done our part to bring in business and ensure cash flow.

Our paychecks have often times been threatened or late, we were never offered promised benefits, 401k contributions stopped in an effort to save company money, we had hours cut, I am on call 24/7 and not reimbursed for on-call (no, I’m not salaried either) and now we’re being told our upcoming paycheck will be late (supposedly will direct deposit Tuesday when it’s due this Friday). It was also stated that this will be our last paycheck until “they get some money coming in.” And then presented us with an ultimatum.

Tuesday, we were given ‘the ultimatum’ to either continue to work for an “equity share” in the company versus an actual paycheck moving forward and they’d pay this weeks payroll or if we declined the equity share, we could transfer the patients out and close the doors, without this weeks paycheck.

Unfortunately equity shares is not an option for us and definitely not what we signed up for. We both have families that require a steady, predictable outcome. 

Closing the doors and moving on sounds like the most logical option, however we are required to give Medicare and our patients a 30 day notice of business closing and then have to transfer patients to other home health agencies. 

Finally, We were also offered a $5000 sign-on bonus. The remaining $3000 of the bonus is now 3 months late and no signs of being paid anytime soon. 

I feel as if I am stuck between a rock and a hard place - if I want to file unemployment while I search for other jobs, I cannot quit my job however I’m also not guaranteed to get paid.

My thought was to call the Department of Labor, (after we get our last paycheck) & file a complaint but would still need to follow Medicare policy in transferring patients and how do I accomplish this and still get paid?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 😑

1cz3boo,Training someone,"Hello Reddit,

So my management has hired a couple of employees and they have asked me to train one of them. The other one is being trained by one of my colleagues. This is an information technology company.

Here’s the catch, they’re both interns so it is expected that they know very little. Today I was on a one on one with this employee and it appears they do not even know basics of IT. No kidding they don’t even know what IP address or difference between HTTPS and HTTP means. I mean this is very basic stuff you learn in about eighth grade I think. I have to train this person to support our product. This means soon they will be handling customer tickets to deal with product issues and detailed issues related to system administration. 

I am afraid that this person is probably not up to the standard to even begin to support this product. Although I would expect someone to know very little to nothing of the product but I certainly don’t expect for them to not know even what basic website protocols mean. 

This is going to make my job extra hard and I’m worried that my management is going to blame me in the end for failures of this person. But in reality they hired someone unqualified just to cut costs and I know this. 

Am I being too paranoid?  Is it my immature mind being not compassionate? I am not sure. I would like to hear your experience and advice on how to proceed without putting myself in trouble. I want to help them but this is not going to be easy.

1cz337b,Burn out or not?,"I’ll try to keep it short.. I work in supply chain for airfreight. Not unusual that this sort of work comes with a lot of stress, but I just can’t tell if I’m nearing a burn out or literally even experiencing it.

Let me start by saying I never liked the working hours, and I never got used to it. I kinda work 10-6 standard but overtime is almost guaranteed. On Fridays almost always until 7~7:30. I started at this place 3y ago and it was very busy during lockdown times, having come from a simple 8-4 job it was unbelievably stressful and I realized what I had given up… but I’d never go back to the previous shit pay I had. So I kept going.

Over time things didn’t keep being as busy and I got sorta used to the hours and could start a bit earlier for around 2 years… until now. Suddenly we got new clients and I need to drop everything else to get it all out and arrange it for delivery in 4 (!) days. It’s basically receiving documents and making all the papers in the same day, for like 20-30 files daily.

I have had daily 9-10h working days for the past 2 weeks. I skip lunch, I get home with a stressful feeling in my stomach leaving me not hungry, I have the urge to deeply sigh once home and it physically hurts. I can’t get work out of my mind and even dream about it. I have 0 energy left for anything else.

Despite all that I do good work but I feel so empty by the end of the day because I have to concentrate every single minute of the day.

Are these burn out signs or am I on the way? I am slowly settling on the idea to look for something else because even if it’s no burn out.. I hate how it’s making me feel. I feel I can’t keep doing this.

1cz2dmj,How much will quitting my job of four months hurt me professionally?,"I've been practicing data science professionally for about 10 years and in management capacity for three. I moved to a new job four months ago and it hasn't been working out well. I'm handling the work competently but my boss is kind of a piece of work. The latest in a long list of... questionable... statements my boss has made was yesterday calling me into his office for a one on one and starting with ""so I get the impression you consider yourself a professional"" then proceeding to lay into me for allegedly being sloppy. It's worth mentioning this is on a project that he has emphasized must be done quickly multiple times. The guy has thought out loud about firing me to my face on multiple occasions and talked to me about how he can find someone else to do what I do. According to some other people at the company he has self described his management style as ""authoritarian"". I think back very fondly of every other boss I've had over the past decade and feel a handful have been genuinely great leaders on top of being great people. But with this guy, I'm absolutely perplexed at how he could have moved up the ranks.

I've taken it in stride (though I probably have raised an eyebrow at some of it) but it leaves me walking on eggshells. I've never had a manager in my professional career who acted like this. I really think I got more respect in my first role out of grad school. After yesterday, I'm done. In a piece of good fortune, also yesterday, a real estate deal went through and a large sum of money hit my account. I plan on very respectfully offering my two weeks on Monday. 

How bad does something like this look in terms of work history? I'm guessing it looks better than getting fired which I genuinely can't tell whether it is on the table or not (my assessment and that of others is that I'm actually doing a great job and this is just his communication style). I assume I'm looking at between 3-6 months of unemployment before finding something new.

I am a 25 year old currently working in sales, selling manufactured homes. I went to school and mostly fucked off, but went back online and will have my BA in Marketing in December of this year with around a 2.9-3.0 GPA overall. I am not loving the sales life, it is good money, but isnt always consistent and is extremely draining. I live in Amarillo, TX, which is a decently low cost of living. My issue is that I know if I transition into a entry level marketing job after getting my degree, I will be taking a paycut. I currently have a mortgage, a truck payment, and travel to 2-3 music festivals a year, so I am living a decent life that I do not want to give up.

I am considering applying to full time MBA programs and quitting my job, selling my house, and using that to pivot and just living as cheaply as possible for two years and network enough to land a job in consulting until I decide what I want to do.

Another option I see is take this summer to study and get as many marketing related certs as I can in the hopes that I can get a WFH marketing job above entry level.

1cz16g8,Salary Negotiation with current employer,"USA Sales Position – This is a burner account as several employees in my company seem to be keen at finding anything I post.  

Here is the dilemma -  Sales position – Company started firing people early this year due to too high of a head count and since then the company has lost an additional 50% of sales force (resigned or quit) and they have restricted since.    I am in National Sales that had a team of 5 specialized people, but now there is only myself and one other on the west coast.  

I just got a job offer with a competitor company for 125K/yr, 4 weeks PTO, and has overall better insurance.  Same type of position, just different company.   I currently make 115K/yr, 3 weeks PTO, but enjoy what I do.   My only issue is waking up every week wondering if I will get fired.   Everyone has been caught off guard with any firings.

My ask:   Should I ask my current employer – Match my salary offer or possibly a little higher, request same amount of PTO, AND (here is the kicker), ask for a pre-negotiated severance package of minimum of 3 months if they were to terminate me.      They will ask me what they can do to keep me, as they have the last few people who quit and I want to be ready for a response.    Any help would be great.

FYI – Sure I am replaceable, we all are, BUT with what we sell and the relationships I have with accounts, it is going to be a long time for them to hire someone and get them trained etc and they will lose a high amount of sales.  ",Ok-Upstairs-1354,1,1.0,0,1716492044,2024-05-23 19:20:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cz16g8/salary_negotiation_with_current_employer/,5,2024
1cz0yry,Nonprofit or…Not?,"So I recently graduated with my Master’s Degree. As part of my program, I interned at a nonprofit working in refugee resettlement. I loved the work I was doing, and working with refugees (helping people in general, really) was the most “fulfilling” a job has ever been for me. They essentially offered me a job, however they pay is… less than ideal for the city it’s located in. (I’ll say it’s one of the 5 most expensive cities in the United States)



Alternatively, I’ve been looking at corporate/private sector jobs relevant to my degree. They pay significantly better (I’m talking a difference of like $10,000+/year). However, part of the appeal of working at a nonprofit for me is the eventual student loan forgiveness that comes with working there for 10 years.



 With that in mind, which is preferable: working in a nonprofit doing really great work and eventually getting loans forgiven but with meh pay, or working in the private/corporate scene for much better pay but no hope of loan forgiveness and likely less personal fulfillment? All opinions are welcome.

I have my schedule on my calendar and he can see it, so I’m not sure why he doesn’t know. He’s said multiple times, he has no problem with us logging on to resolve quick issues but I don’t like the culture that creates. There seems to be an expectation that we will log on during off days. He will pay us for it, but I don’t like that I have no real idea if my days off are actually my days off until the day of. I’ve done it many times now but in meetings, he praises my other team member for doing it and acts like I’m a spoil sport and never willing. This other coworker has never worked in IT or the professional world before so I’m not surprised but I’m 31 and have been in career settings for many years and I’m just tired and want to have balance and peace in my life. 

Am I in the wrong for setting boundaries here? Especially since I’m part time, I’d really prefer to unplug when I’m off and not feel such a strong sense of obligation to set aside whatever I had going on for the day ",Archimediator,2,0.75,2,1716489086,2024-05-23 18:31:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cyzzfv/my_employer_is_always_nudging_me_to_work_on_days/,5,2024

","I have a masters in public administration, with a certificate in healthcare management. I’ve been fired from two jobs in the past year,only last four months at the most.

My interview for a Pre-K Assistant Teacher went wellut it got awkward when I explained I have other options on the table but absolutely will get back to them by mid-June. And something about that being my life and it stifling me gave me a panic attack like i haven’t had in a while so I’m now going into my usual spiral about my future and what direction I want to do in life

Current interviews lined up by relevancy:

1. Councilmember aide that has degree relvancy/office experience I need. But is part time (salary est $48,000) m. Easy enough to explain Jewish holidays
2. Part-Time Admin work ($29,000 est.) that is office experience need/some relevancy to my ambitions, will be awkward for Jewish holidays and Shabbat but manageable
3. Full time Operations and Bookeeper no relevancy as it’s a food company but office experience and is the best pay at $60,000
4. The current position I visited was for a pre-k teacher at my old Jewish school. I did well and certainly it has opportunities for confidence building but I’m struggling with relevancy and is not desk work for the future which may make things difficult long term when I want to move on. Also a $35,000 salary

I gave the school admin a mid-June deadline for my choice but I think what I’m struggling with is more internal more than anything. I’m 26 and facing a crossroad in my life that I’m really scared of because of all the uncertainty.

1cyy6s9,Final round job interview requiring me to pitch their business and suggest process improvements despite not know what those processes are. What do I do?,"24M in London. 

Have gotten to the final round interview stage for a business providing strategy consulting and analytics. The role itself is Partnership Enablement. Absolutely smashed the first two interviews and being a fairly small company, I figured the final stage would just be a cultural check and discussing the day to day and negotiating salary.

However, after asking whether I need to prepare anything for the final stage interview, I was told the following:

1. To ""pitch"" (COMPANY NAME) as if you are presenting to a prospective partner (10-15 mins)
2. Discussion on how you would propose to improve upon current support and activities with partners. For example, how do we do more to help partners be even more successful through our services? (10-15 mins)

First of all, although I know what the company does, I haven't been given a full picture on what the partner activities entail making a 10 - 15 minute pitch (which is a LONG pitch even with a power-point) seem very difficult.

Secondly, I don't know how I'm supposed to suggest improvements upon processes I have had ZERO information about. Sure I can make good general suggestions around partner enablement practices but I don't feel that's what they're asking for.

  
I'm really frustrated because I have been out of work for a while, have done really well in the interviews and the company looks extremely good. But this has thrown a massive curveball. I'm fine presenting to clients when I am prepared and I know what I'm talking about. However, my anxiety makes it so hard to do something 'on the spot' like this is and it just seems unfair. Any suggestions? Shall I respond to them querying what they're asking me to do?

1cyxreg,Advice on asking for GM position to the owner ,"Hello,

This might be long so i'll try to break it up as much as possible. 

I work in a fairly new role as a coffee roaster / warehouse manager for anestablished cafe with multiple locations. I've seen this path taken by many cafes which usually implodes mainly due to the owner not being able to trust in their employees. The most common bottleneck I see is when a cafe tries to scale up with a roasting operation without considering the overhead and the systems that need to be in place to scale.

My boss is an incredibly business savvy person that knows how to talk with people and is shrewd enough to pick up on anything shady. Unfortunately he is not a operations person and is incredibly disorganized. There are no systems in place and whenever there is a system a new one gets implemented soon after. I've spoken to the entire team and have enough rapport to know that majority of the team does not like him. Our turnover is extremely high due to the operations manager and owner not fulfilling their roles properly. 

  
The Operations Manager in the 3+ years she has been with the company has not even done a P&L sheet.....nor has she established any sort of SOP. The owner has become a sort of madman always fixing issues that he should be trusting with the cafe managers. Management has an us vs them mentality and the cafe managers are just being whipped around without having any input in any matter. I've been with the company 4 months and have seen 4-5 people hired and quit within the span of a couple months. 

  
The owner is pretty trusting of me as I have been in the industry as long as he has and am already doing many of the tasks the operations manager should be doing and have taken a lot off his plate already with little effort. 

  
I am being underpaid at the moment for the roles that I am covering compared to the market and wanted to propose to be promoted to GM and take majority of the owners responsibilities in order for him to focus full time on scaling the business and opening more shops (something he is very skilled in) I would propose a 2.3x of my current pay and assume most of his responsibilities apart from a few major components of the business. 

  
This may mean firing the operations manager and doing her role as well. But I'd like to know your thoughts and whether or not this is a good idea and how I should approach.

Currently - I work in marketing for a fintech company. Yes, the work has become super drab and I think I’ve hit a plateau with my specific role. While I’ve changed companies, I’ve been writing for the last five years and I know I can do more.

Where I want to be - I want to leave the country and pursue further education to level up my career within the next year. I’ve signed up for a standardised exam and I just want to give it my all for the next couple months. I know I can crack it. I have a certain amount of pressure on me to get married and have kids, which is fine.

How do I ask my boss? What narrative do I use? I don’t want to be too honest about the preparation and moving to greener patches part. I don’t think he’d agree and he’ll make my life harder. 


Would this affect my reputation at work? I’ve an excellent yearly rating and all my claims are taken seriously at any given point. I’ve won awards for my performance in general through the 1.5 years I’ve spent here. I’m hoping my damage isn’t too bad.

Problem is I hate the job and it’s soul crushing. I’m also in my small hometown and I’m just sick of living here (27F for reference).

I had a whole plan lined up, saved up a lot of money, and now I feel like it’s all been shot to shit and I’m faced with the choice of taking a leap of faith and moving to find a job in the dental field in order to make next years application more competitive….. or staying here miserably comfortable.
My bf lives in LA and we had this whole plan of me moving in with him while I went to school. Now that it looks like I won’t be getting in, he says he’s willing to help me and support me while I look for a job if I decide to move down there with him. 
My heart tells me to just go for it. I don’t want to lose him and I also don’t want to feel stuck here anymore. What worries me is just how awful I hear the job market is right now.

I recently have been reached out to by another larger firm who found my LinkedIn profile and offered me a junior position in a more specified role (PPC Coordinator) which they would start by paying €36,500 per annum which can raise to €48,000. 

This opportunity is over 1.5hr away from my home and I would be in that office 4 days a week and 1 day from home.

1cyu6it,Offered Significant Promotion but like current job on a personal level,"Hi all,

I work at a Fortune 100 at the director level. I have a very nice set up - I am an SME in my segment, the VP of my business is a personal friend and is the one that brought me with him. We have an exceptional working relationship and I enjoy the people I work with and the work I do. I am able to work 40 hours a week while consistently making $400-500K/yr

  
My current role is largely capped out and there's no clear path to the VP level. I am ok with this (for now) given  I have a good set up - though much of that set up is down to current VP who of course could leave at any time.  My VP put me up for a very very senior role that is both likely to get me VP this year and also directly supporting the CEO of the company and I have been offered the position. It is clearly an excellent opportunity that 99% of folks would jump at but I have an overwhelming sense of imposter syndrome and am reluctant to rock the boat on the good thing I have going right now. The new role is with a new set of people and likely going to require 50+ hours a week.  

Does anyone have any thoughts on weighing these types of decisions? Part of me wants to decline but I have been told that opportunities like this don't come around often and that I should reconsider. I am also quite young (35) and don't want to just stay where I'm at to be comfortable and regret this down the line. 

Bit of a ramble but would appreciate any thoughts folks have.

1cytxor,What to do next...,"It's in the title. I don't know what to do next.

Let me start from the beginning. When I was younger, I used to excel at everything. I was always that star student, teacher's pet kind of kid, and all throughout academia, I was always ranked top of my class. Valedictorian, even. Everyone always believed I'd be destined for greater things, like becoming a surgeon or business-savvy woman. And while I was doing that, I wanted to pad my experiences as much as I could, so I worked multiple jobs at the same time when I was just 16. When I graduated high school, I thought I wanted to be a psychiatrist, so I immediately went to university to get my Bachelor's degree in psych and finished it in three years rather than four because I never took a semester off.

I'm not saying all of that just to toot my own horn. I'm stating it because what do ya know? Once I got my bachelor's, I was burned out to hell. I got into a master's program the summer after finishing my bachelor's and quit the day the semester began along with my managering job at a restaurant, just like that.

Then, I started making plans to move to Korea to teach English because I wanted a change of scenery. I didn't want to be a burnt-out student anymore. I thought that if I did something else, I'd get my old flames back the way I used to, but three years have passed with me here in Korea, and I'm no better off than I was before. I'm 26 now and I don't love this job despite certain benefits because kids aren't truly my passion, even if I fake it as much as I can. My patience wears thinner and there's been no advancement in my career here (not that you could really advance much in hagwon culture) because it's just been switching jobs in Korea after the next due to either malpractice or horrible work environments.

I just want to return back to America, preferably next year, but I don't even know what my true passions are anymore, none that would translate well for a new career path anyhow. I'm exhausted, and even when I took a whole month off to try and recalibrate, nothing changed. I'm always a planner, but now, I feel like I can't make sense of anything enough to even make a list.

I'm sorry if this is just turning into a rant of some sort. I'm just very lost. I want to make it home because I miss my family and community, but I can't imagine how I would even survive out there with the way the housing crisis is, and I only have a BA in psychology after all. I've considered going back to school, but I don't even know for what, and even if I did, I'm not sure I'll be able to learn and work again the way I used to. I don't feel as spry. And I'd live with my mom again if I could and just focus on school, but she's not faring better than me, and she's the only family I got (single mom raising me and my sister essentially).

1cytrz7,"Valuation analyst exit opportunities: worth it?
","Hello all!

I have been offered an Analyst 1 position at Ernst & Young's VME arm and would like your opinion on whether I should take it, given my current circumstances.

I am currently in my first year at a Fortune 30 company as a graduate development financial analyst. The company is great, offering an upper-mid salary (for entry-level), decent perks, and a good work-life balance. My manager is supportive, and there is a clear path to promotion over the next few years. While the role is in corporate finance, which I find interesting, I have a stronger preference for valuation and investment.

The EY position offers the glamour of working at a Big Four firm but comes with a much more intense work-life balance, possibly requiring 14-hour days. Despite being early in my career and willing to work hard to develop professionally, I am concerned about the competitive nature of the position, limited promotion opportunities, and job stability. The total compensation for this valuation role is 25% less than my current position. However, I am drawn to the learning and potential exit opportunities in the investment side.

1cythes,Debating a Major Job Offer: HELP Please! ,"Hi all, 

I'll try to make this concise. I have an offer from a major tech company on the table but there are some inherent pros/cons to making the move. Just wanted some opinions. For context, I'm a 28 y/o single male, without any obligations holding me back in terms of my flexibility. I really want to grow my career prospects but also love the current work-life balance of my situation.

  
**Pros:** 

- Salary increase of 33% and relocation assistance to get me over there

- Major tech company so great bridge into that world of opportunities (I currently work in media and have wanted out of my current role due to lack of learning/growth. I've been in my current job for 5 years and have received 1 promotion)

- Job is in LA or Seattle, so I can choose between 2 places. I have a distant family member in each so I know at least 'somebody'

- Opportunity to grow/learn on behalf of a major corporation and have that stand out on my résumé

- No kids/spouse holding me back

- Fresh start? 

  
**Cons:** 

**-** All of my family is east coast based so it will be a hard lifestyle change going to the west coast. No friends in either place so starting from ground zero.

- I relocated to San Francisco  previously and didn't enjoy it ... which is why i came back to the east coast.

- My current job is full time remote. This is an in-person hybrid job. I absolutely LOVE the flexibility of WFH and not being able to travel to visit family for a few weeks while working kinda sucks.

- Needing to commute, especially in a city like LA or Seattle ....

- High cost of living in either city 

- I don't anticipate staying on the west coast long-term, so the hassle of moving would be for a year or two of a short-lived stint.

- I've been with my current job for 5 years so that has to stand for being able to put up with it to an extent.",peanutbutterbuddy,1,1.0,0,1716472851,2024-05-23 14:00:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cythes/debating_a_major_job_offer_help_please/,5,2024

1cysz0z,Two bosses with different views on my long-term path,"I'm currently a junior partner at an investment fund where I handle a lot of our portfolio management and operational work - working with our portfolio on strategic work and overall firm building. 

  
I've made it transparent to my managers (the managing partners) of my interest in running a fund within our firm eventually. This is a pretty typical pathway within my industry, and for good reason - compensation, engagement with portfolio companies/LPs, and overall ownership increases exponentially at the managing partner level. Additionally, i don't see much more particular growth in my current role over the upcoming years.

One of the MPs has been finding ways to carve that pathway for me - they are giving me an opportunity to sit on board seats, be more involved in investment decisions, etc. the other MP, however, bluntly said that unless i am in a full-time investing role, there is not a pathway to me managing my own fund - and an invesment role is not available at present. Essentially, it sounded a lot like he was shooting down my hope.

I'm struggling to decide how to process this. I feel like they have two fundamentally different views of my career path, and I worry that one will be an advocate for my growth while the other will stifle or undermine it.

If anything, I concluded that this kind of work is better to do on the side rather than the other way around

I'm quite literally stuck on a decision. Complete 50/50. I am 27F. I don't have a clear career path but I work in biotech. 

I have been applying for internal jobs because (1) I want to make more money and (2) I like my company (3) I want more responsibility and more interaction with people. 

My current job is a clinical data analyst. I make ~60k with overtime options sometimes that can bump up my salary. I work 4 10 hour shifts which is amazing. It's 100% remote. It's metric based and monotonous. There is no room for growth. No opportunity really for projects or advancement. No one ever asks about it in interviews. Everyday is the same but I never have to take my work home and can travel while working which is a plus because my boyfriend has a camper van. My next step with this job would likely be go back to school while working this job for a MPH. 

The job offer is an associate sales rep. I would have to move to Chicago (I live in CO). I don't picture myself being in sales for life but I see the opportunity to make more money and gain experience. The pay is 75k base + 20k bonuses. They would not give me money for relocation. It is a field based job so I'd be remote/field 50/50. From what I've been told, it's amazing work life balance, unlimited pto, great experience. My hesitations are the lack of ability to travel while working and the cost of moving. I also never considered Chicago as a place to move (big nature girl) but my boyfriend and I thought it could be a fun place to live for a couple of years and see it as a big adventure. I could likely still get a MPH with this job and be more financially comfortable doing so. 

I have to make my decision today. Amy advise/wisdom/thoughts would be so appreciated. I've never felt more overwhelmed and stressed over something in my life. Thank you all!!

1cyrh2g,"Offered a promotion and a big salary raise, but I'm not at all ready for the job. What do I do? ","Hi everyone! I'm currently going through this situation and need some outsider insight and advice. Sorry for any formatting issues as I'm on mobile. 

To summarize everything, I'm in my second job now for 7 months after a year in a very toxic corporate job. This job is completely remote and with flexible hours; though the salary here is less than my first job, I took it since I'm saving much more money just working from home. 

At the start of my job I had no idea of all the drama, internal conflicts, and stresses that my coworkers were going through. Since we were remote I didn't know much about everyone, and just focused on my work. I did notice that more and more people were resigning, especially people in higher positions. About 4 weeks ago a coworker resigned, and an hour after they did I was offered their position, which is completely different from my actual job description.

However, I took it because I did have some idea of the new workload, and was under the impression I'll be under enough training to get used to everything. Basically, I went from an entry level job to a junior manager. So it's a big jump in responsibilities, but I've been doing my best.

It's only me and my manager in our team, and today my manager resigned. I knew she was going to eventually after she vented a lot about her stresses in the job. I just didn't know it would be so soon. 

I'm only in this new position for less than a month, and I've officially been handed a promotion to her role and a large salary increase. But I'm still learning a fraction of what she does. They said they'll hire a junior for me to take my role, but knowing how my bosses are now that could take longer than they promise. 

I've been honest that I'm not ready for the role, but they keep insisting that they'll help me out and that I'll be able to transition into the role in a month. I have a hard time saying no, and I'm worried I'm just accepting another change that I won't be able to handle.

I don't want to resign, I want to be in a job for a year at the very least. But I'm getting bad vibes from this sudden change and the amount of people leaving in droves. I'd appreciate any advice from anyone who experienced something like this. Thanks for reading all the way, stranger.

1cyqlmr,Leaving a job after only 6 months to raise salary by almost 20k?,"Hi all! I would really appreciate some insight! 

I graduated in December and got my first full time job doing research at a university. When I was hired, the expectation (never verbally stated, though) was that I would stay in this position for at least a year. However, every week my boss has been encouraging me to really think about my career goals and how I can achieve them... in doing this, I have realized working in bench science just will not get me to where I want to be and no amount of role manipulation will teach me the skills that I really want/need. Additionally, I just really do not like my job - I have been doing bench science for 3 years and I think I am just kind of sick of it. I took this job because I thought I wanted to go to graduate school but this position has confirmed that I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT! I am ready for something else. 

So, I have passively been looking at other jobs at the university that would be more relevant to my long term goals and found a role that seems great! They're looking for a candidate with my exact skill set (plus other things I do not know how to do yet ofc). Even more than the experience, this position at MINIMUM would offer me an 18k raise. My current salary isn't awful (I think I am one of the higher paid researchers in the department, actually) but I live in a MCOL area and while it is enough to live on, I do not have enough to save meaningfully. 

If I were working at a normal company, I wouldn't really hesitate to apply and (IF I got the offer) quit my current job. However, I am the only individual in my research lab and I fear this would be like a slap in the face to my boss. I don't think her being upset would affect my career at all because I would be doing something almost completely unrelated to my current field, but I still feel that it's morally grey to quit a job at or just after 6 months.

1cypyrw,Can I leverage my position?,So I got off a call with my boss about an hour ago. A supervisor is submitting their resignation only after about a month and a half of being with the company; I’m now being asked to train all members of management on this department as I’m very well acquainted from the work and am typically the go to person when there are questions or issues arising. During this training period they’re asking that I shift my days/hours. I don’t mind doing this- in the long term it’s going to take away a lot of extra work that doesn’t relate to my current position. But I’m unsure if I could potentially leverage this current situation into a minor (but hopefully somewhat substantial) pay increase. Would it be wise to try and do this? The only factor making me not want to ask is I received a merit pay increase back in March and don’t want to appear money hungry. There is most likely going to be a four way call with three of the managers and myself to discuss this later today.,TheGayGaryCooper,1,1.0,0,1716461735,2024-05-23 10:55:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cypyrw/can_i_leverage_my_position/,5,2024
1cypq1z,Toxic work environment - should I leave?,"I need some non bias advice. I currently work as a contract analyst at a company. Initially, they hired 3 people (including myself) for a 6 month contract. Prior to reaching the 6 month mark, they fired one of my coworkers hired on with me.

The team dynamic between the salaried employees and the contractors have gotten a little hostile. Work load has increased and the initial contract was extended to another 6 months without an increase in pay. The thing that I struggle with the most is the miscommunication and lack of transparency with certain tasks assigned. It has gotten to a point where training is lack luster and we’re just expected to know this information 100% when we haven’t received inadequate training.

The money’s good about $32 an hour but the benefits are hot garbage. I recently received a job offer at another company but the pay is trash $56k a year salary BUT the benefits are good. 401k 4% match, full healthcare benefits paid for by the company, 18 day PTO, gym membership up to $100, and $800 a year reimbursement for personal leisure. 

I guess I’m just trying to weigh the pros and cons because the current job I have is in the corporate automotive industry that I want to be in but mobility is hard since I’m just a contractor and have no actual possibility of moving into a salaried position. I feel like they want to stretch us thin and we aren’t in a position to say no because we are third party. I’ve already done an internal investigation that basically went no where about the toxic environment and how management treats us when things don’t go their way.

The new job is more of a commercial, financial sector of the industry I’m in but it’s definitely a job where advancement is slightly slim.

1cynrg0,Not sure where to post this ,"Apply or not to apply ‼️

I really need advice!!!! PLEASE 

BASICALLY, I’ve been working out at a well known commercial gym for about 3.5 years. Two years ago I was approached buy another gym member while working out. We eventually developed a friendship as we often worked out at the same times, and enjoyed talking about similar interests. Although his actions did have some flirtatious tones I thought nothing of it as I was not interested in a relationship. I just brushed it off and ignored it. One day he came into the gym, and he brought a girl. He came up to me, started talking to me per usual, and then introduced me to a girl who I had never seen before but right away could tell they were having a romantic relationship. I was in a bit of shock as he had been so flirty with me, that he suddenly had a gf. This guy was living in my city for periods of time for work trips and then would leave occasionally to go home, then come back etc.. So I had a fishy feeling after that. 

Now, my friend also works at the front desk of this gym and i immediately told her how shocking it was that he had brought a new girl into the gym, as lots of women at that gym had known him to be flirty or even kind of creepy at times. A couple weeks later I decide that I should let his GF know that while she was at their home, he’s been obviously flirting with other women at his gym. He told me her name that day I met her, so I went to his IG and searched his followers. Her name came up so I sent her a message anonymously telling her. Where I screwed up is that I used a fake account that my friend working the front desk of that gym had given me. The girlfriend replied and obviously told her bf, he ended up making a complaint to the gym that my friend had gone through the database to give me the girls contact information ( first and last name etc..) and that that’s how I found her IG. Even though that’s not what happened, my friend still ended up getting fired after the complaint because they saw her as a liability for possibly have given out client information. 

Fast forward 1.5 years later, I’d like to apply to work at this gym as I’m looking for another job and I’m wondering if they’re hire me? Is it even worth a shot or do you think that situation ruined my chances? The GM who does the hiring is generally nice to me, she compliments me and is overall nice. I’m wondering if I have a good shot or no. I’d like to explain that I was young (17 and he was about 25-27) when I made that mistake of texting the GF from my friends account and that it won’t happen again, it was inappropriate way to handle the situation. 

Do you think I have a chance or no?

","Hi, I'm 29 F, I finished my engineering in 2016 from a Tier 1 university in India from Information Technology. During my engineering I was derailed from interest in studying and I had 7 backlogs - which I cleared in 2-3 attempts (total 17 backlogs) and secured a CGPA of 6.49. 

Soon after engineering, I got into a Sales Associate role in Byjus and worked for 2 years. Since this was in the initial stages of Byjus, it gave me an exposure into rigourous sales. Post Byjus, I worked for all the new-age start up companies like OYO, Pristyn Care, Cars24 - In good business mangerial positions, mostly sales and sales Stratergy roles. My currrent package is 20 LPA. 

I have 7+years of experience now, and feel like a failure in life. I have been into non-tech roles, and feel like I have not gained any ""Actual"" experience. I now want to get into a project managerial/program managerial/business analyst roles. 

Since childhood I always wanted to live abroad, and could never pursue masters due to whatever reasons. And now it feels like a ""Now or Never"" opportunity for me. 

With my current experience, I'm looking to pursue ""Engineering Management"" or ""Data Analysis"" in universities in USA or UK or Australia. 

I got IELTS score of 7, My engineering CGPA is 6.49 with 17 backlogs, and rich experience  of 7+ in management field - Please suggest how to move forward.

Do you think it's a right time to move to US or UK and pursue masters at the age of 30? Take a student loan and pay it  by I'm 33? What will be the pros and cons?

Hi Everyone, 

So first things first, let me keep it short. I’m a newly graduate from SDSU with a bachelor’s degree in marketing specializing in professional selling & sales management. I’m about to turn 25 years old and was thinking of breaking into pharmaceutical sales or just any type of sales that is lucrative and help me have a decent career. I’m very passionate about helping make a difference in peoples lives and health. 

My experiences are not much but I currently manage my family business which is a high end liquor store, and I basically speak with sales representatives and make orders, generate sales with new products , and have increased the profit margins in a lot of product categories for the business. I also currently also assist a liquor company with their website optimization and web development. And lastly, I’ve worked at a market. 

Any device would be appreciated! Thank you.

""Hi BOSS, 

I have been waiting to hear back from you about my vacation days. 

Unfortunately I think there has been a miscommunication. 

During our phone interview and in person interview I made it clear that Saturdays were not days that I could commit to unless discussed and agreed on by both of us in advance. I agreed to set aside Thursday and Friday every week for the company, but made it clear that I would not be committing my Saturdays as well. Although I said I could work some Saturdays, which you made it seem like that would be only once a month, it is now becoming clear that my boundaries are not being respected. 

As I have notified you about my time off three months in advance, I will be unavailable during the time of August 21st- September 1st. 

As for the future, I will only be able to work 2 Saturdays a month. 

Unfortunately I was not made aware of the schedule for the Sonoma show and as that Saturday will be a 10-11 hour shift, I am not willing to commit more than 2 of weekends. 

Best, OP"" 

How can I say this in a more professional way, so I won't get fired?

Gained tons of experience as I've been doing the entire department's work, and even other departments work.

Burnt out as fuck. But lots of transferable skills and experiences.

The idea of a remote job and designing solutions is really exciting to me.

I feel so fucking lost and I don't know where to go. 

My options are basically as follows:

- Continue in Aviation and keep hating myself.

- Medical Sales Representative at some multinational big pharma till I can break into Medical Affairs, which I find really interesting.

- Regulatory Affairs and Compliance at some multinational big pharma. Boring but there are some remote opportunities.

- Transition to Cloud. I find things like solutions archticture and DevOps really cool. But will need to study a lot.

- Transition to Salesforce. Will also need me to study a lot.

So i'm in my 20's and i live in arizona. i've been having issues with my career stability and i've just been having the worst of luck, not to mention my and my girlfriend are planning on getting out first apartment at the end of this month and im worried ill keep having to do go from job to job. My job before my current job right now was contracting for low voltage work my first contract with them was short(about w week) and it was cool but then that was cut short and i was moved to the original site i was planned for. at the site on the first day i had an issue trying to get into the parking lot for training(watching some videos then leaving) and ended up getting in trouble because the guy didn't like my tone when he started yelling at me when i got into the wrong area to park mind i was a little frustrated am i'm usually a nice guy but the guy was giving me a hard time and somehow called my recruiter later the same day and they told me to just head home for the day because of that incident. and then i call my recruiter for that job and told him what happened. long story short they never got back to me for new openings so i was out of a job. and the job before that was a low voltage project that i was on for about some months or so but the team lead on that job just randomly fired me one day for bs reasons regarding to cutting the team costs short bla bla bla, it was literally bs he told me because i have proof of me doing a good job his lies when he fired me and oddly enough i thought we were friends because everytime i start a job its already is going so good but eventually some bs happens, but even then i could tell eventually that i was being singled out just by my job task and how the team was behaving and eventually fired for me simply showing up and doing my job, now i don't want to sound like a victim in the post but i promise i reflect on my situations and i'm always looking to please everyone and do the best job i can do and after i always look to see what i could've done differently but i swear my situation im being done so wrong i get fired for literally no reason. even my job before that was a valet position i got from my friend because i was working a job i liked but the crew i didn't get along with after a while for reasons idk( again i have no reason why im nice to people and i try to make friends and overall im a good person to everyone im not being mean in anyone etc) i just wasn't able to make friends and eventually even a old friend from a old job i had starting working with us in the crew but me and him were not even cool again we stopped talking after the first about week he got there for some reason, but yea the valet job i was working there for a while doing good but eventually i get fired for a bs reason but i could tell it was going to happen because a whole bunch of other bs i can make a whole post about but basically i got fired from that job too and the reason was because apparently i wasn't at my valet post not doing my job (and a supervisor that worked there didnt like me from day one which he did his best to make me look bad), which was a lie he said the front desk peoplesaid, which im almost positive they didnt because one i was doing my job and two i knew the front desk people well and they wouldn't have a reason to say a lie or even tewll him anything like that. so basically my worst history sucks all of reasons that i genuinely fell are out of my control. and of course my little backstory doesn't cover all the nuances and details but trust when i say im a great worker and i do really good at whatever job im doing, and i also look to do better but i don't get the recognition ever! and if i do its not rare it makes a difference.

So as i mentioned earlier the last job i was contracting for isn't responding, i did all i could do so i moved on. i recently just started this new contract for a new company last week. i was hoping this job was going to work out smoothly for the projected three months or longer. So its not a big team, its a small crew and were basically pulling cable into apartment units for internet etc. this is my first time working in this type of setting but im clearly qualified for the job and i understand the work as much so. So this is only the second week and im already having issues with the lead on the team and the guys. Last week on our first run we finally get a plan on how to run the fiber and we got it up to the top floor. mind you were all working together. the job is going great at this point were all happy to be there bla bla bla everything seems cool, im learning the job helping out, proving/providing my skills, making relationships all that jazz. i thought i made a friend i was working with him most of the time that week and he is younger so of course im helping him out with what werer doing when he had questions, we would talk basketball. its a small crew so no cliques to worry about( except two guys the were friends before the job) clear objective and it just seemed like it would be a cool rewarding job that i can do good at and make the most of. but yea so things are going smooth up until this point. were up stairs and ima helpful person so i started helping with a task i see another one of the guys doing that the lead called out that needed to be done. the lead cuts me off as im helping out and tells me to wait for a reason that he never gave me, so i was measuring had i set i back down but i ends up getting tangled because the formation 8 it was in it had to be laid back in a specific way which i was unaware of. no big deal though he starts working on unraveling it and it was done no big deal, yes a little mistake but no big deal foreal easy to fix. and mind you its not like i'm slowing us down we literally can only do so much in the day to due residents not wanting us in the house etc etc that's why we all in that unit in the first place so dont get the picture that this is a smooth job because its not at least while we are figuring out the building layouts etc, trust me. so yea the next day or so we end up done the same thing a little differently because again this is the first building were working on and expectations are way off bla bla bla they had bad communication on the timeframe of the job, so yea i'm spooling the cable this time and its my first time doing it, i get the rundown and i do the job, but at the end i noticed i forgot to label the tail before i cut it and let that be known, i tell our team lead and we move on. sure i technically ""messed up"" but tbh not taking away from what happened, its not a vital step in the cable pulling because its already pulled and ready to go that why hence we moved on but yes i understood i made a mistake and owned up to it, not a big deal considering everyone makes mistakes including other guys on the team but he wanted to single me out the next day. so next day we cant do the original plan and start working on the next building because he messed up communication with the apartments on how long each building would take before the job started and we couldnt go in the building, so no work for the day pretty much, but we ended up making a plan to work on some vacant units. i didn't get the plan until last minute because i started noticing they were going over shit without me whenever they could so once i get over there i ask to see the map so see what going on joining the conversation on the lead tell me not to take things from people that not nice because i grabbed the map. so im like that weird why is he acting like that? then later i ask bro like khey are you okay do you fell like i didn anything wrong, he said no and we moved on but it was weird that the lead would even say that trying to call me out in front of the crew like i was just being the rudest guy ever, like you guys are having meetings and shit without me in the conversations and im being rude, whatever but okay whatever like no big deal ill just try to make sure that doesn't keep happening(being singled out of little talks/ seeming rude or being too friendly) which they started doing already singling me out but yeah eventually i get the plan to do one unit after basically forcing myself into the task to see what is being done and what i can do , i got the code to do one unit and the lead said he would come with. simple task no cable pulling just setting the unit up for the cable. so it was weird i only got one but okay let me bust this out real quick. i only had one unit to do so we both do take care of it and it was easy boom, we go over back to the storage and were just waiting on them to finish the rest,,, (odd i could've been helping out too on other units) but whatever if hes here too then obvouly im good plus i asked whats the pla and he wanted the guys to do them, so we started prepping some shit to make time, i try to make small talk which was cool but then a little later he starts asking me about my xp. just to in the end try and make a big deal out of the cable situation the last week and obviously trying to get under my skin. i basically tell him hey i understand but you dont have to worry, first time, etc etc, it'll be alright you know. and btw there has been mistake done on the other guys part(accidently disconnecting the units wifi etc) and i don't know if hes had conversations with everyone else but it looks to me im being singled out, and i hate to bring race into this but as a black guy in arizona this seems to be and issue for me more than i thought it would be. but what really left a bad taste in my mouth from that conversation was was i walked away for a second because he was making the conversation hostile after i told him its fine bla bla bla were going back and forth a little but im trying to stay professional and i was pretty much done listening to him try to disqualify me ( the convo was over my heart was beating fast etc) i went to throw some trash away and i say to myself it will be alright, he comes out from the storage obviously rilled up from this argument he tried to start, and says what did you say dont walk away mumbling things?! walking up to me, i'm like dude i was talking to myself, i said everything is going to be fine. but that just left me bitter because why is he acting in this way. ive only kept things professional to this point and ive been nice to everyone help full communicative studious all of the above, but its like i was on his bad side all of a sudden. like dude im a grown man i dont need these issues at work you know im not trying to have conflict and if there needs to be converstations im open to them but its like were already on a bad start and hes trying to disrespect me with his athurity as a team lead, im fine with constructive criticism and things like that but its the way he approached and continued to make toxic conflict. so yeah anyways today after that bs im ready to just go in get done what needs to be done and not disappoint not make any mistakes communicate be helpful. all the things ive ben doing already but with a focus because i dont want to have an problems i'm just trying to work. so i get to work as usual go to the meet up spot and there's no plan just waiting then i see some of the guys there but at this point i don't even want to make friends anymore im just focused on doing my job. they already were starting to clique up so i just said hey and stuck around until finally we get some word to get started and what building were working on. we start on the building but already im annoyed because i had a task to prep then set up cable. i go to set up the unit and the young guy i thought we were cool, he starts working on that same unit im in like he/we didn't just comfirm what we were all doing and that i was to prep this unit. no big deal i think we can work on this together like last week ill help you out if you need then ill move on, the lead come in because this kid clearly cant do the task on his own which i could have taken over but he already started calling for help etc sso the lead comes up and see me standing there and acts like im no doing anything and tells me to set uo the cables. im like ughh in my head because at this point im just doing what was told to do as usual but whatever let me go do what i do. mind you in between working on setting up the cables he tries to play the narc card, are you okay when was moving the stuff up to prep. idk if he felt bad, felt like i was upset , or just wanted to set me up and check my temp from the previous day, i simply tell him in okay everything is good and continue working taking the mat. up the stairs, but from previous xp i can tell he was pulling a bs card asking me whats wrong when clearly im fine, its like gaslighting me to make me feel like im acting different of something playing as my friend but i can tell it wasnt genuine.

so everything is going good we break for lunch and get back. again the plan for the building isn't even set because were figuring it out so i cant move ahead or nothing im waiting on his go to set up the next set of cables to run but we cant because there aren't reasy to be be run anyways as he already knew what was done from me because i communicated with him etc. i see who and asks who needs help and let him know then i'm advised to help the other kid from earlier on something which i did. after that i take a second to think about what's next and he comes out of a unit and acts like im just standing around then we go to the side for a conversation. at this pioint i pull out my phone and record the conversation. he's trying to blame me and saying a whole bunch of crapto me and making up things so were going back and forth. ill include it if i can but its 17 minues long. he tried to send me home and shhit im jsut like dude why are you acting this why and explaining myself to him for some reason and after i deescalated that i end up going to to finish the job because he understood or at least i hope he did that his points some of them were not factual and dude your giving me unnecessary shit trying to kick me off the team.

so i guees im here on advise of what do i do. the first time we talked i went home ealry ad started looking up how to stand up for myself etc etc without coming off rude or seeming like a problem and came to the conclusion just to do better, then today i have this issue. its honeslty so fustrating trying to take care of my bills etc but these jobs im in i keep havng issues. i dont know what to do. i guess ill start looking for a new job already but i dont know why it has to be ths way. i literally don't understand why these situations keep happening to me, and this as mentioned earlier isnt the first case of harassment from sups or leads no matter what i do how or much i do. im trying to be the best i can be and everything always start off so for new jobs but it always ends up going bad no matter what i do. this is only the secind week of this new contract and this is already happening and i haven't been doing anything wrong to anyone but i always am the odd ball of something whatever im at. i cant get any help from any one and im afraid im cured with dealing with the forver! why do people focus on me and want to be my enemy, i want to love people and have great relationships and do good at my job and pay my bills and stuff but i jsut cant get over beig blammed as the bad guy

i can include the conversation from today if anyone wants it but i just done know aht to to. its hard for me to stand up for myself and i know im a independt contractator so i probably can say some things but im always being put as the bad guy even when im not doing shit to anyone so i feel im screwed both ways because if i do say the things i want to say iim screwed, if i dont and get walk over im screwed theres nothing i can do and im at the mercy of learning how to kiss ass bettter and as best as possible but even that does work or guarantee my job securty. its jsut starting to give me toxic vibes already and is already effecting my preformance. ill know it but ill eventually be forced out from the squad im sure. none will talk to me, theyll force me to feel like im not trying to stick with the plan with them etc etc etc

1cyjtuq,How to navigate workplace hierarchy and get better? ,"Urgent help needed regarding work place hierarchy and how to get better.

So for the context, I am 21, currently pursuing my studies and work at two international startups. I love working there. Now at one of these startups, I take care of operations at quite a senior position. Now there are new people coming in, who should ideally be reporting to me given the structure and line of reporting SOPs, but they have more experience than my age. 

Now the thing is, I am all down to learning from them. They have seen more  they know more, and I am all in for the growth mindset mentality. But again, at the same I now gotta grind 6 to 7 times harder with their entry so that I can get the COO position for which I have been in line for so long. I think I already know the only thing I can do in this situation is study more, deliver better outcomes and results, and work harder, but I still some kind of advice, as to how to go about this situation in general tbh. Because all the people I have talked to, have not been very helpful tbh. And last thing, I think I should not say, but I think the CEO is starting to put me away for some reason, and he is getting more biased towards the people who are yet to join or are just one day into the job. So yeah, as a whole this is what I have been stressing over quite sometime now. 

I know moat people on this sub are very experienced and learned. I think if you could help me have some clarity on this tbh. I would greatly appreciate it 🙏🏼. Thank you everyone!

1cyiv9c,Looking for Advice: When to say it's enough....,"\*\*\*Apologies ahead of time for the lengthy read...

Hi All - I am looking for some advice/thoughts on what I should do given my current work situation. A little bit about myself I am a 38m Advertising/Marketing creative professional who has been in the industry for over 15 years now. Started in the NY ad world and grinded it out there working for big consumer brands, winning awards and spending most of my days and nights working on pitches or on set. Then my wife and I had our daughter and of course just like any sane person (hopefully) I didn't want to work 80-90 weeks anymore out of a broom closet (literally).

Since then I have been working for smaller agencies/marketing firms in senior/executive level positions helping these organizations grow their internal creative departments based on business needs and bring in new clients.

When the pandemic hit I was working remotely for a communications agency doing what I stated above, but after 2 1/2 years I felt like I hit a ceiling both creatively and professionally and decided to move on. Fast forward to where I am now. I currently work for a global non-profit (remotely) managing the creative team (around 12 people) as part of our ""marketing and communications"" department.

Before I started there was the usual selling point of ""carving my own path"" and ""getting out what I put in"" deal, IE ""everyday there will be something dysfunctional and new"" and ""do good work, get rewarded with even more work"". Which okay that's fine every company has different selling points on how they try to get you to work there and I also have heard stories about wearing many many different hats especially with a non-profit environment, so I knew what I was signing up for. I also took a pay cut and title reduction because I wanted to try something new and really felt that there was room to grow. At the end of the day I was more concerned about being a good manager for my team, creating better processes, innovate where we could, and create a higher standard/quality of work that everyone could be proud of and really push the organization forward.

Everything started out normal as any new job does. Everyone is nice to you, everyone seems competent in their roles and everything seems to be working as it should. Well for anyone who has been 3+ years of general work experience in any environment knows that after a couple of months that honeymoon period starts to wear off and you start to see the cracks in the sidewalk.

This is where my story starts (told ya it was going to be a long one). The first couple of months I do what I do at every job and kind of go on a listening tour with my team and other people within the company to get a sense of where everyone's priorities were and get better context to what happened previous to me coming in. While I was doing this my boss seemed competent enough at the time to understand the things that I was telling her that needed to get fixed/updated, where the challenges were and how we were going to move past them.

To start I put together a couple of decks that consisted of a new department structure/recommendation, SOP (standard operating procedures) + Process document, and even an annual plan for the rest of the FY with a roadmap of all of the tactics, initiatives and tent pole moments that we would be heavily involved in from the marketing/creative side. She seemed receptive to many of the ideas and was happy that I knew what I was talking about so she took the documents and we didn't really speak about them for the next couple of months. Over those few months there were new projects/initiatives coming in that were piling up for the team, so I took it upon myself (while still reminding her that I needed some form of approval) to just implement the changes I recommended.

Fast FWD 8 months, the team is knee deep in projects (more projects than we have ever had because everyone internally were using outside vendors, because they originally did not want work with our department/my boss). Everyone on the creative team was happy with how projects were being executed, they felt empowered by letting them try new things they weren't able to do before and everyone actually feels like there was some semblance of order to how we do the work and ultimately our internal stakeholders who are requesting these projects were very happy with the results/outcomes.

During those 8 months, the conversations around projects and all of the documentation I provided originally was pushed off, my boss rarely ever came to status calls, kick off calls or even just meetings that we both should have been in attendance for. It literally felt like she just took an 8 month vacation and when she checked in with me, she would not ask me what's the status of jobs a, b and c. She was always frame the questions as ""if someone asked you this, what would you say?"" or ""what are your thoughts about doing this, and how would you execute that?"".

It got to the point where I had to have multiple conversations with her to say ""I don't feel like I am getting the support I need and your other direct report is also radio silent I need you to talk to her so we can actually work together as a team"". Well after about 6-8x of having this conversation I went to her boss and had a 2 hour conversation with him about how she has been MIA for the last 8 months+, I have been doing her job and her other direct report is also non responsive (which I will get to some more background context later on both of them).

He said I hear you and will do something about it. After I had that conversation with him, my boss immediately asks for a 1:1 and essentially says to be if I go to her boss again about these things I said that it would be ""a different conversation"", mind you I also told her on that call AGAIN everything she was NOT doing and gave definitive answers and showed the receipts of everything I was doing to carry the department.

After that conversation happened my life has been a living hell. For the past 5-6months she has been documenting every conversation we have had together (which I have as well), overstepping and bottle necking every projects myself and my team are working on, and undermining me around every corner on full team calls.

Since I had that last conversation with her boss I have had multiple conversations with him and HR and other executive team members about her behavior, her lack of professionalism and tbh her lack of knowledge/skill to even do her job.

I have tried multiple times to come to the table with viable solutions like just splitting us off of the department so we can operate solo, among other options - and it even got to the point where exec team members have asked me do we even need her, and I have said ""no"". They're very aware of her past behavior but I do not think to the degree/detail in which I have told them in the last several months.

To give that background context I was talking about earlier -  the story goes that she was hired by another really terrible/unskilled leader (who was fired for stealing from the company and just being a terrible person) and it kind of just multiplied like bunnies from there. Before I came into the org no one wanted to work with her or her other direct report that I spoke about earlier, because they were rude, unprofessional and just plain mean. So the department at the time just became a vendor management team essentially. The only reason she has been her for so long is because it's a non profit and it's just too hard to really track the core source of where things come from whether it's good or bad. So she crafted her entire ""professional career"" off the backs of people below her who ended up leaving because of her and now she's just been able to fly under the radar until now.

Last I heard through the grapevine -  a couple of weeks ago there were plans to fire her and move me into her position, but like any organization all changes move at a snails pace. We also recently got a new CEO, and he seems very smart, observant in a no BS kind of way which is good - he has already commented on how we do not have any good marketing in it's current form and something needs to be done.

At this point in time I have built up a great reputation with our internal and external stakeholders, I'd like to think that people enjoy working with me based on the feedback I have heard and everyone is happy with my work product/output and has been mentioned many many times to the exec team and HR without and prompting (from what I hear).

All that to say presently I have resigned myself to just doing the bare minimum because I feel like I am in a damned if I do damned if I don't type of situation - it's very apparent that my boss notices and hears the  positive things myself and the team are doing and is already very self conscious about her ability to do her job, so she tries pull me into these ""gotcha"" moments on team calls and other project meetings to maintain control/power.

At the end of the day it's less about taking her job and getting ""promoted"" and it's more about my teams mental health, happiness and professional development.

My question to everyone is; do I believe the conversations I have been having and wait and see if something is really going to happen to her? or do I just say F it and really push down the gas on my already active job search? have any of you ever been in this position? it's mentally vexing and I really think if she was gone we'd really be able to do great things and innovate the way we are suppose to for our stakeholders + I really like my team.

Any advice would be helpful and happy to give clarity and answer any questions, thank you!

TL:DR - I started a new job, made some great changes and created some great work, my boss was MIA for 8 months, have been doing her job since then - when she found out I was not happy about it through multiple conversations with her then escalated to her boss after she did not listen - she threatened to fire me, and now I am waiting for my company to do something about her based on my situation + her bad track record/inability to actually do her job.",p1anit,1,1.0,2,1716433720,2024-05-23 03:08:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cyiv9c/looking_for_advice_when_to_say_its_enough/,5,2024

Yes, I do recognize that it is extremely late to be looking for a summer internship and have already had a few interviews but since I do not get back in my hometown until June that has been a problem for some firms. Even if I cannot get an internship this summer, I am looking for some advice as for what I should do this summer. I am taking a class at UCLA on real estate investment and wanted to hear if you guys had any other ideas? I would love to do something related to finance or real estate and have been constantly looking but have not found much.

1cyi63u,Should I focus on making money or something I love doing?,"
Need advice 

Hi I'm 18 years now and I am joining a design institute for a degree in game design. Making games what I love to do from start to finish. I have thought to learn and work in big game companies. The problem is that recently I have started looking for ways to earn money online and found things such as copywriting, drop shipping and stuff. I can earn money through making games too but doing that is way harder than others.

So, should I solely focus on making games and learning deeply about it or should I do both making games and copywriting together or maybe I can solely focus on game development and learn things like investment, copywriting slowly with time. Cause I will never regret making games but the problem is making money.

Please guide me to the right sub if this place is not right to ask these questions.

1cyhx1k,Can I ask for a raise a month after starting a new job?,"I've just completed training at a job and worked my first shift alone as a salon receptionist. I agreed to an hourly wage that was just slightly lower than I wanted, but I'd already been job searching for longer than I'd planned, and other considerations like commute, hours/schedule, and flexibility seemed like a good fit. However, my first shift without the person training me was extremely demanding, and I'm no stranger to high-volume, fast-paced customer service jobs. The thing is, at most jobs I've worked at I'm only responsible for 1-2 tasks at a time. The most challenging part about this job is the amount of multi-tasking I'm expected to do. Not only am I answering the phone, checking people in/out, dealing with walk-ins, and misc. administrative tasks, but I'm also expected to do laundry (start/transfer loads and fold) and clean/sweep in between clients. I did not have a single second of downtime during my entire shift, and we weren't even at full capacity (some stylists were out).

I know I've only worked one shift, but I don't think having more experience and becoming faster/more efficient at the tasks will be able to make it much less hectic. That said, I really don't want to quit right away, especially after completing training. However, now that I realize how demanding the job really is, I feel that I should be compensated more than agreed upon and want to ask for a higher hourly wage. I was told during the interview that higher compensation could be discussed after I'd worked there for awhile -- I'm sure they meant after 6 months to a year. I'm going to give it another few weeks to see if anything changes, but if it remains the same, I think I want to ask for an 8% increase (I'd really like a 15% increase, but that seems unreasonable to ask for) because as of now I feel that I'm underpaid for the amount of work I'm required to do. I'd like to be paid $19/h, which seems to be well within reason for a receptionist job where I live. Would it be insane to ask for a pay increase after a month? I mean, the worst they could say is no, and then I could start looking for other jobs while I tough it out. Any advice is welcome. If anyone has worked as a receptionist before, I'd love input on whether or not the amount of tasks I'm delegated is typical or reasonable.

TL;DR: Salon receptionist job more demanding than I thought, lots of multi-tasking and zero down-time, now I feel I should be paid more than agreed upon, should I ask for a pay inc $17.50 --> $19/h?",EcstaticDragonfruit9,0,0.5,5,1716430659,2024-05-23 02:17:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cyhx1k/can_i_ask_for_a_raise_a_month_after_starting_a/,5,2024
1cyhx0r,$375K to Hustle or $100K to Coast?,"Up until a few years ago I was a senior executive at a company earning around $220K a year. I was very good at my job and worked for 15 years to get there. After some toxic and illegal behavior by the CEO that I refused  to go along with, I was terminated, but got a good severance package due to his toxic and illegal behavior. I used that money plus savings to buy an existing business in the same industry. Business was clearing about $80K in profit annually when I bought it and I was confident I could increase that. Fast forward to today and profit is just north of $100K annually. Best of all, while profit goes up, my workload decreases with most weeks only requiring a few hours work. Business is located half a day's drive from where I live so it's mostly run by someone else, BUT my absentee ownership limits expansion and more profits.



On the positive end, this has allowed me to spend much more time with the family and enjoy life like never before. I can't afford to just pick up and go on fancy vacations or anything, but we are comfortable. In my old role, all I used to do was work and my position was HIGHLY stressful. Now that I am working for myself, money is tighter than it used to be, though with the wife's income ($80Kish) we aren't exactly poor. Recently I was contacted by a recruiter I've known for a few years about a position similar to what I was doing before. I told him I wasn't really sure if I was interested, but I'd have a call with the CEO. Suffice it to say call goes great. CEO wants to fly me in to interview. Okay, I will sit down with him kind of hoping it wouldn't go well. After face to face, he seems like a good guy and makes me an offer before I've even left. $275K a year plus benefits, etc.. Downside is I'd have to move across country for the job and it's a TON of work. Back to long hours, etc. He also doesn't know about my business since I am a silent owner. I wouldn't sell, close, or divest from it.



So now I don't know what to do. Turning down almost $300K in additional income seems ridiculous to me. At the same time, right now I make six figures working a few hours a week and actually see my family. I also don't really want to move. Then again, nearly $400K in annual income would be big for my family. They could buy a stand-in to replace me while I work and just buy a better house, fund college, expedite the retirement process (though I'm practically retired now), and/or let my wife retire early.



My wife is laid back so she doesn't care what I do. My kids would obviously prefer not to move because of friends, but I also have to consider their college funds, how I set them up in life, and retirement. I am torn on what to do myself so I come here for some perspective. If you were me would you be happy with an easy $100K annually and not having to relocate/work much or would you follow the additional $275K to a new state for a total of $375K annually while increasing your workload to 60-80hrs per week indefinitely? I've got the weekend to decide.

1cyhl0s,Job Offer in Limbo: Did My Hometown Location Cost Me the Opportunity?,"I'm from India and have 5 years of corporate working experience. Recently, I decided it was time for a job change and applied to a multinational tax consulting firm in Pune, the same city as my current job. Although I work from home now, my company offers a hybrid model.

I got a call from Ekta in HR for a job which I applied via LinkedIn, who informed me that my resume matched their job requirements. She asked me some basic screening questions about my current role, communication skills, expected salary, and current company location. I answered all her questions, and she then sent me an online assignment, which included aptitude, personality, and reasoning tests.

After completing the test, I received an email saying I had passed and that they would schedule my first interview. The interview was conducted by two people, one from India and the other from the UK. It lasted 30 minutes and went well. They even extended it to ask more questions since they found my profile interesting. After the first interview, I received an email saying I had cleared it, and they scheduled a second round.

The second round also went smoothly, and the next day, I received an email from Ekta congratulating me for clearing the interview process. She requested my last three months' salary slips to prepare the formal offer letter, which I promptly sent. They mentioned I would receive the offer letter by May 22.

Two days passed, and I hadn’t heard back. On the promised date, I called Ekta twice but didn’t get an answer. She finally called me back around 8 PM and asked a few more questions. During the conversation, I mentioned that I was currently working from home in Northern India. This seemed to surprise her, and she expressed concern that I hadn’t informed her I wasn't in Pune. I explained that my current office location is in Pune, and I plan to relocate there for the job.

Ekta then said this was a major issue as she had assumed I was already in Pune and suggested this might lead to my rejection. I was disheartened since I was very excited about the role. I reiterated that my office location is Pune and that I wasn’t expecting any relocation assistance. I assured her that I was genuinely interested in the job and would relocate to Pune within a week, highlighting that my current company was laying off employees, which was one reason I wanted a job change.

She said she needed to check with her senior for approval and would inform me of the next steps. I felt angry and confused. How could my hometown be relevant after clearing all assessments and interviews? They had already sent me an email expressing their excitement to have me on board, yet now she was suggesting rejection because of my current work-from-home location. I can't help but wonder if this is discrimination since there are known biases against Northern Indians in Pune, Maharashtra.

I genuinely want this job for its international exposure and growth opportunities. What should I do? Is this discrimination, or is there a valid concern I'm not seeing?",Swimming_Peace_1902,1,1.0,0,1716429614,2024-05-23 02:00:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cyhl0s/job_offer_in_limbo_did_my_hometown_location_cost/,5,2024

1cygxrf,Is it bad to start looking for a new job after only 8 months? ,"Hi everyone,
I (27F) made a huge mistake in taking a job as a Director of Food Safety at a large company. I’m on call 24/7 and I’m a very anxious person/don’t handle stress well and this job is turning me into a basket case. I cry randomly at work in the bathroom due to the stress, have no life and am always on call or answering the phone or emails, and have dealt with now extreme turnover to where I’m constantly filling lower level labor positions. There’s constant people/personnel issues as well.

Prior to this, I was a Director at a smaller company and I really enjoyed my job, had weekends off, got all my holidays, and had great work life balance. I left since I thought “the grass was greener” and now I’m dealing with constant issues related to this new company understaffing their FSQA Department. 

I also have no family and limited friends in this area (central coast CA) so there’s really no point in me being here. It’s been really hard to make friends here since I’m always working. I was thinking of moving to the Bay Area and joining a start up (smaller) company and working in food safety as the rents are similar there and I think I’d have a better time meeting people. I feel bad after leaving this job after only 8 months, but if it’s having such an impact on my mental and physical health, is this okay? 

My history is:
Grad school - 2 years doing a thesis based degree
Technologist job - 1.5 years, got laid off 
Director Food Safety -1.5 years, this new opportunity came up that seemed like a good idea 
FSQA Director - 8 months

It seems like a lot of hopping around but I’m just at a loss of what to do. I’d be willing to take a pay cut for my own sanity now.

1cygtz8,Honest advice from a consultant,"Consider if you have a skill that companies need, but aren’t necessarily hiring for. Or hiring in lower numbers. This can be anything from IT to physical security to marketing, depending on your location. Make sure you’re either good at it already, or are willing to put in the hours to get there. Make sure you have some sort of sellable qualification, whether a piece of paper or experience.

If there happens to be a consulting job in your niche, go for it and use the below to get clients for your commission. The other 99% should…

Form an LLC. It’s important to have a business for this to work. Start attending *shudder* networking events. Skip the Young Professionals. Go to business events, like Chamber of Commerce breakfasts, and the its-actually-about-business events, like the swanky fundraiser for [cause].

Identify and speak with C-suite executives at these events. Ideally, you’re looking for major corporations - not just Amazon, but Anheuser-Busch, TPI, Home Depot, Curtiss-Wright. Executives with 8-figure budgets are SHOCKINGLY easy to talk to in a casual setting. And their standards are way lower than hiring managers.

Be social. Everyone likes someone who’s easy to talk to and shows interest in whatever they’re going on about. Oh what do I do? I provide __________ services.

Maybe they have something relevant, and want to throw this nice person a bone. Maybe they know the guy over there is looking for just that and wants to introduce you. Shit happens when you meet large groups of people who vaguely know each other in a casual setting. It’s the only reason people attend these things. Do what they do.

Here’s the best part, and the reason I identified large corporations: once you’re in, you’re in. You can get lost in the cracks of a large corporation for years - the check still comes every month. 

Yeah, some clients are actually demanding. Yeah, most clients have emergency periods when you need to hustle. But at the end of the day, you’re on retainer unless you agree to specific work products. A lot of big clients don’t bother you much (the mom and pops will probably demand more). And if you have a business, you can charge a pretty large percentage of what would be your salary for a role at that company. Except you now have multiple streams, if things go well. And lots of new connections. And a lot less hours of work, if you’re not at the bottom of a consulting firm.

Sometimes, you just end up doing a half hour therapy call with whoever brought you in each week. Outside consulting is a wild world. Top executives are…they’re not dumb, but they’re rarely smarter than the average person outside of one highly specific area.

This all depends on living in a good local economy, and I realize not everyone has that benefit. But I hope this sparks some ideas for how you can follow a non-traditional path. It’s really bad out there right now.

1cyeyw5,Need help wrt how to politely avoid answering former employers questions about my current job.,"Hi, I need some advice on how to politely or diplomatically, or both, not provide any answer about my current job, boss or project I am part of, to my former boss? I work in academia, so as long as some joint paper is lingering somewhere in the publishing pipeline I have to be in touch in some capacity, with my former bosses, since they are coauthors. I'm fine with this part of emails back and forth every two months now, updating them about status of a paper we submitted where they are my coauthors. Fellow academics, you might be able to identify this situation better. For further context, I do not live or work in the US, so any US-specific work-culture  advice might not be applicable. 


**BACKGROUND**: I did not like the work environment in my former project. My former bosses liked showing off their positions of influence and power, how they know so-and-so people in such high profile positions; one even reminds me of my school bullies, and I do not want to share details about my current work since I am concerned they might try to influence my career (and not in a good way). But if I rudely say it is none of their business then they might get vindictive, and I witnessed their pettiness while I was working there. I know how sanctimonious, shrewd, arrogant and controlling they are. Even the thought of my former position suffocates me now and makes my hair grey faster. So the only thing I divulged to them when I left, and during a paper related follow-up meeting is what can be seen from my professional networking page already: the name of my current institution and department. And my current department is big enough such that it's not possible to know everyone, even when one is working there. So I could remain vague even after. So what's the best way (read: diplomatic/ British way) to avoid answering such questions, or answer while remaining vague?  However I have to meet them soon (online) for a revision of a paper and I'm feeling uneasy about it just thinking of how they'd smugly ask me the following questions, again: 

""What are you currently working on?"", ""We might know someone there, who is your day to day boss?"", ""Who are your collaborators?""


Thanks in advance for sharing your wisdom fellow humans who are more diplomatic than I am at present. Also sorry for possible typos. It's very late where I live, and I'm half sleepy and half anxious about the upcoming meeting with the former guardians of Hades.

1cyelm6,Advice for this job market starting out?,"Hi all. I am a early 20s dude who lives in a MCoL area. I live in Indiana in a town that has a fortune top 200 company located in it that pays phenomenally well. I am talking near Chicago, and LA pay. Most other jobs around here pay nearing 20% UNDER industry standard. A accountant at a factory or small office makes <$18/hr. While one at this large company can start at as low as $75,000/yr and you can end up a corporate director making $300,000/yr. 

Now here is my dilemma. I fucking love my town, it is known for its architecture having such a high concentration is significant mid century building. Not too mention all my family lives here, I want to stay in this town. This company has only presented me one issue. I CAN NOT SEEM TO GET HIRED. I am currently a MBA undergraduate and accounting minor who went to my state business school in a nationally top 10 program. And couldn’t even land an internship here. I have been applying for two years to this company. It’s such bull crap, 12 years ago my mom walked into the corporate office building and asked to speak with HR, had to wait for 20 minutes and then she left that building a few hours later as a corporate employee with NO degree making 30/hr in 2012!! 

I am sure I will eventually be fine, since I can still access this schools phenomenal career center with all kinds of head hunters from Fortune 500 companies. But any time I find a recruiter for this company they lead me on and tell me to apply and once I get accepted to reference them, but I keep getting denied. I am worried I am on some no hire list even though I have never worked for them. I have 87 applications to just this one company. I even have family friends who are director level and they can’t get me a job. I graduated nearly top of my class on the deans list with a 3.9 GPA and have internships at other companies. 

I have a great resume with some solid experience. Any help? I leave great impressions on people, dress super well, speak well, and so forth. What is my issue? Is it just shitty luck, is the job market really this atrocious? When ever I do apply it takes them a month or two to deny me. Usually near unposting for the job. I know I am getting looked at internally and being at least considered. I have a few times applied for engineering niched corporate rolls I could certainly do but lack the qualifications. And I was denied within days. So if I was truly unqualified for these roles I would be denied in days, not sitting in the pool for months.

1cye8vj,Stay in new role in a company I hate vs. leaving for a new company for a role I may not like,"I need some career guidance! Long story short, I’ve been with my current company for 4.5 years and have just had the opportunity to start a new role within my company that I’ve been really interested in for a long time. I’ve always hated the original role I was hired for when joining the company and have finally been given a chance to try something new that I’m excited about. However, I absolutely hate my company! Lots of financial pain (haven’t had a pay raise for close to two years with no raise in sight), layoffs every year, company reorganization, constant change, etc. I feel like I’m always in a state of anxiety. I’ve been wanting to leave for a couple of years now and have the chance now to leave for a new company. However, this new company would be for a position that was very similar to the one I hated at my current company. I know people at this new company and think it could be a great fit, but I’m nervous about losing this new opportunity to try something new at my current company.
I don’t think I’d get this opportunity again since it’s sort of a career change that I’m able to easily transition into within my own company. 
I also don’t know what the pay would be in comparison to my current role, but I’d imagine it’s maximum $10k increase. 

What do I do?!

TLDR: 
Option 1: 
-stay with current company I hate
-try this new role hoping that I like it (a career change opportunity I wouldn’t be able to make on my own without getting this experience which could open a new career door for me)
-haven’t seen a pay raise in almost 2 yrs and likely won’t any time soon

Option 2: 
-go to a new company with people I know (potential for a better company that’s healthy)

1cyd2uc,"What would you do if you found out you were going to get axed?
","Tl;dr I came across an email exchange where my boss is talking about replacing me.



I'm an exec at a small startup, and we're barely hanging onto solvency (we laid off half the company a few weeks ago). We use Salesforce as our CRM, which tracks all of our external email exchanges. I randomly came across a new email thread in Salesforce where my boss emailed one of our investors about replacing me. It doesn't go into detail on the ""why."" I've never received a performance review or really any substantive performance-related feedback in my 3 years at the company. While getting axed is a surprise to me, it really doesn't bother me that much as much as I find it, well, poorly thought out.

I'm fine with leaving and in fact have already started a job search myself as I don't particularly care to wait around until the company is no more. However, knowing that I'm on the chopping block pretty much saps any and all motivation I might have had remaining to help keep this ship afloat.

1cyclhh,Changing engineering major in 4th year undergrad?,"

I am an undergraduate engineering student considering switching from geological engineering to mechanical and materials engineering. I have completed 3/4 years, and one internship year. Since I would be switching at the beginning of 5th year, it would require an additional 1-1.5 years (1-1.5 years after spring 2025, which is when I would graduate now).

Another option is to graduate on time with a geological engineering BASc, and then pursue a mechanical engineering M.Eng during the extra 1-1.5 years. My concern with this approach is that most M.Eng courses are more specialized than undergrad, and it would certainly not provide the same breadth of mechanical engineering exposure. 

I have enjoyed studying geological engineering, but am realizing I want to work towards jobs that combine engineering skills with business/sales/marketing. Mechanical engineering is a good fit for this due to the breadth of industries it is applicable to. Mechanical engineering is also a big interest for me (rock mechanics is my favourite part of geology).

Have any of you switched majors late in your degree, or gone through a similar situation? 

Any advice you have? 

Thanks in advance!

1cyc5yq,Posting bc I am desperate ,"I took a job in workers compensation  insurance as a risk analysis underwriter to escape a former company, specifically a coworker’s toxicity and unwanted advances.

I never wanted the role I am in now but covid aftermath, depression and the economy have played a big role in why I have stayed in this role for the last 2.5 years. 

I am capable of so much more than my work history indicates. I have a background in communications and I am a certified paralegal. However, I can not for the life of me seem to even get so much as an interview for anything else —- even an entry level opportunity. I want to do something creative, marketing and public relations related because the legal industry is extremely toxic and I refuse to be treated like trash again. 

I have 5 years of previous experience on my resume so it’s not like I’m incompetent and I have held two roles successfully… but I am so miserable in my current role I’m spiraling into a deep depression due to it. 

Is this common? I feel like the fact that I work in insurance processing and underwriting risks is a huge stain on my employment resume and my abillity to do other things. There is no room to grow for me. I am 26 years old and I have applied to over 500 jobs in the past 6 months.

What can I do? Should I bring my unsolicited resume into companies? I have tried networking and even that has failed bc I am introverted. I cannot go on making crap money and being depressed in this crappy role.

1cy9h9l,"Burnt Out and Thinking about a Career Change, 29 M","I currently work for a smaller/mid-sized environmental consulting company as a project manager, primarily in the renewable space. I enjoy the renewable industry and projects that I get to lend my hand in, enjoy most of my colleagues, am fully remote, and don't need to travel all too much. My work-life balance is not bad, I enjoy flexibility and I make about $82k which is a solid jump from where I started less than 2 years ago at this company at around $62k. In time (maybe 2-5 years), I could probably make closer to $100k. My supervisors and higher ups seem to have confidence in me and my input is valued. 

  
But, even when trying to take breaks in the work, being appreciative of my current situation and items above, I just feel drained. Too drained. Much of the time is spent in some level of anxiety during and after work (especially over the weekends). This has gone through up and down cycles over the last 8 months especially. I often feel an extreme lack of excitement or reward toward my work and getting any task done, which makes me feel worse and strengthens my imposter syndrome feeling. I wanted this job so badly and have learned a lot. I acknowledge I am in some growing/learning phases of my role, but when I look to my peers who are above me and managing larger projects, teams, etc..their roles don't seem very appealing to me. Sure managing projects and people and the responsibility that comes with it seems intriguing and with some reward, but it seems like it would feel like taking my current work stresses now (multiple things needing to be worked on with the urgency as if they were due yesterday, little cohesiveness to my work areas, worrying about utilization, billable hours, constantly tracking every minute of my day for timesheets, little appreciation from clients, and constant screen time) and multiplying it by 100. Additionally, I'm not a scientist or an engineer and play more of a generalist role in terms of specializations. Not necessarily a bad thing, but an odd feelings in env. consulting. 

  
My wife recognizes it taking a toll on me. I'm torn between the following thoughts while I continue to kind of do the bare minimum this week and next, which is tough because I am somewhat a perfectionist and can easily overcommit at work:

- apply to other roles that interest me, but adjacent to my field (meaning no env. consulting, and other type of consulting work). What scares me here is not knowing if it's consulting that kills me, or the type of consulting I'm doing now.

- entertain conversations regarding an outside sales position with a close connection at his well established company. I have no direct sales experience, but am great with people and have always said to myself that I think I would do well. Variable pay and a lower base is what concerns me, aside from completely abandoning my current field of work. 

- continue working at my job while trying to get past tough projects and support roadblocks and trying to be more appreciative of the positives, while hoping things (and my mood) get better.

  
I want a career or a job that provides me with stability, room for growth in responsibility and compensation, and fair flexibility around my real life.

1cy75k1,Am I too old for medschool? What should I do?,"  
Hi, I'm a 19F and I need some advice about pursuing a career in medicine. Currently, I'm studying Computer Science at Tec de Monterrey in Mexico. I chose this major because of my interest in programming and fear of committing to med school at 17. However, after two years, I still dream of becoming a doctor. I feel like I will be unhappy if I don't pursue this dream. Now that I feel mature enough to start a career in medicine, I'm uncertain about the next steps. Here are my options:

1. **Leave my current degree and apply to my university's med school**:
   * **Pros**: I would finish med school in five years, starting in August 2024 and finishing by 2029. The program makes it relatively easy to do my residency in the US.
   * **Cons**: I would be abandoning my current major and the progress I've made in it.
2. **Finish my current degree and then apply to my university's med school**:
   * **Pros**: I would have two majors, which could provide financial stability through software engineering work and a backup plan if med school doesn't work out.
   * **Cons**: I would finish med school by 2031 and be 36 years old by the time I complete all my education. I aim to be a pediatric surgeon, which requires additional years of training.
3. **Finish my current degree, do one year of premed courses in the US, and then apply to med school**:
   * **Pros**: This would allow me to complete med school in the US.
   * **Cons**: Limited and competitive schools accept students with foreign degrees. I might feel like I wasted time if I don't get accepted.
4. **Transfer to a US college and follow the traditional path to med school**:
   * **Pros**: Most of my education would be in the US, potentially simplifying the process.
   * **Cons**: My transfer options are limited and might be to universities with a lower academic level compared to my current one.

**Additional context**:

* I am a US Citizen.
* My current college GPA is 3.78, and my high school GPA was 3.73.
* I'm involved in a student group promoting sex education for young people.
* I have family in the medical field (an uncle and cousin) who I could shadow for perspective.
* I plan on working in the US during the summer to save funds and build my resume.

1cy6jvy,What to do after graduating ?,"Hello all,

Yesterday, I graduated with a BS in data analytics.

Currently, I am working part time at a company I interned at last summer. I received a verbal return offer from this company in August, but I didn't actually get to return until late February.

Since I wasn't sure the return offer was ever going to come to fruition, I applied to a bunch of spring and summer internships and jobs. Yesterday, I received an offer for a summer internship for 30 hours a week at a pay rate of $17.50 (50 cents more than the minimum wage here) for an operations role within a school system.

Although the work I currently do is not directly what I studied, it is easygoing, and I like the people I get to work with. I have familiarized myself with the internal systems and used PowerBI and apps, along with Sharepoint, to complete projects.

I've done some software implementation and led a couple projects, but it hasn't been anything too complex. I would have loved to have interned or worked this winter in a role more focused on utilizing the skills I've developed in my academic career, but finding something was really tough, and I had no luck. I am making more than what I was as an intern at $22/hr vs. $19/hr, but I really want something more.

I'm only working 20 hours a week, and the outlook of being converted to full-time isn't looking too good. The budget is already set for this year, and my contract expires on September 30th, but there is a possibility of extension, but still at the same pay rate with the same hours. I would like the opportunity to work for both companies, as it'd look great on my resume, but I don't want to lose the position I currently hold, as it pays more than the internship and is more accessible. I also won't really be able to take advantage of both opportunities due to obvious time constraints. It also gives me the opportunity to focus on applying for full-time jobs more related to my desired field and still work here while giving myself sort of a mental break after school as it's only 20 hours a week. I appreciate any input on my situation.

 

Sorry for the long post, but I have been feeling anxious this year about the future. I couldn't enjoy graduation with this in the back of my mind. I appreciate any advice or words. Thank you.",Deep-Cardiologist622,3,1.0,0,1716400274,2024-05-22 17:51:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cy6jvy/what_to_do_after_graduating/,5,2024
1cy63sb,Having a backup plan at the same time of a career job,"Choosing a job

So I currently have two job opportunites. Job A seems super promising and looks to be more of an apprenticeship then a full role which I’m okay with while job B is good too. The guy I met has been advocating for me to work for him (Job A) and wants me to be part of his team. I already had the first interview and was invited to a second.

Both jobs are neither what I thought I might be doing but both pay great I’d say. Job A I still have to do all the interviews while Job B I got the job and they would like an answer soon. I told Job B I’d like to think about it as well as give my current my 2 weeks + Job B is commission only but the commission is great that’s it’s good but the hours are meh (8-8 with a break from 12-4) where as job A is start hourly + commission and if I’m very successful could be only commission.

This is my first time in this position so I want to ask is it wise to accept Job B knowing that I could say never mind in a few weeks - month when I’m being brought on to Job A??? My reasoning is if Job A falls through I still have B and vice versa. 

I do have another interview for Job C in which I did go to school for. It be salary and wouldn’t be making technically the same as the above 2.

1cy5zgp,"Feeling a bit lost, 39M ","I'm not sure if this is the best place for this one. My apologies, please remove if so. 

I'm 39 and have worked for the same company for 10 years now. I started this job after leaving retail and have made a wonderful career out of it. For the first 5 years I was dedicated to customer support. I started as a contact center agent, but quickly moved to a manager role and eventually Director where I led the global support team of 150+ people.   


The last 5 year I've worked heavily on the IT side of things, managing servers in AWS and Azure, SBC's, firewalls, couple PBX's etc. Migrated VMWare images to AWS, Datacenter moves, lift and shifts.  I've built and deployed Cloud Contact Center Solutions, CRM platforms, whatever is needed. I'm getting ready to roll out a new CRM solution for the organization as well. I have done all these things but when I go out to look for a role that would fit what I am currently doing I'm coming up short. I see that this is a similar feeling across all industries but especially IT.   
  
I'm worried that when the time comes that I am inevitably let go, I'm going to struggle finding something similar to what I'm doing now and pays similar mid 12x's. I do not have a degree but attended a vocational program in High School for Networking. I also hold several IT certifications. (A+, Network+, AWS Solutions Architect Associate). I'm located in Kansas City and have struggled finding IT/CS networking opportunities.

I swear to God, I take my work seeiously, I am diligent and do the best that I can, no doubt. But why does this keep happening to me? I feel like a clown. I do the best that I can all to make such simple dumb mistakes in the end and end up looking like an idiot. Is it anxiety and stress? is it the medication that I'm taking? is it the lack of sleep? is it just pure bad luck? I have no idea.
My boss still doesn't know about the mistake but he will tomorrow and I'll have to face him. With the first mistake I was on my vacation and I wasn't there to take his justifiable anger and when I came back to work he didn't give me a hard time, he was rather kind to me. But this time, he's gonna throw me out the window. I feel terrible, I don't know how I'll get through this. I haven't recovered yet from the humiliation of the first mistake and now I habe to face another. To top it all off, I cried today because it was too much to handle for me which made me look more pathetic than I am. I don't really care about how my coworkers will perceive me from now on, it's my boss that I'm worried about.
How do I face him? What do I say to him? Do I just stand there and say nothing?

I left a previous role at the end of September 2022 after about a year and half working there on good terms in order to pursue a different career. Unfortunately, that didn’t work out and since then, I have done some work in other roles but nothing that I have really enjoyed. My role at my previous company has never been filled and they are still looking for someone to fill the position. They’ve also lost an additional employee bringing the team down to 6 from 8 when I was there. I would love to reapply and go back but I have also just been retained for a pool of candidates for my dream job. The pool is for future anticipatory staffing needs and could take up to a year or more before I even hear back from them. I would really like to use the job I left as a reference for it when I do get a call so do you think reapplying now and then asking for a reference not too long after is a bad idea?

I feel like I’m being trained slow asf so I basically do meaningless projects (makes me feel like they can replace me easier) I’m constantly bored and tbh fuck them I miss work whenever I feel like it lol… of course most times I have genuine excuses. Well for months I’ve been asking my supervisor to give me a few more hours of work for extra money and she said they always reject that request. Well recently 2 girls quit and she went on vacation she planned for like 1 yr at advance so she asked me to come in early that week.. I thought I couldn’t do extra hours ,??? So I asked her again sure I’ll come in, in the future can u give me tops 2 extra hrs a week? And she said she’ll request it but she doesn’t think it’s possible. Well she left for vacation and then when I’m coming in early the top supervisor which is my supervisors, supervisor, tells me I can’t go over my hours bla bla blah I can only do 130 hours a month which if u do the math.. I work 29 hrs a week which is 116 hrs, which means I have 14 extra hr I can do so I can do like 2-3 hrs extra week .. well I talk to her and she’s like yea let’s set up a meeting for when she comes back from vacation to talk about it.. well the day comes and all of a sudden no they can’t give me those extra hours .. wtf is wrong with them? So new position for full time opens up and I applied and they made me go through an interview and everything just to turn around and say sorry position has been filled out by someone else.. idk I feel so unappreciated .

I was planning on going into academia because I enjoy writing and the thought of being a professor was really appealing (salary for 9 months of the year?? Sounds pretty good to me!). I have since been put off of academia. I don't want to sit in an ivory tower doing research while riding the dicks of my colleagues to get published. There are more PhDs that graduate than tenure track positions available each year. School is going out of fashion and less people are going to college.

I currently work as a research coordinator at a hospital and it sucks!! We do the work doctors are too busy to do for their research, which is often paperwork and data entry. We get paid like shit and work overtime (but I’m salary so I don’t get compensated for what I do). Many come to this job to prepare for med school or a PhD program. I have clinical experience (lots patient interaction, cognitive testing, blood draw certified, etc etc) and I think that I am a little smart (or at least smart enough to do very well in school and bs my way to this job lol). June marks a year of being here for me and I want to leave every day. I have no idea where to go though.

I make 40k/yr and I'm able to live on my own with roommates. I don't know of any other jobs I can do with a psych degree other than counseling/therapy. I am not opposed to going down that route, but I don't think l'm ready to be a therapist yet (too young, have a lot of stuff that I shave to sort out in therapy myself (and I feel like l'd be doing a disservice to my clients if I'm not mentally healthy myself)). The things that I've learned from this job are:

1. I cannot stay in an office all day (it sucks sooooo much)
2. My passion is people. Talking with the patients is the only thing that keeps me going at this job. I love the stories and genuinely just talking to people.

Firm believer in that my career is not my life, and it can just serve as a function to make money. If I find something I’m passionate about, great. If not, I’m ok with tolerating something so I can live the life I wanna live.

1. jobs involving months- or all year round work travels, where you get paid extra money for the inconvenience and housing is provided by the company. (few years of grinding enough to get a mortage and then back to a normal job).

2. A primary job and a lucrative side hustle. The primary job must have a good Work-Life-Balance, but instead of life, I'll have my side hustle. Ideally both of the same domain, in order not to spread my energy too thin.

3. Emigrate to a better paying country for a few years, save as mush as possible and come back.

1cy38zp,"If my Contract was not renewed, should I ask for a reference ect. ","Hi all. 
I graduated in 2023. I landed a job with an Americorps service position. 

 It was my first full time job serving my own home community. They decided not to move forward with a second year. My last day is May 31st. 

I have had wonderful experiences but also it was hard due to being the first person to work in such a position at my service site. 

Anyways that is besides the point. They decided to not renew my contract because of lack of communication. 

Policy is that I must notify them beforehand if I'm going to be late. I didn't notify until 3 days later. This is actually a second offense. The first offense was working from home without permission for a week.

That's policy I understand. I don't think it's necessary to give context since all it will sound like is that I'm giving excuses. It was my fault. I take responsibility. I'll just get down to my questions.

Question 1: Should I ask this Job's supervisor for a reference? She has seen me do many things for the organization and nominated me for an award. I just don't know if this is an appropriate request since she doesn't want my contract renewed. 

Question 2: is this considered a forced resignation or termination even though they want me to finish my contract time? My future job applications ask this question and I want to be honest but also not self incriminate myself because I tend to do this a lot because I hate lying but I say too much. 

Question 3: is it okay to reach out to my americorps coworkers about not coming back and my service site about not coming back? Or should I just keep to a small pool of people. My mom says tell nobody, it's nobody's business. I just feel like it's not proper especially since someone from service site team also left out of nowhere in the middle of the year leaving us all scrambling. Well I guess what's different from that is that my supervisor did send an email to the main people about my departure (I just don't know who) with assurance that someone new will take my place. 

Question 4: is it unprofessional to not attend the last day of training a.k.a a celebration training where all coworkers from other service site gather to celebrate and do final last things?  I asked permission not to so I do have the okay in that. 

Question 5: in light of question 4, if I don't attend, does this further make it even more inappropriate to ask for reference from my supervisor? 


Keep in mind, there are no personal differences or conflicts but I also don't have strong personal connections with them either. It's just me and my lack of timely communication but I have contributed a lot in the work of the organization which I'm proud of and grateful to have experienced.

1cy2qqe,How should I reach out to an existing connection in a company I will apply for?,"So a person that did an MSc with me 7 years ago works at a company that has a vacancy I will apply for. We were not close friends during the MSc and didn't remain in touch but no problems at all, the relationship was normal and friendly enough and it's no issue to text them now.

My only question is, how would I need to go about it to make the most out of the interaction?

If it were a close firend or a colleague with whom I worked closely I would just be like ""Hey, can you help me with this and maybe put a good word?"". But in this case asking directly for support seems a bit blatant and I need a different route.

if I had to bet, I would say that they don't do referrals. Just saying that I will apply there seems a bit unconsequential.

There are a couple of things that I could ask.

For example the vacancy description says the role of the line manager but not the name. I have my idea about who the actual person is, but could use this excuse to ask my contact if that's the case and if they have any insight/suggestion on that person.

Also I'm not sure about the level of seniority... the vacancy doesn't specify years of experience. I tick almost all boxes of the requirements but they can be ticked at various levels, so not sure if that's at my level really. Could maybe ask my contact if they have any insights on this aspect? The pay is considerably higher than mine but things don't really apply across contexts as we are talking of different countries, different types of organisations, different types of contracts etc.

Are the two inputs above good in your opinion? Got any other suggestion? Thanks!",jinalanasibu,1,1.0,1,1716391002,2024-05-22 15:16:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cy2qqe/how_should_i_reach_out_to_an_existing_connection/,5,2024
1cy2chi,How to approach a mentorship program I do not want to participate in,"I (33M) was selected to participate in a leadership mentoring program with my company.  This program paired me up with a Senior Director that I am to meet with on a monthly basis to discuss career goals and get help from the Senior Director to outline a pathway towards achieving my goals.  I was not asked if I wanted to participate in this program, I was simply told I was 1 of 10 in the company selected to participate.  I am fairly new to this fortune 100 company (2 years) in which time I have far exceed the goals and objectives given to me so it makes me believe the company recongizes the value I have brought to the company and they want to put me on a trajectory towards a leadership role.  In theory it all sounds well and good.  But, the only problem is....I dont want any of that.  

The last few months I have begun to fall out of the honeymoon phase and started looking behind the veil of the company.  If I am being honest, I have fallen out of love with the company and I do not believe in their ideology, culture, or view of the future.  I am keeping my eyes peeled for other opportunities but I am not in a rush to exit because if I can hold out a few more years I may have other opportunities that would put this career path behind me.  I have tried to think what my 5 year or 10 year career goals are or would be and I really cant think of anywhere I want to go.  Outside of this job, I started a small bussiness that is proving to be profitable but I am unable to expand it due to time commitments.  I have also built a real estate portfolio that is cash flowing around $3k/month as well as significant 401k/Roth investments.  I say all this because to me it feels like I am nearing the point where I no longer require this higher paying career path to live comfortably.  In 5 years I will likely be able to transition into my own endeavours but certainly by 10 years.  

This brings me back to the mentoring program.  The program was introduced to us and our mentor told us it was our responsibility to schedule time and develop a plan for what we wanted out of it.  I am now 3 months into this program and I have yet to schedule any time with my mentor.  Well, he went ahead and scheduled a meeting for this week and I really dont know how to approach this meeting.  I dont really know how to say ""My 5/10 year career goals are to leave the company"" without it sounding like ""I plan on quitting so this is a waste of time""",IxJAXZxI,1,1.0,3,1716390037,2024-05-22 15:00:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cy2chi/how_to_approach_a_mentorship_program_i_do_not/,5,2024

1cy16zm,What should I put on my CV,"So I 26M want to get back or at least start in the corporate/career world. So let me give you a bit of a backstory for proper comprehension. I did a bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science and got a 2:1. At the time I had done and passed 2 out of 13 papers required by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFOA) to become a fellow i.e. full actuary. However, at the time I was doing academic writing as a job i.e. freelancing or self-employed. I understand for many of you academic writing is a grey area or even illegal. But at the time I was making on average $1500- 2000 a month which was a lot in a developing country so I could not pass it up. This was between the ages of 21 to 25. 



During that time I only did a formal job for one month which was ""Business Development Consultant"" at a regional reputable company. Now here comes my problem I have no formal experience and at 26 I do not know what to do. My friend suggested that instead of having nothing for my CV I should say I worked for a company he and his friends created. The company in itself serves only to bid for and acquire tenders. While it is registered and even has a Facebook page I feel it is a major obstacle to future interviews as to how I can explain it. At the moment I am studying for the IFOA papers but I am also applying for actuarial/data analyst roles as part of becoming a fellow is to have around 2 to 3 years of experience. 





So my question is should I just put a blank space in my CV, say I was self-employed but the work I did was in a grey area maybe illegal, or continue saying I worked for this tender company.

1cy11ha,Is This Harassment or Am I Overreacting?,"I work for a very small company, there’s only four of us. The owner (66), the owner’s sister (70), myself (48 – female) and colleague (54 – female).

It is important to note there is no HR department.

I have been here 2.5 years. I do my job well and have been promoted a few times, both in title and salary. However, throughout my time here, I have been on the receiving end of some questionable behavior by my 54-female colleague. Most I have overlooked or set boundaries on, but there is a history of inappropriate behavior such as calling me at home after hours for personal reasons, being sexually explicit about her personal life, expecting me to participate in gossip (I sway the conversation back to work related topics), and wanting my attention for personal reasons when I’m bogged down in work. In general, she is an unhappy person and a bit of a bully to everyone. This has slowly worn on my mental health.

I believe I’ve reached my final straw, but I want a sounding board.

She’s always had a habit of looking me up and down or glancing at my chest. I do not dress provocatively and I do not wear jewelry such as necklaces that would be a distraction or give her cause to behave in this manner. For the most part I have let this go, as she has said rather superficial things about people and their appearance in the past.  There was an incident recently that I cannot let go of.

We were leaving for the day, and upon entering the elevator she stood across from me and began to look me up and down and up and down and obviously “check me out”. It made me feel so trapped and uncomfortable. We were the only ones on that elevator and all I could do was make small talk and try to get out of there and to my car as soon as possible.

I believe I am at my wits end with her and this behavior and I will be approaching the owner. I don’t think this is a case of “female appreciation” as when one woman will assess another’s outfit out of curiosity. If there were no other out-of-line behaviors I may consider that angle, but this feels completely out of line. I am so upset I don’t want to be in this office with her.

Thoughts? I also happen to be moving in a month, 100 miles from where I currently am. I have been given the option to work remote, however I feel I am at the end of my rope with this person. I want to give them notice and start anew.

I now have been given the opportunity to be a Program Manager of Policy at Amazon. The gist of it seems to be that I would create global and country by country benchmarks and policies, dig into the data for where we should expand the program and update program agreements as need be. Are these responsibilities typical for a Program Manager or is this really more of a Policy role titled as a Program Manager role?

1cy0sx2,Work/Life Balance ,"Hello 👋 

So I’ve (27F) been working at a hospital lab for almost 3 months now as a lab specimen processor. My probation period ends June 5th. I work 2nd shift, which is 3pm - 11:30 pm. 

Background: What’s complicated about my position is eventually I’ll be moving from the processing department, over to the hematology department since they don’t have a processor. I’ll be their first only processor. The hematology department is in the same floor and only a 1 min walk from the processing department where I currently work with all the other processors. Unlike my current coworkers in processing, I have an additional manager who is with hematology named Sara. 

Ok that was the background. My problem is this is the first time I’ve worked 2nd shift and I don’t like it. I’d rather either work the day shift or work 4, 10 hr shifts. I’ve expressed to my processing supervisor, Rachel, interest in her current open position to work 4, 10 hr shifts. But she told me that I was originally hired to work 3-11:30 and move on to hematology. But she told me she’d talk with my other manager, Sara, to figure out if working 4, 10’s is something Sara could arrange for hematology department. But it’s been a month since I’ve inquired about that, and everytime I check in they don’t give me an answer. I expressed to Rachel how working 2nd shift is affecting my work/life balance, and that have an extra day off by working 4, 10’s would help. 

Im wondering if I should wait to ask again until my probation is over June 5th. Or if I should email my HR recruiter and ask for her advice. But I’m worried it won’t be confidential. I’m also considering talking to Sara in person to have a heart to heart and ask if the 4, 10’s is something I could try out once I move to hematology on June 2nd. 

And advice is very much appreciated. I know my probation isn’t over yet, but work/life balance is something I’m trying to prioritize more in my life. Additionally, with new hours imposed on us (2:30-11 to now 3-11:30), Rachel did tell us she’d be open to us working 4,10’s but that was a month ago.

Currently on 110k. The team I’m working with is a global consulting company, and they’re a strong practice for what they’re doing (proper processes, very smart and talented people, highly corporate and professional). My team alone is 15 people. Work life balance is ok. Some late nights here and there but overall there are quiet periods where I can just cruise along. This company has a healthy pipeline and many large scale prestigeous projects.

I have an opportunity to move to a startup for slightly higher salary $135-$140k. This startup has just gone public and is in scaling phase. They have 500 employees already. But the team will only be 4 people. Two are very new. From the interview, they said the company is going through massive change managements, with lots of processes and acquisitions going on, and nothing has yet been streamlined. Sounds like a typical growing pain case. Scale wise, the customer base of this company is much less prestigious than my current company, and is mostly local.

My heart wants to go for the money, but scared that I don’t have anyone to fall back on when I fuck up. Plus, it looks like I'd have to figure things out as I go rather than learning from best practices. And the growing pain seems big.

• 2 years corporate work experience in the Microelectronics industry.

• I currently work in Germany (I’m American) but would be moving back to the USA to either continue my Quoting job or join Internal Sales.

• Fluent in both English and German

- maximize my career growth potential considering my lack of degree and young age

- maximize my salary 

- I am generally focused on self growth and betterment.

Considering all of the above points, which direction would you say has the most potential for growth and development? 

I have no doubt in myself and my ability to move into sales, as I handle rejection really well, am motivated, and generally do very well with people and resolving conflicts. 

But, it would be an entirely new experience for me, and I’m certain it would have more responsibilities and pressure than my current role.

I work in the cultural sector and it's my job to welcome people to museums, galleries and these places so they can have a nice and safe day out. I had to do two degrees to break into the sector. I'm 30 now and been working in the sector since 22. I've been in my current job for 3 months and it's same old 

It's mentally and physically exhausting.

I have to manage people and all the difficulties that come with that.

I have to deal with the public, often having to deal with awkward situations and conversations etc.

I will never be able to work from home.

It is the lowest paid branch of work that is available in the sector.

It is not seen as ""skilled work"" by colleagues from different teams.

Managers use people as much as they can and then people leave. Burnout is expected.

I clearly do not enjoy it anymore and have not for at least 2-3 years, however I am good at it.

My father-in-law has a joinery business that is flat out between the months of March-August; less busy in the winter months. He builds ponds and garden furniture.

He has asked me to join his business and wants to train me up as a joiner.

The idea of this really excites me, learning a hard skill that can be used to create things and make money from.

But do I leave a career that I've invested so much time and energy in? Do I leave a job after three months, risking that that will look bad on my CV forever? Do I stick out at least 6? Am I just in a sunk cost fallacy?

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

1cxwhbq,A coworker has made accusations against me in private messages to me and I am not sure best next steps?,"Everything I am about to stay is not a HR complaint but a coworker reaching out to me directly. I am not their manager but am senior to them in the team and I have been helping them with some work recently. 

  
The coworker has reached telling me they have ADHD and as a result make mistakes and strive for perfection and this causes them to take longer to do things. In addition they have told me they have dysphoria regarding criticism and thus can't take criticism. They have gone on to say criticising hteir work in public has significant effects on their mental health and that I shouldn't do this. In addition they have asked if I do critique their work in public I check I am right first.  

  
I have been professional and written a long message in which I say I don't want to upset them etc and they have accepted that, however, one thing I have asked for is specific examples which caused this upset with links to the comments I made. I have asked for this mainly because it has left me being shit and my brain is now wondering exactly which comments I made were the issues as I have spent hours going through them and can't find any I would deem issues so rather than me guessing I would like specifics. The only thing I can think is that they asked me to do some work and after starting it I realised this was not actually the correct work relative to the specifications of the task and so replied to his comment (in the public document) to ask them to provide the correct work. I have done this before with other individuals and not had any issue previously. 

  
Currently they have told me they can't think of any specific times but this is not the first time they have felt they are singled out or teased (in their original message they said their mental health condition makes them feel this way even if they arent). I have reiterated a request for this information with a couple of examples and they just haven't replied to me. 

  
I don't really know what to do next as to me these accusations are quite serious and close to bullying but since the individual is unable to actually come up with anything i t feels like they have just dumped on me and wanted me to just apologise whilst telling me I am doing things wrong rather than asking for evidence of wrongdoing. 

  
What should I do next as I feel a bit lost?",Laserpointer5000,0,0.5,22,1716371738,2024-05-22 09:55:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cxwhbq/a_coworker_has_made_accusations_against_me_in/,5,2024

When I joined my current team, I saw many development inefficiency, code smell, bad designs. I tried to point them out in pull request review(in neutral tone with pros/cons analysis), showcased some PoCs showing how things could be better, talk to some team members how they can improve.

But all of them do not seem to work. Most members, especially the seniors, insist they are fine with the current practices and conventions that was created a couple of years ago when the product was at its very early prototyping phase.

I feel like burnt out worrying about not only them, but also spending most of my time every day repeating the same educational, role-modeling code snippets, giving same improvement comments in PRs. Suddenly I realized my skill set stagnated at where I was 2yrs ago when I joined the team, but I was not lazy all the way within the last two yrs.

1cxw13a,From content writing to digital marketing ,"I am a freelance SEO writer active in the i-gaming and fintech sectors. I live in Italy but have several clients abroad and collaborate with very relevant and well-known entities in terms of number and size. Currently, I am completing a master's degree here in Italy in an unrelated field, so I still have time to evaluate and decide whether to change direction or stay in this field. However, I would like to work in the content creation, SEO, and digital marketing field, moving from a mere content creation position to a more strategic level, for example as a content manager. For instance, I see that many of the clients I work with are employed by companies abroad, sometimes remotely as content managers, often without specific training in economics/marketing. So, I was wondering if this is a viable path and, if so, how to access it; I exclude Italy from the start because in this field it almost exclusively offers unpaid work with ridiculous selection requirements (I have worked with Italians, and it is an experience I would not repeat).

1cxvagd,Asking for a raise during layoffs,"So, the question is quite simple. Is it stupid to ask for a raise during layoffs? I'm working in a job where the pay is very average. You don't need a lot of qualifications to do the job, and the turnover is quite high. Main task is being responsible for purchasing, i.e. being a ""corporate spender"". We are maybe 20 people total that all do this for different regions. Now in the last couple of months we got pushed hard to lower expenses as much as possible, and here is where I shined. I managed to lower costs with over 700k USD, which was the most in the whole department. When I raised the question about raises previously my manager just laughed it off saying it's part of the job to ""save money"". However, as time progress it's clear that I'm doing numbers that no one else is doing. This is also my first year, and I'm by far the youngest which I get to hear every day. I was ready to make my case and ask for a significant raise, but this week 3 friends got layed off in my team, and 100 other people in another department. Would it be dumb to still go through with asking for a raise? Should I wait?

TL;DR: I'm outperforming my colleagues and want a raise in a role where they are notorious for not giving high raises. Company is going through layoffs and I'm wondering if now is a stupid time to ask for a raise.

1cxv4if,Burnt out and unhappy,"University is making me miserable. For the past 3 years I've gone to school full-time while working part-time up until last year when offered a distribution engineering position.
My physical health and mental health has been on the decline as I'm feeling completely burnt out to the point I don't care about learning the material anymore.
Is it in my best interest to just grind out the last 25 credits of my EE degree part time at the  maximum course load I can handle per semester (I've found that to be 7) or should I drop down to one class a semester and focus on my health?
It’d push my graduation date back to 2027 if I went part time due to when they offer certain required classes. 


For further context: 
I have a good job in the electric utility world, making close to $100,000/year, I’m in my early 20’s, and I’m not in good physical shape anymore. I just want the degree so I can finally be a real engineer and earn more money.  I apologize for asking this (as I feel the answer is obvious, I'm just not in a very healthy mindset of late).

1cxv1bx,Academia in the US,"I’ve been mulling about my next steps in life for longer than I’d like to admit. 
To preface, I have ADHD and absolutely thrive on learning new things and digging deep to answer questions. 
I have two masters degrees and for the most part, I loved completing both. (Each degree competed almost entirely during COVID when most people were in lockdown, so I don’t feel as though I “wasted time” as many say regarding two masters)

I keep pulling away and getting drawn back into the thought of a PhD. I love the idea of spending much of my life doing research, teaching others, etc. 
however, every time I search the internet I find overwhelming commentary against PhDs, especially those centered in academia.
Basically, “don’t do it it’s worthless and you’ll have no where to go after it”. 

Everyone says “get an MBA” or something adjacent. But do we have any hope of a turnaround in the future? If everyone steers from PhD’s, academia, etc, and trends toward MBA like they have been… won’t it end up tipping the scale? Like all trends, will we eventually see a resurgence? 

I guess it’s just an effort to understand why there is such an immense push back on this field and if it will ever been in need again. For reference, I’d very likely be applying to neuroscience programs.

1cxrag7,Should I ask my boss for a transfer? I’m only 7 months into my job.,"To preface, I started this job around 7 months ago, in a part of the state where COL is very high for my wage. (My rent is $1300 a month, even having 3 roommates, and I make about $60k a year gross, slightly less). 

Training for this job was about 5 and a half months and I just hit the field about a month and a half ago. I have customers that I visit daily (not in sales, but I drive to accounts like a salesperson would). 

My family lives in a different part of the state and they are willing to let me move back home to save money. A coworker just quit and a job just opened up there in the same department (the exact same job I have now except my  customers would be different because of location). 

I was planning to ask my boss for a transfer after about a year with the job, but my lease is ending soon and unexpectedly, my coworker in that area quit. They already posted his job on our company website and if I wait too long and they hire, the opportunity will pass.

Is it too early to ask for a transfer or should I try? I really want to move as it would save me so much money and I would be close to family. However, I worry that if my boss says no, it would hurt our relationship and they would know I’ve been planning this. I would also have to establish relationships with a whole new set of accounts.

Hi! Im not sure if this is a good place to posy this but Im turning 26 years old this year and I really fumbled my time in uni. 
I didn’t have the right resources, had a hard time at home, worked super often almost 40+ hours a week, and was just overall immature with the way that I saw myself in college/didnt see myself ever going back since it was kind of pushed on me. So overall I had a really hard time doing averagely, so forget doing well. I also recently got diagnosed with ADHD so that might have been part of my struggling haha. 

I recently have been thinking about going back to get a degree and just overall move up and continue my studies. 
Mostly because Im having a hard time finding a job I like because of the job market, partially because it feels like Im meant to do more with my life. 
I always knew that pursuing a graduate degree would be really difficult because of my low GPA in undergrad (2.73) so now I’m looking for other options. 
Im in NY and double majored in Psych/Sociology and would ultimately hope to get a phD in clinical psychology or MD in psychiatry(which is a bit of a longshot and really I’m leading towards the earlier option). I would really love to be a school psychologist, work with adolescents in a clinical setting, do research, or be a professor someday. 
I dont have financial support so Im a little strapped for cash but will most likely suck it up and take out students loans like everyone else. 
I was thinking about getting a post bacc as a boost before a Masters especially since Im 98% sure I dont have the grades nor much experience in this field after graduating in 2021 to get into school. The only option for a post bacc program near me is Columbia and idk if thats an option financially/academically. Do I get another bachelors? Do I try to reach out and apply to all of the public university graduate programs near me with my 2.7 gpa and hope for the best? Give up lol? I even thought about going the public health route to end up in a psych based phd program but I dont even know Im just so stressed.

1cxqk61,Should i apply to a higher position even though i just got promoted ,"Back story:
I have worked for this company for over two years. When i joined, i was a sr manager of product, and recently been promoted to director of product. I reported to the CTO for most of that time as a sr manager until recently. During that time, i had resurrected a failing multi million dollar next gen platform (i was hired to do this for the tech side but also onboarded 4 new customers in addition), stabalized the legacy platform (which was in disarray after 2 major resignations), and helped the company exit the platform business, selling the tech for 7 figures. in addition, we had merged with another 2 companies, in which i trailblazed the creation of a technology function within the merged entity, figuring out truth from fiction and empowering the new hires/peer into their roles, and disempowering my bosses rivals. 
For that, i was provided a promotion to director, and a new boss shortly after (a fresh AVP).

Current situation:
Now theres a new AVP of Data position opening up, and I truly believe Im a super fit. however, ive only been promoted 2 months ago.  im director of half of the tech platforms that the data avp will need and my experience in how the data tech works in this position is superior than anyone at my company and i have a lot of experience from prior jobs. however, if i apply, it may signal to my CTO and new avp boss that i may not be happy in my current role , even though i am content (as i have already done the heavy lifting, its become a cushy job) but im a guy who likes challenges. 

if i apply, likely 2 of 3 peers that will be interviewing me in the 1st round will want me tl get the job, and i have a good chance with the 3rd. but its my CTO i cant seem to read (i suspect the avp position has a lot of politics around it and my Cto may want a older visionary type that shows credibility (knowing she now has a team that can  get the job done, however this position only opened up because the data execution was horrendous by the first team - not me/her involvement) if they want the job done with a solid vision and strategy, i know im that guy, but should i stick my neck out??

","Hi all, I'm 26, almost 27 years old, and I'm feeling miserable, thinking of suicide every single day. I just recently got my bachelor's degree in marketing at a no-name local regional state school called the College of New Jersey - TCNJ, and I honestly regret it. I have about $10,000 in debt, and I can't land a job or find a job anywhere making $70,000-$80,000 entry-level, like many of the Rutgers Business School graduates I've seen. According to the most recent statistics for their supply chain management and finance graduates or undergraduates, I shouldn't have to start with $40,000 or like $19 an hour when someone from a top school is going to easily make way more entry-level and then six figures to $100,000-$120,000 year 3 and $200,000 year 5 and $300,000 in 10 years with just a bachelor's degree. Like, when is my life going to finally be good and worth living? There are so many people my age in their 20s who are 24-26 who currently have everything - a bachelor's degree from a top school and six figures and marriage and daily sex every day and children and a nice big 5-bedroom house. When is that going to happen to me, and when am I going to finally have a good life to live? Seriously, all I have is student debt and credit card debt thanks to my awful asshole parents, my virginity still and loneliness, and bad acne. I have nothing to live for. I feel suicidal every day.

I got hired but ive seen sorta the red flags during the interview.,"Long story short I never done job hunting or know any professional ettiquette when goings to interviews. I applied for 66 jobs and got 5 interviews. And got hired at two shorty after starting at one. 

Im in a dilemma of leaving so soon when i just started.

I use to be a manager and hired people who worked for a week or two and left. Sure we wasted training dollars but we really need people on staff. So them leaving wasnt that bad.

I told the owner i got hired at another job. But was still able to work part time.

So im not sure how to go about saying its nice working with you this place isnt for me after a week working. 

My gut feeling says i dont belong but they need workers like crazy. 

Everyone tells me dont over think it you finally got a job after 3 weeks of searching. As ive always stick to a job and want to be the best.

I would prefer the internship at the company I am waiting to hear from, but do not want to wait too long to respond to the other company in accepting the offer. I emailed the recruiter yesterday in the afternoon around 2:30p just asking if there is any update, as I was supposed to hear by noon yesterday.

1cxp7i4,Colleague got promoted and making a lot of mistakes ,"One of my colleagues, who has been at my organization for longer than I have, was recently promoted to the same role I hold. The problem is, he makes a lot of mistakes. Like too many. He was already some of the tasks involved in this new role in his previous role. It’s a writing-heavy position, and he makes both basic (spelling, inconsistent formatting, random capitalizations???) errors and more substance-related ones. I’ve tried telling him softly that he needs to review his work, but it hasn’t really changed. The mistakes he makes are honestly astounding..basic writing principles and basic spelling!!! He’s college-educated and presents himself as somewhat of an intellectual! 

That was a long preface to my actual question: Should I bring this up with him again or bring it up with someone who’s above us in the chain of command but not necessarily our direct supervisor? His sloppy work is becoming a burden on me as I’m spending hours redoing his stuff. He was promoted to help ease the team’s workload but I keep thinking now that I’d be better off if I just did the projects by myself in the first place. This also means that I’m falling behind on other tasks because handholding him is so time consuming.

1cxp3ed,How do I get over feeling like I'm going to be fired at any moment?,"So without going into so much details this becomes unreadable. I was at my last company for almost 6 years. 5 years of all superb performance reviews, working well with people executing my functions well, etc. New management came in and everything flipped. Over 11 months, my team of 14 became a team of 7, half were fired, half quit (usually under a PIP), I was kind of in denial about what was going on, even when gaslighting started, then sure enough a few really torturous months later, I got a PIP citing extremely vague performance issues and setting an impossible month of work to complete to keep my job. I went to HR and proved a few of the performance issues were fabricated and they didn't care. Some of them made no logical sense because for them to be accurate a whole list of other people would have to be failing miserably at their own jobs, but it was clear it didn't matter. I got lucky and found a better job at a higher grade with higher pay, and took it before my PIP even expired. I found out not long after they had been directed to cut a specific number of people and they prioritized certain expertise that I happened to not have. They also were told to specifically favor cutting higher paid people which I was.

But I got out of there with a 32% salary increase and a better title. So good move, the problem is I think I was a bit traumatized by the whole thing. I felt so betrayed and gaslight by the whole thing, I looked people in the eyes and knew they were lying and they knew that I knew they were lying and it disturbed me. I know that comes off as naive, but it's true. 

My first performance review went very well, I'm well on the way to executing all my goals for the year, they just put me in charge of managing my own team last month, they talk about my future there all time. The say me and my team are working well together. All that stuff. Then recently I got my first constructive feedback. It wasn't even really that negative, just an ask that when preparing a certain product I make it more concise and frame it slightly different. My manager said the content was great, just wanted to make that adjustment. I think it was normal necessary feedback and yet after I logged off I felt like I was gonna get fired.

1cxowe8,[24M] Has anyone ever felt fraudulent and completely useless in their career?  ,"For reference: I’m an engineer that works on aerospace electrical systems, and I’ve been in this job for 2 years.

I’m currently on my first business trip to has out the design implementation for an initiative I’m supposedly a big part of. Day 1 was mostly my teammates and I getting acclimated and bonding. It went much better than I expected, since I’m usually a nervous wreck who rarely speaks. But I was able to be myself for once and actually felt apart of the team.

Then Day 2 comes (today), with the first round of technical discussions. Barely said a single word the entire day. My manager and I had an understanding this would largely be informative for me, but I still felt…gross. The technical/schedule discussions largely went over my head, then I was awkward at the happy hour afterwards since I’m so obviously not among my peers. Everyone involved is completely out of my league, actually. They’re all so well-spoken, intelligent, witty, and they understand the system on the same fundamental level (which likely helps with banter). I can barely write notes fast enough to keep up with their trains of thought. I feel embarrassed that I’ve wasted the company’s money coming out here, I’m completely inconsequential.

I’m only 2 years into my career, but it’s not like many of the major players are much further along (5-6 years). I’m starting to think I just don’t have the aptitude for this, or anything really.

I live in Central Pennsylvania. 

I feel pulled to make a change in career, as sales is not something I see myself in forever. I would like to pursue a rad tech career path and become an MRI tech. My fiancée is very supportive of my endeavor, and have plans to apply for the rad tech program at my local college in January 2025 to begin August 2025. I feel some fear about finances - both my partner and I make the same amount, and I understand that going back to school full time would require that we adjust to living on her salary + a PT job that I would pick up. Before diving into this, I wanted to get some opinions from those in the field: 

1. Is pursuing a career in rad tech worth it? Do you feel any regrets about the career path you chose?
2. I know this could vary by person, but what is your schedule? Do you have a successful work-life balance? 
3. What has your salary progression been during your time in rad-tech? Is my current salary in sales something that is realistic to achieve in rad-tech? 
4. Is there anything you would want a rad tech student to know/anything that you wish you knew before pursuing this career? 
5. Did you work whilst attending school? If so, what did you do?

I am not getting better at software engineering. 

I wasn't one of those students who got internships, recruiter DMs, and job offers in school. I just kind of kept to myself, focused on school and graduated with decent grades. Nothing amazing but nothing terrible. I have made maybe 1 or 2 personal projects of my own for things that seemed interesting or fun but that's about it.

Are benefits negotiable? This company has an IRA matching 3% but doesn't start until you've been there 2 years. Could I ask for it to start sooner?

Hours outlined are ""Monday- Friday 730am-530pm (can be negotiated)"". They mentioned the hours during the interview but after thinking about it over the weekend I don't want to work 5-10's. I get that's what the company needs and I've always thrown myself into my work and let it consume my life until I burn out. But I've come to a realization I don't want to do that anymore. I'd have a 40 minute drive each way to work. Would it be unreasonable to ask to work 4-10's leaving me the option to work Friday if I want to. Or to ask for a 9-5 so I can work a more sustainable 40 hour week.

So for some context, I recently graduated from my master's in Automotive Engineering and I am looking for a job in Europe.

1cxku40,What do you do if you keep wishing the most difficult careers? ,"I'm kind of frustrated right now, I'm doing a software engineering major, I work at a tech company as a developer and I don't hate my job by any means, it seems that I'm a good developer, at least that's what my mentor and collegues say to me, but something is off for me, I don't like it that much, just the analytical parts and that's all

The problem is that I'm a overanalyzer, I keep overthinking stuff and my brain has cached that info about being a developer, now I'm thinking about other possible careers, but the ones I seem to gravitate the most have a very difficult career path to say the least.

At first I thought about something like astronomy, I had some courses, it seemed that the psychics was not so boring as I remember at school, but then I started to look at the prospects of the career and it's pretty difficult to get a job as a researcher.

Then I thought I could pursue something like philosophy, it seemed interesting and I even studied as a hobby, the teaching aspect wasn't great but I really thought I could work it out, especially teaching something I loved and annoyed my friends talking non-stop about it, but it seemed that it was very difficult to evolve in the career, especially if you're thinking about being a university professor.

Finally I thought about writing, as in novel writing, or perhaps screen writing, which was something I liked, I like it so much, but then I started to search about career protects and I think is the worst of them all, with a very competitive market and it seems like very few people earn enough for a living if they're full-time writers.

1cxkgxn,What do you do when your manager won't stop calling and texting you?,"My job is remote and in media.

For context, everyone uses email for everything. It helps with paper trails, reminders and accountability for all parties. Sometimes there are email follow-ups after phone calls. We have meetings about work progress twice weekly. We also give updates as needed for problems or delays, usually by email. This is also how it worked when I was in university.

The transition has been frustrating since the previous manager recently left. The new manager says there are too many emails. For some reason, the solution has been to use four different modes of communication including phone calls almost every day and sometimes texts throughout the day. Twice-weekly updates are now every single day. Instead of discussing things during the meetings, they try to use outside time every time it seems. Why even have the meetings at this point?

It's more efficient to email and if it isn't broken, don't fix it. I'm already forgetting what we've discussed or when we discussed things because everything is all over the place.

In our line of work, quite frankly I don’t have time to spend all day getting random phone calls for non-urgent or repeated matters that can be emailed. No one at work communicates this much either, even through email. My partner, friends and family don't even contact me this much.

To top it off, I freelance; I'm not a regular full-time employee, but I'm treated like I am. The old manager, who claimed to sometimes do the same, didn't do so NEARLY as much as this. The old manager respected our time, worked with us to coordinate outside phone calls, called maybe once every two weeks, used emails (of course), and showed trust. It comes off like the new manager is micromanaging. It's also like they want to waste my time. They even sent a false lead to ""test"" me even though I've proven myself time and time again, something they acknowledge. This feels like a lack of trust and an ineffective use of time.

What especially bothered me was that I had an emergency the other day, and I was clear that I would be unavailable for a call but would try to accommodate their needs via any other medium. You already know what ended up happening despite this. This shows blatant disregard to me and the old manager was never like that.

My eye twitches whenever my devices go off and it's them. I've gotten to the point of making an iPhone focus on my phone specifically to mute them.

I was suggested to explain my grievances to the new manager, which could help me practice how to address future issues in my career, but I plan to jump ship before I even have to do that. I'm also worried about how I may come off.

1cxkglt,Wanting to transition from healthcare to tech or something similar?,"Hi! If anyone reads this I would be forever grateful. I work in healthcare, specifically mental health. I won't get into the nitty gritty, but I was wondering if anyone else out there comes from the same background and found themselves getting burnt out and successfully made the transition into something else. I've been thinking that I need to find a job that's more suited for someone who works better independently and enjoys working on detail oriented behind the scenes work. I have been working in mental healthcare (miraculously without a degree of any kind) for about 6-7 years now and I fear that I have pigeon-holed myself. Any advice is greatly appreciated!!

1cxk3fv,How to handle a strange post-interview process?,"Hi all, thanks in advance for the thoughts and advice.  
  
A little over five weeks ago, I had my final interview with a middle-market accounting firm. The interview process consisted of five interviews and a case study, all of which I received positive feedback on. The hiring manager indicated that an offer would be coming in the following two weeks from that final interview (the internal team round-up was two days after the final round and, once again, was positive feedback). Five weeks later, I feel strung along; every 3-4 days, I get an email from the hiring manager saying, ""Only a few more days,"" with nothing ever happening.  
  
I know I'm a strong candidate who received good feedback, so I'm a little confused and worried by these excessive delays. If anyone has advice on handling this somewhat gracefully, I would appreciate it. I will say that while I would like the role due to a fairly significant increase in comp and better hours, it is not the end of the world if I need to walk away, as I always have recruiters looking to talk.

I was thinking of doing trade or vocational school but unsure on what to study for. Any advice on high paying trade or certification that my security background would fit best?

1cxi9sf,"How to deal with people who intentionally steal credit or try to ""steal thunder""?","Hi, I have this guy at work that intentionally steals credit and often the spotlight. I do not know how to deal with him and I'm looking for advice.

I work in IT and most of my team works online. There are a lot of examples of the guy's thefts. But I'll share a fresh incident from today.

The guy was facing an issue during work and he talked about it in the group chat. I offered to help him but he declined my offer publically. Later he reached out to me in private messages and asked for help.

I took a few hours to figure things out and eventually solved the issue. I even explained the problem and solution to him.

He then proceeded to report the findings and resolution to the whole group in detail. But he did not mention my name. The message seemed to imply that he solved the problem.

Later he sent me a short ""thank you, I appreciate your help"" in private messages.

Now, I'm not greedy and I don't mind sharing credit from time to time. I love helping others but it's not practical to always do that. Our timesheets aren't too detailed and me helping him too often affects my perceived performance.

I don't know how to deal with him. If I ignore him, I'll be branded as a ""not a team player"" or ""not responsive"".

He does this with others too, not just me. He finds ways to add unnecessary input that makes him seem competent by nontechnical managers.

Honestly, I'm too frustrated with his BS. Is there a way for me to deal with him without making me seem like the bad guy?

1cxhwg4,Internship troubles,"I got a competitive internship this summer in the agriculture field at a large and well known greenhouse. It has been overall good but im struggling with a few things that make it an issues.

- It is a long way away, and i've had to move out to a closer relatives house to compensate with the commute. They offered housing but throughout the interview process couldn't get back to if i was allowed to take my cat until they offered the job and said I couldn't. Anyways, I still have to sometimes go back to the house I rent to be there for maintainence and other things. 
- Since I sometimes have to go back to the house I rent, I plan my week out. Some jobs I do require a start time an hour earlier than usual and when I asked my supervisor about the planned job and start time a week before, she told me it was rescheduled. Only to be approached a day before the job and told I needed to be there an hour earlier the next day. I replanned my whole week.
- I really thought I would be able to work in a greenhouse in 100+ degree heat, and it is far more than I expected, especially with 8 hours of soaking wet feet. 
- I have made the decision this is not where I want to be in agriculture at all, but I am supposed to be there until august. 
- Truthfully I think I may have bitten off more than I could chew with this position, and a lot of that may be my fault. I didn't expect so many commuting/scheduling issues, nor the work environment to be so intense given the climate I live in rarely gets above 85 degrees. It has been exhausting and that is largely my own fault.


Do I stick out three months of sleep deprivation, heat stress, and sudden rescheduling for a position I know I wont want to work in the future? Or do I stick with it because they will probably report back to my college advisor to say I quit early? 

TLDR: My internship has provided a much longer commute, with a much more intense work environment, and more difficult scheduling than I anticipated. I do not want to work in this area of agriculture. Do I stick this internship out or leave? ",General-Temporary683,1,1.0,0,1716323271,2024-05-21 20:27:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cxhwg4/internship_troubles/,5,2024
1cxhvom,Conflicted about giving two weeks notice…,"I was laid off in July ‘23 from my good paying fully remote job and ended up with a less than desirable position that’s hybrid and is a 2 hour round trip commute currently. 

The salary and commission at my current position has not lived up to the companies promises and overall the company just has a lot of red flags I have to deal with the backlash from. I do like most of my coworkers and manager though. 

I received my official offer letter with a new place that is fully remote and pays much better than my current job with a 6/10 start date. I submitted my background info and have a drug screen scheduled; I would not put notice in until this is complete. 

My commission is paid out at the end of the month and is a month in arrears, I will receive April’s at the end of this month on that paycheck. My concern is that if I give them notice that I am leaving they will make me leave that day and I won’t get my final commission check. It states on the commission outline that you must be employed on the PAID date of the commission. 

I also noticed that they will not pay out any PTO…but dock you for PTO used and not accrued (even though it shows the full amount on Jan 1 in the system). So I could potentially be docked 3-4 days of pay if I work out the full two weeks as well. 

I’ve never not worked out my full two weeks but I am just so mentally done with this place that I am considering putting in notice the day I get paid next week (as long as background check is done) and leaving there and then.

I question do I choose a job for the money or chase a job that ill enjoy and pay decently.  

I thought about probation officer since it revolved around law enforcement and also counceling and working with youth which I enjoyed when I worked before with them.

I know I dont want to be a teacher tho. Idk if si should go for my masters first , idk what to do.

I’ve been put in junior management with the team reporting directly to me and then I report to the very inept boss. The team knows that the boss is clueless so they come to me, the boss also then heaps me with work, for instance I do all the reports and presentations that they report further up. They do not even change a thing on the reports, they don’t allow me to take a leave since they don’t want to be ‘exposed’. In terms of support with tools of trade they do not offer those. There is no mentorship since they do not have knowledge nor the suitable qualifications to be handling such projects. They earn triple what I earn yet they know and do less than a third of the work.

She'll send a voice note or forward an email from the CEO, often requesting it within the hour if it's super urgent or by end of day. When I send it to her, she copy/pastes it, erases my email signature and sends it to the CEO. I suppose it's a manager thing, the problem is that I think the CEO would actually appreciate knowing that there's an employee doing this and not the manager, because someone in her office left (I believe the executive assistant) and since that spot has been vacant, the CEO has been inundated and the work is coming down to me through my manager. I am basically doing double duty during this vacancy period for no other reason than my manager has developed a closer relationship with the CEO than other departments and wants to redeem herself after a fallout with her a few years ago. My manager would lose it if I tried to make any steps to get close to the CEO, God forbid she knows I exist. It's more than handing her the work, once I do the work, she requests that I write the actual email for her. Down to the signature. She wants to copy/paste and doesn't add any input or give direction, I am leading her in a way. She trusts my persuasive writing skills more, I'm basically her ghostwriter.

1cxcbnb,Finding a better Career / Practice Area. AKA what else can I do with a JD,"I recently was fired from a law firm. It was my first legal job out of law school, and I worked there for five months. Despite feeling like I was making a lot of progress and understanding the niche practice area, apparently, the firm didn't think I was making progress and fired me. They seemed understanding, and all seemed to like me as a person, but I just don't think my work product was at a place where they wanted it.  
  
I already feel a huge amount of shame over it despite all the support from family and friends. So no need to remind me that I screwed up. I know.  
  
I am thinking about my next move and am not sure if I want to continue being a lawyer or if I need a different environment. I would love to get some advice from people on alternative things I can do with a law degree and jobs that will make me happy.  
  
I was not happy working at the firm. While the subject matter was fun and unique, I was constantly writing and submitting memos. Writing is not my strong suit. I suffer from petty bad dyslexia, and I think that was a major part of the problem. I know I will need to write in every job, but I am hoping to find one where it is less of an issue and where I'm not writing a dozen memos a week.  
  
It might have just been the environment, but it felt less like I was learning and more like I was being judged. I went into every meeting with the partner who managed me, thinking, ""okay this memos probably not perfect, but I'm gonna learn something, some tip or trick to make this memo and all my other memos better."" But the Partner really just seemed to tear it apart, give me little to no instruction, and get angry at me for not immediately understanding the subject area and his writing style, which was 100% the opposite of everything I learned in law school.  
  
I know this sounds like venting, but I'm trying to give a good image of what I was struggling with at this firm so I can find something different where I can enjoy life. I'm thinking of something like HR or contract management, but I'm not sure. I feel frustrated because it feels like you do all this work to get a job you don't really know if you'll enjoy because you're not allowed to try it until you invest all this time and money.

1cxc7z3,Leaving a job over mental health ,"So pretty much I had a job as a salesman for 5 years and left to go work at a cannabis grow facility. It was something I’ve always wanted to do or at least try. 

Anyways, I started here, went through a horrible breakup, and have been dealing with depression/anxiety issues. It became to the point that I took a PLOA indefinitely. I came back today and I just feel like I hate it here. It’s been 3 months. The only time I really liked it was in the beginning. I’m just miserable and in my head all day. The money is great and I have good insurance too, but I can always get put back on my parents for the time being. Luckily I do not have rent or any major bills and have some money saved up. 

I stopped smoking cannabis and I’m also on anti depressants now but I just feel like I really want to take some time off and get myself together. I feel horrible and embarrassed over it bc my new co worker family has visibly seen me go from a super happy dude to a miserable person. 

I want to just get an easy part time job maybe working at a local surf shop or something where I can talk to people and not be isolated in a grow facility. 

Am I crazy? I’m 25 yo with a bachelors degree in business and 5 years of insurance sales experience. I just feel like I need to take some time to sort myself out.

1cxc1nr,"Toyota Expert Technician , stay path to MDT, or jump careers now?","I'm at a bit of a cross-roads here.  Currently expert level Toyota MDT apprentice role. will still become MDT eventually, just need 18 more months of tenure. Already have the certs.

Heres the probem though, I make a modest 29/hr flat rate, but I am lucky to pull 70 hours a pay period, though I am physically here 90ish hours (7am-5am). Pair that with being in about 7k in debt for tools and I am starting to lose morale. I love working on cars, or machinery in general. But the inconsistent pay is endlessly stressful. 

When I become MDT, I get a pay bump, and access to more advanced work. This could easily grant me 6 figures if I really bust my ass (up to 37hr, 120-140hours)

Would you stick to this path? Maybe take a vacation to help with the loss of morale and get to working towards that MDT? 

OR...

**Jump careers**??? 

I am interested in tinkering with just about any machinery. Solar farms, BOATS, Air-planes, Factories, Buildings! ANYTHING where I can use my brain and my tools to produce results. 

How is the conversion from an experience Automotive Technician to other Technician roles? Would I be stuck starting from the beginning again? Would anything change having Toyota Master diag technician (highest technical level for automotive repair)

1cxbrma,I've Spiraled Into a Deep Depression Because of My College Major,"Hello everyone,

So I am about to enter my junior year of college where I will be on track to getting my degree in communications (yes I am aware that it is deemed useless). Many people have told me that this degree will get me nowhere, that I will forever struggle to find a job, and that I will make a shitty income with this degree and this has caused me to spiral into a deep depression so much so that I have been prescribed Zoloft because of it. 

Now, the reason I chose this degree was for one reason, I had no idea what I wanted to do in life, but I was forced to go to college and my academic advisor told me that this degree opens many doors for my future. However, I have read too many articles and seen too many posts on Reddit that say the complete opposite and now I spend all day thinking about those comments. I know that I shouldn't be spending a lot of time on Reddit as it is full of pretentious people or people that don't really have a clue what they are talking about but act as if they do, but it's too late. 

I feel terrible because a lot of my friends are going to school for finance, accounting, and engineering, some are even planning on becoming lawyers. My little brother, who has always been smarter than me and who has been told he will be way more successful than me, is planning on getting an economics degree and I am stuck with a degree that has been widely regarded as a terrible degree to pursue. So I have been lying about my degree choice when I get asked about it, I have told people I'm going in for marketing, business, and economics.

 Another thing is that the school I am transferring to is very strict on letting people switch majors this late into their college career so I have no choice but to get this degree. My parents have told me that they have connections with people who will help me find jobs, but I am afraid that I may not be interested in those jobs.

I know Reddit is the last place that I should be venting about my future, but I do not know what to do anymore. I am sorry for this long ass post, but I would appreciate people's two cents.",Scary_Growth,2,0.6299999952316284,14,1716308173,2024-05-21 16:16:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cxbrma/ive_spiraled_into_a_deep_depression_because_of_my/,5,2024

1cxa14m,Case 69: Masters vs Job ?,"Hey everyone,
 
I wanted to get some advice and opinions on my current situation. 

Here’s a bit about me: I have a total of 1.8 years of experience in the tech field. Here’s the breakdown:

1.3 years in .NET Core/Angular (current job)
6 months as a web developer (No Code)

I completed my Computer Science degree from a college in a 3-tier city. A 3rd class collage too 😂(yes i wasted collage years doing fun in lockdown😥. but the present is what matter right) Currently, I’m working at a small but established startup in Ahmedabad, Gujarat (probably 1 tier city). I’m 23 years old.
 
Lately, everyone around me has been talking about pursuing a master’s degree in CS. So here’s my simple question: Should I go for a master’s degree?
 
Here’s why I’m considering it:

1. My current salary is 3.6 LPA, but I could easily get up to 6 LPA if I switch jobs based on my skills.and the current offer I am holding are approx (5.25)

2. But a good product/service-based company wont give me 6LPA because of my bit less experience and not so popular current company so would have to settle for less salary.  

3. A friend who completed their master’s got placed with a 24 LPA package (10 LPA fixed + 14 LPA variables, stock options, rental, etc.). I know these are highlighted stories, but still, if there’s a chance, why not?

4. With the advancement of AI, many jobs will be replaced by highly skilled people. Backend developers like me might have less risk, but still, the job market is changing.

5. i am young and can take risk and can also afford paying high fees of private collage,

like if i dont do master’s i will have more experiance in backend, I could explore other options like Node.js or Laravel since the concepts are similar. I’ve worked with Node.js, and the logic is pretty much the same.
 
However, I’ve heard that  master’s is just 2 years of reliving your college years again, and I don’t want to waste my time. I don’t want to end up searching for a job after spending 2+ years on a master’s.
 
From my mentors, colleagues, and friends, I’ve heard that if you do a master’s, do it from NIT, IIT, or a top private college because they offer good placements.
 
But here’s my “mythology”: I believe experience in the field is more valuable than any degree.
 
So, what should I do? Continue with my current job and gain more experience, or pursue a master’s degree for higher education?
 
Looking forward to your thoughts and advice!
Thanks!

1cx9od2,Post Bacc Program or Industry Job after graduating,"I just wanted to field some opinions on some avenues I have. I just graduated with a BS in Chemistry btw with the hope of atleast getting a masters. 

First, the Post Bacc program I was accepted from the school I go to, it would be a two-year deal, which they have you take graduate school prep classes the first two semesters. The second semester (out of 6) you would start cycling through research labs and meeting PIs on various projects and get to know them. Then semesters 3-6 would be research only along with poster presentations and paper writing on the subject. This would be 45,000 a year with a housing stipend that pushes pay up to 52,000. Comes with health insurance and free public transportation. But the issue is the program announced it lost funding when I graduated so I started to apply for jobs, but only after sending a ton of apps out, they came back and said, we can get funding, just no formal offers as of writing this post.

Second, I have actually been getting a few interviews, I am going in for an interview for a Lab Research Tech at a big hospital for assisting with research in Mass Spec and the hospital has great
benefits. It does not pay as much starting out but I also believe this would be great experience for graduate school. Also I have gotten various offers to be just a general chemist for various small labs as well that pay anywhere from 45-55k. So I have options.

So was curious on what yall would do.

He even mentioned my name when he reiterated the point. He didn’t even articulate it differently or in a more elegant way, he was just restating it for emphasis. 

My other coworker then chimed in and said wow that’s a really good point you made, mentioned him by name and my manager then chimed in and said I didn’t think about that, you should add his point to the presentation. She immediately assigned credit to him. 

I could easily brush this off, in the grand scheme of life this doesn’t matter. But I just feel like I’m always trying to prove myself, going above and beyond. And I don’t want this to be a gender thing but I (female in tech) feel like I dont get treated the same way as men in tech. 

I’m just upset and venting. And there are productive ways to handle this, I just feel so defeated all the time in these environments.

1cx60qb,23 out of uni with a Bsc and realised I lack skills for any decent job.  Any advice?,"
I had an incident which has led me to a unique position where I ended a longer course a year earlier with only a bachelors. I had been revolving my life around completing my full course but due to family issues and burdens I was unable to finish it and have been looking at jobs ever since. I had been told by a friend to look into consulting but have no idea how to even approach that and had been working on learning Python and SQL in the attempt to get something in tech or as a data analyst only for AI to get to the point it is today. I have no idea what to look into or where to start. I have a temp job lined up after weeks of applying but I know I can’t rely solely on that. 

 I am still hoping I can finish my course since I have been told what happened to me was unfair but I know I can’t rely on that. I have basically no corporate experience and with a 2.2 I feel like I am limited to what jobs I can apply for when they all ask for a 2.1 and even then with no experience I have very little hope. I apply nevertheless. So any advice would be appreciated.

1cx5g5i,Struggling to Choose Between IT Specializations and Management,"I’ve been pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, which has extended into its 6th year primarily due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic and dealing with some backlogs. The pressure of exams and coursework has prevented me from exploring the practical aspects of IT and delving into the various fields within computer science. As a result, most of my knowledge is theoretical. Plus, I don't think I spent much time exploring my interests during those years because of some personal issues.

Recently, I started researching potential fields within IT that might interest me. Mobile app development, React, Data Science, and Machine Learning caught my eye. While these fields seem exciting and have significant potential for lucrative careers, I'm worried about a few things:

1. Genuine Interest vs. Monetary Motivation: I'm not sure if my interest in these areas is genuine or if I'm merely attracted to the financial prospects they offer. I'm afraid that I might invest time and effort into self-learning, only to regret it later if I don’t actually enjoy the work.

2. Market Saturation and Competitiveness: The IT job market is highly competitive. I'm concerned that unless I become really proficient, my chances of landing a good job might be slim. This adds to my hesitation about diving into these fields without a clear sense of passion.

Given these uncertainties, I'm contemplating whether I should continue in the IT field at all. An alternative path I’m considering is transitioning to management. I'm thinking about pursuing an MBA after completing my Bachelor's degree. However, I’m equally unsure if this would be the right move for me.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you decide whether to stick with your field or switch to something different? For those in the IT industry, how did you discover your genuine interests and navigate the competitive landscape?

Any advice or personal experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",Commercial-Ice8548,1,1.0,0,1716290458,2024-05-21 11:20:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cx5g5i/struggling_to_choose_between_it_specializations/,5,2024

1cx4wf0,Reputation ruined at company but promoted anyway. Not happy in current but easy role.,"Hello,

I work for a retail chain where I moved up fairly quickly. I moved to a location that was closer to my home and began working with a person that I got a little too close to. 

I should have always kept things professional, but we were soon spending a lot of time together outside of work. This person was cooking for me, making coffee for me at the office, flirting, lots of embraces when no one was around, randomly buying me gifts, making a lot of sexual comments at me, etc.

This relationship tip-toed into almost physical on several occasions, I just couldn't bring myself to go that far at work with fear of losing my job. I felt like I was trying to be seduced at work.

Eventually this person got into a relationship. I cooled things off and stopped giving them any attention or special treatment. Which I admit I was guilty of. They knew how to play me and they got a lot of attention and special treatment. Their behavior became very hot and cold with me.

One day in a ditch to save money, then company decides to slash hours. Easily cutting more than a 100 hours a week from each location. When this person found out, they put in their two week notice but not before disparaging me and ruining my reputation.

Another associate from a different store was working with them on that day. It took me a year to find out but my coworker told the other associate that I was ""being creepy"", giving them ""too much unwanted attention"", constantly ""buying them things"", ""stalking them"". My coworker had told a few other people in private that they were quitting because there wasn't anymore hours for them. This other store's associate was told that my coworker had to put in their notice and quit immediately cause they feared for their life around me, that I may attack or harm them. This is after me cutting all contact and communication and not seeing this person for several months due to our schedules no longer lining up. I hadn't talked to or even so much as texted this person for months. They conveniently left out all of their parts of the relationship to make things seem one-sided and they were a victim.

Now the other store's associate went back to their store and spread the gossip. It doesn't help that the other location has an immature older lady running the place that still believes she's in highschool. Now this older lady has spread gossip throughout the whole district that I'm creepy, I should be avoided etc. Despite this I've been promoted again. When I need to get coverage from another store, it's almost impossible because everyone has been warned to steer clear of me and my location.

I hate having this stain on my reputation, but I'm very conflicted. The job is decent pay and fairly easy. It's the kind of job you can work maybe 40% of your shift, and the rest is downtime watching TV etc. So in one sense it's very comfy. The benefits and location are also very good.

The one thing I really hate about the job is their hours. The operating hours are now middle of the day and that makes work life balance very difficult. It's one of those jobs where you don't have time to do anything early morning or at night when you get off work.

So do I keep the job and just try to ignore everything. No one from upper management or HR ever came to me with questions, which makes me thing they are just treating it as unfounded rumors and gossip. I honestly can't stand the immaturity of it though. People who I used to be really cool with have turned their backs on me, believing all the gossip and lies.

If I were to quit, I'd have to take a job with more physical labor and less pay, but there is a chance that I'd get better hours. I've worked so hard to achieve a lot at this company and it would suck to have to work my way back up from the bottom again.

TLDR: had a relationship with someone at work, they lied and used it as an excuse to be a victim, ruined my reputation and now I'm unhappy at work.

1cx4joh,Throw me some ideas!,"Hi All!

I'm at a bit of a standstill at the moment career wise and I'm looking for as many people as possible to tell me what they think I should do.

I'm currently a teaching assistant at a music college. I'm 21, I don't have a degree, only a level 4 (foundation degree) in music performance.
I'm not really happy in this job as I don't see any progression without further education and it's a pretty toxic work environment.

I have applied for University and had an unconditional offer to the one I would want to go to. I'd be studying BA(Hons) Popular Music and Recording, but to be honest I'm not sure I really want to go, mainly because of the debt and time I'd have to dedicate to it.

I've considered teaching primary school but that means studying for four years at university and I don't know if I want to make that commitment.

I've had a few daily jobs as a TV runner but I'm also aware that's a slow start and initially low pay, and if I want to go down that road I need something to tide me along.

I love anything creative; songwriting, drawing, writing, video creation etc, and have at least some kind of experience in all of them weather that's with a company or independently.

My personality type is INFP which might make sense to you after reading this.

Any suggestions, specific or general, would be greatly appreciated.

And anon Nurse B ( I know who it highly is, doesn’t like me doesn’t even work with me in recovery) also gave me a shitty review. And because of this my boss said I don’t qualify for a raise. Which honestly pissed me off since what they said I personally don’t agree with.

1cx20dv,New consulting analyst - should I have an exit plan? Help!,"I’ve been working a big 4 for 5 months as a graduate analyst in tech consulting, and I’m not really enjoying it because of the lack of work/good work.

My util is super low, and I’m concerned that any day I’ll be fired/come next year I will not be promoted – despite the fact that I’ve been told project allocation is not in my control. When I’m not on a project I message my manager and people in my team for work - which always comes up with nothing due to the bad economy right now, and it being pretty quiet in general.

When I am on a project, all I do is edit slides and grunt work with vague asks. I did a degree in Business Analysis, and I would love to have my first practical corporate experience in BA projects, and that way I can build specific skills and have a tangible exit plan. Right now it’s just general advisory and I have no clue where to go with that.

I guess what I’m saying is what should I do? Should I draft an exit plan (and what the hell would that look like considering I’m still out of uni with zero experience where the job market is rough + I haven’t even been at the big 4 for 1 year), or stick it out and wait the potential of being fired for ‘low performance’ (which is literally just my util rate which I can’t control!).

Would love advice as I’m spiralling a little bit – I feel very disheartened working hard throughout my degree, and everyone applauding me for this competitive job that I don’t love and may kick me out (which how awful that looks to employers).

I have been a call center agent for almost three years now, but I want to do something else now.  At the moment I have a preference for the company I work for because they have some pretty good benefits, but most jobs open in them are call center or programming or ""project manager (insert corporate jargon)"".

I currently have a bachelor's degree in psychology and have experience working with people from the homeless population.  I also have experience in graphic design and art.  Unfortunately I have huge gaps in my work and education experience due to bouts of mental illness or just struggling to find a job that works for me.  I had to wait until COVID came about to get a full-time paying job because the place where I worked was a COVID-19 related job at the time that was trying to get filled fast.    

At my call center job I have a knack for wanting to ask questions and dig a little deeper into what people need.  The current call center I work for is just re-routing people to the right number because our number is on a state health department website that is poorly designed.  Something I do enjoy from my job is hearing people's stories and just knowing what is out there and happening to people all over the state.  Sometimes I ask questions I don't need to because I want to know a little more about an issue that is popping up. 

I would like to work at home as a preference due to some issues I have with driving and ADHD.

1cwzzlg,Career advice: should I consider joining ISB? Would it be a right move during my entrepreneurial journey?,"I need some advice.

I’m currently pursuing an online MBA from upGrad (IMT + Liverpool John Moores University) I’ve almost completed the course (2-3 months left), but I'm not satisfied with the experience. I feel like I made a mistake choosing an online MBA. Now, I’m considering joining ISB’s PGP in Management course. Should I go for it?

Here’s a bit about my background:

I did my BTech in CSE with a specialization in UI/UX Design from a tier 2 college. During college, I was really into filmmaking and spent 80% of my time on it. I even planned to pursue a career in filmmaking. But in my third year, I discovered UI/UX Design and thought it could be a career I’d be passionate about.

I graduated around May 2021. In April 2021, two of my uncles passed away due to COVID-19, and my father had to manage the family business alone. Before this, I had never been involved in or even known much about the business. Suddenly, in May 2021, my father asked me to start working there, and my life turned upside down. All my dreams got put on hold. I used to hate going there.

Fast forward to today:

I’ve built an eCommerce website (selling law/tax/banking books) and am planning to launch an app. I started this accidental entrepreneurship journey in May 2022, and the website went live in January 2023. From January 2023 to March 2024, I did 48 lakhs in revenue through Google ads and organic search. (Is this good? I'd appreciate your thoughts.) I gained a lot of experience and did market testing (now preparing to launch an app).

But some things are bothering me / my core reasons to join ISB

1. No corporate experience (which I really wanted in college)
2. Working in a fast-paced environment with smart people
3. Quality learning and work culture
4. ⁠structured learning and skill enhancement 
5. ⁠personality transformation from a semi introvert who’s willing to learn and open to everything 
6. ⁠skills enhancement

1cwzqvk,Career advice?,"21f Hello reddit, I have been researching careers for a long time and I have yet to find anything I really feel like I could picture myself doing long-term. I'm willing to do the work and go to college but I'm hesitant to start and then get further lost not knowing what I want to do. (I'm not looking for people to tell me I should just start, I know I'll have to soon). I am mainly looking for career ideas. My dream job involves doing something important to help people while not having to sacrifice having a comfortable salary. I've worked in daycares and I loved researching and learning more about child development. Past careers I've been interested in pursuing but didn't for one reason or another have been speech therapist (I may still look into this), therapist, kindergarten teacher, child development research, travel photo journalist, war photographer, and journalist. I'm really just looking for any other similar or maybe even completely different career ideas.

Background: 24m; BS in biological sciences, worked 3 years in hospitals and fell out of love with healthcare toward the end. Really loved numbers though. Got a job in a lab at my states environmental department (worked ~7 months), got a promotion to working on permits and doing audits (worked ~1 year), recently got another promotion making 55k as a contract manager and doing project management (worked ~8 months). 

Question: what kind of MBA should I specialize in to get to a livable salary (~120-150k). 55k isn’t enough to support a family, and I recently had my first kid. I need to get my shit together. I don’t know if I should continue down contract management those salaries look to be around 100k or go into business analytics.

Should I make the move?","My title pretty much covers it. I'm going to try to keep this short and sweet because I've been pacing back and forth thinking about this for the past few hours and have yet to eat lol   
  
I've been with my team for about 5 years starting fresh out of college. I've had a lot of opportunities, and have really grown thanks to these people. I feel like there is a mutual appreciation between my team and I. Leaving feels almost like I'd be selling out.  
Because I tend to jump into extracurricular roles within the company, my name was thrown out somewhere for a position that just opened up starting from **75k - 90k**.  
  
Right now, I do a lot more web/print/motion graphic/and even double as a production assistant from time to time. It *IS* corporate so not every job is ''fun''. There might be a *fun* corporate Tshirt that needs to be designed or something.  
In this *new* role, I'd be mostly working in powerpoint creating presentations for the sales team, meeting with them and working with a lot of templates.  
  
I spoke with the hiring manager to get more information and they told me that they really want me on the team and that the position is mine if I apply even though there are two potential prospects that they've already got.

I came in making barely 40k 5 years ago..  
I feel like making a lateral financial decision is a smart move, but the work I'd be doing is so much more mundane. I'm struggling to make a confident call..   
Should I choose to be more bored and have significant financial stability *or* less bored, with more *fun* sprinkled in while trying to strategically pay bills without pulling from my dwindling savings account lol

This was my first semester not playing a sport as l'm out of eligibility. I have a few internships under my belt, but obviously no actual job experience because being a college athlete takes up a lot of time. I've been job hunting online for marketing jobs but in all honestly, I don't know what I want to do career wise. I run a social media account with a good amount of followers and make $1-2k per month from commission/partnerships/etc.
The problem is that my dad is extremely overbearing when it comes to what I should do with my life, always has been. He thinks I need to have a life plan/career path lined up already and that it's crazy that I don't know what I want to do with my life at 23. He also continuously tells me what jobs I should be applying for/what I need to do/send this not that/talk to so and so/etc. I would be fine working a few small jobs here and there to pay rent while I figure out what I want to do, but for some reason he thinks that's a terrible idea. I just don't want to be miserable where I work. I'm frustrated and lost. Am I crazy? Any advice helps.

1cwv5hw,When the perfect opportunity arrives but I’m not ready?,"When the perfect opportunity arrives but I’m not ready?

There is a really good opportunity that has come up which really aligns with my values and what I am currently interested in. It would be extremely valuable experience for me, I think it would give me a better idea of what I want to do with my life but I don’t want to apply because I feel like I’m not ready for a number of reasons. 

The biggest reason is I am struggling health wise and right now I have the opportunity to build that back up whilst spending my time trying out any new things. This is possible because I’m not currently working right now and getting a full time job would mean that I won’t be able to focus on myself like I planned to for the next few months. I quit my last job not too long ago because it was not for me and I really wanted some time out/career break (fyi this new job role would be a complete career change) 

Some other reasons include:
- don’t think I’d be a strong candidate right now so I want to spend more time to be more prepared for a role like this 

Am I stupid not to apply? I know logically it makes sense to apply and I don’t think I’d regret applying but I also feel like I’d be making the right choice not to apply. I would love to apply for this new job in a couple of months time when I’m mentally prepared and feel like I have myself the opportunity to do what I wanted whilst I am not in full time work. One thing to note is that this role is for a new start up and I realise that now would be the best time to apply if I was ready

1cwuysw,I'm going back to my old job. Is it the right move?,"I have been working for a prestigious company for two months now. The company has everything a modern IT specialist needs: a technology stack that is in demand in the labour market, remote work, the latest equipment, a friendly team, clearly defined work processes, and career development opportunities. But with each passing day, I was getting more and more depressed. I have a heavy workload, constant stress from adapting to remote work, constant fear (a feeling of complete isolation), and a premonition that I am about to be fired. It's also important that I was on the verge of total burnout from my previous job (I even lost my period!), mostly because I was combining university studies and work.

All these factors prompted me to call my old job and ask for my job back. My old employees were happy, but said I was making a big mistake. In general, all my friends were shouting that I was making a big mistake. The old company had lower salaries, low-level technology, strange performance evaluation metrics, heavy workload, management did not value people, the work was purely office-based with the possibility of remote work sometimes. I still enjoyed it, I had a lot of friends.

At the new job, they asked me to think about it until tomorrow because they liked me (but I have a feeling that their attitude towards me is already bad), and at the old job, everyone is already waiting. But am I doing the right thing? I'm afraid that depression will drag me down because of the remote work, but is it worth working for a worse company because of this?

1cwuexn,What career to pursue? How to choose among many!!!,"A big thank in avance to everyone who read this long help request.

I am in my late 20's and i've been stuck for a few years now trying to find what I want to do in my life.

I have already graduated and got my computer science degree. A year and a half before graduating I knew that I didn't wanted to get a job related to that (software and web development mainly) even though there were things I enjoyed (like web design) but at the same time I started to hate them. At the beggining I was really good at it until I wasn't (I guess I didn't put enough effort to it) and I felt really frustrated, I'm guessing that's probably the reason that made me hate every part of it.

Since then i've been looking for a career that I actually get to love or enjoy enough. Many have gotten my attention. First it was graphic design, then translator and interpreter, then photography. Currently I'm interested in data analytics and nutrition, and now considering web design or front-end development again, thinking maybe when I was studying I didn't like it because I just didn't give my best.

I have taken a lot of tests to find a career that suits my personality, insterest, etc.
Most of those results say I am IRC or RIC or ICR on the holland code, or suggest me careers with one always present or at the top: computer science (or related). This has been really frustraiting for me because I've been looking for another one! But this tests suggest the one I already studied.
Another kind of test says I am an INFJ (I know this is a personality test but still). Many people don't believe in this, I just have to say it's been pretty accurate, and the careers suggested (Nutrition, one that I'm interested in) for someone with this personality are completely different from the ones in the other tests.

I've been thinking (OVERTHINKING) about this a lot, I'm lost, I'm stressed, frustrated and I feel anxious. Right now I'm struggling to decide between Nutrition or any other career such as data analytics or web development.

I love languages but I think they could remain just as a hobby, just like photography.

I really like graphic design, I'm constantly using my computer and the time flies when designing any personal thing or for others. The truth is that not many people value this job. Maybe I could do something with it, I just don't think I would study this in a university. Maybe I could mix my interest for graphic design with the suggestions of all of this tests, front-end development, but I'm not sure given the past. This could only be possible if i get a job remotely because to get a job where I have to be present would mean to move to another city, the nearest to where I am from, and living there is a nightmare.

About Nutrition I really like to know about food, what it contains, how good it does to us or how could it harm our health. I like that I could provide the knowledge to help others. Listening to other people ideas about nutrition, eating, etc., I realize that we know almost nothing about it and how important it is. One way or another I would like to learn about Nutrition, I just don't know if I would like to make it a career. Choosing this would mean graduating in my early 30's.

I want a meaningful profession, something that is important, valued, it is important to me to feel that I'm doing something that matters, a job that gives the chance to have a life and not to feel tied up or suffocated. But how can I know which one will I actually feel the most satisfaction with? How can I choose just one having so many interests?

I appreciate any honest advice.",Sweet-Thinker,4,1.0,7,1716249798,2024-05-21 00:03:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cwuexn/what_career_to_pursue_how_to_choose_among_many/,5,2024

1cwt8p8,Unfriendly and very direct coworker,"So I've been working in this company for more than a year, and since my day one, I never liked the vibes coming from one of the members of my team.

Being new, I always told myself that I should get used to some stuff, and maybe it's to be expected in the culture of my team. This person didn't cross any red line or anything, but let's just say that I avoid asking him questions as much as I can, avoid the topics he is working on and don't want to be involved in stuff together with him.

Now after one year, I can say that it's not just me. He is indeed unapproachable by the other coworkers in the company and he had a few arguments in different ones because of his way of communication. Let's say he is not really at fault every time and he has a point in some cases, but he doesn't give his feedback professionally and sticks to bad sarcasm and harsh critic on public channels through messages. 

Once, there was an interview to recruit a senior for the team.. once he noticed that this senior is not up for the task and lacks knowledge, he just left the meeting... no feedback, no nothing...

It's a shame because our team is shrinking and the atmosphere used to be good, but with his quarrels and with the 'diplomatic' ones leaving the team, I feel some stress knowing that I will be stuck with someone with such behavior. Other people in the company stopped using the public channel for questions and support and reaching out to me privately as well as the other polite persons in the team, because they are afraid they will get discouraging answers. 

I'm also more comfortable with asking other people rather than him.

I wonder how I should go about that. ",Brilliant_Share_1918,1,1.0,0,1716246493,2024-05-20 23:08:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cwt8p8/unfriendly_and_very_direct_coworker/,5,2024

And potentially no salary raises in the future because of how it’s structured unless everyone else in the company also gets an increase. I felt so at ease with the team and it really is calling me in terms of my moral alignment, passions, and more.

Opinions on whether I should consider leaving my higher paying job for the ideal role and organization? My partner and I would like to eventually save for a house and we live in a VHCOL area. 

It feels like going for higher paying jobs are soul sucking and I need to give up my humanity and morals to do so.

1cwso83,"Could use some career options with my background, help!","I am more of an inventive/creative personality, but I have a physics BS and about 210 college credits from prerequisites in other areas (mostly sciences, chemistry, biology). I applied to PA school but uncertain if I will get in, or its even the best fit.

What are other paths I can look to long term? I generally work quite hard and really dive into things. Ive done a variety of things up to this point, but honestly I just wasn't familiar with the career world at all. If I could do it again I would probably try for dental/medical school/PhD. Unfortunately college profs/career advising wasn't helpful, and honestly I just hit every landmine out there.

Now at middle aged I am out of time, and need a long term viable and a stable pathway, with true advancement potential. Ahhhh HELP!

  
  


Willing to consider all options (and money helps). Any advice is appreciated.

1cwrqve,Any advice for a young professional?,"What’s up everybody. I’m 26F trying to work my way up the ladder. Struggling with an impending decision and looking for any / all perspectives. 

Currently have been with a company for over 2 years that is struggling financially. I have been working to get promoted for the past few months but answers regarding my status to move up have been pretty vague. I have a great team, amazing boss who advocates for me, but the higher ups are not giving me answers when I’ve been already working way outside of my job description/scope with NO compensation. 

I’ve been interviewing for a company that would give me around a 40% salary increase, but it would be a lateral move (title wouldn’t be changing, and it seems like an entry level position with some tasks that are a bit of a step backwards professionally). The money is enticing and I think I could really make a name for myself at this company that clearly can afford to value me and help me grow. 

My current boss wants me to stick out the next month or so to see if a promotion comes through (it would have to by end of June). But the answer could still be no and I’d be missing out on this opportunity for a huge pay increase and likely a lifestyle change for the better. 

I’ve been working hard at my current company, love the work that I do, and would really like to leave with a promotion. It’s been a long time coming. 

Would you stay and wait out to hear about the potential promotion? Or make a lateral move career wise for more money? I’ve been in the work force for 5 years, I feel I deserve a promotion but also need to accept when a company doesn’t value me.

1cwrd7e,Job field that I like vs. field that will provide financial security,"I graduated college a couple years ago (Computer Science degree) and have been working as a software engineer until recently.  To be frank, it sucked.  My self-worth was completely shot, I felt stupid all the time, and I was incredibly anxious every day.  (\[Trigger warning suicidal thoughts\] basically since I knew I'd have to work for decades more, I started thinking about how if I was going to feel so terrible every workday I might as well not continue on.)  I was bounced around between a lot of different managers and got conflicting feedback about how to get better at my job, so it's probably not surprising that I wasn't the strongest engineer on the team.  I ended up getting laid off a few months ago.

While looking for a new full time job, I got a part time job at a bakery/cafe.  This was partially for financial reasons and partly because when I was a kid I dreamed of having a bakery, and wanted to see if it was something I still want to do.  I serve customers a couple days a week and bake one day a week.  The customer interactions are okay - there are nice people as well as scum.  But baking is amazing.  In general I'm having way more fun at work now, and I like knowing that people actually appreciate what I'm doing, even if it's gone in a couple minutes after they eat/drink it.  I could see myself being happy switching to full time at this cafe or getting a job where I'd be able to bake all the time.

The problem is I don't know if I'd be screwing my future self over by not earning software money.  I imagine if I was a full time baker I wouldn't be able to retire (or own a home, etc).  I don't really know what a future looks like for someone in the food industry.  No one in my family has done this kind of work, and the people at the cafe are around my age or still in college (the exception being the owner who's pretty well off and seems to open local businesses as a hobby).  I know a lot of people work their whole career in food, but would they think I'm an idiot for giving up on a software career?  Any suggestions for how to weigh my options?  Am I overlooking anything?

  
**TLDR:**  Had a terrible time as a software engineer, got let go, and now am having a good time working in a bakery.  Would it be a mistake to fully switch fields?  What should I be considering?

I really needed a job so I entered a Call Center, I was promoted and worked there for about a year.

Then I got a job offering for a Human Resources position, I though I could start a career there and since, I've been a HR executive.

Even then, I'm always looking for job offerings as a teacher or psychologist but it's been hard. 

2 years later, while I respect HR, I'ts not what makes me happy. As a psychologyst I've always wanted to help people, and it's definetly something you can do in HR, unfortunately, in my country the work laws are all over the place and HR serves a shield for the company's heads more than a department that actually helps the employees. Also, I'm doing 10 hour shifts 6 days a week and I live like 2 hours away from the office, so no time to invest on personal projects now that I do have a license. 

Recently I got a job offering as a customer service rep for a booking company, work from home, decent salary, great hours. Maybe I could use all the spare time to really invest time, effort and money in providing therapy independently and get that satisfaction I've been looking for.  
But what if it doesn't work? Will I always be stuck as an HR or Customer servies exec since that's all the experience I have? 

It sucks man. If anyone has been on a similar situation, it would really help to know if t worked out for you.

And I know I'm really lucky to even been able to find a job, I know it could be a lot worse. I'm just not feeling all that well atm.

1cwkd5e,Looking Young in Workplace,"Today my co worker (a 60ish year old man) told me that clients/other people in our company have referred to me as “the high school intern”. 
I am turning 27 in a couple of days. I am pretty short (5’2”) and people do often tell me that I look young, but I don’t think I look that young. Sometimes people say that to me in the office and I feel like it’s not a compliment to be told that I look like a teenager. 
I dress and act professionally, I have a master’s degree, I have worked at this company for 5 years and I am good at my job. I felt pretty confident until he made that comment. 
I do find that I can be a pushover/laugh it off and I don’t know how to stand up for myself when people say that to me, or when clients assume I’m an intern. Does anyone have advice for a polite and professional way to respond to this that is also direct?

1cwjzwc,"Legalities of Claiming to Fire an Employee, Transfers Them to Another Store (CO)","I do hope this is a question that is acceptable here? I am not completely sure and would appreciate it if I could be directed to a better spot for this if not.

So this happened some time ago, few months at most when I had quit my previous job at a fast food joint. I recently heard from a contact I still have at that store claiming one employee who sexually harassed and assaulted a few of the employees was not fired as management claimed. The day I put my 2 weeks notice, the main manager at that store had stated the employee had been fired under the evidence of sexual harassment and assault, as the management claims they were digging up evidence of such actions on shift.

The issue with this, said employee lives with one of the managers and is favored by said manager. I found it odd when I was told the management was collecting evidence yet “fired” on spot the day I put my notice in. About less than a month ago I got the news that employee was transferred a town or so over to another store, while management claims to anyone at my old location that he had been fired. 

There are several labor and safety laws, child labor laws especially being violated by the GM of this particular location that is bound to fall apart eventually, I wish to get into that some day if anyone is interested, as no legal repercussions or measures are being taken into account since most of the employees have started to quit. If anyone could help me find the legalities of this issues I would appreciate it.",Fehlor_404,1,1.0,1,1716223199,2024-05-20 16:39:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cwjzwc/legalities_of_claiming_to_fire_an_employee/,5,2024

1cwil40,Need career change advice.,"I've been in the automotive field specifically, the collision side for right at 20 years as an estimator.  The wages are actually falling & I've yet to find any employer outside this field that will hire me that will pay a livable wage.  Wages have been basically the same for the last 10 years with twice as much work to do now that most insurance companies have gone virtual.  The techs get hefty raises & are treated like royalty when there's an equal estimator shortage.  I'm trying to raise kids & everybody knows the economy is awful.

I've tried to get on the insurance (auto adjuster) side but they keep telling me no because of no insurance experience or no degree.  I've been looking for months with no luck.  I've always been able to look for a few days & get a good paying job no problem but it appears those days are over because of this crappy job market.

1cwi50u,Would you leave a full time role for a contract to hire role? ,"
Hello all! Hoping to get some advice on a career change situation. I am going to be interviewing sometime in the next couple of weeks for a contract to hire position at a company that I used to work as a contractor for. When I contracted there before, I ended up leaving because I couldn’t get hired on (not contract to hire role then though). Currently, I am working in a permanent role but the position I am interviewing for would come with roughly an $8k pay raise, which is about a 15% bump for me. Here are the pros and cons I’ve come up with:

Pros of potential new role:
- Salary boost
- Hybrid (I love this this bc I have dogs and an autoimmune disease)
- same type of work I did before so it should be easy to get back into
- I have a degree in this field so I could potentially move up 
- new environment (current one is a little toxic, although I do have friends and my bf here)

Cons of new role:
- 5 day work week (currently work 4)
- would be contracting again (at least a little while)
- not a huge fan of the office location (commute will be worse than current)
- currently working as engineer which could be more money in the future - however I don’t have a degree in engineering so I’m not sure about advancement opportunities.
- promotions/pay raises at current company are happening in 1-2 months (don’t know if I’d get one or not though) 

So what do you think? Would I miss the 4 day work week terribly? And one thing I’m ignorant on, could a recruiter lie about a job being contract to hire if it’s actually just a temporary role? 

Thanks for any advice! ",honey-badger-14,2,1.0,6,1716218436,2024-05-20 15:20:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cwi50u/would_you_leave_a_full_time_role_for_a_contract/,5,2024

1cwhbpf,Career break at 29 - good idea?,"I graduated as a doctor 6 years ago and have since had a couple of career changes. Did the doctoring thing for 3 years before moving into tech (first research, then project management) for which I am very well paid. I’ve felt low level burnout the whole time but it’s really coming to a head. 

I have been lucky enough to get on the London property ladder (bought with a family member) so have a guaranteed place to stay, but I’ve been thinking of taking a year off to really assess what I want out of life and my career - something I’ve not really done before. I do have an offer for an MSc (Public Health) which I initially intended to do part time alongside working, but the idea of being a full time student is increasingly attractive. I have enough cash to fund my life for the year (and can pick up hospital shifts to supplement this), but i am concerned that time away will set me back and re-entry into the current job market might be extremely difficult.

the current tech team is very small with it only being myself and 2 other people. they have plans of hiring a few more people this year. i'm currently still sharpening my frontend skills, however i've found myself not doing a lot of javascript/framework tasks at this company. just a lot of building email templates (in an editor), adding/updating pages on their site (wordpress editor with some html/css) and just small tech related tasks that aren't exactly coding. i was working on a project that heavily involved javascript but it's currently somewhat on the backburner for now. so i did do some coding projects in the past but it's been a while.

they have plans to grow and incorporate more technology into the company, so my boss says that they will need help building certain tools and such that will require a lot of coding. they are also planning on hiring a senior developer.

idk i guess i wish that i would be doing a lot more coding then im doing now? so even though i know that things will pick up soon but i'm feeling kind of useless.

the salary also isn't the greatest (65k, jobs in nyc, i live in nj), so now i'm wondering if i should start applying to jobs next year that are more tech focused or that has an established tech team? too soon?

i feel really bad thinking this since my boss and everyone at my job is really nice.

1cwg43l,How do you figure out a career path when everything you've tried so far has failed?,"Hey, reddit. I guess this is an extended version of the 'how do you know what career/job to pursue' question. How do you do this when you've worked insanely hard at your plan A and plan B and both of them have failed, how do you then reassess how to live your life and build a future? 

I'm 30F and I finished my PhD in english literature a year ago (in the UK). I've been running a module in my department but the contract isn't getting renewed, I failed to get a postdoc, and there are literally no jobs in my field. I've been searching all year, there's nothing and that's unlikely to change in the near future. I'm not alone in this, I know academia is awful for jobs especially in humanities, but that doesn't stop it hurting. I'm not in a position to keep doing part time teaching work for another year without anything else to help me cover it and I don't really understand how anyone pays rent on these kinds of contracts on their own tbh. I could work part time at something else but then how do you find time to do research, apply for postdocs? And if you don't do those things you'd never get a job so how does this work?? Maybe other people can just do or achieve more than me, but if so how? I've got a decent publication record, I've got funding awards, I've not done as much networking as I should because I struggle severely with anxiety and social anxiety, but in theory I'm not awful at this - just not good enough? I'm feeling pretty lost and devastated but I'm also just searching for practical ways forward. People talk about choosing to leave academia but how is it a choice when there are no jobs? What else can I do?

While doing my PhD I also wrote three novels which I submitted to literary agents and publishers. The last of these was actually good, I know it was, it won a competition, I got good feedback. But it's not getting picked up, I'm starting to have to face that. I know it's insane to try and make a living off of writing fantasy books and I wasn't planning on it, but at least getting SOMEWHERE with that career path would have given me hope. I'm not going to stop writing and trying because I do this because I love it more than anything else, but it's not like it's going to help me out practically.

So I don't know what else to do. I had some dreams, I worked hard and got pretty far with them, but now they've kind of failed. I don't know what else to do with my life, I don't know what other career paths make any sense to even start. I tried teaching before my PhD and hated it. I worked in a publishing company for a little bit but I'm scared I won't get into that industry again and if I do what if it's the wrong call? All the advice I see is to think about my skills and passions and make career decisions from there, but what do you do if you've tried that, twice (admittedly in very competitive fields but still), and actually it just didn't work out? I feel old to be starting another entry level thing and doing another degree isn't exactly an option. I'm trying not to feel like a failure but currently I'm looking at moving back with my parents in a month's time and I just don't get what I'm doing wrong. Would honestly appreciate some advice, hard or soft at this point.",zai94,4,1.0,2,1716213122,2024-05-20 13:52:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cwg43l/how_do_you_figure_out_a_career_path_when/,5,2024

While my job is “stable”, pretty flexable and pays decent, I work in a hostile work environment and dont really possess marketable-high income skills; Im a custodian. 

My goal is to eventually develop and acquire self sustaining businesses over time. At this time, I have two affordable businesses with low competition and what I believe will fulfill some demands where I am. I’d like to move forward on them and have access to capital to do so, but I cant help but feel concerned about my lack of marketable skills to fall back on if they fail. I’ve decided that sales would be the best route for my overall objectives but it will require me taking a pay cut, less stability and I’d assume some years before I can make a move on business opportunities. I also know that there can be a big reward on the end of it for my future.

My question: Did some of you just dive in using your dead-end job to fund the dream and end up with marketable skills anyways (found a decent job afterward) or did you take the time to learn some high income skills first?

1cwf9b9,Help with career/education decision,"Help with a career/education decision

Hello, I’m struggling to make a decision if you can help me please:

Background: 
I’m 26 living in the US and I recently got accepted into an Erasmus MBA program (but not the scholarship) in Europe. I applied to the MBA in Europe because I wanted to travel while studying business as I think it would help me with creating my own company (marketing agency). My biggest life goal is to see as much of the world as possible and reach financial freedom.

Speaking of which, i’m currently at a corporate finance job which has warned us of incoming layoffs start of 2025, so definitely no future here, plus it’s not even a job I enjoy. 
But I have been inconsistently freelancing in design/marketing at the same time as a side gig which i enjoy and I’ve been thinking of transitioning into an agency.

Decision:
1)do the MBA in Europe which starts this September and travel when & as much as possible, however this would be very costly with the 18month program being $15k, and averaging living expenses at $1k/m so about $35k together for 18months, not including any other travel trips when possible. This means having to dip into saving which I really don’t want to do. 

However an accredited MBA (3 degrees from 3 European universities) would be very valuable in terms of what I would learn which I can apply to my agency. I have considered doing my agency at the same time as the degree but I don’t know how much time I will have or how soon I can make money from the agency consistently. 

OR

2) Stay at my job until I can start & get my agency to replace my income at about 5k/month. Then do a digital nomad type thing where I can travel while working/making money, not using savings.

My Reasoning:
I think #2 is more sensible since I would be making money while traveling accomplishing my two big life goals simultaneously, but the income/consistency from the agency is not guaranteed. I guess maybe finding a ‘work from anywhere’ remote job would be a backup if it doesn’t work out, I hear the job market is brutal now so I’m fearing that if it comes to it.

Because of so many unknowns It’s hard for me to make a decision (such as value, ROI, and use of MBA, how much free time I will have, European education system, uncertainty about agency success, consistency & profits, career change/job market).

If you picked #2 then would you recommend applying at other jobs now instead of waiting for the agency to take off, given 2025 coming layoffs?

What do you think? 

Thank you for your time.",mysticdarkspot,2,1.0,0,1716210767,2024-05-20 13:12:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cwf9b9/help_with_careereducation_decision/,5,2024
1cweq4y,"I did related tasks but under a different title, how do I leverage this?","I graduated in 2020 with a degree in BS Information Systems. In my home country I did 1 year as a Projects Coordinator and 1 year as a Business Analyst, both at different tech startups. I want to apply to UI/UX designer or Product Manager roles. 

For both roles, here’s what I did that are UX related:
* Requirements gathering, talking to stakeholders and clients. 
* Writing the feature specification docs
* Writing test cases
* Working closely with devs 
* Writing Information Architecture and User Flows. I’ve made database diagrams too. 


and project management related tasks too like maintaining product backlog, holding sprints (yeah my old PMs noticed im very organized and put work on me whenever possible). 


In my home country I couldn’t break into UI/UX because they still feel like UI/UX is just UI for graphic design grads and UX is for Business Analysts. I wanted a real UI/UX job so I moved to Canada and I’m taking a design program to work on design skills. 


Now with so much competition I’m a bit at a loss. I know I can do a good job but I feel like because I don’t have ‘UI/UX’ or ‘Product Designer’ on my CV, I might not even get past the screening.

1cw9508,What is a good career for someone who experiences audio processing disorder and dsylexia? ,"I'm asking because we'll...I've had unpleasant experiences working. 
Basically I did retail and every time it ended bad. Meaning I had a diffcult time problem solving with very angry customers and I always had to go to the manager or another staff member to problem solve it. I notice myself would get highly anxious when a customer would get furious. I also had diffculttly handing out money and made a few mistakes at the beginning but then eventually got the hang of it and was okay. However the managers would get frustrated at me unable to learn quickly enough and would threat at me I will lose my job, which would end in tears. 

I did try to do 2D animation a course I did. However I always got confused with the number system and always asked friends to help me but they ended up got frustrated at me. Also hearing the sounds of flipping pages when people were animating annoyed the crap out of me. 

I did try to do acting! I ended up sadly with a abusive toxic drama teacher, confirm by my therapist that told me they were abusive. Pretty much the drama teacher told me I was ""low middle class"" the way I spoke. Also told me when I did a short film with the teacher that I was responsible setting tone on set and it was my fault why the crew were distracted. He also question my religious beliefs which was werid because we were suppose to talk about drama. At the end I stopped going, I would end up leaving class in tears. 

I thought to work at a libraby because my mum worked there and I thought ""yeah I be safe, I won't lose my job here"". 
I did shelving first and then I got involved helping out with kids events say Chinese New Year and made over 60 masks of the year of the Sheep one year. I also go involed with Halloween event and design the games and make the decorations etc. 
However!!! yet again it went down hill. 
I was working to becoming a Libraian assistant, at the time their was this manager we will name them Annie and she understood about my learning diffculties and that it would take me time to learn but I would eventually get it. Though when she retired it all went to hell! new manager was unaware about my learning diffculties. I was accused by staff putting books away wrongly. 
Also when I hand out change to the customers I was just dollar short, and the whole staff freak out like I had covid. And it eventually ended up some gossip session and went to team leader. I ended up doing compute program we all had to do for the libraby and I failed at that. The teacher told the manager I was incapable and my mother wasn't in the know until a friend at work told her.
I wasn't told this and found out through my mum. My mum told me how the new manager told my mum I should work at some clothes shop. Which hurt hearing this 
I was then gonna be ""WATCH"" by the new manager behind the desk serving customers, I was so afarid and scared I will fail. I went to my mum in her office crying and she just went up to me and told me angrily ""your not to suppose to cry here. I fear you to go to the manager and resigned from your position and say don't ask questions"". I did that what my mum told me to do. After that I couldn't go to the libraby and shelve I felt so hurt and felt people were watching me. I ended up just not working anymore. 


I did try to do art class online through a friend and we'll sadly I ended up doing everything. And my friend didn't do anything and I had to pull out and I wasn't being paid for it, since my friend at the time seem obsessed with doing it for free. 

I'm now lost and depressed not sure what to do for my career. I haven't worked for 8 years due to my mental health and having therapy. Now I feel aimless and not sure what is point in life when you don't have direction. 

My skills pretty much is Art. 
I do portraits. Pencil and traditional oil. 
I like to do illustrations and cartoons and I do that digitally. 
More than one therapist told me I'm empathic so I guess that is a skill. 
Usually I get people tell me their problems just randomly, and people who worked for years didn't have a clue what was going on for that person. 
and I like to make stories. 
I have a strong visual memory and imagation as well. 

So I'm not sure what to do. I'm just so afarid if I do something again that I will fail. It almost feels like some werid curse.

I'm a software engineer team lead at an AI company. I've been with the company for one year, managing a team of five engineers.  
About four months ago, the sales team proposed a new product to meet their business goals and attract new contracts. The CEO, a former software engineer, directly instructed our product manager that the engineering team needed to develop a marketable product within two weeks, citing that ChatGPT could write code. It was surprising to hear this from the CEO, who then criticized us for not utilizing ChatGPT for development and suggested that engineers like us were outdated.  
Despite feeling blamed, I worked with our product manager to create a demo and potential solutions. When we informed the team about the two-week deadline for a new feature, they were unwilling to commit their time. They felt the product manager and I should have managed the CEO's expectations better and avoided unrealistic projects.  
Since it was a direct request from the CEO, the product manager and I had no choice but to comply. After days of hard work, we finally produced a demo.

they have plans to grow and incorporate more technology into the company, so my boss says that they will need help building certain tools and such that will require a lot of coding. they are also planning on hiring a senior developer.

the salary also isn't the greatest (65k, jobs in nyc, i live in nj), so now i'm wondering if i should start applying to jobs next year that are more tech focused or that has an established tech team? too soon?

1cw79kq,24 M | Australia | Best Career Path in my Position for Job Securtiy/Stability,"Hey All,

I'm just after some advice regarding my current course of actions to take in my current situation regarding my career.

  
**About me**

I'm:

* 24 years old
* Have a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science at UNSW
* Have 2-3 years experience as a Software Engineer working at 2 startups
* Am currently unemployed (been so for around 3 weeks)



As I'm currently unemployed (I resigned due to the toxicity of my previous workplace), I've been contemplating my career path.

Through this, I've been looking more into whether Software Engineering/Development is still a good career path for me.

Things I've been considering about my current career and the longevity:

* The looming threat of AI either taking my job in the future, or significantly reducing the demand due to each developer being way more capable
* All the tech layoffs
* The insane interview process of software engineers (i.e: 5+ interviews of Leetcode questions, system design questions, behavioural questions, etc..) and the fact that I absolutely despise this (and interviewing always giving me a lot of anxiety), as it doesn't really reflect to a recruiter your actual ability to build software
* The natural volatility of tech

  


In my time off, I've considered the following paths and would like some advice on what anybody else thinks, or any other suggestions

  
**Option 1: Go back to Uni and complete a degree in a specialised Engineering (i.e: Electrical)**

With my Computer Science degree, I had initially began doing civil engineering. I had taken quite a few of the core engineering courses in the 1st and 2nd year, and then had eventually transferred to Computer Science. 

This would allow me to get some credit towards my Engineering degree and take a little bit of time off of the degree length.

I would more than likely specifically do Electrical Engineering, as I'm quite interested in renewable energy, etc. I'm also pretty sure that the jobs for electrical engineers are generally pretty stable for the future and pay reasonably well (correct me if I'm wrong).



**Option 2: Begin an apprenticeship trade to become an Electrician**

Throughout uni, I worked as an electrical assistant for around 2 years casually and enjoyed it. A few people in my family are working electricians and they all seem to enjoy the job as well as make good money, and they always have a job/can easily get one. I also really envy the fact that they're able to actually help people first hand and also be able to work jobs on the weekend/on the side for cash.

I also note that the demand in Australia for trades only seems to be getting greater.

I know doing an apprenticeship will take 4 years and apprentices get treated like shit, but I don't think that deters me from this option.



**Option 3: Continue as a Software Engineer**

This would involve me just continuing to find another job (Im not pressured by anything financially at the moment which is good) , and stay as a software dev/eng. I would also potentially consider doing a Masters degree part-time in something like data science or AI in an attempt to keep myself competitive in the future job market (although not 100% on that)



If anyone could maybe give some insights into what you think I should consider doing, that would be greatly appreciated!

I feel this knowledge could potentially catapult me further into this company and career path, but I'm just not quite sure of how to do it. Did I shoot myself in the foot taking a position maybe a bit lower then what I am worth? Should I continue a search for a job that utilizes my clearance? Or should I just continue to put my nose to the grindstone at this company to try and stand out to move upwards in this company as quickly as possible? All insight appreciated.

He's doing a fantastic job leading our team but he really struggles to give positive feedback. I will go weeks or months without hearing anything positive about my work or skills. He genuinely tries though - sometimes he remembers and will make a weirdly heartfelt comment like ""I just want you to know that I'm really proud of you"", but it comes across as very forced and is awkward.

Anyway, I have a lot of social anxiety and quite honestly, spend a lot of therapy sessions just discussing this with my therapist. I really like my job, company, and team lead but the stress this causes me is huge. I'm working really hard to just work through it because navigating that situation is a life skill I need to develop. I just don't really know what to do.

I have really solid benefits that I'm losing and need to figure out what I need to consider around health insurance + any other things I may not be considering in this swap.  
\--  
Additional Context:  
So long story short. I am very happy with the opportunity I have. I am making a career switch from sales to product manager in a 4000 employee company. I was making 150k before I swapped to this job 8 months ago (QOL decision).  
It took a ridiculous amount of networking and stepping way out of my lane to get the position, and the specific role I'm getting is not something that existed in the company. They're taking a risk on me and don't have the, I'm not sure the proper term for it, but 'corporate headcount' to take me on as an employee till January.  
I was making $74k salary + benefits before and will now be making $60/hr with 40 hours guaranteed (explained as $120k yearly target assuming 50 week in a full year worked) and was told that I can work overtime. Jan would be 135K plus full benefits.  
I have really solid benefits that I am losing, but I do feel like this is a good move for me.  
I have an S-corp LLC that I worked under for 6 years prior, so I have that for taxes and am meeting with my accountant Monday for tax planning. I also have a second LLC partnership that I suspect will make an extra $10k this year from.  
I have a $2500/month mortgage, but I also could float myself for at least a year with no wages, with all my expenses, if it came to that, so I can take the risk.  
The VPs I've been talking to are talking to HR about some options of potentially keeping benefits, but I'm not confident. The job offer came Friday, with HR formalities I won't start officially until Thursday.  
The company is a really good culture, the CEO forewent 2020 salary along with all management down the chain taking 75%-25% pay cut to prevent layoffs. So let's assume there are not intentionally malicious intentions. As a side note, when I first started the conversation 3 weeks ago, they were planning on bringing me on as a BSA, which I was open to, but after a presentation I did I surprisingly got offered the PdM role.

1cw23eq,Career Switch: EnvE to CS,"Hello,

I’m currently a water/wastewater process engineer at an environmental consulting firm in the US with under two years of experience. I graduated with a master’s in environmental engineering in ‘23 from a highly reputed institute the US.  I am currently on OPT and transitioning into STEM-OPT (Optional Practical Training) this year. My work at the consulting firm is very mundane and administrative, and I feel unmotivated for various reasons. I’ve certainly lost the passion since the work is very different from what I imagined myself doing. The work has been more of a political game, focused on business and relationship understanding rather than on engineering implementation itself. Additionally, I’ve always been scrutinized under the timesheet game (which we all know sucks), and the company’s resource organization has been poor in providing me with relevant work. It also feels like a very long hierarchy corporate game rather than focusing on the ‘environmental’ aspect itself.

I currently apply ML/AI skills to water research projects at the company and possess programming skills to apply data visualization techniques. I’ve always been inspired by new technologies, products, and AI revolutionary innovations, and I want to be in this fast-moving forefront industry. Additionally, my current work isn’t monetarily rewarding considering the efforts I put in.

Question: What’s the best way to switch to a CS-related career given that I’m still waiting on my H1B VISA and my F1 Student VISA expires within ~2 years? Would pursuing a second master’s with a major in CS be a good option? I’d like to also remain in the US for its hot tech market.

The job offer is Contingent upon passing a Live Scan criminal background check, a **review, verification, and clearance of my prior work history**, and clearance of a pre-employment medical examination. *After* turning in my **background check/livescan form**, I double-checked my start date for one of my past employments and discovered that I had mistakenly written my start date as 09/2019 rather than 10/2020. This mistake is **also reflected on my resume**, due to the fact that when I was writing up my resume I accidentally based it off the first time I communicated with my manager (at my previous job) which was in 09/2019, rather than double-checking my actual start date of 10/2020. This is 100% my own clerical mistake; however, I understand that since the hospital will be evaluating my work history, this discrepancy may lead to a ""red flag"" on my report. Also, I have not received an actual report yet, I am just expecting issues and would like to be proactive on my end.

I’m currently really nervous and a little guilty because I know in order to get this new job I will need to put in my two weeks at my current one. I’m scared of angering these people who have been nothing but nice to me and have put a lot of time and money into training and hiring me. How am I supposed to do this?

1cvyi0y,Is my supervisor trying to set me up?,"So my new supervisor recently got promoted into his position. So I presume he’s on probation and is trying to make a good impression. However he appears to be super risk adverse, which I partly understand. Some examples below:

I was granted unofficial 3 hours of leave prior to him becoming a supervisor for completing a project. When I inquired about it once he onboarded, he said let me ask my supervisor for clarification. He then came back and said this is not something we do, so just take the leave but don’t tell anyone. Strange but ok. I decided to not take it. 

I wanted to leave early one day because I was experiencing some serious back pain. He told me to text him on his personal phone. Ok? I suppose communication is communication. 

We were all required to be in attendance for an offsite meeting. He told me my time starts when I begin my commute and ends when I arrive home. This was nice to hear. At the meeting I told my team members how great this was and they all looked at me with a blank stare and said they were never told this. So I couple of my days were 10 hours. He approved it so I presume i’m in the clear?

Lastly there is no paper trail. It’s all verbal or on personal devices. Do you suggest I begin sending emails to cover my ass? I’m on probation as well fyi lol.

1cvx56t,Propose counter-offer or leave company (and boomerang back) if things don't go as planned?,"Hey all, wanted to get input about this conundrum I'm facing. I'm a software engineer who has received an external offer that would increase my compensation by almost 80%. It's a huge difference. However, if I accept this offer, I would lose some of the perks from my current job, such as good work life balance, relatively chill workloads, and great teammates. 

I'm fairly confident that my current employer would extend a counter-offer to retain me if I told them I'm leaving. I'm sure they won't match the external offer, but I might get a \~40% increase. I'll probably be ok sacrificing the rest, again because of the current perks I have. Also, I know people usually recommend to never accept a counter offer because it makes you more likely to be laid off later, but in my case, I don't think this would happen given the fact that my skillset is highly specific and technical, and it would be very difficult to replace and just hire someone different instead.

So, should I consider a counter-offer even if it less than what the external company offers **OR** simply leave the company, try things at the new one, and if things don't pan out, just boomerang back to my current company and negotiate a higher salary. Seems like this is a fairly common thing.

I work at a small startup (<3 employees) in the UK and have a booked holiday coming up (which was approved in January) in the next 2 weeks.

My boss is the type of person to set unrealistic deadlines, delay tasks regularly, add new tasks at the last minute and overload me with work the week before I go on any type of holiday (even working until 10pm the day before or on the weekend until very late in the evening).

I am worried that he will say that if I do not finish the work I will have to work during my holiday (which he said to me the last time I went on holiday).

I am not planning on taking my laptop on holiday and would appreciate it if anybody has any ideas on how I can respectfully refuse to decline working on holiday if my boss insists.

1cvu6kt,Corporate to trades. Too old to become an electrician?,"As the title says, am I (33M) too old to become an electrician (or get into some trade)?

Some background: I started my career out as an auto technician out of trade school at 19. I did that for about 5 years, but I thought I wanted to do something in an office instead, so during that time I went back for my bachelors in business administration. Since then I’ve gotten an MBA and worked my way into what I do now, which is somewhat of a dev/project manager building reports using SQL/tableau. Currently I’m making $112k annually (which isn’t bad for my area) but my mental health has really taken a hit from the lack of structure, impossible deadlines, and limited social interaction (100% WFH gig).

Looking back, I miss how structured and straightforward being a tech was. The physical aspect of it, problem solving, etc. But I can’t tell if I’m just remembering the good times and I should just shut up and keep doing what I’m doing, since I’m sure in some folk’s eyes, I’ve got it made. 

I’m also supporting a family now as the primary breadwinner, so a huge pay cut isn’t exactly an option. 

Feels like an impossible situation. What should I do?

TLDR: Went from trades to corporate, make decent money for the area I live in, but at the cost of my mental/physical health. Supporting a family now, but feel like I need a career change for my happiness.

1cvtveb,Contracting agency client wants me to convert to FTE at a pay cut,"I have worked for a company for several years now hourly through a contracting company. The client recently made an offer amounting to a substantial pay cut when including overtime. 

I raised this point during my discussion about the offer, and the response was a garbled mess of different reasons why it didn't matter. ""We can't afford to be as generous now. Well we will just trade OT hours for banked PTO. We will just manage your shifts better"".

This is partially my own doing. I agreed to forgo submitting OT several times voluntarily when it made sense. Partially I was trying to help them out. Also, I didn't mind taking some vacation time.  However, regarding his ""manage your shift better,"" I am unwilling to trade nights and weekends for random afternoons off during the week. I am not a shift worker. I work in IT and run the show in my area of responsibility, but I suspect my direct manager has passed several initiatives I pushed for off as his own.

I have also turned away many recruiters over the past couple of years because the offers were in the same range that this company offered me. Other offers I received closer to my average annual income I didn't pursue due to being content with my hourly arrangement.

Do you have any advice on how to correct their expectations without coming across as threatening? Their offer is about 25k less than Glassdoor estimates for my job title, area, and level of experience. I am not sure what they are thinking.

1cvttsu,Looking to further my prospects (in consulting) - what are my options?,"Hi everyone. I (24F) have spent the last 2 months working at a large consulting agency as a Graduate ESG Consultant. Before this, I graduated from London College of Fashion where I studied BA Creative Direction for Fashion and worked in several strategy and sales related roles before graduating last summer. 

I'm currently on a very low salary - coming to £28,000 a year - and really want to look into advancing my career prospects. I studied A Level Economics, History and Politics but unfortunately didn't do very well in my exams due to personal reasons so I don't really feel like I have much of a leg to stand on.

I want to be successful while doing something I feel somewhat fulfilled by and think consulting would be the best career for me to continue pursuing in that respect. Having said that, I get the feeling having little academic success or knowledge outside of the fashion industry will eventually leave me at a disadvantage considering my colleagues have been to Oxbridge/Russel Group universities and are very, very bright.

What are my options for getting myself up to par with my colleagues, to enhance my prospects as a consultant and to generally become smarter and a better critical thinker? Would it be retaking my A Levels or doing another undergraduate degree in economics, finance or business? Would it be doing an MBA or masters degree related to the aforementioned subjects (I mention these subjects because their combination of economic theory and quantitative analysis is applicable to a lot of the work I currently do)? Is there anything I can do in my free time aside from reading articles and watching the news?

If anyone has any pointed advice they could give me I would really appreciate it. I feel quite lost at the moment and really regret squandering away my secondary education and prospects of doing a better degree because I feel like I've put myself at a disadvantage, and I really want to turn this around.

1cvtqxa,Should I pursue a promo?,"I'm currently in a finance leadership role at a company with two distinct brands within our division. We have a division president who oversees both brands and focuses more attention on brand A and there is a division manager role that oversees brand B and reports to the division president. The division mananger role for brand B is currently vacant as the former person in that role was let go about 6 months ago (I speculate due to some of his own shortcomings but also due to the underperformance of that brand). My direct boss (the division president), recently retired and has been replaced by someone I highly respect and we have worked very well together since he started a couple of months ago. Last week my new boss approached me and directly asked why I haven’t considered applying for the vacant division manager position. He says I would be good fit for the role. Here are my thoughts and concerns:

1. Current Compensation vs. Promotion
    - I currently make very good money, and the promotion would only increase my pay about 20%. While significant, the raise isn’t a game-changer for me.

2. Job security
    - In my current role, I feel secure with performance metrics I can control. Conversely, the last two managers for this prospective position were fired in the span of 4 or 5 years. It feels like a big risk..

3. Division Performance
    -  Brand B is currently struggling, mainly due to sales issues. We've had delays in projects, lower margins than forecasted due to market conditions, and corporate has recently mandated not to drop earnings forecasts, which impacts bonuses. It’s currently a stressful situation with a lot of pressure from corporate.

4. Future Opportunities
    - I’ve expressed interest in leading a division one day, but im in my early 30’s and with only 6 years in the industry, I’m not sure I’m ready. I don’t want to be overlooked for future opportunities if I don’t take this chance now.

5. Stress
- I do feel like this role would cause me more stress… ironically I’d probably work less hours in the new role but it would be subject to more big decisions, worrying more often at home, etc.

1cvspor,"Career dilemma, please advise.","I’ll keep this as short as I can.  I’m UK based, age 31.

I have been a carpenter for the past 15 years and the last 6 of those I have ran my own business.  The business is just myself however it’s fairly profitable, it’s turning over roughly £80,000 each year with around £30,000 profit.  All of my tools are paid for, the only payments I have each month are the van (£220 which will be paid off in 2026), a bounce back loan from Covid (£257 which will be paid off in 2026) and public liability insurance (£45ish).

My dilemma is;

The business is now essentially in autopilot,  I haven’t advertised in a long time and the jobs are constantly coming in as I’ve built a respectable business with good reviews.  Most jobs are a minimum of 4 days and some bigger ones can run for a few weeks (I mainly do kitchens, staircases and garden rooms).  Things are great at the moment but I’m worried about my future. 

I recently applied for and have been accepted into the police.  Looking at the long run, the police has a great pension and I can retire early.  I have been added to the holding pool because I’ve got a holiday coming up and I’ll miss two intakes, so it’s looking like January next year before I can go.  (The business has enough funds to pay off all debt and close properly).

I don’t have a pension (I know, stupid) and that’s the main draw with the police, including the job security.  I recently learned I can make fairly sizeable contributions to a personal pension through my business but I’m pretty clueless with that side of things.

Growing the business isn’t really an option, I have tried in the past by hiring some other carpenters but the work they were producing was costing me money to rectify, therefore I work alone now.  My worry is that all of my eggs are in one basket being alone, if I have a week off due to sickness, no one can pick up the slack. 

I’m now in two minds, do I continue with my carpentry career and hopefully things work out in the end money wise, or do I follow the police path and get started next year?  Do I just get a financial planner and figure out how to keep the business and my future intact?  I don’t want to miss an opportunity as the police recruitment was gruelling but I am naturally a risk taker being in business and I am willing to put in the effort to make something work out.",Sharktopus27,3,1.0,5,1716137451,2024-05-19 16:50:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cvspor/career_dilemma_please_advise/,5,2024

if I want to repeat my class 12 I heard about going as a private candidate or NIOS and I don't know much about either of those as for my career I am interested in AI and I am following everyone or something like that I am genuinely interested in AI as a career I want to do something like research on AI like how can we go from this AI to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) 

so if someone is from this field or related to it like from computer science, mechanical engineering, etc. If you're willing to help plz contact me because I don't know much about these and I read some forum discussions, where they said it's better to ask someone who is from that field for career advice rather than going to some career consultation

1cvp4tp,How do a I handle a possible promotion with a possible poach attempt in SaaS?,"I work for a SaaS startup. I have a great relationship with my manager. We are looking to re-organize our team, with me taking over a section of the team with a director level position. 

We also just hired another outside individual on the team for a director level position. This is in line with what I understand the plan to be, with someone taking over half the team and me the other half. 

But I feel it's been a bit slow moving with my promotion and this re-org. So I am going to express some frustration to my boss. 

But then a wrench has been thrown into things - someone I had worked for previously referred me for a position at another company. This position would come with more ownership and leadership than my current role, and the VP (who would be my boss) basically asked me ""what will it take to pull you from your current company.""  They also mentioned they want to move quickly. 

I'm going to tell them that I want the title to be a director level title (instead of Lead.) And even though I wouldn't have anybody reporting to me immediately, it would show a commitment to grow the team in the future. 

I'm not sure how to approach this with my current manager. The pay for the director level role at my current job would be a decent amount better than my expected pay with the new job. And I think I'd rather stay with my current company. When is the right time to bring up this new opportunity with my manager?

1cvo0rb,Indian mechanical engineer looking for advice.,"Hey guys! Iam recently living in confusion all the time because of tension that what career should i choose. I completed  my mechanical engineering course from a tier 4 college because of that i never got a strong guidance for what to do next. As for why i chose mechanical is because out of my love towards tech and my main interests while growing up were cars, rockets,Robotics,sustainability etc. Even though i completed my course a year ago i still have backlogs still i have no regret in choosing mechanical to study. Because of my bad  college we didn't had any proper faculty to teach us mechanical engineering so i taught myself everything from ground up and i really like it. But coming to choosing a career I'm completely confused about what to do next. Some of my friends studied some MEP, and other oil and gas related course and got placed. No offense but they're jobs are not the ones i dreamt of. I want to make stuff and be in an environment where i will feel involved and not be a slave. Like in production or something. But when i researched those kind of jobs only go to students  from top colleges. So as of now I'm like a blank slate not knowing what to do. Anyways I've decided to join a coding course because its a necessity in future.  So tell me guys what should i do?. Are my dreams superficial?  Should i just switch to it and do data science or something.  Please guys help me. I'm literally having sleepless nights because of tension.  ( ps. Right now I'm working in IT operations and even though i like it, it doesn't feels like somewhere i belong).",ni_kollalo,0,0.5,0,1716124468,2024-05-19 13:14:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cvo0rb/indian_mechanical_engineer_looking_for_advice/,5,2024

1cvkhlt,My volunteer coordinator constantly bothers me during weekends. How do I communicate without causing problems?,"I have a volunteering role for a mental health helpline which I asked to suspend for 3 months because of my masters and exam period which was fine.

 However, I have been contacted by someone during my exam period about updating something on the system, which I intended to reply of course, but then forgot because of my exams. It was a really intense month of exams - I have disabilities, mental health problems myself and had some major dental pain during my last exam and had to defer it to a later date. 

This person emailed me before my period ended to ask if I was still coming back and I said yes. I haven’t been able to book any shifts or communicate about updating on their system because immediately after my exams my research project and clinical placement started and have been overwhelmingly busy, and I was still recovering from the stress of it all.

 I understand they need to know this information, but the problem I have is that this person has been calling me on my personal mobile during this weekend. She left a voicemail yesterday and then another text today saying that she needs to know if I’m coming back before their leadership meeting on Wednesday. It is not the first time that she has expected communication during weekends (my volunteer agreement only requires me to be available for a weekend shift once a month - nothing about communication). If she doesn’t get a response within a day, even during weekends, she sends another email. Holidays do not deter her.

I want to pull out of this role now because I can’t spread myself too thin with my masters. But I do want to communicate something about not being available during weekends without being confrontational. I would like to go back after my masters ends.

Option 1 is pursue HR/Talent management with my Bachelor degree. From what I’ve seen, the money is good but the morale of the role isn’t super good (not fulfilling and seems like a draining job in a bullpen-style office, not contributing to the betterment society and all). Could work my way up the corporate ladder.

Option 2 is pursue a Honours year and then go into Masters (hopefully) and become a clinical psych. In Aus this requires some unpaid placement, and then some placement with lower than average salary. I assume the growth-potential is higher though?

I have really solid benefits that I'm losing and need to figure out what I need to consider around health insurance + any other things I may not be considering in this swap.  
\--  
Additional Context:  
So long story short. I am very happy with the opportunity I have. I am making a career switch from sales to product manager in a 4000 employee company. I was making 150k before I swapped to this job 8 months ago (QOL decision).  
It took a ridiculous amount of networking and stepping way out of my lane to get the position, and the specific role I'm getting is not something that existed in the company. They're taking a risk on me and don't have the, I'm not sure the proper term for it, but 'corporate headcount' to take me on as an employee till January.  
I was making $74k salary + benefits before and will now be making $60/hr with 40 hours guaranteed (explained as $120k yearly target assuming 50 week in a full year worked) and was told that I can work overtime. Jan would be 135K plus full benefits.  
I have really solid benefits that I am losing, but I do feel like this is a good move for me.  
I have an S-corp LLC that I worked under for 6 years prior, so I have that for taxes and am meeting with my accountant Monday for tax planning. I also have a second LLC partnership that I suspect will make an extra $10k this year from.  
I have a $2500/month mortgage, but I also could float myself for at least a year with no wages, with all my expenses, if it came to that, so I can take the risk.  
The VPs I've been talking to are talking to HR about some options of potentially keeping benefits, but I'm not confident. The job offer came Friday, with HR formalities I won't start officially until Thursday.  
The company is a really good culture, the CEO forewent 2020 salary along with all management down the chain taking 75%-25% pay cut to prevent layoffs. So let's assume there are not intentionally malicious intentions. As a side note, when I first started the conversation 3 weeks ago, they were planning on bringing me on as a BSA, which I was open to, but after a presentation I did I surprisingly got offered the PdM role.

I graduated in May of 2023 with a degree in computer science from a decent school (top 50 public).

I originally had 1 job offer lined up post graduation, but I was pressured by my parents to pursure my masters degree because my father regrets never getting his. Unfortunately due to changing circumstances the financial burden of doing my masters has caught up to me and I am seeking a full time job now. I've been applying to hundreds of places since late February and unfortuately I've found little to no leads. I've been given 2-3 interviews that all went to the final round, but I was either ghosted or told they found someone better than me to fill the position. I tried contacting my past internships, but was unable to secure a position.

  
I am not seeking a high salary, I am open to working anywhere in the US (currently in Dallas). Is there any advice on finding a suitable job that isn't highly competitive? For reference, I've been applying to any and all jobs that I feel remotely qualified for on linkedin, indeed, handshake, ziprecruiter, etc. I try using different keywords like entry level programmer / IT analyst / new graduate and such. I've also tried finding government jobs, but I'm not sure what the optimal way is to look for them. I am also open to potentially pivot if anyone knows a good one for my circumstance.

1cvgxks,Which job should I take/ what would you do?,"I’m a 28(m) I got out the army in 2018 and just been bouncing from job to job really. Finally landed that big position I guess you’d say. It’s 65k a year. Which for me is the most I’ve ever made and a comfortable wage since I live in a cheap state, on top of receiving monthly disability from the VA. The only caveat I guess is, there is weekly travel involved. Not a permanent thing but could be up to 6 months rarely they say a year. Low as 3 months. It’d be traveling m-f training going back home on the weekends.  Until they find my permanent location. 

 I do have a wife and 3 year old daughter. I’ve never been apart from. Not saying I wouldn’t be able to. I just don’t know if it will jeopardize the relationship at all. I can’t imagine really waking up and not seeing my daughter. I do have another job offer, it’s local no travel m-f. It’s about 55k a year. So a lot less money, but I don’t have to go without seeing my wife and daughter.  The job with traveling, does elevate me to that next position I’ve wanted, makes life a lot more comfortable but I just don’t know.  

Anyone ever dealt with something similar ? Any tips stories advice is appreciated

I am working for a Series D startup based out of Bengaluru in the Customer Success function.

I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science 10 years ago and working in multiple startups since then.

My question are:
- Should I opt for MBA or the Exec MBA? I heard that Exec MBAs don't get the same treatment as the one who did the normal one.
- Will it make sense to do an MBA abroad?

The reason I have this question is because I have seen people with MBA from Premier institutes getting jobs easily. They are also promoted to the leadership positions with lesser experience.

1cveess,Should I take the student loans?,"Hello redditors, I have an opinion question to ask. 

I just graduated from a very prestigious college in the US, and was accepted to NYU for graduate school in the fall. Only about 50% of students get scholarships, and I received a 50% tuition scholarship from them to attend. The program would put me exactly in the job field that I want to pursue life long, and I genuinely find joy in the idea of pursuing said career (Public Policy Analyst). My career goal requires education beyond just my bachelor’s degree, and I genuinely love school and am excited about continuing going to classes. I’ve met some great people who will also be in my program that I am excited to see there. I also plan to live in NYC for many years to come, and have not found a single other place in the world where I feel like my most authentic self. The program is one of the best in the country, and has faculty who have worked on Capitol Hill and other amazing organizations. I truly feel like I have the key to my perfect future in my hand with this opportunity.

All of this sounds great, right? Well… as you can imagine I would be taking out an exorbitant amount of student loans for this Master’s program. Thankfully, my undergraduate tuition was completely paid for through a scholarship that I earned, so I don’t have a lot of student loans besides my living expenses from that time. This allows some leeway for grad school expenses, however, I would be looking at around $100-120k in loans at the end of all of this…

Thankfully, my career field will most likely fall under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness track, so I believe that I will be eligible to get these loans paid for. It is not a 100% guarantee though. My career field makes somewhat decent money, but if these loans don’t get forgiven, I’m looking at a cool 20+ years paying off these loans.

I am thinking of just going for it and taking on the loans, but at the same time I am not sure how wise this is. I know that as an adult I need to make this decision and I am the one who will need to pay these off eventually but I was hoping to get some input from strangers with 0 stake in my life who will give me the straight up facts (the lovely people close to me in my life of course said to follow my heart and go for it, but I think they just don’t want to hurt my feelings). So please, if you feel so inclined redditors, give it to me straight!

1cvdogj,"What to wear for a fun, vibrant retail job interview?","Hey everyone,

I've got a job interview tomorrow at a super cool gifts and stationary store, and I'm feeling a bit stuck on what to wear. The store has this fun, vibrant vibe, and most of the girls on their Instagram are rocking colored jumpers and pants (it's winter where I am).

I was thinking about wearing a pair of pink pants that aren't too bright, paired with a black woollen jumper. Both pieces aren't overly fitted, but I'm not entirely sure if it's the right vibe for the interview. I want to strike that balance between being professional yet fitting in with the store's aesthetic.

Alternatively, I'm considering black jeans that don't scream ""jeans"" too much, with some kind of jumper. But again, I'm unsure.

1cv7xpd,Getting teaching credential just to sub!!? Want to start teaching career later in life… am I crazy? Will I get hired?? help!!!,"Getting credential, subbing… and then teaching? Will this work? Please help! 🥹

Sooo, I’m currently student teaching and working towards my credential. I wanted to get my teaching credential now rather than later. (I feel like once I have kids, it’ll be hard to balance motherhood with a credential program.)

Is it unwise to get your credential, and then not even teach, but instead sub a few times a week in order to start a family / be able to spend plenty of time with my children? I ideally wouldn’t want to teach until my youngest kid was in first grade. I want about four kids, so even if I have them back-to-back, it’d be a while. (I did the math, and I’d be in my mid 40’s. I’m in my late 20’s rn.) 

I figure with all the subbing experience, school districts would still want to hire me? But I dunno, it’s definitely not the traditional path… I just want to be able to start my family with my spouse and not miss out on their childhoods.

I work at an after school program where kids go immediately after the school day and wait for parents to pick them up when they’re off work.  Even our teacher-parents pick up their kids late because they’re busy coaching, having meetings, or lesson planning. It breaks my heart, but I still want to teach eventually. Just not while my babies are little. We have a kinder who is dropped off at school at 7 and isn’t picked up until 5:30. That breaks my heart that both of their parents are forced to work that much to be able to support their family. 

TLDR; I’m getting my teaching credential just to sub, I don’t plan on teaching until I’m in my 40’s when all my kids are older and busy at school the whole day. Will I have trouble getting hired despite all the subbing experience???

1cv6wyi,Pricing your skills as a full timer,"Hi all,

So I did a thing and I’m not sure whether it was stupid or… “empowering”. I just know I couldn’t live without saying something. 

I was hired for one job who’s role is rather singular. It’s also a junior role as one of my sub skills… I took a step back from my main career path for personal reasons and with that a massive payout which was my choice. 

As I’m at this job, there’s talk about leveraging everyone’s additional skill sets (small company, possibly sinking ship)… my additional skill sets were mentioned. 

That’s where I got uncomfortable. Those skill sets took over 15+ years to cultivate and if I was aiming to continue down that career path, my asking would be double/triple what I’m making in this junior role. And this place doesn’t give out raises or cost of living increases— so i know not to expect anything of the sort. 

I brought up my concerns to my manager. I didn’t want to lend my expertise in one area because the compensation just wouldn’t be there. No benefit to me except to “keep” my job, I suppose.  Note: these are two wildly different roles. It was received well (at least outwardly).

1cv2gyx,41 year old looking for career change advice,"I'm 41 and have been a UX / UI designer on and off for the past 17 years. It is a good job to have, yet it is not fulfilling for me, and I don't do well sitting on the computer all day. On top of that, over the last couple of years, I have worked on very dysfunctional teams, which depleted me and resulted in me not searching for more work after my last contract ended (I'm currently not working and it should be noted that I deal with chronic depression). 

My passion is singing, and while I started taking vocal lessons a couple of years ago, sadly, I don't have the background, experience, talent, or connections to earn a living in this field at this time (or ever, haha).

While I'd love to be in the performing arts area, I think I might excel in roles like project management, event planning, intimacy coordination, and professional organizing because I am very detail-oriented and organized. That said, these roles typically require experience. I also enjoy being physically active, so ideally, a role that allows me to get some exercise.

It is a small company of less than 10 employees. 6 days ago, I sent an email to the owner asking if the position is still open since they posted the job 6 times already in 5 months, and whether or not they are still looking for someone. I also just wrote in 2 sentences my educational and professional background which, frankly, overqualifies me. I left out some of my formal education  and professional experiences, so they don't just shut me out due to my excessive education or experience,  because  I just want my foot in the door if it is a good company. At this point,  I don't know.

I got a reply from the wife or assistant (only used a first female name) asking to see my resume. I didn't reply because her email wording to me was unprofessional sounding. It was just one sentence!!!  Also, instead of the hybrid position of  receptionist & manager position,  she said the receptionist position is open. Then 3 days later, she sent me another one sentence email saying that she would be ""happy to see my resume"" for the position. 

I'm leaning toward not replying again because sending a one sentence reply to my professional email is just rude. I just want to know if the position is hybrid. Is waiting 3 days to reply to her too long?

1cv036a,Working Remotely for a Foreign Company,"
Hi everyone!

I'd like to know everyone's thoughts on the ups and downs of working for a foreign company remotely.

The benefit that I am eyeing on is the higher pay but still the same cost of living — given that I'm still living in the same country.

I'm a UX Designer from the Philippines so my job mainly needs a PC and an internet connection only. UX Designers here are relatively paid lower here cmpared to other countries as I've observed.

Apart from that, working remotely has its perks of flexibility in time and working anywhere I want to.

I don't really see much of a disadvantage to it but maybe I'm just missing something so I need advice.

Thanks!",fiestadelight,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1716046881,2024-05-18 15:41:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cv036a/working_remotely_for_a_foreign_company/,5,2024

1cuzt77,Is my boss’s reaction unfounded? ,"I work in a 100% remote job. This past week was very challenging in my personal life. I have a disabled son and he had a series of unfortunate issues in a row. However, my year bonus was stellar, my review rating was great, my last 5 months of 1:1s have gone great, and I’ve led several important calls. The day before this issue, I was told I “over communicate..” 

The challenges came to a head one afternoon and during a very stressful work deadline, my son had a major issue in my car upon driving home. I block one hour in the afternoon for after school commutes. I had to pull over to care for him. 

 I kept in touch with my boss via Teams mobile  as we had a tight deadline for an important document I was working on for an exec, and even called him 3 times to explain I was in a challenging situation, and he didn’t answer. I was also messaging 2 other execs to inform them of the status. They were both fine with the progress but obviously wanted an ETA. 

The whole day my boss was asking me about projects and status, and seemed annoyed with my responses. This is out of the blue. (He’s cancelled 2 previous 1:1’s due to him being out of office, so we had not discussed priorities on my next several workstream assignments ) My directs were busy on other projects so I couldn’t delegate in that moment. 

I get back to my laptop finally and finish up what I’m working on. This is a day before a 3 day PTO. He calls me. I grab my laptop to go to a quieter spot as I in my kitchen, I wanted to get back online asap. 

He tells me: 
- you seem all over the place and not focusing on work lately. 
- you seem always moving from one place to another. 
- he made comments like “are you even logged in?” 
- when I returned later than expected from school commute, I sent an email to inform the group I was working with to inform of my delays, my boss said this was unprofessional and told me I was unprofessional as well. 
- when I asked for examples of me being unavailable he said “we’ll talk about it later.” 
- overall he was rude. 

This is out of nowhere. 

I spoke to HR as this is the 3rd time he’s been rude to me about very basic and ordinary obstacles. Other directs of his have also complained. HR told me to meet with his boss. I did. I meet with my boss in a week. 

Where is this coming from? It was an emergency. Yes I commute to and from school, everyone is aware. I do sometimes have to take a call from my car, but my boss does too. 

I’m lost. And I think he was out of line.

I do not enjoy healthcare in general and currently hold a B.S. in Rehabilitation Science. I have looked into working for a Master’s degree in Speech/Language Pathology.

My goal is to work in a management role concerned more with business than engineering, preferably in an investment or VC firm or consulting with a top consulting company - this is to build experience to my ultimate goal which is to start a business of my own.

I've talked with a few successful tech entrepreneurs ($15M-$50M) one adviced me to go for MBA immediately and work in VC or consulting after that, another advised me to get a Masters in CS from top univesities preferably near Silicon Valley, only for exposure to research, business opportunities etc, not for the education part of it.

My reservation is that I don't mind getting a Masters in CS if it's really gonna serve my ultimate end goal well, at the same time, I'm not sure if a two year degree just for some exposure is a really good idea. But on the other hand, MBA would require more business experience to get into top universities.

I feel very stuck - the start-up is too small to hire people in the same niche (so no hope of me shifting into management), To be honest, it's not even clear whether the start-up will survive for long enough for this to ever happen. 

Anyway, I identified this as a problem almost a year ago and have been looking for jobs ever since. There are none in my little niche - I've worked really hard to identify skills outside of the niche that are applicable to other lines of work and have sent in (I felt) really compelling applications to those positions, but have received only rejections. I've begun working on an MS in a closely related field to expand my horizons as well.

My current solution is to continue searching for jobs while trying to pick up any other skills in my current company that I possibly can. I live in an HCOL area and am the sole earner, so am trying not to take a massive pay cut if I can avoid it (I can't, for instance, take an unpaid internship or something).

1cusv6j,Opinions on leaving my current job just 3 months after I negotiated a significant raise?,"So I've been working in this embedded product company that is kind of startup ish in work culture , long hours, shit pay but great exposure for 3 years since graduation. 

I had a few project dependencies and was on good terms with my manager when I got an offer for an r&d position in one of the top 10 semiconductor companies in the world. 

I was on the last week of my notice period and preparing to join that company when my manager requested me to stay because of project dependencies and gave all kinds of reasons to make me stay and offered to match my salary which was a very significant raise over my salary at the time. 

In the end i accepted because of how grateful I am to my manager for the opportunities to learn he gave me and because there were some projects I was working in our company too.

But then two months in the dependencies are over, the projects I was interested in didn't take off and I'm bored with the work I am doing.

Now I have received another offer from a company of similar stature to the one I rejected before and I'm torn on whether leaving this quickly after promising to stay 2 more years is the the right thing or not. 

I have a lot of regret on rejecting the original offer and staying because of how things turned out, but I can't help feeling like I am cheating this company because the offer they gave me was insane by the standard of salaries they give to others with my experience here in similar job roles and they gave that to me because they trusted me to some extent. 

I want some advice on this. ",fayrnthe,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1716021811,2024-05-18 08:43:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cusv6j/opinions_on_leaving_my_current_job_just_3_months/,5,2024
1cuspto,Help me choose a career path... Please...,"Hello, I am currently working as a Bioinformatics engineer in a startup, setup in India...  
The company that I currently work at has a very toxic environment and lacks professionalism...  
I am a fresher, I completed my masters in Bioinformatics in 2023, and have only 9 months of experience, 6 months as R & D intern, in a small company where I had no senior bioinformaticians working with me, so I had to learn everything on my own...

3 months in the current company where I have learned a few things, but nothing exciting...  
I have learned to use AWS, Nextflow, and I would rate my programming skills 4/5, I am not good at OOPS currently, and I am trying to learn Django on my own...

I am afraid the Bioinformatics industry is quite boring in India like this, and the growth seems to be very slow... Like after 3 years you will be considered as a senior and the pay from the job openings listed is way too low... like 50,000 INR per month after 3 years of experience doesn't make any sense...

So I am trying to change my target to industry to IT, but being a non-engineer getting there seems very difficult, is this the right move for me??  
Or should I stick to bioinformatics and keep upskilling, and hope to land a job which compensates on par to the skills that I have...  
I am not sure I am asking the right questions... and I am not sure where do I see myself in the next 5 years... Should I go for PhD, or stick to industry... It seems all very confusing...  
I just ask the reader to share what they did in their life to get to where they are right now... I am not sure this is the right question to ask...

1cusjza,Need career advice as my mental health is taking a hit. ,"  
I'm about 6 weeks into a call center job which was basically taken just to pay the bills, but I'm more focused on my cyber security career and studying for my ICT degree. The job is long hours, and exhausting work, and emotionally draining and its taking a toll on me, so I've applied for government roles in cyber security which are notoriously slow to interview so I was going to wait to see if I got the new role in govt, before I quit the call center.. 

So recently I had to take time off to care for my grandkids during a family emergency, I was upfront with work, told them what had happened, and that I may need to look after the grandkids at the end of the shift, they kept telling me family comes first.....until yesterday when my supervisor told me to prioritize work over family and that taking the two hours off was unacceptable even though I got a carers certificate as I was told to do by this supervisor. This, along with other incidents, is affecting my mental health as I feel drained all the time, emotionally I hate this job and the people arent great. I got told Im doing amazing at the job, and Im the only one who is doing everything they should but then I get told to not take a couple of hours to look after my grandkids. 

My question is the new roles in the govt that I am applying for, it will be a couple of months before I know what is happening with them, but I don't think mentally I could handle another two months or so in this role. Its just killing all my joy. Its taking away study time, and the next two months I could feasibly spend studying, passing my exams and getting some extra cyber certs/experience under my belt. 

I have a second car I should have sold a year ago, but didn't, and I know if I sell it I will have at least 30K in my hand to live on, but Im worried I am letting this TL force me to make a stupid decision. 

I have many certificates and experience, including CAPM and Prince2 certifications and my cyber security specialist certification, so I know I have a really good chance at these roles. 

I need advice.  I know what I want to do, I know what I should do, but I want to know, what you think I should do.

1cusfgg,28M Stuck Between a Rock and a Hard Place,"I'm currently working as an Electrical Apprentice in an industrial setting in Australia, and I'm hating it. The expectation is to complete tasks really fast, but I don’t even have the basics down yet. I know I'm slow and struggle with basic hand tools, and I'm scared of heights, but I believe I can overcome these challenges with time.

I had a massive fallout with my senior electrician because he was pushing me way too hard, but we managed to resolve it. Still, the pressure remains. I moved to this very rural factory for this apprenticeship because there are no mature-age electrical opportunities in the city.

Recently, I got a sudden opportunity through a veteran program to get recognition of prior learning for a Certificate II in Security Operations, which could lead to becoming a security guard. I used to be in the Navy and have my security clearance, which is another requirement for the job. When I was in the Navy, I enjoyed duty times the most; it was the calmest, easiest, and most relaxed job I've had. The person handling my RPL can also give me a referral for a job, though it's not guaranteed.

Now, I have to choose between a job I slightly dislike but pays the bills and one I've already invested 12 months of rental in (I've been in the apprenticeship for 3 months). Or I can choose a job I might enjoy, but with no certainty.

1cup1kn,I've been in sales for 7 years - what now,"I originally got into sales as a way to make more money - my first job out of high school was in manufacturing and I would produce 2-3x what my coworkers would - yet after a year of this level of production i was only making $2 more than them. 

I started sales, and honestly it took me about 4 years and many different industries to find my groove - 3 years ago I started really popping off in insurance sales, I was consistently top 10 out of 500 - switched to home remodeling and canvassing and built the highest producing team in our region.

And that's when I started realizing I wasn't being compensated enough. Last year I made 90k, but my sales team isn't closing the leads we set. 

At this point I feel pretty burnt out, I let lifestyle creep catch me and I can't afford to take a commission only job in case I don't do well from the jump - and a lot of days I'm simply worn out and don't feel like running a team, doing trainings, or going out and leading from the front anymore. It feels pointless because I make minimum bonus, I even switched companies that showed a higher close rate on leads (got sold on a sales job, how bout it), and they're even worse than the first company. So now I'm only pacing for 72k this year. fml.

What other industries/positions would I be compensated directly for my level of production and would be something I could grow into a 200k+/yr position in 2-3 years? A few friends have recommended IT/Cybersecurity because I'm a nerd for that stuff in my spare time. But a lot of that is salaried from my understanding. 

Open to any suggestions at this point ",Accomplished-Log-495,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1716006273,2024-05-18 04:24:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cup1kn/ive_been_in_sales_for_7_years_what_now/,5,2024

1cunrbk,Would getting a teaching credential be right for me?,"I need some help. I got an AA in graphic design and a BA in communications with a focus on digital media and a minor in studio art. I worked as a graphic designer for 2.5 years after college and decided I hated it, so I decided to try substitute teaching as a transitional job out of graphic design. I actually enjoyed my first year of subbing and thought about getting a credential to become a teacher, but I didn't feel ready to take the plunge. 

I'm toward the end of my second year subbing and I have really gotten fed up with the bad behavior in elementary schools and was ready to write off subbing and teaching all together. I didn't sub much high school last year, so I tried subbing high school a little more in the passed couple months and I have had some great students (one of the classes was an AP class). This made me consider getting a single subject credential in History and maybe another in English as a backup.

I still don't feel 100% sure though. I haven't subbed enough high school to have dealt with any really bad behavior, but I know it definitely exists in high school. I'm at a point where I need health benefits and better pay, so I don't want to keep subbing. I'm stuck deciding between going for a full time office job or go for a credential and become a teacher. I'm hesitant to pay $4k for a credential and have to go back to school. Financial aid covered my AA and BA so a part of me feels like I should just use my BA to find a full time job and make more money than I would as a new teacher anyway.

I really hated graphic design and I felt liberated when I started subbing and discovered there are other careers out there I can actually enjoy, so I feel like I might be clinging onto that initial positive experience I had my first year subbing. I really enjoy teaching students when they are respectful and excited to learn, but unfortunately, that is only about 5% of the time, in my experience. The other 95% is behavior management. I have already lost my patience for poorly behaved students just two years in. Also, if I were to become a high school teacher, I would only really be interested in teaching at two schools in my area and only History and English.

Should I just forget about getting a credential and focus on trying another career? What are your thoughts and suggestions.

1cunpst,A question for recruiters,"Recruiters,

I need your help!

I am a career coach who launched my own career coaching company in 2020.
Currently, I am contracted with a School for the Blind’s AmeriCorps program that serves young adults who are blind and visually impaired. One of the projects I am working on is helping the students build their LinkedIn profiles (how to write their About Me sections and headlines, ETC).

I believe that hearing directly from recruiters like yourself about what you look for when browsing candidates on LinkedIn would be incredibly valuable for the students. Especially for those  just starting out without much work experience. I am reaching out to ask if you would be willing to send me a 10-15 second video clip discussing what you look for when filling positions on LinkedIn. I plan to compile these clips into one video to use as a resource. Please comment or send me a pm if you would be interested in contributing to this project.

These young adults are all incredibly passionate and motivated to progress with their career goals! Your insight and expertise would be very beneficial to them as they navigate their career paths. Thank you in advance for considering this opportunity to support my students in their professional development.

I look forward to hearing from you.

P.S.: I am more than willing to connect on LinkedIn if you're interested for security reasons and so you don't feel like you're sending a video of yourself to a complete stranger. lol",Pumpkinpatch12,1,1.0,0,1716001747,2024-05-18 03:09:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cunpst/a_question_for_recruiters/,5,2024

1cun029,Looking for clear insight/advice on different certificates & career paths,"I'll try to keep this short and to the point.

I'm 40 years old.  I have a diverse and varied work background with skills that are hard to express and explain within other industry outside of what I've done for over 12 years (Events/Marketing)  
I've been looking for a career change as events have been challenging for the last 4 years and I'm seeking more stability and would love remote work after years of constant travel.

Here's where I need some insight, guidance, help, etc:

I'm trying to do my due diligence on different certificates I would be interested in and what those career paths would look like, from starting off, further promotions & certificates, advancement in the career, etc.  but my searches mostly result in advertised search results that are mostly full of marketing fluff and only information about the courses & products I could buy.  It's not that helpful.

I'm currently considering a Project Manager Certification, through PMI or Coursera google course, I understand this one from a vague perspective.

However I'm also interested to look into careers & certificates I could obtain in the tech industry, which I don't know a ton about.  I'm not a computer nerd or math whiz, but I'm also not stupid.  I've had the idea of coding, software development, UI/UX testing, but open to other ideas.  These certificates and career paths are complete mysteries to me and I don't know where to start looking to obtain clear information that I don't have to dig through and decipher a bunch of marketing fluff.

More or less what I want to do is look into a few different options certificate & career path wise, weigh my options & decide.

But boy oh boy - I never imagined this would be a living nightmare. A boss who can’t stop shouting, screaming, mocking at everyone and every little thing. He never listens to anyone. Asks for suggestions, then says drop it because I don’t want to hear it. Makes me feel uncomfortable with all his random comments of how a new person who’s joining soon will get up to speed quicker. He’s a micromanager, but pretty dumb himself because he’s got no clarity in his ideas, thoughts so when you question him, he gets super outraged.

This trickles down to the entire team. Everyone is either stressed, upset, or frustrated at something. No respect, no boundaries. One senior, Chinese btw came in to my office and getting mad at editing the deck. All I did was made correct few grammatical errors and typos. Plus the boss wanted me to take on it so I don’t get why she came at me the way she did. Told me she wanted someone else to take over NOT me.

So basically this place is a circus! Toxic as hell. No respect. People say things left and right and get surprised when I confront them. Having worked for government contractors in the US in my short career, I have never seen anything like this before.

I recently finished college and have a graduate job lined up for September in finance/ fund accounting. The thing is, I know I do not want to do fund accounting in the future it was just the only job that I could get that had hybrid working and in a location were I can public transport to. 

I personally wanted to a graduate programme in a more accountant based job such as working at the big 4 in auditing, or doing an accounting and finance programme in a big company, however i did not have any luck and got rejected from all these jobs.

The position that I have lined up is a two year contract and offer to pay for qualifications I pursue during this period so long as I pass the exams and stay the duration of the two years e.g. CFA, CPA. 

What is the best option? Should I stay at the job I don’t have much interest in and use it to work towards passing accounting exams when looking for a new job will those two years of experience in fund accounting really have any benefit while looking for a new accounting based job if I have some of the accounting exams passed, or should I not waste my time and try and find a new job. 

I am from Ireland btw

Thanks

However, up until this point, I have mostly had BI type jobs, and have quite solid Python, JavaScript, and PowerBI skills.

1cugym2,When did you realize that you’re not meant for a certain career? ,"I grew up taking sewing lessons and have always enjoyed making clothes. The actual sewing part comes very natural and easy for me but the pattern making does not. I went to college for a couple years for fashion design but dropped out. I’ve always thought I would be a fashion designer and have my own brand. I have continued to make clothes but lately I’ve kind of had the realization that maybe it’s not what I’m supposed to be doing. I’ve never started a brand I’ve never sold anything to anyone and I barely show people what I make because it’s not up to my standards. I get frustrated way more often than I should. I know comparison is the thief of joy but, I see other people younger than me or around the same age making these insane pieces. I see what I make and it feels like nothing compared to other designers. My clothes are very minimalistic and obviously sewn by machine. It’s hard for me to actually design on paper or online, when I think of something I have to physically make it. I do have really creative ideas and looks that I want to achieve but it feels like I never can. I definitely hold myself at a high standard but it just feels like I’ve put 15 years of money and commitment to nothing. Has anyone felt this way? Any advice?

1cuf3vy,Pay cut for new job?,"So, I currently commute from the suburbs into the city for my job 4 days a week (Mon-Th). It takes me about an hour and 15 minutes each way. I love my job but the commute is getting hard especially with two young toddlers at home. I would like to be with them more and be home to help my husband with them more. Plus train ticket costs add up. 

All that said, I just got a job offer for a remote role. It probably won’t be as fun as my current job and will require some local travel when I’m making office visits (1-2x per week). It also seems way more stable than my current situation since we just went through a couple rounds of lay offs. 

The job offer is $10k less than what I’m making now. The bonus is slightly more than what I get now and I would be saving money by not taking the train, but I’d still be down by about $5k. I’m going to try and counter, but they seemed rather strict with their offer and I don’t anticipate them budging.

1cueqij,How Do I know What I like and What am Good At? ,"We call those who have figured out their passions and hidden skills and talents lucky people. Because not everyone knows what they are truly good at.



And wondering ""What do I like?"" and ""What am I good at?"" are common struggles in today's world. It can feel like we're stuck in a holding pattern, unable to find that fulfilling career path.



But the good news is unearthing your passions and hidden talents is absolutely possible! It might take some exploration, but with a little self-reflection, you can move from feeling lost to feeling empowered.



So I'll leave you with these 3 key questions to get you started, and you'll go from being lost to being one of those luckiest people...



**1. What activities do you effortlessly lose track of time while doing?**



This question helps uncover activities that you are naturally drawn to and enjoy. When you're deeply engaged in an activity and lose track of time, it's a sign that you're tapping into a skill or talent that comes to you intuitively. Recognizing these moments can lead you to discover areas where you excel and derive fulfillment.



**2. What tasks do others often seek your help or advice on?**



The perception of others can provide valuable insights into your skills and talents. When people consistently seek your assistance or advice in specific areas, it indicates that you possess expertise or proficiency in those areas. Pay attention to the requests you receive from friends, family, or colleagues, as they can highlight your strengths and areas of expertise.



**3. What are you curious about? What topics or domains intrigue you and draw you in for further exploration?**



Curiosity is a powerful indicator of potential talent. Areas that pique your interest often signify inherent aptitudes and a desire to learn and grow. Exploring these curiosities can lead to the discovery of hidden abilities and untapped potential.



You can start with these 3 key questions. You can also check the [full 25 questions list](https://upperclasscareer.com/25-questions-to-identify-your-skills-and-hidden-talents/) that you'll need a quiet, isolated space where you can truly disconnect from distractions and immerse yourself in introspection.",Basic_Bird_8843,0,0.25,0,1715975994,2024-05-17 19:59:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cueqij/how_do_i_know_what_i_like_and_what_am_good_at/,5,2024
1cueblm,I don’t like my coworkers.,"Don’t like my coworkers — need advice.

Throwaway for privacy. I work in the medical field and I have 2 main coworkers. We have specialized lab positions (for privacy reasons I do not wish to disclose my specific job title). 

For background, I am 26F. Coworker 1 is 24F. She has behaved unprofessionally towards me a couple times, i.e. yelling at me for now knowing how to do the job when I was new. She generally keeps to herself but her daily mood is 50/50 (either extremely happy and talkative or quiet and passive aggressive). Coworker 2 is 45M. He is friendly enough, but loves drama/ is constantly talking negatively about everyone and everything. Neither of them seem to have very happy lives.

Part of what bothers me the most is that Coworkers 1 and 2 seem to enjoy each others company more than they enjoy mine. Whenever the two of them are alone, they’re always chatting/ gossiping but when I’m around they stop. I try to be as positive as a person as possible so I don’t like to get involved in the drama. Im sure they have talked shit about me behind my back because when I’m around they’re just constantly talking shit about everyone else. 

We work together in the same relatively small room for most of the day, except for lunch and breaks. 

I am seeking advice for how I can change my mindset to improve the workday. What can I do to make the workday more tolerable— besides finding a new job? Lol. Thanks!

1cue3w2,"Graduating uni in 2 months. Should I do a masters, take gap year and do internships, or apply straight to jobs?","Hi,  
  
I'm a final year student studying BSc International Management and is graduating in 2 months. I'm still quite lost on what to do after graduation. I always thought I'd do a masters straight away, but now I think that may not be the best option.  
  
I've always had a hard time deciding what career path to take and still do. I'm leaning towards marketing but I still have doubts as I do not concretely know what a marketing job actually looks like. I feel like the theory I learnt about marketing throughout my course actually differs quite a lot with the actual duties of a marketing role. Throughout my degree I have not done any internships, which I do regret a lot as I have no work experience, but considering my position now I reckon getting work experience before doing a masters might be a smarter choice, so I can have a clearer idea of what I enjoy the most (and if I'd even enjoy marketing) and then apply for a masters.  
  
Right now I think I'm leaning more towards taking a gap year to secure some internships before applying for a masters. I've heard that internships are hard to secure after graduating as companies prefer those still in uni, is that true? Ideally I'm trying to secure 2 6-month internships before applying for my masters next year, would this be feasible? Another option would be to directly apply to entry-level jobs but I'm scared I might not go back to studying.  
  
What should I do? Is taking a gap year to do internships before a masters a good route to take? I'm so overwhelmed and stressed out, I just feel so lost about what would be the right choice. I'm scared of making the wrong decision and have negative consequences on my future. 

Also, just as background info I am based in the UK but I am half French half Chinese, and I am open to stay in all 3 countries in the future. 

Any help is appreciated! Thanks!

Great people, culture and overall, a great place to work. The company was sold to and investing group a few years back and it was fine for the first year. When the company was not as profitable as projected, they closed down 2 offices and let some people go and forced previous owner (my old boss) to retire. 

I now have a job offer from a local city government for a bit less, but benefits are better. I have never worked for a city or government before and not sure if it's the best move. I am 38.

* Fear of the unknown. 
* What if the city runs out of $?

&#x200B;

Brought up the new offer to my new boss and he said he can offer me more $ to stay but didn't say how much more. Could give me a bigger bonus but didn't say how $. Planning on getting the 401k matching back in the future. Can get me involved in more projects and decision making, kind of sounds like more work for me. Mostly just left it for me to ask what I wanted. 

I am leaning on the city job because the benefits are a lot better and the uncertainty with the new owners. I'm also thinking a couple of years in the city looks better on my resume than more years at my current job.

1cua981,"Mid 30s, totally directionless and broke.","I’m in my mid-to late 30s and need to turn my life around…I’ve never made more than $25k in a year …and that’s in a good year. I’ve worked since I was 18. Graduated college with a bachelors in philosophy/art at the height of 08 -09 recession, I worked in art galleries as an art handler and whatever else, eventually worked at a large and well known museum in NYC for visitor services, then worked shipping and receiving at a large bookstore while going back to school at night for environmental science/sustainability post-baccalaureate certification. 

I struggled again to get a job in my mid-late 20s with any non profit or the NYC parks department, I interned and volunteered hoping someone would hire me and also applied to all sorts of programs and grants etc, but I couldn’t get any interest from employers. I was basically working for free and it started to upset me so I took the GRE and considered more school for a master’s degree but ended up managing a craft beer & liquor store/home-brew store in NJ for a few years while working in tasting rooms. I also interned at small indie record label in NJ.

In 2016 around the time I was 30 I decided to move to Los Angeles, stay with friends, and took an immersive web development course. I eventually got paid small amounts to freelance and make very basic websites and worked on very basic API’s, really just tinkering around, definitely wouldn’t consider myself an engineer or coder by any means, it was never a “real” job, and I never felt like I was good at web development and didn’t come to enjoy it like I hoped I would, at times became anxious and depressed, it all felt so fake and scammy, at least as I experienced it back then. 

During Covid I had roommates who thankfully asked me to help them out and I “worked” (again not a “real” job) for them on digital events, basic tech wrangling, which slowly morphed into acting as a Production Assistant for them (my roommates also incorporated their own production company). It was a unique, fun and low pressure arrangement, my roommates threw me a bone work-wise which was honestly really nice of them, I got by, but overall it allowed me to just procrastinate about having to find a “real” job, things stagnated. 

Now its 2024 and I recently left LA and now live back in NJ/NYC area where I live with my parents. I’m currently volunteering at an independent radio station. 

Once I gave up the dream of some ideal magic 6 figure tech salary back when I was still relatively young and when it actually would have mattered, I really hit a wall of depression and regret. I checked out. I can’t even imagine myself being that ambitious anymore, now I’m back in my childhood home, flat broke, totally alone, burnt out, directionless, all my friends own homes and are married with kids and I can’t deny I’m getting old and physically really feel it this year, it sucks, I know I won’t be able to do the physically demanding dumb shitty jobs I used to do for much longer, its got me feeling helpless.

Sure, I have some degrees and certificates from reputable universities, and some solid work experience with plenty of references that will vouch for me, but I’ve never had any sort of “real” office job or anything that paid barely more than minimum wage, when I think about it the best paying gig I probably had was when I was a fancy waiter around age 20-21. I’ve avoided the corporate scene my whole life. I don’t use social media, I have no “network” and even if I did, it’s not like I have specialized or in-demand skills or have held any positions with any responsibilities above the most basic entry level -low level jobs, and most of those are from 5-10 years ago anyway, which is certainly not impressive for anyone, let alone someone who’s pushing 40.

When I am able to overcome the negative/depressive thinking I tell myself I still have time, that I can work hard and with the right guidance and mentorship I know I could thrive in most environments but….where do I go? Why would anyone want to help me at this age? I know there’s no quick fix, I’ve made poor decisions and gave up on myself time and time again and there’s no one to blame but myself. All my crappy hourly wages from years of hard work were spent on education and rent. There’s nothing left. I look in the mirror in the morning and know that soon it really will be too late. I’m single and would love to meet someone but fear I have nothing to offer. 

What do you think Reddit? 

How can I not waste the next 6 months so I can be on my way to a decent salary with benefits.  To make a salary of even 50k a year, it would profoundly change my life. People talk all the time about how life gets better in your 30s etc, but honestly, I’m over halfway thru my 30s and this is by far the lowest point in my life and I’m so ashamed. In fact, I’m starting to not even feel shame anymore, it’s just a blankness. What is the light at the end of the tunnel here? Working and working to save up for what? I’ll never be able to afford even the crappiest tiny apartment around here unless I start making like 100k a year. When I was younger I had friends and social outlets to help prop me up and act as a buffer to the harshness of being an underemployed broke loser because we were all in the same situation more or less. I used to be inspired by artistic or creative dreams that I could put energy into, but now those friends and dreams seem like a distant memory and I just wake up sore every day, feel it in my bones. I haven’t had a celebratory or rewarding moment, especially regarding anything career-oriented, since I was around 19 years old. 

Saving up and moving to California all on my own was such a huge deal for me and I feel like I had so much going for me 6-7 years ago but I really blew it by not trying harder in my early 30s. I let depression drag me down and now I have to live the rest of my life knowing my crucial early adulthood was spent on mindless pursuits that led to nothing, I can’t remember the last time I was really happy. It feels like I have to make up some story for every future job interview or every future date just because the reality is too pathetic. Working in tech seems so risky and stressful with the layoffs and how oversaturated it is, I really didn’t like it and its not a field I’m particularly comfortable with but at this age it sometimes seems like one of the few options I have left, how else could someone like me make 6 figures?…. I’m at a loss as to what to do, I can’t just get another shit job and waste another year, my body honestly can’t take it anymore, I want to start finally living my life and stop worrying 24/7, I need help.    ",OstrichBusiness5563,64,0.9599999785423279,102,1715964889,2024-05-17 16:54:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cua981/mid_30s_totally_directionless_and_broke/,5,2024

1cu9tm0,Fresh pre-med graduate wants to pivot to research,"Hello everyone. I just recently graduated in December with a bachelor's in psychology that I already regret. If I could go back I would have done finance or computer science, something that would have given me a better chance at a job post-grad. Anyway, I was pre-med all through undergrad thinking I wanted to enter the medical field. But turns out I never really wanted to do that, I was just doing what I thought would satisfy my parents. I don't really have many options right now. I was thinking about going to PA school, but the thought of being a medical professional stresses me out. So I was thinking about careers in research. I did a lot of research in undergrad, especially through my psychology major. I didn't find research to be the most enjoyable but that's all I got for a background. So I was wondering if anyone has any advice on where I can start a career in research. Perhaps psychological research or biomedical sciences. Should I go straight into a master's program?

1cu78ar,Need help deciding a career path/college!!!,"I'm an incoming college Freshman and I'm currently deciding between two colleges. For some background, I’m interested in both business and engineering (more interested in engineering). I can either go to a top 3 engineering school Mechanical engineering or do a 5-year dual degree program at another top school to get both a business and mechanical engineering bachelor's degree.

The appeal of the dual degree for me is I'm not 100% sure I want to go into mechanical engineering, so having the business degree opens more doors. Also I have a full tuition offer to the dual degree program, but for regular engineering I have to pay full OOS tuition (\~35k/year). But say I do decide I want to start a career in engineering, would a business degree be helpful at all with getting jobs? Would it help me stand out or give me access to more mangment/PM roles? Are there any potential career paths that would value both an engineering and business degree? Or would it be completely useless and I'm essentially wasting a year of my life doing the dual degree?

My upper management has not mentioned a word of promotion, compensation, or any plan for me other than “keep up the good work”.

I’ve played with the idea of asking for smaller more insignificant titles because of my lack of experience but the more I think about it I’m not sure why I can’t ask about my managers old title/spot and what the plan is for backfill.

1cu5mjh,"Let go from work because I asked too many questions, despite producing amazing work","Four months ago, I began a new job as a contractor, working full-time as a desktop support technician. I was told that my main tasks would involve assembling laptops, desktops, and similar devices, as well as working with the company's software. It was my first contract role, and I was new to the company.

In my training, I was proactive, asking many questions to further my learning and minimize future dependence on help. Over ten days, I trained with two different co-workers. Soon enough, I felt ready to manage my own queue, addressing tickets and requests to assist end-users. With less than two weeks of training, I was mostly self-sufficient, successfully resolving over 100 tickets in my first month.

  
After processing various requests and tickets, I encountered some unusual ones in the queue. Consequently, I consulted with my colleagues—the two individuals I trained with—on how to manage these, since they were not covered during our 10-day training period. Each person had their own desk, spaced about 10-15 feet apart, except for me, as I was the newcomer and new contractors typically don't receive desks immediately. I decided to proactively seek out my colleagues for help in person. I chose this approach over waiting for a reply in our Microsoft Teams chat because responses often took over an hour for straightforward questions, hindering my ability to work efficiently until I received the necessary information.

  
Inquiring casually, I picked up on a subtle yet clear tension. It appeared that my straightforward questions were somewhat irksome to my colleagues, who boast years of experience over me. I was subsequently informed by my manager that I should refrain from approaching my peers with questions and instead direct any inquiries to the chat. This situation was troubling, as I often observed them mingling with colleagues or idly scrolling through social media instead of working. By then, I had been with the company for just 1.5 to 2 months. Consequently, I minimized the questions I posed and maintained a cordial relationship with my coworkers.

Three months in, I was honored with awards for my dedication, exceptional support, and comprehensive management of tickets from start to finish. I had become proficient in managing my queue independently at this point. I have not yet been assigned a desk and continue to work standing at a countertop for the majority of my 8.5-hour workdays. Standing for such extended periods has become uncomfortable after several consecutive months. I notified the warehouse manager, who had the authority to resolve my issue, but no action was taken until three days before my termination from the company. I communicated to my boss that I had repeatedly experienced discomfort from having to stand, and I was informed that a new room was under construction. I was assured that I would be relocated there and provided with my own desk. 

I received confirmation on the morning of May 13th that the room was ready, and I would be moving in the following day. Hearing this news was incredibly exciting, and I began preparing for the move immediately. After working hard all day and resolving 14 tickets, which exceeded the standard 6-ticket daily average, I was informed just 10 minutes after getting home that I had been terminated, effective immediately, just a day before I was scheduled to move into the new room. I inquired about the reason for my termination, given that I was a high-performing employee recognized for producing quality work, had received accolades for my contributions from peers I assisted, and had also trained two newcomers to my team since my hiring. Despite receiving praise from all my colleagues and my boss, who also shared that sentiment, I was unexpectedly dismissed from my position. 

  
The stated reason for my dismissal was that a couple of complaints had been made against me for making my colleagues ""uncomfortable."". I was taken aback by this, as I had never received any written notice or acknowledgment of complaints, nor had anything been mentioned to me that would suggest I was causing a disturbance during my four months with the company. Initially, during my training, I asked many questions, which I realized could have been bothersome. However, that was literally the point of the training. If I don't ask questions, how am I expected to learn? I had been managing my own queue independently for over two months at the time of my termination and had not been asking repetitive questions, which is why the termination was unexpected. 

During my four-month tenure at the company, I made several friends and asked them to inquire about my termination, which I believe was unjustified. I learned from my colleagues the morning following my termination that the primary reason cited for my dismissal was that I ""asked too many questions."" This rationale seems entirely irrelevant, considering I was working independently for almost 2 full months at this point. It appears to be a rather bogus justification for my termination.

I have an inquisitive and analytical mindset, and asking questions, while they may be excessive, is a way for me to understand what's going on around me. The employer who dismissed me assured me that I had done nothing wrong, acknowledged my excellent work, and simply expressed that I did not quite match the workplace's 'culture'. I genuinely believe I was dismissed due to my personality, which would be illegal and discriminatory. Never have I been accused of asking too many questions, nor have I been released after delivering exceptional work for any company I have worked for. I received no prior notice and was terminated the same day after working 8.5 hours, and they denied me the opportunity to collect my personal belongings the following day. Despite living only five minutes away, I was informed that my items would be shipped to me.

I communicated with my manager, sharing my distress over being terminated without notice despite assurances of my excellent performance and no misconduct. The manager never responded to me. How is it justifiable to place someone in financial jeopardy given the current economic conditions? Without a two-week notice, I was abruptly let go, discarded as 'trash', after dedicating my heart and soul to the company every single day.

  
I have been unemployed for three days and am feeling utterly devastated, with no drive to progress. I sincerely believe that my termination was a result of my personality rather than the quality of my work.",Familiar_Wear_100,6,0.8700000047683716,27,1715953637,2024-05-17 13:47:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cu5mjh/let_go_from_work_because_i_asked_too_many/,5,2024

1cu3ttj,Is Syracuse University worth it?,"My background is in HR. I applied thinking I wouldn't actually get in. Now that I have, I have to decide if the massive tuition cost is worth it. Is anyone willing to help me workshop this a bit?

My primary concern is the ROI. While it's basically the bottom of the barrel as far as law schools go, it's still extremely expensive. I did get a merit scholarship; however, the loans will still be in the $200k range probably. The interest rate last year was 8%. Because outside of Big Law lawyers don't make very much money, I'm worried I will wind up drowning in debt. Furthermore, I'm on the older side. I will be in my 40s when I graduate so I don't have much time. I don't know if I will even break even.

The reason I want to go is because it looks like fun. According to my mentor, lawyer is the role I'm most naturally suited to do. Also, I **hate** HR. Can I suck it up, do it for another 10 years, and retire? Yes, but I will hate every single day. I even ""attempted"" two years ago because I was so unhappy. I think I can find a way to suffer through it if it's truly the better option. However, I feel so much better with an intellectually stimulating job.

My secondary concern is, frankly, I don't want to work sun up to sun down. I've worked hard to buy a beautiful house on a beautiful piece of land. Why would I want to spend 12 hours per day in a stale, soulless office? I talked to a legal mentor who told me he works 100 hours per week. I'm straight up not doing that. I also talked to a few other lawyers who said they only work 45 hours per week. This leads me to believe that paying back the massive loans will be that much harder given the already low salaries and even lower if I'm not willing to work myself to death.

At the end of the day, the math makes SU look like a terrible investment. I think what's stopping me from simply passing is the desire. I **want** to go so I'm trying to find an excuse to do something foolish.

I would appreciate anyone's sincere thoughts.",Medical-Print5785,0,0.5,1,1715948669,2024-05-17 12:24:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cu3ttj/is_syracuse_university_worth_it/,5,2024

1cu2w24,Am I losing the best opportunity of my life or I'm just getting paranoid?,"So I'm currently on a performance plan and will pretty much lose my job in a month.

Couple of days after receiving these news I was reached to by a recruiter of a company I worked for part time back in September. She said she wanted me to interview for a full time position they're opening and they wanted firstly to OFFER IT (her choice of words) to us who previously worked part time on the project and had a fantastic performance. 

I couldn't believe the coincidence, showed my interest, and scheduled the interview with a partner. Interview went well and the whole time it sounded like they're just waiting to hire me.
At the end the partner asked me to send him the range of salary I would be satisfied with. I asked him what did they have in mind and he said they thought the salary could be similar to what I was paid on the project I did. 

Now, that salary would already be 100% more than I ever earned, but considering the job I would be doing will be tough, and also considering I got leverage as already proved myself, I told him I would want more than that. He said to send him the range and they will discuss it. 

Tomorrow morning I send the range where I raised the initial offer from 10-25%, thanking him for the opportunity and saying I'm ready to fully commit to this role. 

He replies that they will consider it and get back to me soon on the next steps. 

I haven't heard from them in 3 weeks, I have also sent an email a day ago, letting them know of my notice period and asking if there is any progress on the process. Still nothing...

Did I fuck up majorly by negotiating (I really just thought they were gonna tell me they're sticking to the initial offer in the worst case), or am I just getting paranoid?

- they seem to be very slow with the hiring process, as from the first time I was hired I waited more than a month before I revived any kind of news after the first interview 

- I also learned one of the guys from the project has already been hired. I don't have information if theyre opening one or more positions for this role.

- the company Is pretty green flag by any means, and my experience with them so far has been nothing but professional

1cu2czs,I feel like a failure. Help.,"I started college when I was 19 years old. i decided  to do a 5 year dual degree in BBA LLB (hons) course. things went amazing for the first two years (4 semesters) but eventually when my subjects became purely legal subjects i completely lost interest in my degree so i started trying to built my own various start ups. eventually after two years approximately and 20+ backlogs none of my ideas turned into fruition and my batchmates graduated this week. now i have to go back to college, sit with my juniors, focus on attendance while everyone i know is probably living their life. 

to go into detail about why I lost interest, i'm from India and when i did a few legal internships i saw how difficult and monotonous it is for a lawyer to scale their career. it takes atleast 10-15 years for an average lawyer to eventually start making good money. Most lawyers go around in a suit riding their 125cc scooter which is at least 15 years old. When i observed these things i completely withdrew mentally and the idea of law as a career option for me was over subconsciously. 

moreover, the vice principal of the college was a selfish, narcissistic, inexperienced, pretentious piece of shit. He constantly made rules and punishments that were against the entire batch of a particular course because a few people fucked up. for example: students with backlogs have to do 20 hours in the library/ semester and they'll be eligible for writing the final exam. we had to get the librarians sign after every session, so some students forged the signature and they were caught, and this VP instead of punishing the perpetrators punished everyone. He made a new rule that students with backlogs should now do at least 40 hours of library per subject along with maintaining 70%attendace in the backlog subject. 

with this rule, there would be clashes in the time table obviously. nobody cleared any backlogs nor passed all their current sem subjects either because everyone was trying to do a 100 subjects at the same time. no matter how much we pleaded he'd say no. He enjoyed his power trip. He even doesnt pay the teachers well. anyway the environment of my college was so fucked that it prompted me to pursue my start-up goals.

  
how do i deal with this situation? do i go back there and just get my degree?, do i start a new course at 24 years? this entire ordeal has messed up my mental health that i've become addicted to cigarettes and i'm constantly having game over thoughts",thelastkouros,1,1.0,2,1715943661,2024-05-17 11:01:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cu2czs/i_feel_like_a_failure_help/,5,2024

I ended up doing load of low level jobs lacking confidence and leaving jobs once I got bored or tied of the BS. I started making progress in 2021 after leaving a mortgage company where it had been particularly bad. By comparison the next job was good however it was family company and when director was diagnosed cancer, things started the fall apart with one member of team letting the situation allow him to run amok, and his actions led to me  having talk down someone from suicide attempt over the phone. After that having been approached by previous director about company merger with his brother I took him up on the offer.

A few weeks I was pulled in meeting and told to take paycut and demotion which brought me minimum wage(not factoring all unpaid work doing) siting me slamming a door when coming back in office one day. I had no other complaints and this came after another meeting where raised concerns of employee moral, high turnover and themselves having admitted toxic work environment had done nothing to resolve issue.

1cu0sfh,My boss says I should not tell anyone that I resigned,"Hi all

I submitted my resignation on Monday.  It's standard to give 4 weeks notice.

I work at a global law firm in Canada, and I am going to be an in-house lawyer at one of the firm's clients (but will be based in the UK).  It's an exciting move.

My bosses asked me not to tell anyone.  To be honest, I have no ill will or intent, and needed to communicate my departure to one or two close colleagues (because I am leaving the country and needed to tie up loose ends).  I also know some former co-workers were ""walked out"" of the firm because they refused to do work in their notice period - but that's not me.

What are the risks to me of having told one or two close colleagues?  I really just wanted enough time to tie up loose ends before I leave the country forever.  I understand my departure will be communicated one week before I leave, which isn't nearly enough time for me to say my goodbyes to my colleagues properly.",cupofjoe001,2,1.0,0,1715937108,2024-05-17 09:11:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cu0sfh/my_boss_says_i_should_not_tell_anyone_that_i/,5,2024

1ctzh9p,Should I pursue Sport Management or continue in medicine?,"My concerns/issues:

I’m about to start my sophomore year of undergrad as a Biomedical Sciences major at a large university. I’ve been super interested in the human body and medicine for years. In high school, I was president of the Health Science committee and earned a license as a clinical medical assistant. I was top of my class and didn’t struggle a bit with academics. The transition to college was rough for me though. I ended up getting a C in basic Chem and Calc 1 even though I’ve made A’s in both those courses during dual credit in high school. One issue that bothers me is that the classes have around 200-600 students on average. It’s hard to hear professors and feel like your problems are being answered. I’ve started questioning my future and found that I am not super passionate in pursuing medical school, but it is still something I want to/can do and something I feel like I need to go through with. Keep in mind for later that surgery is something I find fascinating and would love to do.

This past semester, I started researching alternate careers or different paths that I’d be interested in. I discovered a Sport Management degree that I can finish in a shorter amount of time than I would finish my Biomedical Sciences degree in. If I switch to this degree, I would most likely try to become an athletic director at a collegiate level. I love everything about sports and college football/baseball. This seems like something I would love to do. There would be less schooling, less tuition, no grad school. If I change my mind later on, I can still use this degree to get a Master’s in Kinesiology and go to PT school — kind of a mix of medicine and sports. 

The one thing holding me back is feeling like I failed. If I switch into Sport Management, I’d practically be giving up on years of dreaming of med school and becoming a doctor. Med school is by far more difficult. This major is going to be way easier than Biomedical Sciences and I think it would make me feel like I’m wasting my time. I know I’m smart enough for medicine… just don’t know if I want to stick it out. If I go to Sport Management route, surgery is off the table given that I at least do PT. 


Possible Solution:

I could try to transfer to a smaller school with smaller class sizes after the spring semester. If I do this, I’d stay on the med route. This might help with getting a better understanding of material in class & help to better focus. 




I apologize for the length of this post. I’m just very conflicted and feel like this is a huge, life-changing decision for me to make since this is the last year I’ll be able to change my major. If any of y’all have been in this same situation, I would very much appreciate if you could share how you handled it. Thank you.

1ctz9zq,Still applying while newly employed,"The title explains it: I got a good-ish job back in January after being laid off and out of work for 4 1/2 months. The people are nice but the job is constant chaos because the boss wants things done cheap and fast. Because of this, things fall off my plate too often which makes me look bad but when I am daily having to shift priorities and pull 9-10 hour shifts because work cannot fit into an 8 hour shift it wears me down. 

So I am still actively applying for work. I have spoken to one recruiter and he seemed concerned that I am applying for work despite just getting hired 4 months ago. I explained that I took the job since I was going to run out of unemployment in a few weeks and needed to take the only offer I received. I’m over worked and over qualified for my current job and I still have not found my ideal situation. Plus my compensation was a bit misinformed. I was told I’d receive quarterly bonuses. Well those metrics weren’t fully disclosed to me until I asked after not receiving Q1 bonus and it turns out only if sales are good (which I am not in charge of) and the company has enough revenue (again, not within my power) then I get a small bonus. Bummer because I was told it was performance and company based. 

So my question: does it look bad to potential employers that I am applying for work after only being employed for 4 months? ",Awshucks23,1,1.0,1,1715930363,2024-05-17 07:19:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ctz9zq/still_applying_while_newly_employed/,5,2024

1ctyp19,"Career advice, ENG 22 pass, lost, wasted around 2 yrs after btech, what to do next?","Hi, I am 2022 eng (ece) passed out. Worked in a MNC for 6 months in IT, then switched to a tech support role in another company and worked there for 2 months. Not interested in the IT field as I have tried myself adjusting in this field for around 1 year. Wasted 4- 5 months after leaving the second company. Now, working in a edtech startup from last 5 months in a digital marketing role and handling other stuffs of the business. Salary is also very less, even lowered than the first company i placed right after college. Now, I am also not liking working in this company, my constant worry is that how long would it take to get stable in the career, atleast 50-60k per month. This worry keeps disturbing me right after my college as I have lot more responsibility and know that I will be in a need of huge money in the next 2-3 years for my mother's health and other necessary things. This worry does let me do the things I want to do or not even let me spend time in one day particular job for a long time as my mind always tells me that how long would you do this job, there is no growth in this company. This kind of thing happening in every company i worked, and to be Frank I always get the role that didn't have any growth in future and thus i lost interest in the work in the initial months itself.

I am now fully confused career wise and I can't spend too much time figuring out my shit. I had of lot of interest in my college days and want to pursue so many different things, and even good at my academics but due to my financial state, accepted the job from my college in the mnc and things are not working in my favour after that.

Now. i iust want a stable iob which pays me atleast 50-60k per month and thus i am thinking of preparing bank po exams right now. I even started a little bit prep with eng and reasoning. Thought of cat as well but i am not able to take much bigger loan at this moment. So banking exam seems more suitable to me and there process is also bit faster compared to other govt exams.   
Also, i have a fairly good academics so i think i will be able to clear it 2 attempts max.  
Acdemics: 10th- 75+, 12th-93+ , Btech- 89+, work exp: around 1 yr combines (had a smalll issue with the epfo account as i abscond my second company)

My questions:  
1. Is it a wise optio to prepare for the bank exam considering my condtion?  
2. What would be other good options based on my background in which getting a job is little faster.  
3. I think i have some psychological weakness and mentally disturb stressed and disturbed as i am not able to stick with anything for a longer time. I find interest in everything (finance, economics, psychology, hindi literature, technology as well etc) so this could also be a potential reason for where i am right now.

This is a throwaway account… because too many people I know follow my main account and have biased opinions on this very situation. 

I have a degree in Advertising, but graduated in the height of COVID 2020. While I was in uni I worked a sales rep job and when i graduated finding jobs in advertising was basically impossible (considering I’m based in Melbourne especially). 

I landed another sales role as I just needed to find work. I’ve been in sales ever since. I’ve worked my way up & make a decent base salary ($90k) + commissions. 

Recently, I went for a role within an advertising agency, my dream role I was initially trying to snag when i graduated. I was successful, however the salary they’re offering me is $85k. Not a huge hit, but there’s also no commissions in a role like this. 

It feels like a no-brainer to take the dream job, but I’m worried about all my pre-existing financial commitments I have made based on my current salary + comms.

1ctxde7,Livid about an internal job rejection,"There were two openings in the booking department at my company that I have been wanting to transition to. I've been waiting a while for this opportunity to occur because it's not often that this department has any openings. I already work super closely with the department and I know the ins and out and how to do the job already. I know all the programs, all the people, all the venues we work with, everything. There were two open booking assistant positions that I interviewed for with the two managers of each position. I thought I was a clear great candidate and would get the job since they wouldn't even have to train me and they already know me. I've been at my company 2.5 years now. The managers that interviewed me I see all the time and am friendly with. Anyone at work that I told I applied for this job thought it was ridiculous that they just don't give me the job on the spot. 

  
Well, I didn't get the job that I've been wanting and they didn't even have the decency or respect to tell me to my face. I found out from overhearing a conversation. I heard one of the managers tell another coworker that the new hires were starting soon. I was fuming. The next day I emailed the managers and asked for an update because I wanted them to have to tell me. The reasoning they gave me was that they went with candidates who have previous booking experience. Which is a complete BS reason because this is an entry-level assistant position... if thats not the role thats supposed to give you experience then what its. One of my friends currently in that role never even had booking experience. So why is that fine for her but they cant hire me because of it. Also insane to me that instead of pulling me aside, she emailed me rejecting me even though I'm just a few feet away from her office.I also do actually have the experience but its old experience that I have where I booked my own shows. But I guess that isn't good enough for them. I even went ahead and learned how to create offers and showed them that I already took it upon myself to learn part of the job. And yet, thats still not good enough for them.

  
I don't even know how to move forward. So much of me wants to have a conversation with them telling them they could have at least fucking told me to my face and not wait for me to come in one day and just see the new hires. I want them to have to say it to my face and tell me why. I never wanted to leave this company because I love the flexibility, perks, and culture.

1ctx5er,Should I invest in learning CyberSec?,"I (31M) am currently working as a Web Developer for a SP500 company with a rate of $75/hr no benefits. I currently don't enjoy the company culture but I couldn't complain because the pay is good for me.

1ctx3yf,Lack of motivation at new job,"As the title suggests, I recently started a new Job that I was really excited about on paper. It was in a line of work that I really enjoyed and paid a lot better than my last job. 

I was at my last job for 2.5 years. When I started I was super eager and took on as much as possible. I loved the work I did and was finally starting to get some true responsibilities during my last 6-7 months there. But It was not the best environment. My co-workers and boss were not fun to be around. There was a 15 year age gap between me and the next youngest person on my team. I felt like I couldn’t relate or talk to anyone about anything happening in my life or things that were happening on social media, for example. After asking about a promotion and being ready to take on the next step, it was made very apparent that a promotion or even a raise was not going to happen anytime in the near future. My manager was brutal and made daily work a nightmare. She was a micromanager and had to check up on everything I did. Although I enjoyed my work I was always on edge. After deciding I had enough, I searched for a new job. 

That brings me to here. I started my new job a month ago and I have no motivation what so ever. I am learning new things but there is no motivation to learn the “why” to things, clean up my notes, and be present. I want to do well and learn as much as possible but I don’t have any motivation to do so. I work fully remote and was at my last job as well so it’s not a new concept to me. With this new job, I just want to sit there and let the time pass until it’s time to log off. It’s frustrating because I was excited about this new job and want to be excited for this new opportunity. 

Looking for any advice on what I could do to get some motivation back",aaalloy,2,1.0,0,1715921654,2024-05-17 04:54:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ctx3yf/lack_of_motivation_at_new_job/,5,2024

1ctuq8u,Looking for advice with previous colleagues,"Hi all! I am fairly new to the professional world and would like some advice on handling a situation with people I used to work with in a previous office. 

About a year ago, I decided to leave my previous office and left on good terms. I had worked with the people for a few years prior, but ultimately this role wasn’t the right fit for me. There was some things happening that didn’t feel right and after talking with a couple of my mentors they encouraged me to seek out other opportunities within my company.

I’m very happy in my current role and know it was the right move, but I still see the people from my previous office on occasion and they won’t speak or look at me. I’ve made an effort to try saying hello and catch up but I’m usually ignored. Or one time the response wasn’t in the nicest tone. As I was leaving the office I felt all this negativity from everyone even though now when I see my previous supervisor they are always kind to me. The office has a very close culture that I never felt I fit into well and it feels like they view me moving as betraying them.

As a young professional, I’m worried about my reputation in the field as it is very small. I know if I would’ve stayed my mental health and work life balance would’ve been terrible, but I’m sad it cost me some professional relationships and mentors I had for a couple years. In my current role I’ll most likely be having to work with some of them on a project later this year and I’m willing to be kind and civil but I’m worried it won’t be reciprocated.

1ctu384,24yo Nurse looking to possibly go back to school for accounting. Worth it? What should I do? Will it help me achieve what I’m looking for? ,"Background: Have been working as a nurse in a niche specialty (Operating room) for the past 2 years post graduation. I have a Bachelors in Nursing Science (BSN). I have also been doing travel nursing contracts to make much more than I do at my permanent staff nursing job at home. 

Problem: As you may know, working as a nurse is very stressful most days and it can also be very backbreaking work. Having people’s lives in your hands on a daily basis takes a toll on you physically and mentally. However, it does allow me to make enough money to live comfortably while also being able to save and invest. 

What I’m looking for:

All I want is a “boring” lower stress office or WFH job. Where I don’t have to worry about people dying on being disfigured on a daily basis. I have also always had an interest in finance/business/investing and I figure that accounting could possibly be a good choice as a second career that would give me a boring job, a decent income, and a possibility of being able to eventually WFH. Obviously, WFH is not possible with my nursing job as I need to be physically present to do it.

What I need advice on:

From how I see it, I have two possible options to achieve this. 

1. Accounting. Is accounting even worth it for me to try pursuing? Since I already have a bachelors degree I wouldn’t have to take nearly as many classes and if I do an all online program (looking at WGU) I could have it completed in less than a year and for not very much money (money isn’t an issue for sake of argument).

The only thing Im concerned about is a new grad accounting salary not being close to what I make as a staff nurse (70kish). I know this is location dependent but I don’t want to take too much of a pay cut for too long, I also do not want to relocate as I own my home/investment property. I would also like to be able to have an earnings potential of well into the six figures. More responsibility is fine with me for career advancement, I just don’t want to be in charge of peoples lives. Of course I would have to do more research on this for my area.

If I did choose this option and it failed for whatever reason or wasn’t what I thought it would be, I would still have my first nursing career to fall back on, essentially only wasting some time and money.

Or would it be more beneficial to persue the second option?

2. Stay in the nursing occupation but try to get an office job as a nurse at an insurance company or some other company where I do not have a clinical, patient facing role. I do know that this is a popular option but I am unsure if it would give me as much room for growth as accounting such as going on to get your CPA to further maximize earnings potential. 

I realize this would be an easier and less time consuming move as I would not have to go back to school, however I just feel like it will not allow me to grow my career as much as accounting would. I have no interest in furthering my nursing education such as MSN, NP or CRNA.

I would like to hear from those who have gone the accounting route or nurses who have landed office or WFH jobs. Thanks!

1cttsbs,Got a weird feeling about this digital marketing agency (looking for advice),"I've been freelancing my own clients all year. I interviewed with an agency today for the first time in a while. 

They said me having my own clients was a conflict of interest. Said I'll be handling 20-30 Facebook ad accounts, and want to pay me $50k. They also want me to work 12-8pm for 90 days because of our time difference (AKST to CST)

I worked for an agency last year that paid 10k more for a similar workload and didn't have any gripes about me having clients on the side or working a second job. $50k is barely enough to keep the lights on without a roommate in Austin, TX, where I plan on moving back to soon.

Flexibility is the reason I freelance and the reason I love working from home. I know I have enough time to handle a full time job, alongside my clients, and I'd appreciate a W2 job to offset my taxes, but I can't help but feel like this one is inflexible.

They seem to want me, but I'm not sure I'd fit into their culture. It came off as rigid during the interview.

Just looking for opinions. 

Do any of you work fulltime W2 positions and manage your own clients on the side? Or work part-time for multiple agencies?

Now I'm only 3 months into my new job, and I'm already starting to feel everything that I felt when I left my previous job. Honestly, except for a strict/condescending manager, the work life balance in my company (and the previous one) was good, so I'm not sure why I dread work every single day. The number of times that I've been thinking of quitting my full-time job and applying for a work holiday visa for an ""eat pray love"" kind of thing to find myself has been on my mind lately. However, there's definitely a fear of quitting a stable job and taking odd jobs for a year because I know that it'll be just as difficult to find another full-time job when I come back from my working holiday.

Should I really just quit my job and apply for a work holiday in case I'm more suited for the occasional part time jobs instead of a deskbound corporate job? Or how should I go about finding what job would truly make me happy instead of making me unhappy EVERY SINGLE DAY?

1ctt8vs,Advice on reaching back out to job after leaving suddenly due to mental health,"One year ago I suddenly left my job as an analytical chemist at a lab due to mental health reasons. I had been working there for 1 year when I realized that I was transgender. I had questionable mental health during that year but I took care to not let it affect my work. But after I realized I was trans I became almost incapable of operating on a daily basis. 

Over the next six months I got deeper and deeper into depression where eventually I couldn’t go an hour without contemplating suicide because of how much it hurt to pretend to be someone I wasn’t everyday. At this point I could no longer keep my workload up. I was falling behind on deadlines, leaving early, missing entire days just to rot in bed because anything else seemed impossible. Some point during this period I ended up telling my boss that I was depressed and implied I was experiencing suicidal ideation because I was asked why my work was slipping and I couldn’t think of anything else to say but the truth. 

I was too scared to come out at work (even though they probably would have been fine about it in hindsight). And when it became too much I drafted an email and sent it to my boss saying I was resigning effective immediately and sent it over.

Over the last year I have been to therapy, began transitioning, and been medicated and am the best I have ever been in terms of my mental health. I want to reach out to see if they would consider my reemployment since before it became too much to handle I was a good employee and received no complaints. But I don’t know how I should go about doing that.

1ctswqw,Hit hard by the reality that there is little to zero camaraderie at my workplace,"39M. Over the last 10 years or so of my life my personality has morphed into that of a much more caring, understanding and even sentimental person. As long as someone is fair and nice to me, even if it is someone I do not know well or even do not fully trust, I tend to go out of my way to be there for them in times of need. 

Two years ago I started a new job as a technician for a large company. A few hundred employees and I tend to work in different spaces and have gotten to know many different co-workers. It is a good job and most if not all employees get along, talk to one another about personal things quite often, and overall there is a good sense of friendships in the workplace, so it seems. However, I've realized slowly but surely that not all I had thought actually goes as deep as I imagined. To make a long story short, in the last few months I've made a few what I'll call innocent/forgetful mistakes, and it's been really hard to see just how little some co-workers who were there at the time of said mistakes gave a shit about it or how little they tried to help at the time.

At the time of one of the issues which happened to take place very late in the work day, there were two people who were with me-

One woman who I have spoke to very often over the last 2 years, while trying to be as nice as she could during said issue, instead of trying to go the extra mile to help me out, made two mentions of the fact that it was getting late and implied that she had to get ready to get going. As if the world would have come to an end if she had to stay a few minutes late one day out of her entire career. Meanwhile if it were her, unless I had a legit event to be at, would have done all I could until I realized there was no more to be done.

One other guy who I wasn't as close with but seemed very nice and who has been with the company for over 20 years, acted as if what was going on was a legitimate inconvenience in his day and wanted to make sure he got out at exactly 5pm on the dot and wouldn't have given a shit if I got fired or not. Within 2 whole minutes he informed me to call a manager about what happened instead of trying to rectify the problem a bit, even though it ultimately was found out by us that it was past the point of that. Point being, I wanted to try and do all I could to get out of the mess I was in, and all he cared about was making this go away and him getting home.

Not much to ask or wonder about. This is just one example of a couple I've seen. I guess this is more a rant about how it's sad to know that 99% of the time the only person you can truly count on in your life is yourself and most others are just out for themselves and really just enjoy your attention and conversation more times than not.",Interesting_Ad_9856,8,0.8299999833106995,10,1715907687,2024-05-17 01:01:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ctswqw/hit_hard_by_the_reality_that_there_is_little_to/,5,2024

1ctsqjf,How to deal with someone chewing you out,"Hey all,

I started a new job a month ago, and my 1-Up, is grilling me pretty hard on things where I don’t have full knowledge of systems or processes, so errors are bound to happen. 

I work in banking(not investment banking), and where I am fine with turning on the heat sometimes to get a point across, I think at one month seems a bit harsh. My 1-up barely provides any guidance on tasks, and I’m basically left to swim on my own. I have years of experience at another bank, so the core principals of the job are easy, but when you have no knowledge of the clients, or the day to day systems, or the situations the clients find themselves in, it’s very challenging. 

I am becoming a little frustrated, because I’ve managed people before and I’ve never treated someone like this, especially when they’re new. Mistakes are bound to happen. The full picture isn’t painted, and a month in you can’t expect perfection.

1ctrz98,Gap year programs for 30+,"Hi all,

Turning 31 in a month and since turning 30, I’ve been in an emotional state of regret. I’ve wasted away at dead end jobs for the last 10+ years with no real direction or end goal. Just did what I saw everyone else doing. 

I’ve come to envy those who invested in themselves early on, their hobbies, education etc. I realized I gave up all of my dreams and hobbies just to keep a dead end job. I have no degree and limited life experience. I have nothing to show for my life except working low level jobs in banking and e-commerce. 

I’m hoping to find a gap year program where I can be around a group of young people (around late 20s and 30s) where I can leave my state possibly the country to work (earn a bit of money) gain new skill sets and most importantly exposure to new cultures, people and travel. 

I’ve been in AmeriCorps and thoroughly enjoyed the experience however looking for something a bit better. I’m currently enrolled in online college and can do my course work from anywhere. Just need out of this soul sucking way of life and job. Please, any programs, internships, immersion programs, apprenticeships etc that would have what I’m looking for would be so helpful.

I really want a job were I can make good money because if Im going to be working for the next 40 years then I may aswell choose a job with high pay.

As of right now I see 3 options for me:

1. Become an MD: I dont have a problem with biology or medicine. The problem is I dont have a burning passion or interest for it and Im worried that if I stay on this path eventually I will realize its not for me and by then it will be too late to turn back.
2. Become a Nurse -> CRNA: This seems like the safest option to me I can transfer some courses and graduate in 3 years instead of having to start over.
3. Switch careers to computer science/math and work in quantative finance. This would require me to start over again and spend another 4 years for undergrad but I feel this is the one im most interested in.

1ctqzpd,Career direction for a recent electrical engineering graduate,"Hey there, I am hoping that I can gain some new perspectives by making this post and I welcome any advice that can be given.  I also apologize as this may be a slight rant.

I graduated with an electrical engineering degree about a year ago. When I was looking for jobs in my senior year frankly I was willing to take anything that would pay the bills. 

I am currently working as a product development engineer at a major appliance company on the east coast. My salary with bonus was around 80k this year and I am in a medium cost of living city. Also for added information I am 23 and I have around 30k in student loans.

I don't hate my job because frankly there is almost no stress. However, I find it very boring. It's not what I want to be doing and I struggle to get excited about most of the things I do at work. 

The things I have enjoyed the most through school and independent learning have been coding and digital design. 

I know I am overthinking things and I know I am young but I feel like I just don't know what to do with myself most of the time. I am afraid of stagnating and I feel like I am just drifting through life right now. I know it sounds cliché but I want some amount of adventure. I am single and don't feel attached to living in any one place. I feel like there is so much out there to see and I have been trapped in a very small bubble for most of my life. 

I am lucky to have parents that have loved and supported me a lot as I have grown up. Although I did not grow up with a lot of money and they could not support me much financially they have been there for me in so many ways emotionally. 

In school all I could think about was graduating and finally making ""adult money"" but I have realized pretty quickly that money does not go as far as I would like it to. After taxes and living expenses I am really not living it up that much. I am grateful that I have the luxury to be able to save money each month but it means that without being irresponsible I don't have that much to spend on hobbies. 

I don't know if it's because I have never had a job I really enjoy but honestly every time I think about money I just want to be able to put enough away so that I can retire early and spend time on the things I do enjoy. 

I really don't know what to do with my career I just know I am not where I want to be. I have been heavily looking into digital design and FPGA jobs and have sent some applications. Unfortunately, I have not had much luck as I either don't hear anything or I don't even get an interview. My current job is not very helpful to breaking into this field. Therefore, I have been trying to refresh myself on digital design and got a FPGA development kit to mess around with. My thought process for going into digital design is that it is something I enjoyed and is a code adjacent field if I am working with a hardware descriptive language which I also enjoy. In addition, from doing research it seems to be a very niche and well payed field of electrical engineering making 200k or more seems pretty easy to swing with experience. 

On the other hand I have looked into two other options. I have considered taking a government job with an overseas contract just so I could get the chance to travel. Though I would probably want to go back to private after I finished my contract. I also looked into trying to internally transfer to a different division. I am not sure how to make something like this happen. My hope would be that I could find something closer to what I want with a lower barrier to entry and still get a pay bump. I don't even know who to ask about this. It seems that you usually have to be at a company for a certain amount of time before you can transfer. 

I am kind of at a point where I don't know what to do. But I know I need to do something. It feels like I don't have many people to talk to about my situation because I don't know many people in my industry. 

A lot of people I have vented to always say that money is not that important. To be fair I know money will not make me happy. I really believe that especially once your basic needs are met happiness comes from within. I have been trying to work on being more comfortable with myself and enjoying life (though I am not always the best at it). That being said, money is a barrier to entry for a lot of things in life. I feel like there are so many things I want to try that require money. Like building a house, getting to travel, racing cars, karts, or motorcycles. I want to be able to have fun projects.

Currently in my free time, if I am not doing some productive like working out or trying to find jobs. I feel like I am not getting to enjoy myself. I usually just end up watching shows or playing video games which I honestly hate. It just feels like I am throwing time away into things that don't matter.  I want to learn things see things and meet new people. It certainly does not help that there are basically no young people where I live.

The honest truth is I am lonely, bored, and I don't really know what I am doing with my life. This has made me pretty depressed for awhile especially after I graduated as I don't feel like I have some big goal I am aiming towards. 

I apologize for this being such a long post but I really would appreciate any advice or thoughts that you have.

My boss (and probably best friend/closest ally at the company) was recently fired, and I was forced into his position with very little consultation and most importantly, no immediate raise in pay. 

I’ve been with the company for 15 years, and I’m also fairly close with the man who fired my boss.  When I asked what the new role means for my compensation he didn’t appear to be in the mood to discuss, he then f***ed off to Europe for 3 weeks.  He led me to believe a raise was coming but did not want to share specifics in terms of how much or when.  For the record, I DO trust him that I won’t be doing this job for the same money, but I’m still upset nonetheless. 

So here I am, 2 weeks into a job I didn’t really want and not being paid for it with no clarity in sight.  I was so upset that one night I reached out to a recruiter to start testing the market for me.

I worked as a contractor for a while which was the best job I ever had. Before that I got a really good offer at my internship job that I turned down which meant turning down a lot of money, but I didn't like it. That said, I felt I made a step in the right direction. Anyhow contracts end and I got my next ""dream job"" at the same organization but I hate it. I moved across the country for it.

I am so worried about packing up my life and moving to another location just to hate the next job. I know my current job has broken me hence grad school and applying to jobs with a paycut when I move because I'm so desperate to leave. I'm just so scared that if I get an offer at a job that pays less and I hate it again, the amount of defeat I'll feel will be unending. I want to buy a house eventually and I can't keep moving forever for job satisfaction. I'm tired and my dresser is heavy. I have 2 interviews in the next 2 weeks and recently got rejected from the job I really wanted at my same pay rate in a new city.

I don't want to be miserable again if I move and I'm familiar with my current misery at least. Advice?

1ctq3md,Looking for Life Advice!,"I pursued a career as a firefighter/EMT directly after high school and was able to secure a full time career, I quickly realized that this Job did not align with my long term goals for what I wanted. I never felt like I fully fit in with my Coworkers, as well as experiencing occasional blatant disrespect due to me being newer/younger. I understood that this was a part of the culture for this industry and kept my head down and continued to focus on my Job. I never was disrespectful back or reacted to the occasional disrespect. I genuinely enjoyed the aspect of my job where I could make a difference and help people on an everyday basis but the culture combined with the brutal nature of the job made me feel isolated. I never felt like I had the ability to talk to anybody about how I felt after “Bad Calls” and I didnt feel that any of my family or friends outside of work could understand how certain “Bad Calls” were affecting me. One call in particular that left me feeling isolated and questioning if I even wanted to stay in this career  was a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head of a man I found inside of his bedroom where we had to console his grieving wife. I buried those feelings deep inside due to the fact that I didn't want to burden my family or friends with such information because what could they even say or do to help me? I experienced countless more events like this where I kept them to myself until eventually I couldn't take it anymore. I eventually started taking Online college classes for a degree in Construction Management due to the fact that I was interested in working for myself as a general contractor and would like to have the degree as a backup and wanted to quickly find a lateral move out of my career for my own mental health's sake. I lasted for a little over a year when I eventually quit and began to try this entrepreneurial route that I am pursuing right now. I can only see myself working for myself within Construction/General contracting and can't ever really see myself wanting to pursue an official construction manager role for a company, Id still like to have a college degree for my own accomplishment/to always have that peace of mind for a backup but this has brought doubts as to whether or not I should continue to study Construction Management. My other interests for backups include Finance, something intellectually stimulating regarding problem solving and maybe something where I'd have more autonomy over my own schedule/possibly remote. Potential degrees I've looked at include Economics, Finance, Mathematics, Physics because of the wide versatility they all have.

I didn’t take any break in between so my work experience is limited.  

After starting my PhD I realized don’t really want to pursue a career in academia.

As someone with little to no experience in any type of corporate or software/business type role, how can I make myself marketable for such jobs? I am open to getting certifications and working part-time to get experience. 

Should I look into any of these: coding, software/data analysis certificates, sales/consulting experience, learning/obtaining skills pertaining to SaaS/CRM/etc. (also how would I go about doing this), or anything else you may suggest. 

I’ve known people with degrees in humanities or no tech skills at all find high paying careers in tech and software companies or other corporate positions. But this was a while ago so I’m not sure what this experience is like now. 

Also- would companies such as Salesforce or Oracle be a place I could start?

1ctnnx5,Seeking Career Advice: Stuck in a Stagnant Startup and Struggling with Job Interviews,"At the beginning of my career, I did some freelancing even before starting college. I easily got an internship and after a year and a half, I got a job as a Junior Software Engineer at an international company. It was my first time speaking English with people; before, I only practiced by myself and by watching TV shows and things in English.

Almost at the same time, about a month after I left the company where I was an intern, one of my superiors who really liked my work invited me to do some freelancing for him. He wanted to develop a SaaS. After a few months, he asked me to become a partner in the company, and he would cover what I was earning from him and what the international company I worked for paid me, plus the profits the platform would generate.

Two years have passed, the platform has users but still doesn't make any money, and to this day I haven't seen the partnership contract, the project is kind of stagnant, and I'm extremely anxious because I feel like the project could fail at any moment and I'd go down with it.

Back then, I was single and still lived with my mom, so I didn't have much to lose, but now I live alone with my wife.

I've been looking for an opportunity for about 4/5 months, only a few call me for interviews, and those who do, I can't get past that stage. I can easily do all the tech challenges I receive before the interviews.

I don't know if I'm conveying some insecurity to the recruiter regarding my stability at the company, since I left the company I worked for after a few months to try this ""opportunity,"" if there's something wrong with my resume, if I've gotten rusty in my English from not practicing for a while.

1ctlcjf,Which is the better job?,"Hi

Would like help trying to figure out which is the better job. Same industries, similar titles (new job is a step above in terms of title)

My current 

Jr Manager
$100k base + 15% bonus 
 4 weeks vacation 
RRSP matching 2%
Full benefit coverage (100%, no deductible)
$750 per year for each health practitioner (physio, therapy, RMT etc)

New role 

Manager 
$120k base + 15% bonus (they won’t put the actual bonus number in the offer. Recruiter says it’s usually between 15-20%)
3 weeks vacation 
No RRSP matching 
$25 deductible for any use of benefits, only 80% coverage. User pays remaining 20%. 
$500 per year for each health practitioner 

Which seems like the better offer? I’m also getting the second half of my bonus ($7500) at the end of the summer. This new job has said that they need me to start ASAP so I’d be forgoing this bonus as well as my year end review which make result in a raise/promotion. This review is set to take place in the next two weeks and the new job needs an answer by Tuesday. 

I’m also really wary about how they won’t note the actual bonus structure in their offer letter and they’re just offering it based off trust essentially. 

I’m really happy where I’m at right now. This new job I interviewed with a year ago (when I was not as happy, they also gave the job to someone else) and they just reached out again recently. 

There may be more of a growth opportunity at the new job, but there’s also growth opportunities at my current job, I would just need more experience. The new job would have me running larger scale projects however. 

Thank you!!!

1ctkxd1,How do I pick which road to take when they all lead to the same place?,"I'm posting this across a few reddits so please forgive me if one aspect is slightly off topic of the specific reddit.

I (18M) am so lost and I really don't know what path I should take with my career. 

Among the two growing industries, I've really been wanting to work in healthcare instead of tech because of it's growth in my lifetime, and because I really don't want to work with computers.

I'm also super disinterested in the type of education doctors and nurses and such positions have to go through. 

So without shadowing anyone, just based on my research, the two careers that I'm most interested in is, ultra sound tech, and healthcare manager. (And also I might try out real estate once I'm in my thirties and financially stable) 

How education for an ultrasound tech works is, you can either do a two year program, or, you can do a 1 year program if you already have an associates or higher degree in healthcare 

One of the degrees that allows you to take the one year program is healthcare management, a growing, well paying, stable looking job.

A rough draft of my future would be, get an entry level part time job in healthcare for the money and experience 

Get an associates degree with healthcare management at WGU which would allow me to get an associates degree within 6-12 months.

And then here's the part I can't figure out. I could at this point do the 1 year program to become an ultrasound tech, or I could continue to get a bachelor's and then masters in healthcare management, or I could do some mix of both, (which would be great) 

Additionally, I'm trying to figure out if I could get two degrees at the same time by taking overlapping courses. Like healthcare management and something similar like HR or Finance (I'm looking at finance more)

After spending all our savings and maxing out some cc’s I got a job last week at my previous employer.. with a catch.

Now the only thing I’ll be “engineering” are the toilets because they hired me for Office Clean-Up. Basically a Janitor.

Now I’m not knocking being a Janitor, a job is a job. And I am very thankful to my boss. But the stares I’ve been getting from my old co workers drive me nuts.

Honestly it’s humiliating and degrading. BUT as a future father and shitty husband I feel like I have to do this to support my family. 

Someone caught me eating a half eaten sandwich they threw away and that was even more humiliating lol

I can barely afford to pay rent plus food for my wife. Using credit cards to pay for gas.. I’m praying this is temporary. 

The problem is I also told my wife they hired me as a Sanitation Engineer… so there is that. Idk I couldn’t bare to tell her, her husband was now scrubbing toilets and mopping floors. And now I regret it so much…

How can I come clean to her. We have separate bank accounts so she won’t see my deposits and I’ve been telling her the rest of my paycheck is going into savings/stocks. Lately she’s been eyeing baby cribs and baby clothes and my heart has been sinking.

1ctj2vr,Do you think I made a mistake changing jobs?,"I went to college for a very niche job. When I graduated, I got the exact job that I was looking for, except it ended up being my worst nightmare. The job wasn't a set schedule, and I wouldn't know my schedule for the next week until a few days before. This did not fit with my lifestyle as I am a huge planner, and I have a family who likes to plan months in advance. I was constantly saying ""no I can't go, I have to work on weekends"" or ""I won't know until the Wednesday before when the schedule comes out"". I hated it. Not to mention, I was being told that I was getting setup to be fired. But that's a story for a different day. 

  
I knew I wanted to leave my job, but I wanted to stay in the same sort of industry that offered a 9-5 M-F job. I ended up finding one that I applied for in September. After the interview process, I ended up getting hired in November. Now that I have been in this job for a few months, I am starting to notice some red flags. I wanted to get your thoughts on if this job was a mistake, or if it will be worth it in the long run. 

  
Red Flags:

The largest red flag is when she threw me under the bus to a client. One of her clients called and spoke with me about making a change. I gave him minimal information and said I would let her know to contact him. I said there would be a change in price, but did not give specifics and said she would have to decide the price. He called her and said I told him an exact price which was way lower than what it should be. She called me and said ""NEVERRRR, tell a price to one of MY clients"". I was scared and said ""Yeah, I don't....whyyy? What happened"". She told me and then called me back later to read the email she sent him. I kid you not, she emailed this client, ""sorry about her, she's new and apparently not as much of a help as I had hoped""...

My boss has worked alone pretty much her whole life. She started the company in the 90s and ran it herself until she went bankrupt and had the current owner buy the company. I did some research once and it appears that she gave up all of the rights to the company 2 or 3 times, but it was hard to find information. 

  
She had about 3 assistants before me who all quit before staying a year. 

  
My boss has told me many times that she's ""not good with numbers"" when running reports and looking over bills. 

  
She never listens to me when I say I found an error. She always twists my words to make it seem like she didn't do anything wrong. I think most of the time she just doesn't understand, but that is a problem too. Whenever I make a mistake, she makes sure to call me out on it. Which is fine, I accept my mistakes. But she says ""I'm not being rude, I'm just saying"". Idk I just feel like that's a weird thing to say.

  
When I was being interviewed, she asked if I was willing to ask questions. I said ""yes, but sometimes in my current job, I get made to feel stupid for asking questions. Whenever I feel that way, I tend to not ask the question again even if I didn't understand because I don't like being made to feel dumb for asking.""  her response was ""honey, that is NOT a good trait"". I guess that's fair, and I respected her honesty. However, I told her this so that she understood I was sensitive to situations like that. Shockingly, she makes me feel stupid a lot of times.

  
Lastly, she is not  professional at all. She never wears a bra. Scratches her butt inside her pants all of the time in front of me. Her office is a mess. Her organization is non-existent. We ""owe"" money to a lot of companies because she can't keep things in order. (Really we don't owe, but she won't contact them to explain why and so the bill just gets bigger and bigger and she doesn't pay it) Etc...



Pros:

My lifestyle is great, I love my free time and never take it for granted. I am able to go to church. I know that's not everyone's cup of tea, but it makes me feel good every week. She is a very caring person outside of work. She has a big heart with non-work related things and always checks to make sure I am okay. The schedule is very flexible. The pay is much better. She is almost to retirement age, so I feel like she won't be here very long, she's also made it clear that the company can be mine if I want it when she leaves. The actual responsibilities of the job, I love.

  
Overall, I like the job. I just don't trust her. Did I make a mistake and start lightly exploring other options? Or should I stay until she leaves?",angel1813,2,0.7599999904632568,1,1715882035,2024-05-16 17:53:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ctj2vr/do_you_think_i_made_a_mistake_changing_jobs/,5,2024

Since growth in R&D is very much limited for those without a PhD, and even if I were to switch companies, the salary increments are minimal. I'm concerned about my financial future, as I can't sustain a lifelong career with my current salary.

I plan to settle down in a few years, and right now, I have the time and energy to invest in learning new skills, to switch fields if necessary. There have been thoughts in my mind to switch to Project Management, Bioinformatics, or learning a programming language.

Given my current job profile and the limitations in R&D without a PhD, what career options would be best to pursue? I’m open to suggestions, even if they are entirely different from my current field.

Is anyone else in the same situation or does anyone have advice on how to advance further in my career?",OhVerma,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1715880031,2024-05-16 17:20:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ctia5r/its_been_3_years_working_as_a_research_associate/,5,2024
1cti8o9,I took a job after getting laid off. The job is Red Flag City & now I'm stuck.,"I'm a content/digital marketer and last August my entire team was laid off. I spent three months searching for work to no avail and ended up taking a job at Trader Joe's to keep myself afloat until I found something new.

Fast forward to April and I was offered a Marketing Manager position at a small investment firm. There were red flags almost immediately (It wasn't ideal, but I was desperate):  


* I was only offered $60k (way below average for my metro area), and when I tried to negotiate I was stonewalled.
* There's no guaranteed raise during the annual review.
* Their last Marketing Manager was only there for a year before leaving in 2021.
* I've been there for just under a month, and my coworkers have already mentioned more than once that my boss is a difficult person to work for.
* My boss has demonstrated multiple times that he's the type who tests his employees without telling them he's testing them.

I'm now being asked to review and revise the current sales lead process in Salesforce, which feels beyond the scope of a marketing manager. I was certainly not told I'd be doing this during the interview process. I've worked with Salesforce quite a bit, but how should I, the marketer, know what process is best for the sales team?

I want to find something else, but I have two big problems:

1. I don't have a bachelor's degree, although I'm currently in school. I have 7 years of experience, but not having an actual degree has created a huge roadblock.
2. It was hard enough finding a job when I had a 7-month employment gap on my resume w/ no degree, but I feel like it's an even bigger red flag to employers if I put my current job (which I've only been doing for a month) on my resume. 

I'm not sure what to do at this point. I'm worried I won't measure up to my boss's expectations and lose this job, but I also feel like my current resume is a walking red flag to recruiters. So, my question is this: what would you do in my position?",MalleusMaleficarum_,3,0.800000011920929,7,1715879931,2024-05-16 17:18:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cti8o9/i_took_a_job_after_getting_laid_off_the_job_is/,5,2024

1cti0m6,Should I ask for feedback from a friend at work?,"I was transferred from my home country office to the headquarters in the US and have been working here for a year and a few months.

I've noticed that people have been acting strangely towards me, being unnecessarily rude and indirectly pointing things out.

**Situation 1:** During a weekly meeting with another group I directly interact with, someone asked the group manager (Manager 1) if a specific product was prepared according to the new procedure. I am responsible for this preparation. The manager replied, ""I hope so,"" while looking at me with a serious, questioning expression.

**Situation 2:** In a project management meeting, I asked if the spreadsheet dates needed to be strictly precise or if they had some degree of flexibility. Manager 2 replied that I must consult my teammates, using a not-so-friendly tone. The project manager, sensing the awkward response, said that the dates are very flexible.

In my last one-on-one with my boss, I asked for feedback. He said everything is fine and the only feedback he had was, ""You work too much.""

I have a friend who is also from my home country and is at the same level as my boss, Manager 1, and Manager 2. They all report to the same person. I don’t work directly with my friend and have limited work interactions, but he might have heard something.

Should I set up a one-on-one meeting with my friend to ask if he has any feedback? It's very frustrating not knowing if I am doing well or not. I really feel something isn't right.

1cthu9i,How do i feedback to my manager on teams morale ,"
Hi all,

I'm part of a team of five, including myself and our manager. We’re facing a high workload which I personally manage well and actually enjoy. However, my teammates, who all have families, have expressed significant distress over our current work demands.

It’s reached a point where team morale is noticeably low, and there are whispers of resignations on the horizon. I want to bring this to my manager's attention without overstepping or seeming like I’m reporting on my colleagues.

How can I tactfully and effectively communicate these concerns to my manager to help improve our team’s environment without betraying my teammates' trust?

Thanks for any advice you can give!

1ctgm56,How do I get an international Job? (Remote or willing to relocate) ,"

(Long text if you don’t want to read just answering the question is fine)

Yeah so literally that. I’m Mexican and live in mexico. I am graduating in July from a finance and banking degree and have been working since I started university, started in a administrative role in a national only company (I was lucky to be given this job), then I moved to a well known international company as an intern in risk and controls. 

The thing is I lived in Germany before college and had multiple jobs (In construction, bartender, waiter, etc.) that I even got a pretty cool job with the owner of the restaurant where I got to live incredible things with people from different countries but since then I have felt like my jobs here and even the exposure to growing professionally and in my personal life are too limited.

So my questions are, is there any chance that I can get a job (remote preferably because I love traveling but also would love to relocate somewhere in Germany, Spain, England, etc. for the Europe nostalgia) in my field (finance), administration or even something related to technology (I’ve been doing research in coding and AI as business developing that I find fascinating) but focusing only in international companies? 
If so… what would be the best the best approach? I mean like, pages to look for jobs, field considerations, resume improvement, companies I should consider, skills I need, etc.

Maybe it’s too dreamy and if it is I also accept reality checks :).

So, to try to sum this up, my life has been pretty chaotic and I found my way into working as a corrections officer for about 3 years, 3 hours away from where I grew up. I came from a life of addiction and terribly maintained relationships and corrections was a good counter to what I was used to. It provided me with the chaos I was used to while still keeping me on the straight and narrow. I eventually got promoted to Lt. And at the time of my resignation I had just gotten a raise. I didn’t like the Lt position, but I pushed through because on the rare occasion I got to do something, it was fulfilling. I attempted to go to the patrol side but that fell through due to misdemeanors I had expunged… I resigned at the jail and moved back to my home town and now I work with kids. This job is easy as shit. Everyone talks about how stressful it is but it’s boring. It’s not the chaos I’m used to. And I’ve become pretty sad lately. The simple answer would be to go back to corrections, but the facilities here won’t take me due to my record even though it’s expunged. I was very well respected as a CO, Sgt and Lt when I made it up the rank, and was consistently being told by patrol agencies that they wanted me when I was able to apply ( there was a wait time I had to endure before I was eligible for a POST license ). 
I am in school for psychology, and have no idea what I’m going to do with it when I graduate. How do I learn to love this job until I’m eligible for a post license? Do I even go back to LE? I feel like I left behind the only opportunity I had to succeed in LE when I left the field. How do I learn what I really want to do with my life? I feel like I’ll never be fulfilled. Corrections, especially as a Lt, wasn’t always excitement and fights with big bad criminals. Often times it was just paperwork and verbal judo.

1ctecml,Possibly at a crossroads with a career option. How can I leverage it for actual work I want to do in the future?,"I (26F) have been having employment issues for over a year despite having a masters degree in public administration/certificate in health administration and top grades (long story short I had two job that I was not qualified for and they hired me anyways, only for them to fire me afterwards a few months later leading to a gap).

I got to the point that I was applying to ANY job just to get the skills/references. And then I sent a general application to a religious elementary school I used to go to.

I had an initial call with them and it all went well. There were no administrative positions but there were open spots for assistant teachers in the Early Childhood Department for Pre-K.

Now this didn't bother me because:

1. I am close friends with someone who works in the department
2. My capstone was about children's education during distance learning and future economic prospects
3. I have extensive volunteer experience working in my local temples children's program and very good references
4. Salary (which can be $19 according to the school's Glassdoor) is not my biggest concern at the moment, my concern is getting work/references.

5)Schedule is flexible aside from departmental meetings

6) Doesn't require me to get any teaching degrees, only certifications in the state (NY) that I'm currently in.

However I am worried about the future as well because I hope to eventually move to Washington DC in a couple years, which will mean I have to leave the job eventually and find a new one. And I'm worried by taking this position as a Pre-K assistant teacher I'm nuking any chances of ever working directly within the policy world or for local communities.

My questions really are then:

1. Should I take the job if offered? Most likely I won't be starting until the 2024-2025 semester which starts in September. Which gives me three months not looking for a job in anticipation of working there. I live with my parents so rent and food is not an issue for now but it'll be a hard stop on spending. If so....
2. Should I take the job if offered but let them know if I get a position in my field by the summer more relevant I have to decline it?
3. If I take the job, how can I leverage it for work I want to do, especially since its an assistant teacher job for Pre-K? Just searching around I could get involved in my local religious community more when it comes to work but they also require office experience. What about writing samples? How could I realistically leverage this position for other teaching jobs with better pay in the future?Another option could be local community centers?",pretty-in-pink,1,1.0,0,1715869974,2024-05-16 14:32:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ctecml/possibly_at_a_crossroads_with_a_career_option_how/,5,2024

The Friday before I started, I was informed by the client I had to take a drug test within 48 hours in order to start with them. I had no problem since I don’t do drugs and got it done. within a few hours of that request. 

Well it came back positive for weed. I had been with my gf the night before and didn’t think much of it. I still thought I was fine because weed is legal in my state. Even through my company didn’t require a drug test and it was the client, my company proceeded to fire me.

The whole thing is so fucking stupid. Even if I did smoke, millions of people do and work just fine. Even more people are alcoholics and they don’t have to worry. I have been insisting it must be a false positive and I’m willing to take another, but I’ve received no response.

1ctbp0p,Having a hard time deciding which direction to go for work/career. Please help!,"I am naturally a very indecisive person and I find myself in a bit of a situation now regarding my work options. Sorry this is long. 

For a bit of a backstory, I (32F - living on an island)) have been working for a nearly 10 years now. I worked at Company A and it was great. I left after 6 years as they would not raise me. Joined Company B and it was a shitshow; i dealt with a lot of racism towards me and it ruined my self-esteem as a person and a designer for a long time. After a year, i went to Company C, thinking it was my big break as I would be a manager. Somehow, they ended up changing the scope of works without letting me know and expected me to go into Sales. I left and decided to start my own company and work freelance, which i was doing on an off while working full-time. 

However, I had applied randomly for another job at Company D and they ended up making me an offer. I took it because it was one of the best and established companies here on the island and I needed to regain a bit of my designer confidence back. It was hustle culture as soon as i joined; no handing over of 4 main projects that i was expected to take over. I did it through migraines, tears, lots of unpaid overtime and stress. My mistake here was maybe not be vocal enough about how i was struggling.. As you can guess, my health suffered and I decided to resign from the job before i completed a full year although i loved the work itself and the experience was extremely valuable. Surprisingly, during my three months notice as per contract, i felt like i could handle the workload and stress much better and it made me rethink my decision. 

Ultimately, I decided to leave nonetheless and was lucky to have 2 clients for whom i am working on a freelance basis currently. Now here am i, a month after having quit, working slowly as a freelancer. But, another Company E, contacted me since they have been wanting to work with me for a while now. My friend worked there for 5 years. He is also okay with me working part time at his but was very hot and cold during our conversations since February. My friend told me not to trust him but use him to my gain. So now i have the following options:

OPTION 1

Company D

- Go back and work on a part time basis 2 or 3 days per week or project based. 

- Freelance on my other projects on the remaining days

Cons: I had a fling with a consultant from another firm who works on the same projects i was working on right after I left the job. I would see him only during client meetings and that's all, he doesn;t work in the office. We had been texting and met up one night and made out but did not fuck. He has been ghosting me ever since (yikes - I know, don't shit where you eat, but it happened for the first time ever in my life - a lesson). I am not attached or whatever but is this something to consider? Lots of work. High stress. Director is a bit moody sometimes. 

Pros: Established firm since 25 years, high-end clients, great work experience, great colleagues. Having it on my Cv has already opened my networking. 



OPTION 2

Company E

- Work on a part time basis 2 or 3 days per week or project based. 

- Freelance on my other projects on the remaining days

Cons: The director pushed his 5 years employee to quit within 2 months (3 disciplinary meetings during that time which put a lot of pressure on the girl from what i heard). When she gave her month notice, he asked her to leave right away He had been wanting her to leave for a while but did not want to fire her so that he did not have to her severance, so he did everything he could so she would leave on her own. He told me at one point that if for any reason i could not join his company in June (because he cannot control things), he was sure I would have a place somewhere else or back at Company D. He has rescheduled our meeting to discuss work conditions twice now. He wanted me to start earlier than June now that he is down 1 staff and has too much to do, without us having discussed conditions. I said no and we are supposed to meet tomorrow afternoon to discuss conditions. 

Pros: His company is 10 years old and he says he is ready to take it to the next level. I would be his right hand a bit to help him grow his business. Smaller company, less projects, projects are not so high-end so less time consuming, less stress overall. 

OPTION 3

- I keep working for myself for a while and see how it goes. 

Pay and commute are basically the same for both. I wanted to have a part time job while I establish myself as a freelancer so i could have a steady income every month. My goal, although I am still not sure if i really want this, is to have my own company doing my own projects. But i don't know whether i actually like it or if I ma doing it just because i feel like it is the natural next step in my career at this point. I like having a routine and structure, which makes me think i like being employed too.

So I don't really know at this point. I have been thinking and thinking and thinking and I come up blank. I want to do it all and I don't want to do anything. So please, anyone if you can help, let me know your thoughts and advice!

There’s some opportunity for growth and I have a pretty good level of autonomy. 

I applied for this other job and had a really good conversation with the owner. We set up a formal interview for next week and they sent the job description along which contained salary and benefits applied for this other job and had a really good conversation with the owner. We set up a formal interview for next week and they sent the job description along which contained salary and benefits explanations descriptions. The job is paid hourly and capped at 40 to 45 hours. The high range of the hourly wage would be about $8000 less than what I make now annually. Also the benefits aren’t quite as good as what I have now.

The question is do I write them an email saying that I’m not willing to take a pay cut explaining what I make now and then don’t  go to the interview if they aren’t willing to match or exceed? 

I guess without talking to them and learning more it’s hard to know. I don’t know if there’s any room for growth or improvement in salary or benefits. But it’s about an hour away and would require relocation.

1ctbdxr,34/F. I suffer from crippling depression. I’m moving to France to be with my spouse and looking for advice on starting a career from scratch.,"Education: Bachelors and Masters in Business Management from well ranked UK universities.  
Work Experience - All in South Asia  
\- Fresh out of uni, I worked in marketing for an advertising agency.   
\- 3 years, as co-founder, at my manufacturing start up.  Had to shut it down late 2019.  
\- Post covid - Part time work, on and off, for my parents company, managing a small team. Analyzing reports, creating short term strategies, lead generation, performance evaluation etc.   


Hurdles:  
\- Due to my mental health issues, I feel like I’m rusty, don’t have any transferable skills and starting from scratch.  
\-  I’m unsure if my ’ancient’ work experience, counts at this point. I never worked in corporate. I don’t have ‘modern’ work experience.  
\- I’ll be in France and my french is at beginner B1 level at best. I’m taking regular classes though, would make a lot more progress in a year.   
What I’m looking for:  
\- 100% Remote work, however I am open to office work, as long as it’s not a corporate environment.  
\- Jobs with scope for career advancement/transferable skills. (I came across VA/Data Entry jobs but I worry if I can leverage this experience to something bigger or long term)  
\- My ideal job is somewhere I’d have to be a jack of all trades. I love variety in my work. Working with cross functional teams, different stakeholders would make me want to work 14 hours a day. However, I won’t be picky at this point. I’ll take whatever I can get.  


My ideas so far: 

  
\- I thought of getting a part time job in retail/restaurants/hospitality etc to build confidence and gain people skills. Is this a crazy idea given my circumstances?  
\- I’ve looked into online training courses on Coursera and Udemy and certifications from Salesforce to become an admin or getting into project management. I’m aware the competition for entry level jobs in these fields is brutal, but I can’t think of any other options.  
\-  I’m also interested in the healthcare industry. Is there a degree or course I could finish in a year or so that would get me an admin role in this sector? I’m fine with a caregiver role too but I’m deathly afraid of bodily fluids. Is there some sort of counseling, training, therapy roles I could get without a degree in science?

I’m open to suggestions for other career paths as well.   
I really appreciate any responses. Thank you.

  


Additional info - Personal struggles have made me severely anxious, introverted, and without confidence. I wasn’t like this 5 years ago.  
During Covid, I developed some mental and physical health issues. Let’s just say I’ve spent the last few years as a recluse, in a self imposed lock down.  I stopped socializing with friends, rarely left the house and couldn’t even get out of bed most days. I did some remote part time work for my parents company on and off, rather they pushed me to do it as they were afraid I might never get out of this rut.    
However, I don’t want to live like this anymore. I want to be financially independent and need to build a career.

1ct9e52,Career Advice Needed🙏🏽,"Hey everyone, I’m in need of some advice regarding how I can transition from my current career into the career that I actually want. I’m struggling to figure out how to do this so I was wondering if anybody would be willing to give some guidance.

So a bit of background, I’m 22 years old living in the UK, currently undertaking an apprenticeship in property maintenance. Since my days in secondary school, I haven’t really had a clue what to do with my life and I’ve tried a range of things: Going to university twice and eventually dropping out both times, then working a number of different jobs (retail, construction, delivery, restaurants, just to name a few) which usually lasts for 6 months before I get fed up and leave. I understand that my reason for leaving these jobs consistently aswell as dropping out of university twice is because I have no interest in the work that I’m doing, therefore it’s not sustainable.

I was somewhat interested in construction after doing labouring for a few months but wasn’t sure which trade to specialise in, hence why I went the maintenance route as you get to learn all trades on a basic level and then I could make an informed decision from there. However once again, 6 months later I find myself in the same predicament wanting to leave. The job in itself can be tolerable but the physical demands and being on your feet for 8 hours a day drains me and takes away from the things I like to do in my free time - the main thing being exercising and going to the gym. I come home and I’m too tired to do anything but lay down, sleep and prepare for the next day. On top of this I don’t see much career progression past a certain point, other than a management role, which doesn’t interest me and also won’t provide the salary or work life balance I’d want for my future. 

One career that has been in my mind for the past few years is software development and for many reasons. One, I like to build things, and software development will allow me to do so in an unconventional way, as in I don’t have to physically build things but rather mentally, which will keep me stimulated enough to somewhat enjoy the job. Secondly I believe once I get to a certain point in this career, I will have a greater work life balance, a much better salary and overall improved quality of life than if I were to stay in my current role. Third, I studied computer science at GCSE and got a high grade but still struggled with some aspects of coding, so I gave up and never took it further. Now I want to return and develop these skills - Over the past 3 years, I keep finding myself going back to coding and spending 2-3 hours a day learning new languages on websites like Codecademy etc and it comes fairly naturally to me since I’ve done it in the past and I actually kind of enjoy it but then I get caught up with life and I forget about it for a few months before returning again.

Im not entering this field as a get rich quick scheme, ideally I want to land a degree apprenticeship which will take 3-5 years, but will give me all of the fundamental knowledge, qualifications and experience that I need to become a full fledged developer. I’d personally rather do this than go the self taught route, although I’d still consider it.

So my initial plan was to spend the rest of this year studying 2-3 hours every day and building upon my basic knowledge of a few programming languages and then applying for some apprenticeships but there’s some problems that I’m going to face. 

I’m already enrolled in an apprenticeship, so to land a new apprenticeship this year I would have to leave this current apprenticeship within the next few months, find a normal job and then apply for some software apprenticeships when positions open up, however this will add ANOTHER 2 jobs on my CV that only lasted 3-6 months and will kind of show the employer that I’m not committed - I have nearly 10 jobs on my CV since 2018 and all of those have lasted 6 months so it’s a repeating pattern.

My other option is to finish this current apprenticeship which doesn’t end until December 2025, which just seems super long to me and I’d much rather spend that extra year and a half working towards my software career plus the job is genuinely starting to make me feel depressed. However, completing this apprenticeship will show my future employers that I can be committed to something and I’ll also have an extra 1.5 years to work on my coding skills further, so there are benefits.



What should I do? 

Is it even possible to land an apprenticeship this year with only 6 months to teach myself the basics?

Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

I’m an ACCA(like CA) although I haven’t cleared all papers but I still managed to get into companies like Amazon and Deloitte in the UK as I studies for my qualification there. Somewhere along the line, I lost interest to pursue the course to completion due to being busy with work and life. 

During COVID, I got into an unhealthy relationship and got into a team with a hostile team lead. Both sent me into so much anxiety and depression, developed a binge eating disorder. Decided to return back last year and pursue fitness training or teaching ACCA, also wanted to be close to my immediate family. 

Now that I’m here, I feel like I’m behind my peers and societal pressure to get a corporate job. I started taking ACCA classes and train Pilates in a major gym, but it’s only fetching so much money. Like 25 to 30k month so to speak, obviously it’s part time and like a 10 hour commitment a week in total with travel n prep. 

The corporate culture here seems so stressful from what I’ve heard from friends who work in Bangalore where I’m based.

""Hi (ex_boss), I'm getting on okay, thanks for asking. I hope yourself and the team are doing well. I've just got back from training today, so have had a little time think it over. I'd be interested in rejoining, however I am currently on the reserve list for (ex_company) down in (new_location), so ideally I'd be wanting to hear back from that first. ""

I'd also like to add in about being better compensated if I decided to rejoin, and perhaps reword it better.

1ct7opm,"Boss ignores me, barally speaks me and ignores my messages","I’ve been having issues with my boss barely talking to me since I joined a new department. He doesn’t provide direction or feedback on projects and rarely responds to my messages. We’ve only had one in-person conversation in the past year, which was when I requested to return to my previous department. He only talked to me then because I bypassed him, and he was angry about it.

I was promised a raise and training by him but never received either. When I reminded him, he said there was no budget for a raise, despite telling me I was doing well. Meanwhile, my coworker has received two pay increases this year, while my salary has stayed the same.

I feel angry, frustrated, and unappreciated. It seems like I’m being discriminated against compared to my coworker in terms of feedback and work conditions. I know I’m skilled and hardworking, often going above and beyond without any training or assistance. I’ve proposed improvements and exceeded expectations.

I’ve asked for one-on-one meetings twice, but he skipped both. Although it was agreed that I would return to my previous department, he hasn’t responded to my message about discussing it.

1ct7diz,Need Career Advice in Australian Construction/Property Development,"Hey Reddit! Long-time lurker, first-time poster here, so bear with me!

I’m reaching out to see if anyone here has experience in the Australian construction industry, particularly those who have moved into property development. I'm wrapping up my final year at a G08 Uni in Sydney, studying construction management and property, and I’ve got just one term left before graduation. My current average WAM is sitting at around 89 including one subject where I received 100/100.

A bit about me: I'm in my late 20s and a mature-age student with a previous five-year career in data analytics and related fields in the corporate world. I migrated to Australia alone about ten years ago with basic English skills and got a late start in my professional career. Despite these challenges, I've always been driven to advance and make the most of my circumstances.

So, I’ve shifted gears to construction and have been working as a cadet with a well-known tier 2 builder since last year. I've had rotations in site management and site engineering and received great feedback. Now, I'm in contracts admin, which I thought was my ultimate career path I wanted to focus on , but it’s been rough.

The guy above me in contracts admin is making life tough—constantly criticising me in front of the team, keeping me out of important emails, and just generally blocking my growth. It's got to the point where coming to work is a drag. Plus, the work itself isn’t as fulfilling as I hoped. I miss the networking, the meetings, the kind of work where I can produce a report, build spreadsheets and give presentations—more my style than the daily grind of quotes and contracts.

So, I’m thinking of moving into property development. I like the idea of handling a project from start to finish, from land acquisition to OC and it seems like it could be a better fit for my skills and interests. There are a bunch of grad roles opening up in July with some top-tier developers, and I’m gearing up to apply—doing my research, prepping for interviews, even taking some elocution lessons to sharpen my interview skills.

Here’s where I need your advice:

1. **Quitting the Cadetship:** Is it a bad idea to leave my current cadetship in July to focus on landing a development role? I’m pretty burned out and could use a break before jumping back in. My only concern is when(if) I make it to the final stage of the in-person interview, it may show I did not show commitment to the cadetship.
2. **Sticking it Out:** Should I just stick it out until at least September(when the final interview stage is expected to take place) to show I can commit, even though the toxicity is really wearing on me?
3. **Fit for Development:** Given my background and skills, do you think I’d do well in a development role at a major company? It’s likely to be a competitive and high-pressure environment, but I’m ready for the challenge.

Thanks for reading through my novel here! I usually keep to myself about work stuff, but this situation has been increasingly tough to handle. Any advice or insights would be massively appreciated!

Cheers and have a good one!",Ambitious-Swing8686,2,1.0,0,1715844647,2024-05-16 07:30:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ct7diz/need_career_advice_in_australian/,5,2024
1ct7asq,How do I escape the IT Support Engineer role? ,"Hoping someone can help me iron out my thoughts on this because over the last few years I have felt like I am stuck with no direction, drifting from one support engineer role to another. 

I have a degree (video game design) and at college I studied media arts, I also have an A+ and Network+. For the past 6 or 7 years I have been mainly doing support across a few different companies and while I don't hate the role I don't consider it to be moving up, instead I feel like I am more or less moving sideways. 

Here are my questions:

How do you escape the support role? I feel like once you're in, it isn't something you can move up from in a company. 

Should I seek to do self learning (Udemy etc) or look at going back to Uni? Or should I just start applying for roles outside my 'comfort' zone should we say.

What I can't handle is someone getting up my grill for not doing something quickly at the pace they would. 

I can't handle that same person not getting after one of my co-workers for constantly being in that persons office, talking, not doing her job. My coworker taking smoke breaks every other hour, plus taking other breaks and a full lunch. That same coworker, consistently entering data incorrectly and missing steps. 

We all make mistakes, I don't fault that. But if I'm slow on a task I get someone coming after me, but the person who just doesn't do it nothing is said?

There's also someone else my workplace who is just.. completely unkind to everyone. She's been doing her job for a very long and has a lot of knowledge and skill. But she treats everyone like crap.

Between those two people, dealing with the public, and low pay, I'm struggling to find a reason to stay. Problem I have is that, everywhere I go the same cycle repeats. 

I can't handle unkind and inconsiderate people. Does anyone have any tips to handle it? Or know of a career that would allow me to work more or less by myself without interaction?

The offer I have on the table from another company I would start at $30 an hour with potential to make mid 40’s after time served. This positions hours would be M-F 7:30-4pm day shift. It’s is a much smaller local company. The insurance is more expensive and the 401k match is 4%. I am also in college and would have more time for school with this job and a lot more family and personal time. If anyone else has been in a similar position I would love some input if the pay reduction and higher  benefit cost would be worth it.

- Schooling/training can be completed in less than two years (low barriers to entry)

- Will not likely be replaced by AI at least within the next 10 years

1ct3ywq,"Is it justified for me to want to quit, or am I just weak?","Hi all, I am a SWE with 10 YOE. More background about me: Generally a low profile person. I get things done. I working very independently and bosses/stakeholders/teammates I work with like to work with me. I always share useful code and mentor the junior members.

Recently I joined a Global US bank that has been restructuring (you probably know which one). I was hired as a senior individual contributor based in Singapore. My entire team is based in US/Mexico. My boss is in US too. Based on the interviews and job description, I was hired to support the global technology function with close proximity to Singapore should the need to support Asia arises. I enjoyed working with my boss and my teammates are generally nice although I only see them for 3-4 hours every week due to timezone difference. I enjoyed solving difficult problems and I'm ok with the red tapes associated with getting those things approved since it's a bank.

In the past 6 months, here are the changes:

* Instead of 1 boss, now I have 3 bosses. Boss A was my original boss and he gives me my usual Book of Work. Boss B is my ""actual"" boss in the chain but he's just helping me with administrative stuff like leave approvals. Boss C is a MD based in Singapore. I dotted-line report to her as well.
* Pressure from Boss C. She didn't interview me. She was recently demoted down into her current role. During my first introduction with her, she spoke about a couple of heavy things that I am hearing for the first time.
   * She wants me to be the ""guiding light"" to help uplift the department that she is heading.
   * She wants to promote me even thought she has never met me.
   * She wants me to set up infrastructures in Singapore. She will support me in terms of sponsorship and using her seniority. For the rest, I'm on my own. (To clarify, we do have a lot of infrastructure set up for global usage. But she wants her department in Singapore to become a satellite for the region.
   * I have to attend the senior leadership meeting and share updates with no teammates backing. Boss A sits in US so he can't attend. I have to set up working group on my own to lead these new efforts.
* I work 50-55 hours per week due to the timezone difference. On 2-3 out of 5 weekdays, I work from 10am to 12 midnight. I don't eat dinner with my wife as often as before due to meetings. I have very low energy. Low libido.

I never asked for any of these. As I said, I'm a low key person and I hate being high profile. I'm happy being a senior IC. I have no aspirations to be promoted to senior management. I am struggling so hard internally because deep down, I know that I can do all of the above if I tried very very hard but I don't really want to. I want to give up and quit but I feel like a weakling for thinking of giving up.

1ct2pnt,Asked to fix issues related to an improper write-up,"I was given an official write-up 6 months ago.  The problem with the write-up is that the actions I was written up for occurred before I was in my current job.  The actions were specifically related to my current job.  I provided evidence (including the documents signed by others) and ""inconvenient"" facts like the dates of the agreements and the date of my transfer.  Asshole Leadership didn't care.  They needed a scapegoat.  I was convenient. They slapped me on the wrist.  Honestly,  questioning my actions was more painful. 

I am now being asked by leadership to help ""fix"" the problem.  Basically, it would take me less than two days to complete the task whereas it would take leadership  more  than two weeks.  The person fixing the problem is different from the assholes who gave me the write-up.  My sources tell me that this person thought writing me up was absurd and incorrect. 

One part of me wants to say screw you.  Another, more logical part of me thinks I should just do it because it would reflect positively on me and if the Leadership asshole group ever tried to bring the issue up again, I am insulated because I was asked to help solve the problem.  To be clear, I am just to provide the documentation to be reviewed and signed by others.  But, I also was screwed before.

Leaving is not a near term option.   There is a big bonus to stay for 18 months.   They know I have a retaliation case if they try to get rid of me.  My last performance review was not completed, so HR would have a fit for not following process.  The one before that was excellent.  The one before that is again missing.  All others are excellent.   They can't show a performance pattern (a big issue to our HR folks -- a few years ago another employee, who rightfully should have been fired, won a lawsuit against the company because of poor documentation of poor performance),  So, getting rid of me would be difficult as long as I am not stupid.

1ct2pg4,Current job lacking growth opportunities/won’t acknowledge my potential,"Relevant info: I’m about to turn 23 years old and I’ve been graduated from my Bachelor of Commerce degree for a little over a year now.

I’m currently working an administrative position at a local organization. I was slightly overqualified for position when I applied (it didn’t require a Bachelors), but it’s similar to roles I’ve held and I’m good at admin work. I really like my team and the organization’s mission, but right now I’m really torn on how they handle my opportunities for career growth at the org. I’ve worked there for 9 months now, and consistently received great feedback from the whole team - I’ve been willing to take on anything (in or outside of my job description), super efficient and accurate in completion of my assigned tasks, and all around an ‘amazing asset to the team’. 

SO: the team recently had a position open up for a role 1 (maybe 1.5) step above mine. Based on the role’s job description, I fit the requirements (one of which is a Bachelor of Commerce) and I already do about 25% of that job within my existing role (a higher % of it now that the position is vacant). I expressed interest in the role, and was originally met with positive feedback, but now it has shifted to “Well, we’re just not sure we want to give that role to such a ‘new grad’” (even though there are zero years of experience required in the existing job description). We are a small (8 staff) organization, so this is the only position I ever saw myself moving into as a promotion opportunity.

Today, I talked to my manager about the potential to gain a new title/responsibilities within my existing role (if they didn’t want to give me the open, higher level position). My manager (who is Director level) said “it’s a lot of work to request the position title change through the Board” and they “couldn’t promise anything but would see what they could do”. 

This response, frankly, just doesn’t feel like enough to me. I am confident that I could excel in the open role, I have proved it, and I know they REALLY don’t want me to leave the company (I have been told this).

I have not worked in almost 4 years after having spinal surgery and going down the wrong path.  Thankfully, I have a supportive wife and kids and am back on my way up.  Prior to the surgery, I worked about 5 years in IT including Mobility (Wireless phone) support and tech support including supporting some basic VOIP Telephony.  I have retail and outside sales experience that dates back 20 years now.  I have 96 college credits from a good community college in Biology and Computer Science.  Just not a degree.

I have about $4k to use to get my skills together and get back into a worthy career.  The thing is that I really need to make upwards of $90k a year. (VOIP would pay that or more but my skills aren't up to par for what they need) 

I am looking for something that is led by a live instructor preferably online remote and can be completed in less than 6 months if possible. Interested in in person instruction as well.  Any ideas and programs or certifications or whatever you recommend would be greatly appreciated! ty! Located \~40 miles from NYC.

1ct1r9f,New job is becoming a nightmare. How do I handle a passive woman and angry boss?,"Throwaway account. I started a job 2 months ago in marketing. This role was a huge step up in my career and I was thrilled. My team seemed great and the schedule was hybrid with majority remote. That’s all changed now. 

A senior employee who oversees me seemed really cool at first. She’s 44, I’m 28, and we hit it off. Shortly after me starting, she changed for the worse. There’s instances she talks to me in a passive tone, rejects my ideas, and talks to me like I’m a child (literally). I’m now only civil but nice. 

This week, I asked to meet with Director to discuss a schedule for my son who will be on summer break. I was NEVER (not once) given a set schedule nor expectations of days to be in. I asked numerous times. Naturally, I followed my teams suit which is 1-2x in person. Well, Director and Sr employee met with me and said they want me in office 3x a week. Which is no issue… had I been given a notice when starting. I assumed the flexibility would allow me to be home during the summer more. 

Now I’m scrambling to find child care and everything is full. I asked my boss if she would be willing to 2x a week due to this situation and she got upset with me and firmly told me “We like you but we need to find a solution. At the end of the day, this is a business.” — **to add, they all joked about how often I went in person at my old job and I have it made now.** 

I’m very upset and overwhelmed. I feel like they did a 180°. I’m timid and hate confrontation. They both seem annoyed with me. Am I over-reacting?

I worked in a retail pharmacy for about 3 years for  Walgreens  and I really liked all the experience I learned. However in April unfortunately I had a really bad health issue that prevented me from going to work as I physically couldn't really leave my house. Now in the previous job we were only allowed 5 unexcused absences and I already used up all being sick. The work schedule was made like 3 weeks in advance so I couldn't even request time off if I was sick and I couldn't get anyone to cover my shifts. I missed about a week of work then I had another week off that I requested months ago for vacation. I couldn't even go my vacation due to my health issue. 

When I came back from vacation I told my job I wouldn't be able to return due to my health and they were upset I didn't give a 2 weeks notice but even if I did I wouldn't be able to make my shifts. I understand a notice is professional but at the end of the day I would have just kept accumulating absences making things worse. They kept me on the schedule for about a week and then took me off. Its been about 3 and half weeks since I was first initially sick and I'm a lot better now. As much as I enjoyed being home and resting I do need to go back into the work force as my bills are piling up. I have a job interview next week and I wondering how to explain to this new employer why I left my previous job but I don't want to come off as unreliable.

I recently was hired at a spa and ended up quitting due to other circumstances. I still haven’t received my paycheck due to their really crappy payment system, and upon emailing them I mentioned that the day they interviewed me they began training me for a few hours after telling me I got the job (I didn’t clock in for these hours as they had just hired me and didn’t set me up in the system yet.) instead of my interview lasting 1 hour, it lasted 4 hours with training. He told me he was not able to pay me for that day as it was just an interview and observation of skills day? What the actual hell does this mean? I told him I would take it to the labor board if he doesn’t pay me for those hours that I didn’t agree to work fully. Am I wrong? Not to mention he misclassified me as a 1099 instead of W2 employee.

1csx508,Looking for opinions - to stay or to leave? ,"Hello fellow redditors,

Wanting to ask your advice on this.. as i am in dilemma 😬
Sorry for the wall of text, i tried to compress it as much as possible. 

I am actively job seeking atm. 
Am now working in a corporate design job, i was in this company a few years ago, and left 7 years ago due to toxic management. 
I was put on PIP at that time & left after a fews months, without any job lined up. 

I went back there 1.5 years ago, as my good colleague poached me & told me that the culture is better now (good people manager & support).. bad decision on my end. 
1 year in, things were really great & i was really happy to be back. 
Then there was change in the team, and sales were declining, so it has been a stressful time for me, as my workload doubled up within a short period of time - lots of overtime & weekend work. 
On top of that, they put me on a coaching plan for 8weeks. 
Basically i have to improve, and if not, i will be put on PIP. 
I have been working my ass off the past few months, there were lots of nights where i cried & felt like a zombie coming home from work. 
The outcome of my work have been great imo, and everyone can see that. 
But some feedback from management is that there are still things to be improved. 

Towards the end of the coaching plan, team leader said that seems like nothing bad will happen, but its pending review from hr & upper management. 
I also told her that i have been working above & beyond & she acknowledges that. 
It is still pending now, as some people are away. 
Apparently my manager (my team leader’s manager) is also going thru the similar thing (she is put on PIP). 
She is taking a personal leave now & heard rumours we are unsure if she is coming back 😰

I have been interviewing in some companies. Most of them were unsuccessful. 
I had a 2nd interview last week & the decision will be made this week. 
My only concern is: they keep saying it is a high pressure fast paced role, as it is quite a small team, they are a serious fun company. They also need employees to be on site 5days, no flexible working. 
It takes me 1,5 hour to get there (one way). 
And the pay is lower than my current (they asked whether im willing to take paycut at 1st interview). 

If my current situation is not as uncertain, i wouldn’t probably take the role if offered.. 
But because it is really uncertain now, in this current job market - I dont know if i should just take it when offered & if it gets too toxic then i can always look for another role ? 

Thank you so much in advanced 🙏🏻

The two career paths I have in mind would either be Nursing or something in the IT field (I know two very different options). I never got my college degree but I did take a semester of community college before stopping due to family issues, so I do have a few college credits put towards an IT degree, which would be a decent paying job (although in our current rural area there are very few well paying jobs in the field). On the other hand I wanted to also pursue a nursing degree, my plan would be to obtain my CNA license in a 6 week course my community college offers and work as a CNA (making similar money as I do now) while working to obtain my full on nursing associates degree and earn closer to $80,00 per year according to glass door with hospitals near me.

1csvnnp,How to navigate being fired in interviews?,"As title says. 

Was recently fired from a company I loved because of my extremely toxic manager who would not let me grow or put my skillset to use. Long story, but that’s about it. 

Now, in interviews, I am asked if I am still with X company. When I answer truthfully, it’s been met with a bit of skepticism, with some managers asking outright if I was fired. 

How do I navigate this professionally? I’ve been sticking to “My employment with X Company ended on X Date. After much consideration, my former manager and I decided the role was no longer the best fit for my skills and my career” but wondering if there’s a better way to say that. 

TIA. Job hunting sucks.

1csuu8i,How do I deal with a language barrier with a new coworker when communication is practically the whole job?,"I am in a team of a total of four people, working at an elementary school cafeteria where I am constantly communicating with everyone. I am what you call the ""head"" person in the cafeteria. I collaborate with all teachers, students, principal etc. I'm basically the person everyone comes to for things. When my old coworker had to leave, I was part of the interview process for finding a new coworker. We interviewed several people and I had no concerns with any of the other candidates. But they decided to hire the ONE person I said was going to be hard to communicate with because they speak broken English. I had already voiced my concern heavily about this before they hired them because this job is very fast paced and I wanted someone who could communicate with the kids. Admin said they'd check her references to make sure she'll be okay, well..... I've been working with her and it's not okay. 

You're constantly having to talk to people all the time, dealing with kid's issues, talking to the teachers, counselors, parents etc. Don't get me wrong, this person is very sweet and I have nothing against them, but it's making my job (and my other two coworker's job) stressful and she's refusing to do certain things and will let things slide because she, and I quote, ""doesn't understand."" Everyday it's always ""I don't understand you deal with this. I didn't understand them. I don't know what they are saying,"" and she will come get me to do the job for her, or ask the same question three times because she doesn't understand. 

I've been in my job for four years now and I hate to leave, but I don't know how to go about bringing this up with anyone. I'm at a loss on what to do, because part of me knows she can't help it, but on the other hand... she can't do the job correctly because she doesn't understand, even if it's explained several times. I worked with someone last year who could speak two languages, but their English was wonderful. I've never been in a situation like this where I can't communicate with a coworker because they don't know enough English.

1csubs5,Got a Fulbright. Crazy to take it?,"Hi!

Never thought I would be posting this.

I just won a Fulbright to teach English abroad, which has been a life goal that I generally had as on the backburner. The kicker is, the salary is about $10,000 for 9 months of work - where my expected earnings otherwise would be about $60,000 annually, which is around what I currently make ($45,000 for 9 months, benefits notwithstanding). Both living in the US and doing the Fulbright abroad, of course, have expenses, and expenses in the US for housing/groceries/etc are considerably higher. All things considered, let's say I pass up on $30,000 for the Fulbright - if somebody told me to pay $30,000 to go abroad, I would say hell no!

I'm currently an independent consultant so I have no job to lose - it's very easy, in fact uniquely easy to pack up and go for a bit, I don't have any significant other or any other reason to need to stay in the country. I plan on finding secure and gainful employment at a salaried position after, and I think the Fulbright could do wonders for my career and expose me to incredible things - but it still is a lot of money to not be making. Any insight? Thanks!

1cstyf3,First time negotiating. How to one year in?,"Hi all,

I'm just going to dump my brain out here. Never been in this situation before so bear with me, I just need clarification on what are realistic expectations in this situation.

I graduated last may with a bachelors in graphic design. Had a job lined up that I've been working at since. Starting salary was 50K, average for entry level in the area is ~55K. I just took it since I didn't think I had any negotiating power at that time (still not sure if I could have asked for 5% more or whatnot).

So my annual review is coming up at the end of the month. Now before going for a degree I did play around with gd as a hobby/freelance gig and I think that extra experience has really paid off in this job. My boss had a casual conversation with me where we discussed my annual review coming up. They had nothing bad to say, the big takeaway being that for a new college grad that I've done so much in such a short amount of time to such a high standard. There was more to it, but the conversation got me thinking and feeling like I am punching above my own weight. I've definitely blown past the expectations of the entry-level role. I'm the only one doing what I do in the company and (for the near future) they want to keep me there.

Now I'm just trying to figure out numbers. I think I'd be comfortable with 15% more (10% to meet the average + 5% inflation/merit) but I'm guessing that is a hard sell.

I'd like to stay with the company because it is one of the better ones in my area and I believe the potential for career growth is worth sticking around for, I just want to make sure I am where I need to be and not being taken advantage of.

There really seems to be more opportunity to grow and move up in this department and the connections that I would make I believe would be very beneficial in my career growth.

It's a small management consultant company called Boutique COO. They work directly with clients. There's over 10-15 employees of the same position. The listing claims they're always looking to hire more assistants.

It states there's room for potential full-time, but it was listed as contract. The hours on their website state 5 hours a week at the start, but lists 15 hours on the website I applied on. It also says there will be a 1 month paid trial before determining whether they would want someone to continue working for them.

What makes me skeptical is I know remote opportunities are extremely competitive, but I got an interview easily. The number of assistants they have along with the mismatched details regarding the hours is strange, and the whole 1 month paid trial thing is a bit weird, too.

But comparing both jobs with benefits combined it's almost double at FAANG. Prefacing all of this with, I am comfortable enough right now financially, no ""wealthy"" but  no debt, and saved up 1.8x my salary so the money won't change my immediate lifestyle but could affect my future. I'm almost 30

My current company gives me profit sharing for the products we release that take a few years to make. There is a lot of prestige with this job and is hard.

My current job is surrounded by good coworkers and a company that actually cares about us and while things Are a shit show sometimes at least its in good company as well.

The FAANG job could be something new, or it could be terrible. Exposure to tech and people in different fields is a plus and maybe it'll lead to my career going in a different direction than I had envisioned. Could be full of opportunity 
The work would def be less enjoyable than current

I think I had a loose image in my head about where I could be going with my career and this  type of money just makes me rethink everything and what my values and future might be. 
On one hand I think about being maybe too comfortable too early in my career and maybe that's why I should leave and yank myself out of my comfort zone, (is change for change's sake good?)

1csset7,Need help deciding between two job offers,"Hi everyone,

I'm graduating in 2 weeks with a degree in Business Administration, and I could really use some advice on which job offer to accept. I have two offers on the table and I'm torn between them. Here's the breakdown:

**Offer 1: Current Job at a Nonprofit**

* **Position**: Accounting and Database Manager
* **Pay**: $30/hour
* **Hours**: Part-time in accounting, part-time in development
* **Flexibility**: Ability to work from home and more flexible with vacations
* **Training**: My manager, who has been training me, is retiring in August and has limited time left to continue my training.
* **Team**: I know the team very well, as I’ve worked there for 3 years. It was my first office job, starting as an intern, and I've learned a lot. The accounting team is currently 3 of us, but with my manager retiring and our team growing to 20+ employees.
* **Future Opportunities**: The nonprofit is looking to replace the finance director, so there could be potential to move into a staff accountant role. However, this would depend on the new finance director identifying the need for such a position and getting board approval. My guess is that a full-time accounting position might open up next June.

**Offer 2: Bougie Car Dealership through a temp agency**

* **Position**: Payroll Specialist for 100+ employees
* **Pay**: $28/hour
* **Hours**: Bi-monthly payroll schedule, which might make taking time off difficult (eventually, no need to take time off right away)
* **Duration**: Temp-to-hire (3-6 months) with the potential for permanent placement
* **Training**: The controller, who would be training me, is also retiring in August. During the first interview, she mentioned wanting to spend 6 months training someone for the role, but in the second interview, she told me she was retiring in August.
* **Team**: Higher management seemed really great!
* **Benefits**: Unknown, as the role is through a temp agency
* **Additional Info**: My recruiter has successfully placed people in permanent roles with this company before.

I don't particularly like that I can't accumulate vacation in the temp role, and the uncertainty of benefits is concerning. On the other hand, the nonprofit offers more flexibility and higher pay, but it's not a full-time accounting position and my manager will be retiring soon, which might limit my learning opportunities.

My goal is to continue growing in the accounting field. I'm looking for a role that will provide solid experience and potential for growth. Also, I'd like to point out that I'm super grateful to even have two offers considering how the job market is right now.

What would you do in my situation? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!

1csquya,"Stay in current remote job with little progression or take an in person, out of sate job with higher pay but lose SWE tittle? (LONG POST)","Hey! I graduated in '21 with a bach in Philosophy and Minor in Comp sci. I was able to get into a SWE role at a Houston based startup starting at 65k and fully remote. So at this point I have 2.5 yoe and.....my total comp has not gone up at all. I was originally a c# developer but eventually found a niche in creating internal tools for different teams - these usually are comprised of automated Jupyter notebooks and Django web apps. Recently the company was acquired by a PE firm and merged with a bigger tech company (I hope this doesn't dox me ). In the all hands meeting it was made clear we would be kept on the benefits and pay scale we are currently on (rip) and if any changes were to follow in the coming year it would be culture based (hybrid in office). Right now I get to live at home and help my family but it has been extremely draining on my mental health and wellbeing (I help care for an elderly grandmother who is esl and a cousin who has severe mental disabilities).

Interviewed with Epic Systems for the SWE role and passed the 3hr exams they make you do. It was not until after the leetcode take home (I bombed it fr) that they decided I should do the final interview for their Technical Solutions Engineer instead. It is still higher pay than my current role nut I would no longer be an SWE. I know the TSE role is not the usual helpdesk role and depending on team can involve some coding and scripting.

My future goals: I want to pivot into consulting (i know i know) after going the MBA route or if that doesn't pan out I wish to stay in SWE or transition to being a project manager. I have a 3.high undergrad gpa and 320 gre (practice exams). I feel like I could spin the TSE role into some management experience and it is inherently a more collaborative role than what I am doing now.

Any advice is welcome as I am at cross roads here. Thank you.

1csqkac,In three weeks I got my company to create my dream role for me and give me a $50k raise.,"I have done sales for 6 years, recruiting, managing and training teams. I got really burnt out at my last company and decided it was time for a change. So I started working at a new place and took a demotion from sales manager to just salesman.

I quickly realized I just was done with sales. I just couldn't care any more. However, during this time I had also been learning to code. I started to create tools that automated my processes so it made the clerical work less awful. 

After about 5 month my managers were wanting to move me into a management role, but I let them know that I was really starting to think I'd rather be an engineer.

So they supported me, and I started just reaching out to random engineers asking them if there was a chance of me getting into it with my lack of experience. That led to a ton of random engineering teams reaching out to me to look at my tools and asking for my thoughts about their projects they were making. 

LLMs were involved in many new projects, and that has be a fixation of mine. I even had started doing some consulting on the side for small businesses on how to better implement LLMs and save money on token usage. 

I got offered an internship as an engineer, despite them being past their hiring season for it - but this led to someone suggesting I look into product management. So I reached out to the VP of Product Managment and asked her about it. She set up meetings with me and VPs over Data and Engineering. Had me shadow some PdMs, and then finally there was a meeting with 4 VPs and a couple department heads where I had to show my little projects and discuss the problems I was trying to solve and how I felt like the company needed to really pivot more focus on better data.

The next day I get hit up by the VP of Data and he offers me a role as a Product Manager over LLMs with a 120k starting salary. Which isn't the best salary ever, but this role didn't exist before. After the year ends there will be another conversation on pay.

But I'm over the moon. This fits exactly with what my interest and skills are, and while this isn't the most money I've ever made - I was expecting low pay throughout this transitionary period till I could really prove myself.

Just moral of the story - don't stay in your lane. It is wild that I just reached out to the VP of the company and got them to make a new position and pay me real money for it. Tbh, I even stopped the CEO in the hallways one day (it's a 5000 person company, so not massive). If you see a place where you can add real value - go for it.

I will also say, the company I work for is an amazing company, the CEO took no pay during covid to prevent having to fire any one, and all of management and up took some sort of pay cut. They're very much focused on getting people in the right spot, and not just shutup and do your job. So results may vary at other companies, but man - I'm glad I gave it a shot.",Optimistic_Futures,0,0.5,6,1715794270,2024-05-15 17:31:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1csqkac/in_three_weeks_i_got_my_company_to_create_my/,5,2024

1csq7gt,Internship did nothing for me. Any advice on what to do next?,"I recently did an internship that I initially didn't want to take as it was unpaid and I would have to stay in my current job (which I HATE and DESPERATELY want to leave), but my parents convinced me to do it just for the experience and to improve my CV, so I relented and accepted the offer. It was for a startup streaming service company (I'm UK-based) and I got hired to help with content writing and social media- the official title being Content Researcher/Social Media Marketing Assistant.

Now that I look back on it, I don't feel I learned much at all. Sure, I got a bit more work experience and something to put on my CV (and create a portfolio), but he never really taught me anything. I just feel like he was using me (and another intern) for free work. I thought I was going to learn the ropes of social media management, SEO, and data analytics. Instead I was just left with designing social media banners and writing blogs and film reviews. This isn't inherently a bad thing, but I don't have any measurable results to put on my CV- which I feel is lacking in that arena. I've reached out a few times to ask if my work helped the company in any way. He said he'd get back to me later as he's got a lot on his plate. The last time I reached out was the 2nd. I've still have yet to hear anything back.

Not to mention, I just feel the internship did NOTHING. I got more callbacks and interviews before I did the internship than I have since I finished. I do think that maybe my CV is the reason, so I've been reworking it a lot lately and passing it through ATS checkers (ie Jobscan and Resumeworded), but they're not that helpful, score me so low, and want you to pay for everything. 

I just feel stuck between a rock and a hard place here. My CV probably sucks and I don't have the money to pay for those services to help fix it, I don't have any measurable results to help as my manager has kept radio silence for weeks, and I keep getting ghosted by recruiters and employers as a result.

1cspje8,"Afraid I made a major mistake, but don’t know if I can trust my gut.","TLDR: 
I (28M) just joined a new company, which is only my second job in an industry I’m still new to. I needed to leave my last job. The company I joined wanted to move quick vs. my #1 choice, which had a delay in sending an offer. I joined the one that sent me an offer. My #1 choice was aware of both the offer I received and later, that I accepted it since my #1 didn’t give me anything on paper. One week in, and my #1 choice is still pursuing me and ready to move forward now. My gut worries are not alleviated with my new company, and my gut is telling me I made a mistake. I am worried that I’m being hasty with still feeling a pull towards my #1 choice and not giving this a chance. Any advice appreciated. 

Here’s the long story.

I started in an entry level advertising (account management) job two years ago. The learning curve was steep but it was an established company, and had a strong process and structure on an account which is a top 3 worldwide electronics giant. I learned the work quickly. Made plenty of mistakes but I matured into the role and performed really well, so I earned a promotion last September. Overall, until the last 4 months or so, I genuinely loved it even though the workload was honestly leaning towards unreasonable. There was a reluctance from management to get more hands on deck to help out, and an increasing number of projects streaming in, and it started to bleed into my personal life because the day left me so unbelievably exhausted I had no energy to do anything else. Even trying to do the bare minimum at work, to help alleviate this a bit, was a lot of work regardless. I was one of the best at my job in my company and even then missing things left and right because of the sheer number of deliverables and ridiculous timelines. On top of this, my raise kept getting pushed out because of financial issues at the company (what’s that got to do with me lol?) and my raise which was supposed to happen 5 months ago didn’t get activated. This obviously led to burnout and eventually in me deciding to send out job applications 3 months ago. I was still getting paid effectively an intern’s salary even until my last day. Even so, I gave it 100% until the literal last minute and made sure to create lots of resources for whoever would replace me. I left on a positive note with everyone, including my boss who I have great respect for.

Long story short, I had/have two main companies pursuing me - Company A and Company B. Both offered the same salary, which was a significant jump in pay over even my raise amount, so that was sorted and not an issue. That was my main priority.

With that aside, what I was looking for was basically, in priority order:

1. Clear avenue for growth and development since I’m still relatively new to the industry
2. Strong culture/a fun team, good relationships- I get a ton of my energy from social interactions and it’s important to me that I see myself getting along with team members
3. Management and boss I could see myself learning from and working with, that is interested in my growth
4. Strong structure and process - need this to be able to work effectively
5. Collaborative client with a good reputation
6. Diversify my expertise and do something new

My first job in this industry, which I left, hit all of the above for most of my time there. 

Company A, pursuing me, was my first choice, after having met with them a few times over the course of a month. They hit all my requirements and I felt a sense of excitement when they got serious about moving to send an offer. However, they did not. They were working on getting approval to hire and budget, and it got to a point whereI was not sure when they’d be able to send me an offer (and they weren’t sure either apart from a vague timeline).

Company B met with me 3 times. They hit points 1 and 5, and MAYBE 3. This company went through restructuring, so my boss and his boss are both new. My boss started 6 days before I did. His boss started 3 months ago. In the interview, my boss, who hadn’t started yet, gave me a good feeling. It seemed like we were very similar people actually and have a similar way of working. Company B has one main client, and is actually a subsidiary of that client’s parent company, so client is very collaborative and open to new ideas. The main opportunity I saw here was that because they were essentially rebuilding their main marketing channel, it was a chance to lay the groundwork for a process and program, and so, a great chance to grow quickly. That said, it was a concern because I know from my past that without existing structure I can start to get disorganized and wean off caring about doing good work. It can get messy very easily.

Company B wanted to move quick. I also wanted to move quick as I really needed to get out. I relayed my concerns to the people & culture SVP about structure, about how it’s kind of worrying that even my boss is new, and the overall vagueness with details. She was reassuring enough that I felt at ease. However, she almost pressured me to give them an answer about moving forward. I said I’ll get back to them in a couple of days. I let Company A know that I’ll need to hear back from them soon but that without anything on paper I will accept the offer I have. Company A said they’ll expedite and hoped for a couple more days to send an offer. They didn’t send an offer and I accepted Company B’s offer with an open mind.

I gave my two weeks notice and didn’t hear any updates from Company B about on-boarding or HR things until 2 days before I started. On my last day at my last job, Company A gave me a phone call and insisted they really still want to go forward and to keep in touch in a week or so to let them know if I was still interested. I said ok. 

Company B sent me my laptop to get set up for my first day and it was both damaged and without my credentials, and without any of the required software that it was meant to come with. They sorted it out on my first day but honestly this gave me a bad first impression. The days since have been weird. My boss is still learning too so I legit have no direction yet on what I need to be responsible for. The workplace is quiet and kind of dull but friendly. The team feels silo’d and even though I’ve reached out to ask if I can help on something, I’ve basically got nothing. I’ve been using my time to get things organized as they make sense to, and to get acquainted with what’s ongoing and the client. Not really confused about anything as the work I’m anticipating seems familiar enough. But I’m bored. I don’t have any feeling of excitement with something new, and i’m used to being busy.

Am I jumping the gun with not giving this a chance, or just need to be patient? Is it just me being uncomfortable with change? My job is important to me because it’s been an important source of stability and helpful for my self esteem and confidence over the last couple of years. I feel fearful of losing that.",yakiinikku,1,1.0,0,1715791745,2024-05-15 16:49:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cspje8/afraid_i_made_a_major_mistake_but_dont_know_if_i/,5,2024
1cspdgk,Let go by employer in USA suddenly ,"Hello

I worked for a startup in USA since April 2024 and today the ceo suddenly told me in the meeting that it’s my last day without giving any notice or anything. Unfortunately, there is a clause in the offer that says 

“Employment Relationship
Employment is employment at-will. By signing this Agreement, Employee understands
and acknowledges that Employer may terminate Employee at any time for any reason or
for no reason. This Agreement is effective as of upon execution by the parties
and may be terminated at any time by either Employer or Employee, with or without
cause, by giving notice to the other. Unless sooner terminated as provided in this
paragraph, this Agreement will terminate on notice provided by employer.”

For context, I was supposed to join as a PM but since I didn’t have experience he let me start off by rotating in all my departments. when he asked me after a month about my preferred position, I chose PM. He still refused for me to join and put me in customer success. Because I needed the job, I agreed but then he comes mid may and let me go. 

Keep in mind that he never asked me to do stuff. I tried to be proactive and learn but the current PM never gave me a chance and was rude to me multiple times.

I said told him okay and gave my current work and logged off. Is there something I can do? He doesn’t even want to give me the full month salary, only half.

I am based in Africa and he is Indian living in the US. Almost all the time is sourced from India. 

I feel so agitated and don’t know what to. I am confident of my capabilities and skills are not the reason because he kept talking about my grad school all the time and gpa. He is obviously strange because when I voiced my concerns about my preferred department he said he will make it right and told me not to leave even if there is some hiccups. He stalked me on LinkedIn and saw that I changed my profile picture and kept asking why, are you looking for jobs? Etc. so he always showed interest in my work.

1cso2um,I'm doing MBA while working; I'm burnt out: drop out or suck it up?,"So, a little background information here. This is my first ever full-time job after graduating. Since my senior year, I have had a clear goal and solid plan to apply for a government-sponsored scholarship abroad. The reason I said it's a solid plan is because I have already begun prepping and have already properly taken the proficiency tests since last year (since the competition is very high) I am hoping to get my MBA or a Master's in another field in the next 2-3 years.

  
However, as Asian parents are, my parents pushed me to get an MBA in my home country whilst working; their reasons being the quick pay upgrade I could get with an MBA in my resume and that the scholarship is not guaranteed. And that I can always pursue MBA abroad afterward, but let's be real who's gonna study for 2 more years just to a degree they already have? I know they don't.

  
I'm about to finish my first semester, and my experience working a full-time job 5 days a week and classes every day on the weekend has been hellish (not to mention the assignments and projects that needed to be done when I got home from work during workdays)

It's affecting my morale and I feel like juggling two very huge responsibilities at once without a pause have been very hard, hence I couldn't go all in with either my work or my studies. (This is coming from me who ranked 3rd in my graduating Bachelor's class so trust me I'm not being lazy or trying to brush off my responsibility). The thing that bugs me the most is that it has affected my work performance where the time I could've spent preparing for my meeting with clients, I was in classes all weekend.)  


\* Here's the thing, I don't feel like it's that imperative for me to speed run my life and try to get a Master's ASAP while adapting to this huge shift in my life from a college student to a full-time worker. The Pros do not outweigh the Cons given the fact that I have to squeeze the MBA in while I'm working and given all that I'm experiencing, and that I can get a Master's when I feel like I am ready to devote myself into it and really perform well as a student. Who knows, I might discover some new area of work that I would like to pursue instead of an MBA if I give myself time to experience the world.

p.s. the professors at my university SUCKS.

p.s.2 I already have a Business degree. The MBA just felt redundant sometimes.

But I might not be wrong and haven't factored in everything into my consideration. Hence, I would really really appreciate to hear some of third-persons' opinions on my situation aside my parents lol. Should I suck it up for 2 more years or prioritize my work at the moment.",Several_Astronaut_36,1,1.0,7,1715788089,2024-05-15 15:48:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cso2um/im_doing_mba_while_working_im_burnt_out_drop_out/,5,2024
1csmv4d,Help me understand this bonus!,"Hey,

So I’ve been working my ass off on my role for the past 11 months and I’ve quite literally killed it. I’ve had critical projects I’ve worked on along with new processes that have saved $10M on a lower side putting 70 hour weeks during the Christmas/New Year week.

Since then Ive regularly had 55-60 hour weeks with after-hours work as a regular cadence. my decks have had high level visibility up until the CEO and mind you, I’m just an entry level. 

My manager has repeatedly told me I’ve become a rockstar and all the teams know me and I should expect a promotion to Senior if I keep this up. And I have done that. Putting hours, making connections, working on high visibility projects.

HOWEVER, the company hasn’t performed well in the last 6 months and stock has fallen 40%. The company review cycle is in June and I expected a promotion from them, but a couple of days earlier my skip manager comes up to me and says that I am getting an Excellent Service Award for my contribution to the company. Along with it, I’d be getting $1500 with it.

Now the question, I’m happy that I got it but I doubt thar they’re trying to dodge my promotion and give it someone else which is due next month. I don’t like the timing of it.

1csmeix,Asked for a promotion plan last month. No longer want it. Should I communicate this to my manager? ,"I recently discussed promotions with management last month. Spoke up on how my work tasks are up to level in 2023 but was passed up. Last year's work was a burnout for me, considering how short staffed we were. And acknowledging the lack of value, I just would rather not try and push hard. 

I've honestly been more humbled since and see how much more responsibility would be given especially with quality. After looking inwards, I don't think I want to take more of the pressure on just to prove myself for this upcoming mid-year promotion cycle.

I would rather save my own peace at this point and focus more energy onto something I want. Wether this be doing the bare minimum at work with quality and applying elsewhere. 

On the side, I'm also going back to school in preparation for a career change (biotech to tech) and just more invested in hobbies. 

I have this gut feeling to communicate it to management. So all eyes are on me now to perform up to par. However there was no promise. Originally I was told to wait until next year to get promoted, but communicated that I wanted to push for this year. My mistake on being too ambitious. 

Any inputs upon this decision is appreciated. Perhaps I'm missing something more critical. Thanks. ",DemotivatedRA,1,1.0,0,1715783877,2024-05-15 14:37:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1csmeix/asked_for_a_promotion_plan_last_month_no_longer/,5,2024

Anyhow, it's been kind of a nightmare since I joined. The company has 0 structure and I wasn't told prior to joining that my department basically needs to be reinvented from the ground up. Nobody knows half of the questions I have and l'm not sure where to even start looking for answers.

1csks09,Became a ghost writer for our top boss,"My manager was very excited to have me on board, now I kind of understand why. We work in the office of the Chief Medical Officer, who is the head of 30+ health clinics in the country. Big deal. 

But we are actually divided into different departments, our department's work is very specialized, the Chief has her own internal administrative team including an executive assistant. But you see, I'm drafting some of her emails. It's not the concept, she's unbelievably busy and needs help to take care of lower priority (yet still important) emails, I'm just surprised that it's coming down to me, a new hire and not even permanent I am on a contract.

What foreshadowed this is my manager always compliments my 'perfect' English, occasionally sends me things to proofread. It's not an English-speaking country, I am fluent in both the native language and English. I get it, she recognizes that as asset, I also get that as the only project coordinator in the department, getting loose ends sent my way comes with the territory. The work itself is a semi-breeze, I have a strong background in this sector and strong writing skills, I am just trying to work out whether the expectations on me are higher than others due to my language abilities and where this may start to affect my actual job description on paper. Since joining I've been given a few bigs task like creating a manual for the entire organization on a subject and my manager is pushing me to finish it, I look at an old file and figure out this has been on their to-do list for 5 years. Let's just say I am taking my sweet time.

Her and the chief had a fallout a few years ago, and now her sole mission is to regain her trust and eventually get promoted. Cool, that's most people's aim. This organization is full of power grabs, I'm sure my manager is not the worst of it.

Because of a bunch of work done by our department in the past 6 months (keeping in mind half are new hires), the chief started to trust our department more and defers more responsibility to us. My manager has been elated and feels she is on the best terms. Last week the chief sent her an urgent request which is slightly beyond our scope and my manager was away, she calls me frantically and asks me to do this request. I draft the emails and finish the report by the expected deadline. Then, all this week, the chief is asking my manager (which is me, de facto) to do similar things like draft emails and collect feedback. I took that as a job well done last week. No one knows I am doing this but my manager. See I kind of get where she's coming from, her English is not broken or anything it's just low vocabulary, I think she prefers the person with the strongest English to do these emails. It's an awkward position for everyone, she can't say no to the chief, and I am a coordinator so I am expected to do what's urgent in our department at the moment and pick up other tasks for later.

I do have major imposter syndrome, and never give myself credit. My manager can be a sweet lady, I'm just taken aback by how impressed she gets with the most basic things, maybe the work standards are drastically different from where I used to work. But I am starting to wonder if I should look elsewhere/seriously think about a writing career of some sort.

What would you do in this situation?

1cskdst,What were your skill level and responsibilities as a software development intern?,"I'm a second-year computer science student considering contacting local companies for an internship between August - September. But I'm not sure if I'm ready for an internship.

I have a few months to further develop my skills before the internship would (possibly) begin, but torn between applying for an internship which could be valuable experience for my CV, or setting aside this full summer to throw myself into deeper learning and projects to raise my skill level higher without the diversion of apply/doing an internship. I also have an exciting personal project I would like to work on during the summer.

A major part of this imposter concern is not making a good enough impression during the internship because I’m not at the skill level to make a real contribution, and decreasing the opportunity to work at that same company down the line. Am I overthinking this… what were your skill level and responsibilities as a software development intern?

An alternative solution is that I could try and push it back to the autumn/winter instead.

My approximate skill level for awareness:

HTML and CSS: I can put together a simple web page with all the core elements you would expect. But still lean on resources to guide me and remind certain things. Okay understanding of CSS also but also rely on resources constantly.

JavaScript: I have fundamental understanding of JavaScript, built simple vanilla projects (quiz game, spelling test web app. I can put together simple functions, use data types, scope, conditional flow, DOM manipulation. Again, heavy reliance on online resources though.

React: A core understanding, but I need to revisit this and learn more. (made another multiple choice quiz app with this in the past). Understand how to work with multiple components, pass props, put together hooks.

Algorithms and data structures: I have a fundamental understanding of simple algorithms, written pseudo code, familiar with Big O notation, simple data structures such as arrays, linked lists, few different techniques for solving problems such as brute force, greedy, divide and conquer. Still learning more about sorting algorithms but making decent progress.

I changed industries around 9 months ago, leveraging my prior knowledge into a newly created role - my new company wanted to branch out into this new area. 

Fast forward, and it hasn’t worked. I have delivered little and everything has been an uphill battle. My contract is up and there is very little chance of renewal (and i wouldn’t want it). 

Here is the thing: my company likes me (socially, if not professionally) and has offered to keep me on as an entry-ish level analyst. This would be a demotion but would allow me to join the actually functioning part of the company. It would be a very steep learning curve, and i dont know how much i love the general ways of working here - i have found it hard to adapt. 

In the meantime, i got a great job offer in my old field. Its back in a city and industry I do not miss, but I know i could deliver. The company is cool, too. 

The question is this: stay at a company that i love, with amazing colleagues, but take a demotion into a position i am not sure i would be good at? Or return to my old industry and hope I like it better this time?

1csjf7c,Am I lazy/In the wrong for quitting a new job I hate.," Hello Reddit. I (19M) recently started a new job about 2 weeks ago. This is only my second job and it is in a factory. I come to realize very quickly that I absolutely hate the job and it got to the point where I was waking up thinking about how badly I hate it, even the paychecks didnt seem worth it. The work isnt hard, the standing all day isnt bad either. I have poor hearing and the facility was very loud making it hard on me. The team leads were very rude, and never trained me or showed me what to do. I would mess up because of this then get yelled at and belittled by them or my other coworkers. I could never get ahold of HR about my payment methods or anything really, and lastly most of my coworkers dont even speak english, making it more difficult to do anything. 
 I decided to look for a new job and leave this one. I have money saved up, and I have a few interviews waiting for me for a new job that may suit me better. I also dont have any bills to pay other than small ones, I dont live on my own and I dont even have a car yet. 
 I truly didnt think it would be a big deal, I have no real responsibilities at this time in my life. I only pay for a gym membership/phone bill and I give my mom gas money weekly for everything. Yet, my family apart from my mom has been putting me down heavily for it. Mainly my grandmas husband (not my real grandpa, I live with my grandma and him at the moment.) He has called me lazy, said my reasons were just excuses to not work, told me I was like my parents and I was gonna fail, then started quoting bible verses at me. (Im not religious, so this was an insult in itself) I have no problems with working, or hard work, but I will not tolerate a job that im going to be consistently put down and yelled at for being new instead of being properly trained. Its not like im going to be a bum neither, im finding a new job as we speak. 
 I just wanted to know, am I really in the wrong for this? Is my family saying these things to me justified? I simply just wanted to find a different job for now. For more context, im not even looking for something permanent. Im just needed a job for a few months to move to the city where I can start the career I actually want. I would completely understand if I had bills to pay/kids to take care of, but I dont, im still a kid myself. 
 Its honestly been a big kick in the gut to here that im a lazy piece of shit from most of my family for simply not wanting a job that has people treating me like im a complete dumbass. Any advice or just an opinion would be appreciated cause im honestly starting to wonder if I just fucked up and should have sucked it up and dealt with that place, despite it being miserable.",NoOne_NoWhere_NoWay,3,0.800000011920929,5,1715775563,2024-05-15 12:19:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1csjf7c/am_i_lazyin_the_wrong_for_quitting_a_new_job_i/,5,2024

However, the job is 100% remote and the nature of tasks will not have so much communication going on, so I don't think it would help much with future networking either.

For a bit of context, I was recently laid off after 4 months with my current company and don't have much savings left. I also have an upcoming interview with other companies for FTE positions, but they are scheduled after the deadline for confirming this offer.

So I am a bit unsure whether should I just accept this offer for now to be secured on the financial side at least for now or try my best on the upcoming interviews.

1csj05v,I lost my dream job,"Exactly one year ago I was laid off from my dream job. Here’s what I’ve learned since then.

💡Resilience > Stability
Stability is comfortable. But resilience is empowering.

Losing my dream job taught me that the ability to bounce back from setbacks is far more valuable than relying on the illusion of a stable path forward. 


💡Balance doesn’t exist. But priorities do.
Striving for balance is like chasing a mirage in the desert. An enticing vision, for sure - but permanently out of reach. 

In dealing with the ramifications of my layoff, getting engaged, starting an AI startup, and a hell of a lot more in the last year - I realized that the best way to find “balance” is to ignore it altogether. 

Instead, understand your priorities and then follow through on them. You’ll likely be surprised by how much fluff can be cut out. Less fluff = less distractions = more time doing what’s important to you = “balance”


💡The world owes you nothing
I thought because I had gone to school, worked my butt off, and followed the “path I was supposed to follow” that I was entitled to a decent paying job with good benefits. 

That belief was more limiting than I thought - and actually kept me from advocating for myself because it lulled me into a false sense of a set-by-step career trajectory. 

What remnants of that reality that still exist are about to be wiped out thanks to AI (and people who integrate it into the way they live and work).

Stop thinking the world owes you something and start thinking about what you can bring to it.


💡Your job is not your identity
I’ll admit, telling people I worked for a company that launched satellites into space using a rocket strapped to the wing of a 747 was pretty badass. 

I relished in my ability to talk about it at cocktail parties, conferences, and even holidays with the family. So when it was ripped away from me, I found myself feeling hollow and empty. 

My job was like the scaffolding on an old building - helped build it up externally, but did very little to strengthen the foundation it was built upon.

Having a healthy separation between who you are and what you do is key for performance in both areas of your life. (Yes, even in roles like being a founder where you live and breathe your work).


💡You don’t need a map. You need a Compass.
Step-by-step plans are beautiful on paper and almost always fall apart in the real world. Plus, life just doesn’t work that way. The universe has too strong a preference for entropy and chaos. 

However, the pain you’re feeling - the longing for a plan, a path forward, a sense that you’re headed in the right direction - is valid and real. 

The world is more confusing and chaotic than ever. It’s increasingly important to have a deep understanding of your personal mission, a clear definition of your ambitions, and a system that you can rely on to translate those into a fulfilling reality. 

Find someone or something that you can use as a general guide to keep yourself in the right direction - not a prescriptive step-by-step plan. 

💡Look, losing a job (especially in this market) is tough. It’s absolutely awful out there right now. 

But you’ve got this. Keep your head down, keep your chin up, and focus on the better things that come next. ",RiverSynapse,0,0.4000000059604645,3,1715774234,2024-05-15 11:57:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1csj05v/i_lost_my_dream_job/,5,2024

1csiv2a,Career Advice/RoadMap: Thinking to switch to Mobile Development from QA. Any roadmaps or advice in general?,"30M here and currently working as a QA. My current ctc is 14LPA(6Y.O.E). Currently I'm on bench and looking out for projects. Parallelly I'm also looking outside, incase I don't get any projects in my current company.

The problem here is I'm not very good at writing programs(Or atleast that's what I think) and constantly face issues in programming questions in interviews. I have always been an A+ student, scoring in 90's throughout academics(Scored 100 in chem and phy in 12th). But I'm not able to clear programming interviews properly. This is affecting my self-confidence and I keep getting self doubts(One of my senior in my first company told me that, I'm good at theoretical concepts and I fail when it comes to the application of said concepts).

Now I'm into automation testing and as I was looking to switch, I kept seeing multiple openings for Mobile Development(Development in general, be it backend/front-end/full stack etc). The below reasons made me thinking as to why not switch to development:

1. My current CTC is low for my exp and testing usually don't have much openings
2. Testers don't have much respect in the Industry(Even from people working along with us)
3. Not much scope to earn more from testing field

My current thoughts:

1. Enroll into a Java course from any offline institute and learn Java thoroughly first.
2. Switch to a good company with decent pay
3. Invest time for 1-2 years and learn development and then try for some startups.

Any advice to my thoughts? Am I thinking in the right direction?  
And also, if anyone who has done this transition(Or similar transition) could shed some light on how you did it and what difficulties you faced, I would greatly appreciate it.",Select-Sleep-6672,1,1.0,0,1715773784,2024-05-15 11:49:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1csiv2a/career_adviceroadmap_thinking_to_switch_to_mobile/,5,2024

I then have 3 years work experience as a software engineer post graduation 

I kind of don’t like software engineering that much because I feel I am spending lots of time on high level problems, looking at stack overflow, fixing errors, always feel im blocked, it doesnt feel theoretical which I like, while I like leetcodes I don’t feel any resemblance of it, i dont think I am doing well and feel unmotivated by work and on a low pay.

When I looked back at uni, my favourite courses were Parallel Architectures which is stuff on cache coherence and cpu architecture, i found that very fun. I really liked the assembly coursework, I really liked computation and logic which was my masters project. I also like C and I found playing with Arduinos pretty fun. My whole life I loved maths, logical thinking and problem solving.

Only thing is I am 3 years out of uni and feel I cant change fields unless i do a masters

I also want to make as much money as possible, the us seems like the place to be to earn that and also doing something i enjoy would help too.

I keep telling people I want to be a doctor and i've based my education around the sciences (Biology, chemistry, etc.) I keep telling myself that the medical field, although it's hard work, is what I want, when in reality those long hours and all the years of studying just don't seem like it'll be worth it, nor will it make me happy. To be honest, I've always had an interest in creative writing and art, even though I may not be particularly good at it, it's what makes me happy.

1csgaa5,Is it ok to continue working on project although you know there is no saving it?,"So 2 months ago I was hired as Senior Developer to work on project. I even managed to negotiate fine working conditions and was really looking forward to it.

But then I started to work on project. The project itself is badly maintained, there were at least 2 attempts at rewrite in the last 4-6 years, and were done to half, so project is now even greater monstrosity than it ever was. I have been doing bugs here and there, but company would like to add some new big features.

It is obvious to me, that in order to add any feature, let alone big one, there would need to be a huge rewrite and clean up. And even then it is question how long it would take. There is no one here that has been long enough on project to know all the functions and features. Documentation about project, is you guessed it, is project itself.

But is has some value, and brings revenue.

So question is what to do here? Do I tell them situation how do I see it? Downside of this is that they may decide to hire different engineer. Currently job market is not really great in IT, so it would take me some time to find job with conditions like this.

Or do I just continue working, pretending there is a way to save it, and refactor here and there, wait for bull market in IT and then just change ship?",TipProfessional1272,1,1.0,1,1715763800,2024-05-15 09:03:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1csgaa5/is_it_ok_to_continue_working_on_project_although/,5,2024

1csdwa7,"I have no idea where to work and my appearance doesn’t help, any advice?? ","Kind of long, but any advice or input would be greatly appreciated :) 

I (22F) have been working in fast food/ retail since I was 17 and I’m finally ready to take that leap to leave my current job and find one that will help advance my career and give me at least some financial stability. I also live in NorCal for context (not sure if I’d be willing to move quite yet.) I’ve been at my current retail job since 2021 and was honestly just going to stay there until I was completely finished with college but I just received my AA and the current management im under is so difficult to work with and extremely offensive I can barely take it not to mention I’ve been in management for about 2 years now and have gone from at least 20hr a week (part time) to less than 10hr a week, less than some associates and they’re all 3 hour shifts so I’m not even allowed to take a 10min break though im not even sure if that’s legal?? 

I am very fortunate to not have to pay rent as I live with my parents and I only have to worry about paying for my car, gas, phone, school, necessity’s etc. So no rent is a life saver in this economy. With that being said I don’t necessarily need the highest paying job quite yet (willing to work my way up or gain helpful experience) though that would be ideal for anyone. I just want to be able to find something that fits with my personality/ needs and also doesn’t care the way I look. I know sometimes you have to do what u gotta do but I cannot take working somewhere I’m miserable at and I understand that is a privilege within itself so  I’m just trying to use the time I do have to really find what I’m passionate about and not be scared to try new things. 

I still want to go back to school to get my bachelors degree since it’s always been a dream of mine, but since I pretty much pay for everything out of pocket besides some degree of financial aide, I don’t want to just aimlessly transfer somewhere with no clue on what to study which has been my issues for some time. I feel like my interest haven’t changed much and neither have my dreams to further my education so I’ve pretty much been saying the same things since probably before high school and I still have no clue what exactly the direction is I should go. I would love to gain some first hang experience to know if getting my B.A. is even worth it for the field I want to go into or what major would benefit me the best. 

I have many interests and ideas as to what I could possibly do but I feel like as much as I say them out loud no one really relates so I always feel alone or like there’s no possible job for me that I’ll feel happy in. I mean I think majority of people would rather not work and focus their lives on their hobbies and passions but unfortunately that’s not in the cards for most people and though I sometimes live in that dreamland that doesn’t change the fact that I’m extremely dedicated, hard-working and really want to make a difference in whatever field I end up in. So I guess I’ll leave a list of the things I’m interested in, in case anybody has some advice or input on any occupations I’ve listed or have experience in anything I’ve listed. 

I guess another thing to mention is that I was recently applying to a lot of jobs in childcare and pretty much every interview I went to turn me down on the spot because of my appearance. Of course I hear the stories of  looking less professional due to your tattoos, piercings, etc., which I never understand. I don’t even have a single tattoo or piercing, not even my ears, but I have bright pink hair and that has been such a downside for the interviewing processes, even some retail jobs like Box Lunch for example doesn’t accept colored hair when they’re literally a pop culture store and share the same company as Hot Topic. I don’t want to have to change my appearance for a job. I know it’s just hair but I was never able to express myself the way I wanted to and the amount of money and maintenance that goes with having colored hair would not be worth it to me to color black just to get a job. It would feel like I’m altering myself and changing something that makes me feel good about myself is unfair and already puts a bad taste in my mouth about the company because they are willing to look over my qualifications and work ethic due to one minor detail in my appearance. One of these jobs I even had two on the phone interviews that went amazing and was going to my final in person interview and was literally meeting with a family for a behavioral technician job and the first thing they (the company) told me was I would need to change my hair to even be considered and I had to eventually politely end the interview because they still wanted to me to meet a kid despite straight up telling me they will not hire me if I didn’t immediately change my hair… and I’d be working with a family, not even in a ‘ public setting.’ I would just love to be able to work in a community that embraces people for their differences for the way they express themselves, and encourages self expression.

Anyways, here are some of my interests and I’d be eternally grateful to hear any feedback! Maybe you’ve worked in some of these environments and have advice or horror stories, if you have similar interests to me let me know what kind of job you have because I’m sure I don’t even know the formal
titles to half of these jobs, or even have other ideas that match my interests. Thank you thank you thank you!

- A lost 22 year old just trying to find her way

TLDR: I have so many interests and have no idea where to go with my next steps in my career and schooling, and would love some advice based off of my interest and experience. My unnaturally colored hair gets me nowhere. My experience and interests are listed below.

My schooling/ experience so far:
* 5 years of theatre under my belt (onstage/backstage/management)
* Just graduated with my AA in Social &  Behavioral Sciences (Random but was recommended to do so based on all of the same interest I told my counselor some odd years ago) 
* Most of my college classes were focused in sociology, psychology, and child development, which has been super interesting so I am willing to branch out from my interest because I did find a lot of interest in the classes I’ve taken previously. 
* Have worked in retail for four years; Pretty well received by people
* A nanny to 4 kids (ages 4-16) for about 3.5 years as well

My personality: (not sure if this will help with knowing if I would be a good fit for any of the jobs listed ) 

i’m extremely bubbly and can have my extroverted moments, but I can also be introverted at times and when work needs to get done, I will figure out the best way to do it and get to work. I work pretty well with a team and always have ideas flowing and bouncing around, but I can also excel working on my own/have no issues being independent with my work. I don’t have a huge preference on a fast versus slow paced work environment. I would like something flexible, but I have no issue with getting into a routine. I feel like I am truly pretty flexible when it comes to my work environment, I just really want a place that I can express myself and be surrounded by a community of people similar to me. I love to be innovative and creative.

My interests/ ideas: (sorry kinda random and jumps around)

* always wanted to be a nanny or travel nanny; to work with one specific family and grow with them 
* Pre-k - 1st grade teacher; I find teaching younger kids really fulfilling, love crafts/ activities/planning, extremely patient 
* Art teacher (i love ceramics, but pretty much any type of art would be so cool to incorporate creativity with teaching)
* Child advocate (possibly on movie and tv sets)
* Teacher on movie and television sets 
* Directing or any sort of behind the scenes job for movies and television (I love to write and create concepts, costuming, sets, music, casting)
* Set designer for movies, television, or theater
* Costume designer for movies, television, or theater
* Possibly work with an acting company backstage (I don’t even know if that’s a job but possibly a permanent backstage role somewhere)
* Open my own curated thrift shop or a shop in general that is really creative or theme oriented
* Have a small bakery business or just a business in general, I love the idea of being able to run a company or brand that’s inclusive and creative 
* I do love to bake and Decorate desserts
* Creative Director; photographer, videographer; I just love the thought of creating things and bringing concepts together, planning, etc.
* Magazine company?
* Wedding planning/party and event planning; again, I just like bringing things together I feel like I have an eye for aesthetics
* Something with marketing or managing

As you can see, most of my interest have to do with childcare and the arts, which are some of the lowest paying jobs/difficult fields to get into, but it’s what I most passionate about and what I can actually see myself being happy doing for a long time. i’m also not opposed to working in one certain field for a while and then branching out to something different or related further down the line, I just want to know what step I should take next so I’m not just floating around doing nothing and being/fill, I just want to know what step I should take next so I’m not just floating around doing nothing and being/feeling useless.

1csbrvt,Is it weird a Principal called at 9pm to say she’s excited I’m coming to work for their school?,So yesterday I interviewed at a private school and I enjoyed the staff and school. They sent me a formal offer today because the principal said she doesn’t want to lose me. I accepted and then tonight the principal called and left a voice mail saying she’s excited I’m officially joining their school. Is it weird she called so late? She didn’t expect me to call her back or anything but is it just because she’s excited possibly?

1csbob3,Do other professions pay significantly more than teaching? (US),"For reference, I'm a 26 year-old guy living in Denver, Colorado, US. 

I got a kinesiology degree in my undergrad, but decided to become a science teacher immediately after. I got a masters of education and an alternative licensure to teach middle/high school science by the time I was 23. After two years of teaching middle school, I realized what most people already know: Middle schoolers are a nightmare. So, I moved up to high school, and I've been teaching high school biology (my favorite subject) for 2 years. Despite this improvement, I'm still not in love with teaching like I originally thought I'd be. In a career where people notoriously get underpaid to do ""what they love,"" I'm just not in love with it. It now feels like I'm just getting underpaid to work a job, and I'm scared of locking myself into a career where I'm doomed to make less money than I could be making somewhere else. 

Or is this not the case? 

What I'm curious about, and what I'd love to hear more about from you all, is whether other careers actually make significantly more than teachers do. At 26, with a masters, I make about 68K per year. In 30 years, I'll be on track to make about 105K per year. If I was to change careers now, and potentially get a new masters in a different field, could I be making more now or in the long term? I've been thinking about data analytics or coding, but I'm open to hear other suggestions if you have them. If it's worth anything, I'm about as book smart as they come, and I'm great at meeting new people.

Any and all thoughts are welcome on this, and sorry for the long read. Good advice here could really help me out a lot, so I appreciate it in advance.

1csb7wp,"I’m 25, I have three degrees, but I can’t find a suitable job. Please help me?","Hello everybody. I’m making this post because I’ve been feeling pretty lost these past few months. I would like some guidance or recommendations as to what I should possibly do career wise given my current situation.  

I’ll start if by stating that when I was younger I wanted to be a lawyer as I had a lot of passion for the field and I was an amazing debater. However, due to family pressure (that still continues to this day), I was put off the field and told that “I would never be able to get a job apart from being a secretary”. To add to this, I was pressured to become a doctor and study medicine (something that I did not want to do). The resulting predicament was that I lost my identity because where once I was excellent at English and languages and public speaking, I was pushed into the sciences. I did well in biology and chemistry but it wasn’t my passion. 

Then, I attended university where the plan was to go into medicine. I had no idea what I was doing so when a family member recommended me to major in Microbiology, i gladly obliged. I HATED by time studying the degree and greatly dreaded labs. I would have panic attack after panic attack and I hated lab work. 

Then came graduation and I thought “you know what I hate working in a lab let me figure out something else to do”. Because of my background in microbiology, I had taken some public health papers and the field kind of interested me but I wasn’t so familiar about it. I went to grad school and majored in public health. I graduated and worked for 6 months for my local district health board. However, I was not in the best place mentally and ended up at the doctors and I had to resign from my position. I had severe mental health issues. 

Then, I decided to say screw it and I went back to university and worked part time to support myself. I studied for a year towards and English literature post graduate degree and I graduated with honors. When I graduated I couldn’t find a job so I’ve been in sales for the last 9 months. 

I hate my job and I want to change careers. I want to have a good job. But I don’t know who I am and what I should do. I thought maybe teaching but hearing people’s short or stories has scared me. I have a passion to explain and help people understand processes. I can teach subjects like English, history, biology, and chemistry. I was thinking perhaps combining education with my passion for reducing inequities (I learnt a lot of the process used to reduce inequities in public health) in vulnerable populations. But I don’t know. I’m feeling very depressed and would like some further information. Do you think educational policy would be for me?

Can somebody kindly suggest what the heck I should do so I don’t feel like a burden and failure?",Educational_Kick_136,5,0.7799999713897705,7,1715743410,2024-05-15 03:23:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1csb7wp/im_25_i_have_three_degrees_but_i_cant_find_a/,5,2024

1csb0w9,Is this a smart move?,"I’m 28yo, and while I like what I do for work right now, I don’t think I could say that in 5 years. I’m looking for something more substantial as a long-term career.  
  
I have a bachelor’s degree in Sociology with a marketing minor, and I currently work as an in-house graphic designer in the marketing department of a nice little company. I don’t make a whole lot of money there, but this company owns a restaurant where I bartend from time to time which generously supplements my income. I LOVE this company, so it will be very hard to leave it… but again, it’s not sustainable in the long term, and I don’t want to stay in this little college town forever.  
  
I’ve been putting a lot of thought into what I want to do. I’ve never been one to have a “dream job.” I just want to work hard, make good money, and live my life while also setting myself up for comfort down the road. Unfortunately, I’ve found that I don’t have the desire to design for any other company, and the competition in the design field makes passion for the work IMPERATIVE. No careers for sociology degree-holders appeal to me long-term either.  
  
On to the real meat of it. I’ve found that I’m interested in pursuing a career as a Rad Tech. I’ve always been interested in medicine, but I got caught up in self-doubt… I’ve come to the conclusion quite recently, so I’m not ready to just quit my job and dive right in. I need to do more research and rumination first. However, this is the plan. Please tell me what you think/how you would improve it/literally any other thoughts or suggestions. I’m spiraling a lil with existential anxiety haha.  
  
1. Keep working where I am, b/c I still love it.  
2. Pick up more bar shifts and save money.  
3. Over the course of 2-3 years, take the couple remaining prereq courses that weren’t covered by my bachelor’s at the nearby university.  
4. When I’m ready and stable, apply for the program.  
5. If I’m accepted, say a tearful goodbye to the 9-5 job, but keep the bar job for extra income.  
  
What do you think? There are more variables I need to consider (I’m single and childless, so phew there), but this feels like a decent start to a long-term plan. For someone who doesn’t love change, this has been very hard.

The new job is also pretty bad unfortunately. I have a severe micromanager and they turned out to be dishonest about a few things during the interview. First, they lied about me replacing a past employee - the last hire quit after 4 months. Second, they lied about some of the skills I would gain. Third, my manager had a completely different personality on the interview than their true work personality. I feel very deceived as a result of all these points.

1cs7og5,Capped at current job. Move or stay?,"Hi gang,

Give me some career advice please!

I currently work as a senior associate at a global private equity firm. The position is a mix of hybrid/remote with a super cool team. Everyone has each other’s backs, and we have excellent leadership too. My focus is on fund accounting, the reporting of it, and audit support. I never “wanted” to do this, but it fell in my lap. My total comp is 100k base with 5k bonus. I am maxed out of my pay band with only 3% ish raises. I fully fought to be maxed out after completion of my graduate degree to which they rewarded. Now we are also grid-locked so no promotions until higher-ups get promoted and so on which will most likely happen in 2/3 years if not then 3/5. So I am grid-locked at my current 3% raises for the next 2/3 years. The next salary will be around $110-120k with a 20% bonus, but it’s unpredictable of when that promotion will happen. It could be more than 2/3 years. It will also be to a manager title position. 

I have been offered a Director title position at a major hospital network with a starting date of July (local).  The salary starts at $159k, but the pay band maxes out at $286k. I may be able to negotiate more, but I have not responded to the initial offer. The work emphasizes accounting programs research (which I currently do some in my job), improving efficiencies, reviewing financials, improve automation, and assist in special projects. The downside is it’s a 30 minute drive to work (one way). I did just buy a nicely used fuel efficient Toyota though. 

Here’s the kicker: we are due for a baby in 3 months. Current company offers 15 weeks pto regardless of gender. Hospital only offers 6 weeks but that’s after a year of continuous service. My thought process was to see if I can negotiate that into my offer. If not, I may not get pto when switching a job. 

My other mindset is that’s enough of a title + salary raise that if I made the switch, I’d be comfortable enough in that job before the baby came and could take a few weeks FMLA unpaid. 

It’s also enough of a title + salary raise that this may be my only opportunity to get this big of a bump. 

I am nervous about a new job before a baby though as I am the breadwinner, but I also believe I could be successful.

1cs7f9a,Leaving Job to Reset. No Job Lined Up.,"Background:
Veteran, returned to school and graduated with BS in 2018. Med device sales from 2018-present. I sacrificed pretty much everything for this job. I relocated to a less desirable place. All of my hobbies dried up.  I haven’t taken a single vacation in 6 years. I hustled and sacrificed. I make okay money but for the amount of work and stress I put up with to string together 120k…it can’t continue. Typically 12 hour days and even when I’m not physically working my mind is consumed by work.

Current situation:
I’ve decided to depart without anything lined up. I have no debt. I’ve aggressively saved over the last 6 years; having around 110k in 401k. 30k in a Roth. An Invested HSA around 15k and roughly 85k in cash savings mostly in high yield.

The predicament:
I plan to just take some time off… a few months at the least. I understand an employment gap is an issue for some employers. I simply don’t even know what the next employer might be. I have ZERO interest in med device sales again and would happily take a 50% pay cut to be outside daily working with my hands (generally speaking).

In my time off, I want to focus on getting back into the things I used to enjoy: competitive swim, running, biking, surf, golf…. Etc. see family and friends. I want to plan for the next move as well but currently another side effect of the last 6 years I don’t even know what I’d like to do. Pretty sad.

I guess my question is, how concerning is a gap for this reason? How do I find what my next move is. I seriously can’t think of anything that gets me excited…

1cs7dkf,Am I delusional to want MORE work?,"I’ve spent the last decade working for a good employer that pays well.  But the work is boring and I can do it without any real effort.  As a result I probably only work 20 hours a week and they think I’m awesome.  Great reviews.  Annual bonuses.  100% work from home.  I’m insanely fortunate.  

Recently I was recruited to a smaller employer, with much more interesting work and they pay about 10% ($20k) more annually (not including bonuses).  That seems like a win win.  But I would be much more involved and likely working 40+ hours per week.   Work from home 3 days a week, go into the office 2 days a week.  

Am I nuts to want the new job with more work?  To give up 100% work from home?  Right now I have a pre-teen and I can go to literally every activity they’re involved in.  I do all my chores whenever.  I go to the gym whenever.  But I’m bored spending all day at home by myself doing easy work.   There is similar advancement potential at both employers.  

Is being bored a legitimate reason to take the new job, or is this a case of me deluding myself that the grass is greener on the other side?

She’s trying to get me to go back to school but I’m extremely conflicted. I can’t leave my current job to go to school full time when I’m already living paycheck to pay heck. After my monthly expenses I quite literally am in the negatives. 

Rent is $1000/ month 
Insurance: 300/ month 
Car payment: 300/ month 
Gas: 250/ month 
Groceries: 300/ month 
Phone: $100/ month
Previous student loans: 100/ month 

I was looking at going back to school part time to secure something that I can put to use. But because I never was interested in a trade. I don’t have the pre-requisites to get in. So I’m upgrading my courses this summer to hopefully start in the Fall. 

That being said, I’m discouraged. I’ll have to take as many classes as possible while working. And because I refuse to quit my job, OSAP is only funding me 1000$ per year of grants towards my 7k tuition and the rest are loans. . I’m debating on just quitting while I’m ahead. But I know that if I do, then that’s it for me. I have zero credentials to make any career moves. And I’ll be stuck in this position forever, hoping that my union continues to increase my wages every 4 years once things get renegotiaged.  

So I’m looking for advice … what do I do? Do I take the loans and hope for the best with school? Even if I do school, there’s zero guarantee that the class schedules will align with my work schedule. So there’s a big chance that even if I start and get through semester 1, then semester 2 I’ll be stuck until they offer me a class that runs before I start work in the afternoon. 

My girlfriend told me to quit and focus on school. Get as much done as I can in 4 years then start a more rewarding career that can support us. 
I think it’s easy for her to suggest because that’s what she did. She quit her corporate job and went to school for 5 years to get ahead. But I can’t quit my job to go to school, take on loans without a job offer/ secured once I’m finished. She’s gotten an offer after completing co-op. But what if that’s not the case for me? What if after 4 years I get no job then I’m even more behind.  And this is what frustrates her because she explains there’s no reward without risk. But I have to support myself at the end of the day. 

What do I do? Can someone tell me what I should be doing moving forward. 

I’d also like to add that all my friends have established careers. Making 150k a year and buying homes and starting families. I won’t be able to do that if I stay with this job. My gf will be the breadwinner which I’m ok with but she’s not too thrilled. 

Oh and last thing to add, in the next 4 years I’ll be making around $34 an hour as per our union agreement. Since it’s a dollar raise each year. I tell my girlfriend to holdout for that but she says by the time we get there the economy will be worse and the increase won’t mean much.

Parents were not happy with this decision and made me stick to it despite my failing mental health and grades (they just told me to try harder 💀). Due to this my grades are not good enough for medschool, and I need a job after I graduate this fall because my parents now say they are going to kick me out (due to no longer pursuing their goal of medicine). Due to being pre-med, I only briefly looked into marketing and comp-sci careers, but didnt take many classes (didn't think i could handle marketing with my courseload since I explored comp-sci).

1cs4yxl,How to become a spokesperson for a cause?,"Hi all. I want to become a spokesperson/representative for addiction. I’m in recovery myself and I knew absolutely nothing about addiction prior to my treatment program. I feel there’s not really any advocacy for this and how addiction is truly a disease. I was lucky enough to be in one of the best treatment programs in California that is led by addiction researchers for over 25 years. Almost everything that I see online about addiction is largely inaccurate (aside from reliable research studies, but we all know most people don’t usually go to those as their first choice of absorbing information). I hear a lot of misinformation sometimes too in the rooms of AA, which makes sense because a lot of people aren’t privileged enough to go to a treatment program/have health insurance. 

I really want to help spread the message on addiction and common misconceptions, and hopefully encourage more people to seek treatment, or prevent people from using alcohol/drugs as their coping skill in the first place. 

I have absolutely no idea where to start with this, and what even the job of a spokesperson (if that is even the right title) would entail. Essentially, I want to help promote advocacy for this disease and help other people by sharing information about addiction, including my own experience. 

My first guess would be to start doing content creation about addiction to build a reputation. I just don’t know if that’s the right first step or what I would do afterwards. I’m thinking something in public policy, or a nonprofit? 

Any advice/tips/corrections would be greatly appreciated. I currently have my Bachelor’s in Business Analytics but I was an addict throughout my college years so I don’t know much about my field. I want to get my Master’s regardless, so I’m not sure if it matters too much what I get it in since I’ve seen other spokespeople for other causes not having a degree in the field they’re advocating for.

If it comes to the stage of talking about salaries, would it be weird to ask about a relocation package since I didn’t relocate for them?

My problem stems in large part from being tired of the sales grind of a constantly shifting goal post and KPI’s. I pivoted into the insurance industry off a referral from a client last year and I’ve been decently successful in it but economically I still feel unviable.

So, I'm 21 and I am a freelance video editor from Italy. I've been doing this for the past three years, helping marketing agencies and infobusinesses with their ADS, YouTube Channels, Short Form Content, whatever.

The thing is, I've burned out so many times I've lost count and I've got to a point of so much exhaustion that, although I know I'm very good at editing, I don't think I want to keep doing this *(I already outsource).*

I didn't go to Uni, I spent the last 3 years not being that social *(which made me miserable cause I love being around ppl)*, my relationship with my friends and family has gotten worse over time; in general, my life has been consumed by my business, and I'm starting to have a sort of gut feeling that this isn't right nor sustainable for the long term.

I also fell out of love with the craft, and at this point I f'ing hate the Final Cut Pro timeline if you ask me.

The worst part, is that I am not confident at all in building my own life through this income. I still live with my parents, and although I'm making good money (around 3k/mo) and helping them with expenses, I am terrified that everything could end tomorrow and that's why I haven't moved out.

1cs0x5e,Can I get fired for my wisdom tooth infection? ,"sorry in advance if this is a dumb question, just over worried about this. only 22 so navigating life is still pretty new to me. 

i moved out of state on my own, finally got a full time job right in time to catch up with all my bills and whatnot. two weeks ago my upper right wisdom tooth caught an infection for the first time, i had to drive back home to get antibiotics to save me some time before i can get them removed, but now already it’s starting up again. 

issue is i only started the training process at my new job yesterday. haven’t even gotten my first paycheck yet. it’ll take time for my benefits to kick in, and even if i can hold out until then, i wouldn’t be able to afford the surgery here right now. i’m still on medicaid registered to my old state, so if i could go back home asap to get them removed it would be free. to add even more complication to this, the only oral surgeon who would be able to do it back home (finding an oral surgeon who takes medicaid was a miracle in an of itself) is only available on tuesdays and thursdays.

1cs0nwi,Losing pay while being promoted?  ,"TLDR: (Being relocated to higher COL area and raise doesn’t keep up, but good for my career long term)

So I’m in a confusing spot here. I’m an entry level technician for a heavy equipment company. We supply tower cranes and hoists on construction sites. I built the machines for about a year before recently being promoted to “technician” level. Started last feb. at $28 an hour. My last raise was from $29 to $31 an hour year end after 10 months. Now here’s the problem.
 I was offered by the company to move about 500 miles west to essentially manage operations on that side of our territory, completely on my own without much knowledge. This is a huge opportunity. Came with a title change and raise from $31 to $35. I accepted. 
However, I’m moving out from the house I had (and loved) with roommates for $950 a month and my new place is $1600. Factoring in everything else I’ll probably end up losing a couple hundred a month, not to mention my hours will decrease (I average 60hrs a week) because I’ll no longer be travelled from my old territory to my new one since I’ll already be there. I could potentially end up going from making $10k+ a month to like $6k sometimes. I kinda feel like I’ve been screwed here because I was focused on how this will help my career. What do y’all think?

I am currently in a contract role as an analytical scientist at a major biopharm company. The company has been experiencing cut backs and layoff of full time employees. The company is now in a hiring freeze and only bringing in more contractors. There's so many different rumors floating around about what will happen next. It sucks because idk if my retainment will still be upheld. My experience has been working on the bench (scientist that work in the lab) and some guided managerial work; as far as my career goals, I would like to move from the bench and into quality/compliance (office-based) role within the pharm industry with options of a hybrid schedule. 

Fast forward to this week, I've been contacted for a 6-month contract role with, as they put it in the job description, a ***high likelihood of an extension or possible hire as a full time employee for the client company***. This job will get me off the bench plus it's a quality/compliance role and the schedule is hybrid. All signs are pointing to go forward at least with the interview process to get more info. 

I am a bit nervous to leave my current role (which i am not sure if I will have another 6 months of employment due to so much downsizing and other changes occurring). I just signed a 12 month lease so that has me worried the most among other things depending on income.

1crzbcv,Rollercoaster job vs. Merry go round job,"I'm currently in what I would call a Rollercoaster job - the highs are very high, the lows very low. There's a lot of chaos, speed and intensity. My role in the company is pretty far from my actual specialism and there's no way to know if I'll ever get a position that's more fitting. Salary and secondary benefits are very good, team consists of a bunch of weirdos meaning I can be myself and have fun, but also there's always a lot of drama. 

Another company offered me a ""merry go round job"". The team seems very mundane, there's no sense of urgency, everything is calm and stable to the point it seems boring. The job won't be very interesting or challenging, but would be within my field of specialism and in that sense a step in the right direction. There's hardly any diversity in the team and there's just very little at stake. No highs, no lows, just easy going. Salary and benefits are uncertain at this point. 

I have been looking around for other jobs because all the intensity and drama sometimes comes with ethical decisions I simply don't agree with. Mental health issues/burnout are a huge risk but aren't taken seriously. I don't think this would be even a risk at all in the other company.

Then again my gut says to stay where I am and only give up this weird adventure if something equally exciting comes along. Like, another Rollercoaster job but the within my own field. Is it dumb to wait for this even though it may never happen, while I have a perfectly okay offer on the table for a job that - even though it would be a bit boring - would be a step towards that same goal? How do I know if the investment in my career is worth llosing everything I do like about my Rollercoaster job?

1cryb4u,Probationary period renewed,"I joined a new company in January as a manager, with a 4-month probationary period.

From my perspective, the assessment is very negative: no integration, promises made in writing by HR not kept, high expectations when it's the first time I've had this type of job,... people from all over the world warning me in the same way 'it's going to be horrible, the money you earned coming here you're going to spend on your therapist, if you survive this you can survive anything...'. In fact, I have 3 positions...

So I did my best but without sacrificing my personal life either. I could have done more by working late into the evening, but I thought it wasn't worth it. Historically, I've always done it and it's never brought me anything.

Anyway, today my supervisor calls me in and tells me that my probationary period is being renewed, that for him I'm still in the process of taking on my role. He has set me goals to achieve by the end of my probationary period, saying 'I want this to be a success'.

Given the toxic nature of the company, I consider all possible scenarios, such as they found someone to replace me and are keeping me on probation to fire me more quickly when he arrives. Or we renew all probationary periods like this to put pressure on people to work more. And then, if in a few years we want to fire them, we have an extra argument 'he's not up to the job, look, even his probationary period wasn't validated the first time, we renewed it.' I'm not in the US and here it's hard to fire someone. 

Anyway, it's the first time my probationary period has been renewed instead of being validated directly and I'm not sure what to think. What do you think is happening?

Does the company have anything to gain by keeping its employees on probation for as long as possible?""",findinglinks2024,0,0.5,6,1715708819,2024-05-14 17:46:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cryb4u/probationary_period_renewed/,5,2024

So I recently was laid off from a position I held for 6 years as an Administrative Assistant for  a local government. I am 36F and was essentially micromanaged out of the position by a new boss and the role was effectively eliminated. As devastated as I was to lose my position, I decided to try to move back into health care in my career and job options. I had previously held positions in health care as well. 

This week I had two offers come in and am trying to disseminate the offers. 

Option 1   
Position: Patient Financial Counselor   
Largest Major Health Care Hospital in my Area   
Making about 70 cents less than my previous role   
Large Potential for growth and continuing education/tuition coverage   
Full benefits 

  
Option 2   
Position: Surgical Scheduler for Ophthalmologist   
Largest Eye Surgeon Practice in my area with multiple offices.   
Making more than what I was making administratively   
Learning curve and unsure if there are growth opportunities.   
Full Benefits 

I am unsure of what to do as I contingently accepted option 1 but was offered option 2 a day later. I don't want to ruin opportunities within the hospital. Any advice would be appreciated.

1crx6t7,I have 2 corporate Software Engineering Jobs,"I currently have two full time software engineering jobs. 

With the fallout of the 2020 pandemic, remote work is abundant. So I took to the job hunt to search for a remote SE job from either the east coast or west coast, since cost of living is typically higher and wages are typically higher. Ironically I found a job in the Midwest that fit the bill, high paying ($135k as Sr SE) and 100% remote. 

After working at “company-A” for several years and learning the ins and outs, I was running my own team of off shore devs and reporting to a non-technical manager. I found that I was getting all my responsibilities done with a minimum of 3-5 Hr/wk and everyone was happy. I supplement my “extra” time with spending time with the family, house projects, and extra curricular activities. I even started a side gig that I could dedicate time to and make some extra money. 

This went on for about a year and I kept asking myself how I can make more with my side gig. Well it dawned on me that my strongest asset was programming and that I should get a programming side gig. I looked into consulting but they wanted hours tracked and needed to be detailed on where the time was spent. I would lose my flexibility with my family and flexibility working for company-A. What I really needed was another company just like company-A! 

So I went to the job hunt again and applied for salaried entry level programmer jobs. Most jobs interviews didn’t take me too seriously because I was too experienced and thought I would get bored. So then I started applying for Sr. SE and lead roles. I landed a job (with a referral) as a Sr. SE.

Now, I currently work both jobs. Company-A pays be about $145k/yr and company-B pays me about $130k/yr. I work about 5-10hrs for Company-A and about 25-35hrs for Company-B.

There is definitely less time doing house projects, and extra curriculular activities but I still find plenty of time with the family and I still think I work a lot less than some other people.

My ask/discussion point: 
Am I setting my career up for failure? I’m not really progressing my career in either jobs as I’m not going above and beyond— however I’m good with the amount of work I’m expected to do and what I produce.

Have I piqued? Seemingly this is the most money I will make without going into management—which I’ve done middle management and was not a fan. I’ve also read “horror” stories of people working their butts off climbing the corporate ladder just to get laid off at a director level or VP level—no thanks

Can this last forever? I anticipate this part of my life to be temporary, so I’m not living like this will be my salary forever. I am paying off debt and saving a lot. But at the same time, it’s kind of hard to get fired. Layoffs are more likely and I don’t foresee that at either companies.

1crulwf,"Business consultant for a year, do almost nothing and no day goes without thinking about quitting. Need to know your point of view. ","Hi guys/girls,

I apologize for the long text but I need to describe the situation properly.

34M, graduated in law (never became a lawyer cause after 2 years in a law firm I lost every interest in law and I don't regret my choice).

I've been at my current job for 1 year now (business consultant for a small IT consultancy firm). Before that I was unemployed for 1y and a half (i quit my previous job as bank teller because of toxic environment, constant overwork and understaffed office) .

I got this job after many rejections and it looked promising since it was almost full remote, it was a consultancy job and it involved software licenses/IT asset management and sounded like something I could do well (I'm a bit nerd, use Linux, assemble my own PCs, I learned some basics of coding and IT jargon at the law firm where I used to work cause we worked with software licenses).

My boss is good, I got a ton of training (hell, basically I did just that for a whole year, with training on the job, self-teaching, etc.), i work from home, the company culture is not great but it's definitely not toxic.

The point is, a few days ago I completed my first year here and I really HATE this job and I'm still really incompetent at it.

I partially blame myself because, finding it super boring, I have no motivation to get better at doing it. But I also blame this company because I think they didn't give me a correct representation of the real job during my interview.

I'm a consultant, that's true. I prepare a few PowerPoint presentations and have some calls with clients. But the truth is that I am a TECHNICAL consultant cause my job involves a lot o technical skills in order to be done properly (e.g. knowing how data centers are designed and managed, what hypervisors are, virtualization, SQL skills for databases, advanced Excel, data analysis skills). All things I never did before and that never appealed me and that I still can0t do properly. Long story short, this job is 90% working on spreadsheets with huge amount of data, performing data analysis and trying to match all that data with vendors licensing ""terms and conditions"".

In addition to that, since I was hired I did very little other than receiving training on the job (basically reading stuff on my own, joining online meeting where my colleagues talk or staring at a screen for 4-6h watching them performing data analysis on SQL or Excel). A lot of training on the job, but really boring and ineffective. The few times they assign me a task is very stressful cause I can't do it properly and so every time is a pain.

Now, I tried to bring that up with my boss after the first 4 months (I had already spent a whole month doing nothing at the time). He said that they understand my situation and that I shouldn't worry since they knew I didn't have an IT background. Now a year passed and I'm still pretty much in the same situation. I'm tired of being paid to do nothing and I can't understand if my boss is just waiting for me to resign cause he finally understood that I 'm not a good fit for this job. I do the bare minimum and I'm just fallowing a couple of small projects. Every time I have meetings with my boss he's very polite and doesn't show any sign of frustration.

I tried to find a another job but without success. Working again as IT asset management consultant is not an option, of course.

I spent the last 4 weeks doing almost nothing (it's not an exaggeration) and 2 months ago I started attending a 10-month Web Development course at a local school. I already studied web design/development on my own in the past, and I've decided to give it a real shot since I enjoy it and I think I'm pretty decent at it. I spend my days doing the exercises they give us and learning web development, which I'm grateful for.

What are your thoughts about my situation? I think I'm living in a bubble now and I don't think I can evaluate it properly from the inside.

I got this job after many rejections and it looked promising since it was almost full remote, it was a consultancy job and it involved software licenses/IT asset management and sounded like something I could do well (I'm a bit nerd, use Linux, assemble my own PCs, I learned some basics of coding and IT jargon at the law firm where I used to work cause we worked with software licenses).

My boss is good, I got a ton of training (hell, basically I did just that for a whole year, with training on the job, self-teaching, etc.), I work from home, the company culture is not great but it's definitely not toxic. 

The point is, a few days ago I completed my first year here and I really HATE this job and I'm still really incompetent at it. 

I partially blame myself because, finding it super boring, I have no motivation to get better at doing it. But I also blame this company because I think they didn't give me a correct representation of the real job during my interview. 

I'm a consultant, that's true. I prepare a few PowerPoint presentations and have some calls with clients. But the truth is that I am a TECHNICAL consultant cause my job involves a lot o technical skills in order to be done properly (e.g. knowing how data centers are designed and managed, what hypervisors are, virtualization, SQL skills for databases, advanced Excel, data analysis skills). All things I never did before, never appealed me and that I still can't do properly. Long story short, this job is 90% working on spreadsheets with huge amount of data, performing data analysis trying to match all that data with vendors licensing ""terms and conditions"" and give clients a compliance assessment.

In addition to that, since I was hired I did very little other than receiving training on the job (basically reading stuff on my own, joining online meetings where my colleagues talk or staring at a screen for 4-6h watching them performing data analysis on SQL or Excel). A lot of training on the job, but really boring and ineffective. The  few times they assign me a task it is very stressful cause I can't do it properly and so every time is a pain.

Now, I tried to bring that up with my boss after the first 4 months (I had already spent a whole month doing nothing at the time). He said that they understand my situation and that I shouldn't worry since they knew I didn't have an IT background. Now a year passed and I'm still pretty much in the same situation. I'm tired of being paid to do nothing and I can't understand if my boss is just waiting for me to resign cause he finally understood that I 'm not a good fit for this job. I do the bare minimum and I'm just following a couple of small projects. Every time I have meetings with my boss he's very polite and doesn't show any sign of frustration.

I tried to find a another job but without success so far. Working again as IT asset management consultant is not an option, of course. 

I spent the last 2 months doing almost nothing (it's not an exaggeration) and 2 months ago I started attending a 10-month Web Development course at a local school. I already studied web design/development on my own in the past, and I've decided to give it a real shot since I enjoy it and I think I'm pretty decent at it. I spend my days doing the exercises they give us, attending the lessons and learning web development, which I'm grateful for.

What are your thoughts about my situation? I think I'm living in a bubble now and I don't think I can evaluate it properly from the inside.

1cru58d,I feel like I’m stuck in a rut after a layoff,"As the title says, I feel stuck. I was laid off due to the startup I was with restructuring last summer, having been with them for over 5 years. I grew from support to being an SME, writing the onboarding training program, providing advanced client training and consulting, and assisting the sales team.  

The reasons I was given for the layoff were due to the company restructuring, which, while I believe, I think that if personal politics had not been a factor they would have worked with me to find another path for me but due to the operations team having favorites in similar roles that wasn’t presented as an option.  I’ve spent almost a year in an outside sales role in a territory that, prior to me had not kept a rep longer than 2-3 months, and I was doing great. April was my worst month, by far, and I’m struggling this month to reestablish momentum.  This has me considering switching careers or at least companies, as I do really enjoy sales, but I’m lacking direction. 

I feel like not having a degree has nailed my feet down and made finding options limited. When I was laid off, I applied to 1057 jobs, between indeed, LinkedIn, Ziprecruiter, and personal connections, and only progressed past the initial interview with 8 companies.  3 of those moved past that and only one gave an offer, at 18k lower than advertised. 

Am I stuck in sales? How can I use training, support, sales and sales enablement experience to land something? I’m a fantastic interviewer; well spoken and friendly, but I feel like I can’t even get to the point where I’m interviewing now.

1crsli2,Data analytics - Made the wrong career move.Looking to get back into data analytics?,"Back in 2021 I ended up landing a graduate data analytics role as part of a graduate scheme at one of the Big 4 accounting firms. 

It was a good role for me at the time, working on large projects, learning SQL, PowerBI, some python and at the same time gaining some consulting skills. However one of the main things I did not like during my role as a data analyst, was the fact that a lot of my work was quite repetitive in terms of the tasks that I would be carrying out on a day-day basis, with rather low pay progression whilst at the company and as a result started looking into higher paying roles.

After 11 months in my role as a data analyst I decided upon a career within tech sales. There was an opportunity for me to make 50-100% more than what I was making with my first role and I took it. This is where things went slightly left.

I'll try keep this part short.After sometime working in sales it didn't work out as planned for me. My first company was really bad, no proper sales training and lack of direction across the board. After 8 months into the role the company decided to have there first round of layoffs and as a result the entire team (my sales team) was laid off. I spent some time travelling and found another sales role some time afterward. Unfortunately this company was only slightly better. Lack of product market fit, bad management, lack of support for the UK team. After 7 months of being there, I was put on a PIP and accepted that I would be leaving the role. 

That brings me to today. Looking back I regret my decision to leave. I enjoyed my time at sales but after the unfortunate events and the nature of the work (cold calling, lots of ups and downs) it just wasn't for me.

I have decided that I want to build a career within data analytics and continue from where I left. 

I would appreciate it if anyone has gone through a similar scenario or career switched into data analytics. 

What is the best way to get back into analytics with my current experience? Any tips in general or regarding interview processes as they will probably vary from my previous role? 

I've been beating my self up about my decision so please take it easy lol.

Was working in an entry level position in tech supporting customers previously.  Was headhunted for a job that seemed to be more up my alley in terms of the day to day work and mostly away from direct customer interactions. 

It was a really difficult decision to make because in my previous job, I enjoyed the environment, people, benefits, having a set schedule to know I could completely disconnect, but the job itself on the daily was burning me out and degrading my mental health. 

Fast forward to the new job… it went smoothly during the interview process but moved very quickly and the fully remote aspect along with not having to deal with customers directly was very appealing because I’m still dealing with that residual burnout. 

The new job is based in a different country and fully remote.  I like autonomy aspect but thus far, there hasn’t been a clear onboarding process with the basics and one of my worries is trying to adapt to all the different time zones and establish a routine.

I know no job is perfect and I hope it’ll align more with my long term goals, but I had the Sunday scaries before even starting and nervous that the feeling of dread won’t go away.

1crmty2,Urgent help needed (career advice) SA warning ,"I previously sought advice on Reddit and took the step to report sexual harassment. I was a 20F intern in a STEM field. I no longer work there because I graduated. I am hoping to take the summer off and work retail or something to save up for classes in fall. I’m scared of working in a corporate setting again as of rn. Here are the incidents:

A male coworker began with intrusive sexual questions (why are you waiting until marriage), then escalated to trying to isolate me, even attempting to drive me alone. Later, he approached me on a Saturday shift, uninvited, staring at my chest for 15 minutes. His constant comments on my petite frame heightened my anxiety.

The person in charge of interns consistently made inappropriate remarks, initially laughed off by me. However, after he asked, “Would you sleep with me for two million dollars?” following a sexual harassment training due to the first incident, I reported him. He continued to say semi-sexual remarks after. Consequently, another individual, who previously showed interest in my personal life and often complimented me, ceased all communication. Ignoring me and greeting other interns.

On top of this, almost daily, both male and female users approach me. Some interactions are friendly, while others leave me uncomfortable, like one suggesting, “If you want a kid with curly hair, I know some people,” implying himself.

I'm at a loss for what to do next. Feeling suicidal, alone, and utterly disgusted, I wonder if this will always be my reality. I've never considered myself pretty, and I never experienced this level of attention before—not in high school, not in middle school, and not even at the start of college.",negatednight,1,1.0,0,1715673938,2024-05-14 08:05:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1crmty2/urgent_help_needed_career_advice_sa_warning/,5,2024

1crkwxs,Should I take a promotion I don't want?,"\[CA\] I currently work for a large retail company as a HR Supervisor and have been here for 4 years. The pay isn't great, but my job isn't too difficult and work with a good group of people. A few months ago, an opening for HR Manager came up in my district. I wasn't even considered so I fixed up my resume and starting looking elsewhere. After some time a smaller company with maybe about <5000 employees informed me that they are preparing an offer for me for a HR employee specialist position (85k-100k).

I was dead set on leaving until today my manager called me and told me that they will be promoting me to Store Manager. Which is obviously not what I wanted to do but they have told me this is just a stepping stone and I need to make my bones before I dive into a higher HR role. It is somewhat true since most of the HR managers in my district have had a starting role in service before making there way into HR. The pay range for this promotion would also be (80k-100k) but I know they will probably offer the minimum.

Part of me thinks I should leave since I do want to further my HR career and truly have no passion for working in retail as a service manager. I love my role as a HR Partner but getting yelled at by customers over a 2 dollar coupon is not my dream job. Although I do worry about the growth at the other company. I would answer to a HR Director who answers to the only HR Executive. I don't really see much room to grow since all the higher leadership have been in their roles for 5 years+.

On the other hand the same could be said about my current company. I have seen many success stories and have also seen a lot of people stuck in their roles for years. There is also no guarantee that the next HR Manager role would be mine if I do jump into Service, but people do come and go from positions all the time in retail.

The Employee specialist position does seem to have a better work life balance. Your typical M-F 8-5 no weekends and its hybrid.

The Service Manager is a varied scheduled with rotating weekends.

Assuming both offers are the same pay...Which would you take?",BobaTeEnthusiast,1,1.0,0,1715665795,2024-05-14 05:49:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1crkwxs/should_i_take_a_promotion_i_dont_want/,5,2024

1crkn8n,"I (21M) want to quit my job, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.","Currently, I'm on a LOA (leave of absence) from my job due to my mental health. I've been receiving treatment for depression even before I started here, but this job is making it worse.

I'm in retail sales and I get amazing benefits, plus I get paid well. The dress code is also very tame and I get the option to have colored hair and piercings. I've never faced any discrimination from my coworkers, I'm in the middle upper rankings for the store/company, and my coworkers/customers generally speak highly of me. All this is to say that I like *a lot* about my job, but I really can't stand sales.

Sales and the amount of hours worked really has been what's taking a toll on my mental health (I'm scheduled 8.5hrs at a time, and I'm going overtime nearly every week). I've been wanting to go back to school for a while now as well, but it just wont be in the cards for me as long as I'm working this job. I feel like I'm just hitting a wall right now and I'm not able to move forward. I already know that I can't stay at this job since my health has just gotten worse since being there, but I'm unsure of how to go about quitting.

If I give my two weeks now, it would mean that I quit when my LOA ends, and I would owe part of an insurance premium to my work. I'm getting short-term disability benefits, and had to sign a document that mentioned owing an insurance premium to the company if I decide not to return to work. I tried looking more into that, and everything I found was pretty vague. From what I understand though, is that if employment is terminated for any reason within 30 days of my LOA, I owe that premium. I'm not sure how much it is, but I'm guessing around $400. (I'm in Colorado if anyone knows more than me about that.)

Additionally, I have about 3 months worth of savings to live on. There's the possibility that I may find a job quickly, but I'm not sure how long it would take. It makes me nervous that I've been hearing about some people going unemployed for 6 months or more. My parents offered to help me out as well, but that's much more of a last resort to me.

Of course, another option is returning to work and searching for a job. I'm a little more hesitant about this idea because I know that my mental health would get worse again. It is the safer option financially, but probably not safer for me.

I am currently facing a significant career decision: choosing between Software Engineering and Electrical Engineering. Both fields offer exciting career opportunities and potential for strong growth. However, I am seeking opinions and advice from the community to help me make the best decision.

**Software Engineering:**

* **Advantages:** This field focuses on developing and improving software, with increasing demand in the modern technology world. Opportunities exist across various industries such as IT, video games, and even healthcare.
* **Disadvantages:** It may require strong programming skills and the ability to solve complex problems. Work can become stressful and pressurized due to quality and time demands.

**Electrical Engineering:**

* **Advantages:** This field involves designing and developing electronic systems, ranging from simple household appliances to large energy systems. It can open up many opportunities in renewable energy and IT.
* **Disadvantages:** It may require deep knowledge in physics and mathematics. Work may involve dealing with complex devices and systems.

**Questions for the Community:**

* Have you ever faced a choice between these two fields before deciding on a field? If so, which field did you choose and why?
* Can you share any experiences or advice for those considering between these two fields?
* In the modern era, which field do you think will have a brighter future?

1crjuxh,I Just Got Rejected For My Dream Job After Waiting 2 Years. Now What?,"[](https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Advice%22)

Male, 27, BA in Foreign Languages and Cultures, BA in East Asian Studies (Double Major Chinese and Japanese, Double Minor Spanish and French), Graduate Certificate in Chinese-American Studies, 6 months professional job experience.

Hey there. The job search for me out of college has been exceptionally brutal. I won't get into the weeds about it, but I just spent 2 and a half years waiting on potentially being hired for my dream job, only to find out I have been determined unsuitable for the job. To say I'm crushed would be an understatement. I'd go on about how devastated I am, but no one needs to hear all that. As you can see from above, I'm multilingual, and was primarily looking for jobs relating to Translation. The job I'd like to have would have me working with the languages I've studied so hard to learn, and would utilize my expertise in East Asia. That has proven to not only be very difficult due to a lack of job postings, but my lack of experience seems to be hampering any ability to even be remotely considered.

I have explored the options my degree provides me with but have so far come to these realizations:

Interpreting: Depends on your level of experience, and where you live. There is no agreed upon standard of certification for interpreting, and it varies from state to state, and sometimes company to company. Generally requires some kind of certification and specialized training, which I have not yet received, along with experience demonstrating your expertise. You can land a high level job somewhere like the UN, or with a government or other company or agency, but the majority of jobs are freelance, with income highly variable.

Translation: There aren't as many job postings for this as you might think. Many are remote jobs, and those that do exist do not pay well (most are $35,000 a year), even for languages that are rare or in high demand. Many translation agencies outsource out-of-country, and thus have no desire or need for domestic translators, and usually only require the services of translation agency management jobs that do not actually require language skills whatsoever, such as being a liaison between clients, overseeing translations, etc. Some require ATA certification, which is a difficult requirement to meet, needing to pay a $500 *per language* fee annually, along with taking a test each year, for someone who has been unemployed for a long time now. There is the freelance route as well, but it too is highly variable, and success is not guaranteed. I would likely need to start an LLC to prevent legal issues due to lack of experience if I decided to go all-in on freelancing.

Military: This is an option I am still considering, but it has several drawbacks. It is a 5 year commitment minimum, without the freedom to say where I am to go, where I am to live, when I am to leave, no guarantees about what language I would study, or what job I would be performing, and boot-camp. The military provides absolutely no guarantees, irrespective of what a recruiter says, and I may not actually be suitable depending on a few factors (physical stature, background, etc.). If I change my mind, there would be absolutely no turning back. Lastly, the military itself is not guaranteed to accept me. However, the upside is the potential for a very high paying job out of the military when my service is complete. Some jobs pay up to $120,000 a year.

Government: 2 and half years (no, I'm not kidding), and I have nothing to show for it. I've done this route definitively, I simply do not have the energy, mental fortitude, and patience to try again.

Teaching: This is an option I am seriously considering, but it would require me to go back to school. Ideally I would like to be a Professor of Chinese, or East Asia Studies. I am $65,000 in debt, and I would be adding at least another $30,000 to that to get a PhD. I'm also unsure of where to start, and what programs to look into and apply at. Even after all of that effort and work, I may only make $40,000 a year, though I would likely enjoy the job.

Analyst: Many of my colleagues who I studied with have gone onto perform Advisory or Analyst roles, and most are doing well for themselves. This is a broad category of Risk, Financial, International, and other Analyst positions that don't directly have to do with foreign language per se, but use it as a major skill. I have attempted dozens of times to apply to various positions, but without experience, I have found I am nearly always turned down even before I get an interview.

Cryptologic Linguist: Without a Security Clearance, this is a job that is usually impossible to apply to.

These are the major options, but of course there may be many others. I'm not sure what to do or what job to apply for. There are many directions I could go in, but I'm starting to feel like I don't even know how to apply for a job anymore.

**TLDR;** What jobs should I look for now given my skills, experience, and degrees? Am I being too limited or unrealistic in my job search? How do I look for a job?

I'm totally devastated, and I don't know what to do anymore. Any advice at all would be appreciated.",Evilkenevil77,3,1.0,8,1715661821,2024-05-14 04:43:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1crjuxh/i_just_got_rejected_for_my_dream_job_after/,5,2024

My current employer is paying for me to attend a conference in June, however now I am unsure if I should let them know soon that I am leaving sin case they would want to send someone in my place to the conference instead. Should I let them know now or wait until after the conference. Would it be seen as shady if i let them know after attending the conference?

1cribom,Company executives - understanding and negotiating non-compensation terms of the employee agreement,"When you got your CEO (or other / previous C-suite) offer, what did you use to understand the various non-compensation terms in the employment agreement and what the market amounts were for the terms? This was difficult for me to figure out, because having a lengthy contractual severance, a non-compete, a good reason clause, etc. were not a part of being a lower-level employee. For base / bonus / equity, there’s easy public comps and Pave, but I didn't find something similar for the other terms.  


  
When evaluating your CEO or C-suite offer, how did you gauge the value of non-monetary provisions like severance packages and non-compete clauses? I feel like unlike base pay and bonuses, these terms often lack clear market benchmarks. Did you negotiate these terms, consult an employment attorney for insights, or rely on other sources for guidance? Any help is appreciated.

Essentially, my role involves consulting, requiring more knowledge than the sales reps about our products/solutions and how they integrate into our clients’ environments. This role also does not involve any coding, so my analytical and coding skills are rusty. A large problem is I don’t know what I want to do besides make enough money to retire early.

I’ve got a difficult choice to make- for some context I have a Bachelors in Computer Science from a UK university and due to my company’s unwillingness to sponsor my work visa here I’ve decided to pursue a masters.

I’ve gotten offers from both the University of Maryland for Software Engineering and the Eindhoven University of Technology for Data Science and AI.

A few things to consider:

-UMD is ranked 169 in the world while Tu/e is 124.
-The post study work visa in NL is 1 year while the OPT + STEM OPT gives me 3 years after my degree in the US.
-NL degree has a mandatory thesis while USA one does not.
-I am very interested in Data Science and AI but unfortunately got rejected from the US schools I applied to this course for. With Software at UMD, I can always take electives in DS.
-I will probably have to learn Dutch during my studies in NL so that I can compete with the local market for jobs.
-Fees are wayyyy higher in the US for international students, NL being almost half 
-NL is much smaller than the US so this may make getting a job a little difficult when compared 
-I’m not sure about the current demand for Data Scientists and AI specialists in the NL (any inputs would be highly appreciated)
-My family resides in the UK so the NL would be a £30 1 hour flight away while the same cannot be said for the US.
-I’ve lived in the US before, moved to India when I was 10 but still having trouble deciding which place I prefer 
-NL is much better w.r.t. ease of life, labour laws, healthcare and just general safety when compared to the US with the gun violence
-Salaries are much higher in the US and I’ve been told it’s easier finding a job in Europe after having worked in the US but not the other way around.

1cre44p,Am I being too quick to judge? ,"I started a new job a week ago today(5/13/24), and already I feel off and out of place. I’m honestly considering looking for a new job come the fall because I know you should put at least six months of time into a job before going to another one. I work at a daycare, and had applied for a teachers assistant for the pre school age. Previously I’ve worked with toddlers, but I wanted to try an older age group. Working with toddlers feels under stimulating to me as of late, and I wanted to change things up for myself. When I applied to my new job, I filled out two different applications: one for an assistant toddler teacher and one for assistant preschool. While I’ve mainly worked with toddlers, I’ve also worked with infants and preschool aged children as well. I had mentioned this during my interview. I imagine that despite mentioning this, I was still chosen for the toddler assistant based on my experience. So far, it’s honestly been difficult for me to actually get excited about getting up in the morning. The pay is slightly higher than my previous job, I do get great benefits(health,dental,vision, pto, sick, bereavement, maternity, and a 403b amongst other things) and it is a smaller setting compared to my last job; so it would feel like a shame to find something else. I want to speak to my boss about maybe moving to the preschool classroom, despite being paid less than what I’d be making now. Maybe that’s stupid, but I’d rather make less doing what I love than make more doing what I don’t. 
Adding onto not getting the age group I preferred, as I mentioned before I feel under stimulated by toddlers. Don’t get me wrong, they’re adorable- but I want something more than that. I’m tired of potty training, the “no biting” talk, diapers, and the pacifier talk. I want to teach kids their letters, writing, numbers. I want to do the things that the older kids can do. Not only that, but I’ve noticed there isn’t exactly any structure in the room I’m in. The toddler room is kind of..ran by the toddlers. There’s not much structure in terms of following a schedule/routine and I think that’s what’s making it so tough. I know I’ve only been there a week, but I’ve been in a setting where the children aren’t following their set routine and it was incredibly difficult for anything to actually get done. I don’t want to overstep any boundaries, like I said it’s only my first week. But I’m already seeing where this is heading and I’m afraid that I’ll hate waking up and going to work everyday. Also, not to play the race card- but I also feel out of place. I’m one of the only people of color in the building. Is it wrong to feel off because of that too??? I’m 25. I have no degree(yet) but I feel so stuck. I plan on going back to school in the fall for social work. But it feels like I’m just running out of time. Switching jobs like this feels too reckless.

Burned out from customer service side and the non-regular hours. I have godkids, nieces, and I'm tired of missing birthday parties on weekends, etc... Current position actually have 6 paid holidays and OT is discouraged, so work life balance is much better than it's been in other roles.

Mid 30s, have been in retail/restaurant manager roles for about 11 years. 

Bachelor's degree in Sociology (minor in psych).


Aspects  I've been successful with (for leveraging into a new position?)
-Training (new hires, developing talent into management). This includes training manager candidates for other locations, writing trainings, being champion of test policies
-Office managerial duties. Ordering, maintenance, scheduling and dealing with vendors or repairmen, scheduling, etc
-HR work. Orientation, interviewing, assistance with benefits, payroll, tracking feedback
-Quality assurance/ensuring standards are followed

Main goals would be M-F work, and non-customer facing. I'm open to getting some certifications or something along those lines. Can take a paycut, but not a massive one (last year gross $67,000)

1crdinv,"Been work here for more then a year, hidden problem shows and lack of job satisfaction","I work in this micro company as a adinistration role for over a year, it just me and my boss, and my boss not always in the office. so pretty much self paced. The same position person that my boss with only trained me for less than 5 hours, after that I am directly trained by my boss, my boss is kind enough to allow my mistakes (which I made a lot I have to admit) but I started to find  I am  working the load of 2 people who used to share the same workload. As in the past, my boss never have any worker only sololy work with her but me.

My boss started to compare me and other people who used to work with her that is the higher title and keep questioning why I am not able to work as well as them and it took me longer. I wanted to tell her that the main reason is because she used to have 1 more man power (and those worker tend to team with someone who worked over 2 years) while I don't but she sees all employees as individual performance but not as a team. To her, I am the slowest, basically the worst worker.

One of the main reason I don't want to change job is because my current job title is the receiptionist, dispite I also worked as pretty much everything except for professtional tasks, not even a office assistance, case manager, nor secretary. While being a receiptionist is just like 30% of my work. This will heavily affect my job search in the future. 

The other reason I don't want to leave is becuase this job is paying about 10% higher than other company in the market that offers slightly higher title. And as you know, the job market is not as good as before, if I am changing job, I must expect the salary will dropped which I do not want to. 

My boss is kind enough to allow me to go to school which works only as a part time (34 hours), and for than not too many company is willing to offer, however, most of the time my boss don't really happy if I go for doctor's appointment during the work hours. Don't even take about asking for vacation, now i am just saving my vocation for I don't know reasons. 

One problem from myself is that, my same field first job, also my second longest job, they simply told other company not to hire me while I work at their place like 5 years ago. which basically bring me to little to no work reference. 

One variable thing is, my boss finally hired another worker who worked as a higher role that might help with the situtation and the new worker will be on board next week.

1crd4bi,Research Lab vs Game Store Employee,"I am a 22-year-old Biology graduate in the UK. I have secured job offers from a research laboratory and from a game store, CeX. The choice seems obvious, but I am very reluctant to accept the lab job because of my passion, music. I am in a situation where I will be fine financially if I work part time at CeX, the pay will be much less than in the lab, but it will be enough to live and save £200 a month. The main reason I am tempted to choose CeX is because of the freedom. I see it as a very easy job that doesn’t require much thought. It would leave me a lot of free time to practice and make music, which is my ultimate goal. Before I sound like a deluded idiot, I want to attest that I am not the kind of person to do something which has no hope of bearing fruit. I know that if I put in the time, at some point I will be able to make a living off music, in fact I have already made my first sale. The reason I am in the field of biology in the first place is because I only discovered my passion for music in university.

On the other hand, working in the lab is a much safer, but less satisfying option. I have already worked this kind of job before, and I don’t think there is a middle ground where I can work in the lab and still make considerable headway in music. There just isn’t enough time in the day and I am only human, not to mention I am starting later than others.

1crckh1,At a bit of a crossroads… what would you choose?,"Hello! So I have a few offers, and I’m not sure the right direction to go… For reference, 21M, married, LCOL area, MBA, recently laid off…


Offer 1: Large telecommunications company in Business Sales. I previously worked for this company, before going to another one and getting laid off. They offered to interview me for a position for the business department - even though I was retail prior. It’s remote with 25-50% travel, and the travel locations are roughly 1.5-2 hours away. The pay is $55k base + a target commission of $40k, and bonus potential up to $15k. Amazing benefits including helping repay student loans. Great company.

Offer 2: Federal government position, in an examination capacity role. It’s 100% onsite, and making around $49k-$52k. Have had a lot of family work for this branch, and some family friends in management and a couple of personal friends working there, in different departments. It’s about a 7-10 minute drive, and obviously federal benefits. Promotion potential up to $130k.

Offer 3: Large telecom/tv/internet company. Senior level manager in sales. It’s also 100% onsite, however this one is an entire state away, or rather a 2.5 hour drive. The salary is $100k + commission (with a target commission being $40k) + bonus potential up to $25k, and stock options up to $5k. Benefits are good, but not spectacular. I like the company, and like the idea of being at a senior manager making that money early in my career/life especially for my wife and I but worried if I even deserve it?

Offer 4: One of if not the largest Oil & Gas company in the US. In Water Logistics. I would be planning routes, and assisting haulers with emergency dispatching calls - in offer person, so I wouldn’t be the one doing the trucking. It’s 100% onsite and about a 10 minute drive. It’s a 12-hour shift position, 7-days on, 7-days off. Each month the shift rotates, so Day Shift 1 month, Night Shift the next. Pay is $60k, but with overtime can be around $85k - as mentioned by the Hiring Manager, and stated “overtime is built in, so it’s closer to the higher”. Benefits are meh, but they offer $5k in student loan repayment per year (my MBA is only $17k). Company I have always wanted to work for, but at a different capacity, however, they’re typically not hiring because their retention is so high. Their turnover is about 3%. Family member works in there as a HR Director also.

Offer 5: Large insurance company. Doing adjustments for large weather events. Pay is $60k and can come with bonuses up to $5k. It’s between 220-240 days of work per year, and benefits are meh. It’s remote, but with travel across my state and some surrounding ones, as needed. Good company and opportunities for advancement, and seems like a good work life balance.

What do you all think? I feel like I want the senior level one, but I don’t really want to move to a HCOL environment, or have to travel that much daily. I feel like I’m blessed to have so many opportunities but don’t want to make the wrong choice. Thanks in advance!

1crcciv,idk how i should feel at this point. my friend got a job that i would say i’m more qualified for.,"So, a little background information. I’m currently in grade 10 and my friend is in grade 9. We both have the exact certifications (Bronze Medallion & Cross, plus Standard First Aid), and i am taking a WSI course this weekend, and she is not. i don’t mean to bring anyone down or hurt her feelings, but i would argue that I am more qualified than her because i did better is every course we took together (getting height points). 

In January, I dropped off my resume at our community pool (we only have one in our city since it’s so small), and have not received any calls despite my strong resume and cover letter, with over 2 years experience at a restaurant and over 150 volunteer hours. My friend on the other hand, did not hand in any resume, has no work/volunteer experience, and is a couple of months younger than me.

She got the job as a lifeguard that i applied for today. i just don’t get why that is. i think it’s very unfair and it might be because of her connections at the pool, where her mom used to work, as well as her sister and brother. look-wise, i would say i am uglier than her and i just can’t find a real reason why they would hire her (keeping in mind she did not hand in a resume) over me, who is older, has more experience, did better in the courses to be a lifeguard and handed in my resume in january, when she just plain asked to manager about a week ago, and got the job today.

i just don’t really know how to feel about this. i love my friend, but i really wanted this job and it feels like everything is being taken away from me, just because of her looks and connections. it’s just not fair.",Illustrious_Hour_766,1,1.0,3,1715639136,2024-05-13 22:25:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1crcciv/idk_how_i_should_feel_at_this_point_my_friend_got/,5,2024

1crbk4h,"Have you ever realized you were the wrong candidate for the job, but it wasn’t your fault?","I was hired to a prestigious university (staff, not faculty). I thought my work experience was relevant, and it basically is, but I do not have a career background in the higher ed sector. I came from government, which works very differently. This has made it really difficult to understand the ins-and-outs of university operations. 

I was honest in my interviews. I think the hiring managers thought I’d bring in a lot of useful insight from my government experience. Eight months into the job, I feel like that experience has meant very little. I’m really struggling to manage my workload in the areas that relate the most to university financial management. Everything feels very unstructured, there isn’t a lot of formal training, and my managers only assign work, but don’t review it. We stopped going over my onboarding and training plan after the second week. I had to keep reminding my manager to schedule trainings. 

I am feeling some resentment about how this has gone. I told my manager and senior director how overwhelmed I’ve felt. They basically said they’d help me help myself through better time management. I acknowledge that I could do better in this area, but I still felt a little gaslit since they didn’t take any responsibility themselves for how challenging this job is for a new hire.  

One thing that really stings is that I make $20k less than I did at my old job. I took this one because I was out of work for over a year due to medical reasons. I was desperate for work. I feel like they took advantage of me by not offering me a higher salary, which is now not working out for either of us since I’m underperforming while feeling resentment about how my first year is going.  

Am I at fault for all this? Has anyone experienced something similar? Did you leave or did you try even harder to adapt and improve?

1crba2t,Leave Direct Hire Job for Long Term Contract Job,"I have been offered a contract job that pays 15% more than I make now plus includes health insurance (it's in writing). Of course there is no PTO, no 401K, no short term disability, no long term disability.

  
The contract agency is telling me that if they like me they will convert me, but there is no timeline for that. They say it could be 4 months, it could be 6 months, but this company has a history of converting people they like.

  
At the interview for the job (I went on the interview just to gain experience interviewing), the hiring manager at this company (a large defense company) answered my question about why they are hiring a program manager through a contract agency instead of as direct hire because program managers are historically NEVER contractors... They are always direct hires no matter what engineering company you go to.  So I asked about that because I thought that was weird.

  
The hiring manager said that by hiring a contract worker that it's easier to let them go if they don't work out.

  
Not that I am a slacker, but that didn't give me a good feeling. Like any other company, my fate would rest in this one person's opinion of me and being a contractor, in theory he could just call up the agency and say I'm not needed anymore.

  
15% more money after taking into account no PTO and no holidays. Health care is included after 1 full calendar month on the job. Which means I would buy COBRA insurance for potentially 2 months to make 1 full calendar month with the agency until their health insurance kicked in.

  
There is the potential to be hired directly if they like me. If they don't like me, there is the potential to be shown the door.

  
I've been at my current job for 2 years. It's a smaller defense industry company. It doesn't pay as well. The management is kind of so-so in the department that I work in. Actually they lean a little in the direction not being very well liked.

1cra7yc,"Data science guidance, what would you do?","Hello Everyone,

I am in an interesting position and wanted to get your takes on the matter. I began my career journey rather young and have been working in corporate settings as a data analyst since 14, I was doing VBA work, basic Python, HTML, some JS…. I then began a position at 19 years old at a consulting firm that had me jumping around multiple financial and tech institutions tackling different projects where I would begin flirting with some ML concepts. During this time I’m actively pursuing a BBA in Finance hoping to secure a position as a quantitive analyst. 

COVID hits and I frankly can’t cut it in the finance world so I end up taking a job as a Data analyst at a Fortune 500 utility company where I became a senior in a year and ended up devoting close to 3 years at the company. During this time I was miserable, I was using antiquated software/methodologies, the subject material was extremely boring and I had enough so I just resigned on the spot.

During this downtime I pursued a intense Data Science bootcamp in hopes of pursuing the “fun and challenging” data analyst/scientist positions. I gave this whole backstory just to say I have no idea what my trajectory looks like from here and this shitty job market is not making it any easier. All in all my questions are:

-Should I pursue senior positions since technically I have 10 years experience in data analysis?

-Should I start from scratch since I’m still relatively young (25) and look into ML internships?

-Is there a specific way you should apply to these roles?

-Should my resume be 2-pages long?

Any other advice is welcome and appreciated, I am always open to making industry friends so feel free to reach out.

Thank you all for your time.

I work for “bad” software as it’s extremely old, frequently has issues, and our users hate the product. Being support, I have to deal with a lot of the customer dissatisfaction and find myself constantly apologizing for things I have no control over. Something will clearly not work right, and I’m given no help from management on angry customers, management often escalates the issue to become stressful for everyone so reaching out for help is a tough decision to make even when I really need it.

Without getting too much into it, I am struggling mentally and really want to find a new career. I have been applying to jobs for a few months but haven’t had any luck on something new. I also just got a raise so it makes me feel worse that I need to stick around to reap the benefits. Honestly though I’m so ready to quit due to the daily pressure and stress I feel like I’m under. I want to look for new jobs but don’t know where to begin.

1cra5oe,Using 3 weeks of PTO all at once before I quit. Risky move?,"I want to quit my job right now but I'm thinking about sticking it out for the rest of 2024 so I can job search and save money/pay off debt. I'm also trying to think ahead of how to use my PTO.

---

At the beginning of every year, we get 15 days of PTO. Also, our office closes for winter break starting Dec 23, 2024 and then we return on January 6, 2025.

I was thinking about using my PTO in January (Jan 6–24), wait a week, and then put in my two weeks or one month notice (haven't decided yet).

We're required to give 30 days notice if we're going to use 4+ days of PTO all at once. So I would need to give them notice on Dec 6, 2024 at the latest.

I'm just worried that if I request those three weeks of PTO, they're going to reject the request and press me on what's going on. Maybe even fire me before winter break even starts.

Any thoughts? My coworker requested 2 weeks last year at the beginning of Jan and she was fine. But I don't know, 3 weeks might seem suspicious.

1cr9ng2,Boss taking advantage of me?,"I work in a restaurant, and there are days off that I need next month, I told it to my boss a month ago.   
Basically what I've noticed is that the boss will bargain with me and others whenever we ask for days off, he'll always have a genuinely good reason as to why we absolutely need somebody else to cover for us otherwise it won't be possible. But other coworkers will be blunt and disagreeable and tell the boss straight up that yes they'll try to find someone but that they're still not coming in if they can't find anybody and that he'll have to figure it out. And he obliges, they get their days off with no repercussion. This dynamic also applies with free meals during a long shift, some people get them and some don't. 

Now I have a good relationship with my boss and I'm open to make sacrifices as long as he's prepared to do some for me but I'm wondering if he's just playing a game of friendliness and does the puppy eyes when necessary but that in reality he doesn't care about me and he's taking advantage of me wanting to keep the peace and help him out.

1cr9h2h,I don’t like my new job. What are my options?,"I am a front-end web developer who was recently offered a contract-to-hire position with a tech services contractor via a staffing agency. The contract term is 6 mos, with the company holding the option to convert my contract early to regular full-time employment.

I should note here that I am in an at-will state.  

My job title is UI/UX Developer, and I was led to believe that the position would be largely design-focused (which is what I want), with a portion of time doing more full-stack and back-end work as needed (our stack is Angular and .NET/C#). 

I’ve been there about a month, and my work is gradually shifting more and more toward  development work and away from design. 

I’ve also been through the whole investigation process and cleared for work on our government contracts, and am slated to begin the training process for that, receive a govt laptop, etc. I don’t know exactly what the work on the government side will look like but I sense it will also be mostly full-stack and back-end development and little actual design work. 

Today, I happened upon a UI/UX Designer opportunity that appears to be almost exclusively design-focused which I believe I am well qualified for. It pays a little less than my salary here, but more than I was making at my last job.

1cr9fvd,Got denied a promotion and I don't know what to do about it. ,"I work as a lab tech in an environmental lab in northeast USA. Well, actually, my job title is Scientist 1, but I really only do tech work for reasons that I will get into later. I was hired on as a temp and worked for nine months before they hired me. When I started, there were two other techs, but within 3 months, both of them were gone and I was alone. I carried the department through our busy season and into our slow season before they hired another person. 

Now, they officially hired me as a Scientist, with the promise that eventually I will be made a full analyst. I will prep samples and run  Mass Specs and produce data and reports and everything that entails being a scientist. I followed that carrot for nearly a year and now we're being told that our department is being moved to a new location on the other side of the state where CoL is ~20-30% higher. When this was announced for our department, all five of us were told that we basically had our pick of any position available to us as well as a retention bonus for staying with the company by September. 

Of course, this did not turn out to be true. We were later given a select list of available positions they were looking to fill, most of which were equivalent to both level and pay. I took this opportunity to try and secure an actual promotion, but I was waffling between two specific positions: Analyst and Project Manager. The analyst position would require me to move out to the new location, which I was hesitant to do given the rise in costs. The project manager position would allow me to stay where I am and even allow me the opportunity to work from home, which most PMs do anyway. 

So, I was pretty excited to explore both options. I made it abundantly clear that I was both capable and motivated to fill either position, especially when I was already fulfilling many of the PMs responsibilities by talking to clients, solving their issues, and correcting errors in their orders. I had even forced my way over to the analyst side to learn about how to run a Mass Spec. I've also shown that I'm willing to come in on weekends and stay late to make sure I fill my duties. I have a streak of overtime weeks that spans several months, and everytime they offer overtime, I always take it. I even work in other departments to help them achieve their goals. 

So, I feel I've proven beyond a doubt my work ethic and commitment to my job. So I was able to sit down with both of the managers of each respective position and the district manager. Again, I promoted myself as a viable candidate for each position, but I also voiced my concerns with pay. I let them know that my primary concern between these two positions is the level of pay. That would be the likely deciding factor for me. I also made it clear that for the Analyst position, I would need help relocating to the area.  They told me they understood, and even wrote up a proposal for a $2500 relocation package for that position. This would really only cover one month's rent for a one bedroom apartment in the area, which means I would be required to pull money out of my bonus just to complete the move.

I interviewed three times for both positions and asked all of them which position would pay more. Both of the lab managers had told me that in the long run, PMs net more than analysts, but that didn't really answer my question until I asked the district manager. He confirmed that both positions pay the same. I took a night to sit on everything and think about what I want and what I need out of my labor for this company.

Of course, my final decision was the PM position. I explained to them that it just does not make sense for me to take a position that increases my costs over a position that could potentially lower my costs when both positions pay the same. Especially if I need to pull money out of my bonus just to move. I'm already struggling with living costs, and that bonus would be extremely helpful in eliminating a significant amount of debt for me. I could not justify taking on a net loss. 

That was about three or four weeks ago, and my general sense of the interviews were good. I felt like I got along well with everyone. All of the managers I spoke to seemed happy and excited to take me on. None of them voiced any kind of trepidation at my questions or comments about pay. They all reassured me they understood what I was saying. We also talked about the responsibilities of each job and what my capabilities were and that I would need training for both positions regardless. I walked away thinking that I was guaranteed a promotion.

Cut to today, and the hiring manager for the PM position tells me they're considering other options. Now, I should highlight here that this PM position is specifically for the department that I have been working in. I have experience handling the equipment, processing orders, troubleshooting problems that relate specifically only to my department. I'm a prime and ready candidate that just needs a little more investment. Instead, I was rejected with no real specific reasoning in the email. 

I replied asking for specific reasoning, but decided to leave early because I just couldn't really handle being there after that. My boss called me just a few minutes ago and we chatted about it. He told me that I ""interviewed terribly"" because i was ""only focused on money"" and ""didn't talk about the job."" This is not true and I exploded. I was yelling and cursing at my boss. I have never done that. 

My boss is a little more relaxed I suppose as he just listened to me, reassured  me that he understands, and that he and our general manager were going to have a meeting with the hiring manager and the district manager. I like my boss and I do believe he is advocating for me, but both him and our general manager were the ones leading me on with the promise of being trained as an actual scientist. 

Now, I don't know what is going to happen. Most likely, I still won't be getting that job, but I don't know where else I could go, or if another position is still available. Work has been slowing down across the entire lab for some reason. I don't want to spend another year doing tech work.

1cr98q1,Feeling lost regarding my internship,"I am finishing my BSc in Business Administration and Management. I study in my country in a rural city, which is mostly known for the university and student life, but not much else. I came here from the capital, and I pretty much lived here for the past three years. I have made a lot of friends, relationships, and memories, and I grew in love with the city. For now, everyone I knew leaves, going back to the capital to start their careers. I got offered a job in a firm in this rural town, I worked there once already and now I have the opportunity to do my internship, however, the employers require me to work at least a whole year as a student (it is a bit problematic, because they want to keep me in the student status for a longer while). I have happily accepted the job after a week of consideration, however, there is an unsettling thought in me thinking that I will be left alone here, and get left behind. The job itself seems ideal to me and I have mostly just doubt about how am I going to start my career.

For anyone who has felt similarly, or has any advice, please feel free to comment, regarding the internship. How do I start a career and life alone in a city where I no longer know people?

So long story short, I'm a data engineer, with two years of experience, 1 year in a startup and one year in my current company.

I'm current company is giving me 1500dt monthly, at first I thought it's okay because I'm not experienced with the stack they're using.

My manager is happy with my work and honestly in this year I've learned a lot and now sometime I take in charge the most complex tasks.


I'm willing to ask for around 500 to 600 dt raise Wich is around 33% of my current salary but I'm hesitating, they may think that's I'm being pushy and greedy but deep down I think I even deserve more.

What do you guys think? Otherwise I would know the average data engineer salaries in Tunisia.

I picked civil engineering but actually over phd started enjoying programming part more.

After that I started working in academia as a lecturer and kept a civil engineering job in an office. (Not easy in term of time but managed to do it).

During phd I have decided I want out of civil engineering industry and either focus on research or go into programming (maybe apps for industry actually). 

During that time I also accepted some side gigs, and grant applications, as my job search was going nowhere

I learned programming on the side over all this time. Last year I started applying hard. After many talks I have finally landed a job offer as a software engineer. 

However at the moment I would need to drop out of the promised gig with a friendly professor that is just about to start and the grant application where I am mentioned as one of key persons (however results of the grant appliacation will not come until at least 4 months still).

I am currently at a loss for what I want to do with my career, so I need all the advice I can get. 

I (21F) have been working as an RBT for children with autism for the past year or so. I am currently about to start my 4th year of undergrad studying Elementary & Special Education. For a long time, my plan was to get a master's degree in ABA with the hopes of becoming a BCBA. However, to make a long story short, I no longer feel like I have an interest in becoming a BCBA, nor do I want to be a teacher. I'll spare you all the details of my bones to pick with the education system and ABA field; but to make a long story short, I feel incredibly burnt out and have lost my passion. I love all my clients and the children that I've worked with so far, but I don't see myself enjoying these jobs long-term. For my own sanity, I need a job that still allows me to make a difference, but is relatively hands-off. 

Now, I feel like I am stuck. I am about to begin my student teaching in the fall, and at this point, I don't see a way that I could get a job outside of the education/behavior therapy field. Ideally, I would love to work a ""behind-the-scenes"" job of what I am already familiar with (ex: office tasks, administration, paperwork). Writing is one of my biggest strengths so I don't mind a job that involves a lot of it. I am also well aware that I will need a master's degree to get anywhere with the experience I have; any advice on what degree I should go for would be appreciated.

1cr7b5d,Should I ask for a raise after working for one month?,"Some context here: I'm 18 years old (unrelated but will be 19 in a week :3 ) and I recently went out and got a job, on my very own, for the first time in my life. All of my previous positions had been handed to me by family and friends so this is a huge milestone for myself!

I'm working at a classy family-owned restaurant in my city, employed for full-time hours. I show up at around 3:30pm and may work as late as 11pm some nights.

I'm being paid minimum wage in my province, $15.75/hr. I figured that it was a start and would get my foot in the door in the culinary world, as before I had gotten the job, I really wanted a future career in the restaurant industry.

After about one month of working, I feel like I am not being compensated fairly for the amount of work that I do. I'm the only other line cook working on the appetizer station, and on Friday's and Saturday's the restaurant is at its busiest. Bills will be printed non-stop, I'm constantly moving and juggling piping hot pans, I'll occasionally burn myself... all for minimum wage. I understand it is unwise to compare your compensation to your coworkers when asking for a raise, and I don't plan on doing so, but I would like to mention to the readers of this post that the other guy on apps is making like $20/hr. The only difference between him and I is he went to culinary school and has a few more years of experience under his belt; however, I feel as if I'm performing to 80-90% of what he is capable of.

That being said, should I sit down with my boss and ask for a raise? I know for a fact that I do not want to remain in this industry, but I'm currently saving up for a vehicle and feel it would be unwise to quit and find a new job for the time being since I've already established the skill set this position requires.

On the other hand, I feel like my position is *very* secure given that I am doing a job someone wouldn't do less than $19/hr for, and are pretty good at it. What should I do?

 I appreciate any advice, or even criticism/questioning of my logic greatly! Thank you for reading this.",thechanelblanco,1,0.5699999928474426,6,1715626802,2024-05-13 19:00:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cr7b5d/should_i_ask_for_a_raise_after_working_for_one/,5,2024

Basically I received a text message this morning from an unknown number offering a job for the company mentioned in the title. The offer was for either an administrative assistant position or a customer service position, I have experience in both. I have set up profiles on a few job hunting websites so they may have gotten my number that way though I don't remember selecting my personal phone number as a means of contact (I'm pretty used to getting notifications for openings through email). They are also stating that their minimum wage is $35/hr which sounds pretty wild since in my previous job I was doing customer service, data entry, and administrative tasks and was only being paid $22/hr. Which that was fairly low for the amount of work but $35/hr seems like quite a jump. They wish to set up a Skype job briefing/interview later today.

1cr6ik7,Advice on a career change,"Hi there,

After undergrad, I pursued librarianship partly because I didn't know what else to do but partly because I had a part-time job in a library and enjoyed it. I found myself in higher ed, which I didn't really want to do but that is where my career took me. I won't get into it but librarianship is no longer an option and I have been an academic advisor for a year and absolutely hate it. I don't hate the kids but it is just exhausting, there is little room to be creative, and it's also a bit boring intellectually, not to mention the stress is not worth the pay check. I don't hate people and in fact in the right setting I enjoy building relationships but I think maybe I would be better off not working with people directly and working more with systems or strategy. 

I enjoy working with data a lot and when I was a librarian I was really interested in using data to make decisions about collections and services. That said, I don't feel confident enough to say, apply for an analyst position. This summer I'm going to try to teach myself some Python and maybe get back into Tableau to see if this boosts my confidence and maybe put some projects together.

1cr632o,Which field should I choose before I graduate from my college? ,"Confused about my future 

Hey guys, how y'all doing? Hope everybody's great. So, I need your suggestions and advice but before that, I would like to make a small introduction about myself. 

I'm 20M, a third year electronics and communication engineering major from a tier 3/4 college in Central Tamil Nadu, India. Although my major is electronics and communication, I have realized that hardware isn't for me. 

My overall performance is very poor at the lab when it comes to core subjects like Digital signal processing, Embedded systems, Analog IC design, MEMS design, etc. I don't have any knowledge in them and I don't like them. I don't think I would survive even a day at any hardware (core-based) companies. 

With that, I'm confused about what to do after college? In what field should I develop my skills to secure job opportunities? 

For now, I have 3 fields in my mind. UI/UX designing, coding ( coding as in Software developer) and finally, content/copy writer (basically that has to go with writing). I genuinely don't know which one to go with. 

Before I go into the specifics of why I have each of the above mentioned fields of interest in my mind, I would like to discuss my future plans as it would be easier for others to give me their suggestions which would match with my long term future goals. 

After graduating bachelors, I'm planning to seek a job at any private firm in Chennai or Bangalore. After working here for a few years, I would like to apply for an MBA at any foreign universities. (For now, I'm thinking of applying for Australian/Irish business schools as I have plans of settling in abroad permanently). 

I also come from a toxic and abusive family. So before I leave this country, I need to have a job, which would pay me enough to sustain myself in big cities like Chennai/Bangalore, where I wouldn't have to be dependent on my parents for daily/monthly expenses. 

Let me go with each field of interest and tell y'all why I have it in my mind. 

1) **Coding(software developer)**: Growing up, I treated Computer Science like any other subject. I would just mug-up/memorize concepts and applications without understanding them. 

This kept on going until a new CS teacher joined our school. I would pay attention to his classes with utmost interest. I would try to write my own small codes at the CS lab. 

Then the COVID came, I passed my 12th exams without even writing them lol. I tried joining the CSE/IT department within engineering but, my dad forced me to join ECE. 

In the first semester, all departments share common papers. One among them, was Python. I easily passed the semester final exams because my basic knowledge of the subject was strong, thanks to my school teacher. 

However, the long and large programs in the textbooks scared me. Then, in the 3rd semester, we were introduced to the C language paper. Let me tell, it wasn't fun 🤡. Our staff was shit who knew crap about the language, the programs were big and scary. 

I genuinely memorized random stuff for my C program exam and that's how I passed the semester final exam (I even had a backlog in it before finally passing the subject for the good) 

This killed every single interest that I had for programming. 

I would like to take up any online certification course and start to properly learn any programming language that is in demand but, the memories of those long and huge programs still scare me. I wouldn't learn to get into any certification course for the sake of it, I'm ready to genuinely learn about stuff that would be taught. 

I'm just scared will I have to deal with those long and huge programs again? (Sorry if I sound over dramatic here). 

I reckon that within programming, you have any domains such as web developer, software developer, block chain developer, etc. 

There is abundance when it comes to web developers so I don't think one would get any decent pay. That makes me want to learn a programming language which would be apt for software development. 

How much would I get paid as a fresher, given I would have completed an internship?

I have heard that even freshers with good resumes could earn a pretty decent amount of money in the initial years of their job in this domain, compared to UI/UX and copy/content writing. Is that so? 

How will, the experience of me, working as a software developer look on my resume if I had to apply for a foreign business school in future? 

I have a feeling that adding the work experience of being a software engineer wouldn't do me any help for applying to an MBA course. 

Correct me if I'm wrong but, aren't all Indian MBA applicants to foreign universities come from engineering backgrounds? 

How would I stand out from the rest of the crowd to get chosen for the MBA program at a supposed uni? Shouldn't I be different? My resume should tell a different story from the rest of the candidates, right? 

I know that work experience alone isn't something that determines your success in getting into foreign universities, you also need good scores in exams like IELTS and GRE but, wouldn't it be logical to make ourselves look unique as much as possible? 

**UI/UX designer**: Honestly, I didn't know about this until very recently. 

So correct me if I'm wrong but, UI/UX designer basically works according to customer reviews. They are responsible for designing the UI of front pages of websites and they design so, according to the reviews by customers. 

UI/UX also involves some level of programming but here, creativity matters more than problem solving and logical thinking, both of which are required skill sets in programming. 

UI/UX is an artistic domain while programming is a logical domain. 

How much would this pay? Will I be able to take care of my own expenses without relying on my parents? 

How would an experience of working as a UI/UX designer would play out in me, getting selected for a MBA course at any Aussie/Irish business school? 

I have also heard that UI/UX is the fastest growing domain in India while programming/software side is very saturated and lay offs are common in IT industry? 

But even if lay offs are common in IT, it's pretty easy for someone, who got fired in one company, to find a job in another one cos there are too many companies in India, right? We can't say the same for lay offs in UI/UX tho. 

Another friend of mine told me that with IT, I could find jobs in both Chennai and Bangalore but, the UI/UX based firms are primarily located in Bangalore and I don't have any option as I have in the domain of programming. 

3) **Content/Copy writing**: Ik that content writing and copy writing are two different domains but since both of them involve writing, I decided to club them together. 

Ever since my childhood, I always liked to write down stuff, express my thoughts and feelings in words. Matter of fact, coding is only second to writing when it comes to being my favourite activity to do. My vocabulary is somewhat better than most of my college peers. 

However, I have heard that copy/content writers get paid peanuts and open AI will virtually replace this entire domain. 

With that, I wanna ask about another domain where copy/content writing is required, Project manager? 

How much do junior project managers get paid? How prone are they to lay offs? 

If I'm not wrong, project management is the base for MBA so, wouldn't it be advantageous for me in future? 

So, that's it guys. I have expressed all my doubts and revelations within me. I'm extremely sorry if I ever mentioned anything ignorant in my writeup. I'm also sorry for my poor fluency in English. 

Keeping in mind that I don't wanna be dependent on my family for my expenses and I won't stay here for long as I plan to apply for an MBA abroad, give me your best suggestions. 

If you have made it this far, thank you so much. I appreciate it 🙏

1cr5ycy,Following up with Preferred company now that I have backup offer,"Hi everyone,

  
So I'm applying for USA engineering internships pretty late in the process. In the past 2 months I've sent out around 35 applications. I did some cold calls on linkedin and I managed to connect with the CEO of a startup (\~50 people) which I am very excited about working at. He forwarded on my application, and I did a technical interview with the manager, then I met the CEO in person to talk about the role further.

  
The technical interviewer and the CEO seemed to really like me (like a lot), and I know the technical interview went well because when I was talking to the CEO he told me that the interviewer texted him saying I did a really great job. I ended up talking with the CEO for like almost an hour before he had to go, and at the end he told me that he 'will probably be seeing me a month from now at \[company location\].' They also told me that they were going to take between 1-2 weeks to interview other candidates, and that I should follow up if I didn't hear anything. Sent a thank you note and they responded in kind. That was 8 days ago.

  
At the same time, I applied for a backup role at another engineering company (again via connecting with upper management at a company), they seemed pretty desparate for an intern because the guy they had lined up rescinded his offer in order to go work for a startup (similar to the one I am going for). Interviewed the same day I applied and I got an offer a few days ago. This morning they followed up with me saying that they need an answer by Wednesday (2 days from now).

  
I'm kind of in a bind, I am very hopeful I will get this startup internship, but I have an offer letter in hand, and I'm worried about emailing either company and potentially backfiring (trying to rush the startup or stalling the big engineering firm). Like I said it is pretty late in the internship season so I don't know if I will have any other offers if I get turned down by both. I also think accepting the offer I have is a bad idea because this company will definetly blacklist me if I become the second guy to ditch this position for a startup.  
What do you guys think I should do? I have a few options  
\- Turn down offer, hope to get Startup internship (follow up at the end of the week if necessary)  
\- Try and stall the offer (unlikely, could backfire), hope to get startup internship  
\- Email the startup company, try to rush things along (hopefully they dont get cold feet)  
\- Turn down both companies and start a worm farm  
\- Accept the offer, then rescind if I get the startup internship (definetly will get blacklisted)  
Not really sure how to proceed here, there is a wealth of knowledge online, people seem to reccomend reaching out, but I'm not sure how that power dynamic changes when we are talking about an intern with no previous work experience vs a full time engineer.",Inner_Mixture3703,1,0.6700000166893005,5,1715623522,2024-05-13 18:05:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cr5ycy/following_up_with_preferred_company_now_that_i/,5,2024

1cr4s2t,Can I negotiate benefits in exchange for extending my last day?,"Long story short, I told my boss that I want to leave the company. We’ve worked together for years and he’s very understanding. 

However, we’re about to have an insane few months with a ton of projects, so this is very much an in-opportune time for me to quit. 

If it was up to me, I’d put in my two weeks now. If it was up to them, I’d stay for the next few months to get them through the busy period without having to lose manpower and hire a replacement during the chaos. 

I really don’t see a world where I stick around much longer unless there is an incentive to. Can I negotiate on this? A few things that would incentivize me to hold off on quitting:

- a decent severance package of like 2 months pay 

- either granting me the rest of my unvested equity (about half) or extending the exercise period so I’m not forced to purchase the stock within 30 days of quitting

- extending my insurance for 6 months with company match so I’m not paying full price

Is any of this realistic? It may be worth noting that I’m going out on my own and not looking for another full time gig. I’ve already saved several months of living expenses so anything more would just really solidify my confidence in branching out solo.

1cr4h2r,What trade should I dedicate my life to and how can I do so with little support? ,"I (F26) am creative, intelligent and hard working and finding a passion to dedicate my life to would be ideal. 

I have always gotten incredible grades, graduating top of my class in high school and with honors in college. I have a masters degree in business. I currently do some free lance marketing, but I hate it. I make good money for my age (about 150k a year). 

The problem is I hate it. I am burnt out and I’m not passionate at all about what I do. I went through a lot of trauma in my late teens and early twenties and I have been more focused on survival, than following dreams. I have been very diligent working on my trauma, but it is work. I need to meet with therapists, work on myself and be stricter with things like fitness, health, diet, meditation, etc. while I heal and it’s a lot of work. 

I also do not get much support from my family, as my two older siblings are disabled. They require a lot of my parents time and money. Although they are very loving and great parents, I cannot rely on them for a lot of support. 

I live alone and am completely financially independent. It is a lot of work to pay all of my bills and run my household. Since I work from home, I have very little social support or help with anything I do. I am about 33k in debt from school and I have some credit card debt. 

The idea of going back to school with a lot of debt, focusing on mental health, running my household and being financially independent is daunting. 

My ideal job would require creativity and design. I have an incredibly vivid imagination. I want to create things and have a very hands on career. I hate working 9-5 hours and would like my own freedom and ability to work alone for long hours of my choosing on a project. I don’t love working with people as coworkers and I hate having to do things like type emails or crunch numbers. I like to have the freedom to make my own decisions. However, I am a little bit business oriented. I’m great at sales and I don’t mind working with people sometimes, if it means I can make friends or acquire customers. I love making money. I’m motivated by taking care of others and stability. I want a high paying, creative job with lots of freedom. 

I’m willing to go back to school, but only if I’m confident I won’t be adding to my debt, it’s something I would love to do and it won’t destroy my mental health. 

Several fields that I think have potential are: 
Fashion Design- I’ve always loved fashion but the fashion industry sounds horrible to me and working for a giant company sounds awful 
Photography- I find myself taking pictures of everything but I worry it’s not the most profitable or stable career choice 
Architecture- I think this encompasses my passions well, but I don’t know too much about it and I worry the education and business end will be impossible (is it?) 
Interior Design- This seems very fun and I’ve been told my apartment is stunning but again I don’t think it’s incredibly profitable or stable 
Furniture Design- I love the idea of designing unique furniture but again I think I’d end up working for a huge company 
Sculpture- I loved my sculpture class in college and the idea of working by myself for hours in a studio creating something sounds awesome, but I have no idea how you begin to make money doing this and my knowledge surrounding the industry is minimal.

Please let me know if you have any ideas for a career that might fit my needs. Also let me know if and how it is possible to change careers and be successful without running into burnt out and any advice on doing so.

1cr3ffq,Advice needed - Manager bias and ignorance,"
Have you guys ever been with a toxic manager? I just wanted some advice and tips to deal with one.

Background - I was hired as the first product person in the team (yes, even before my manager) So, I knew all the areas of the product and up-skilled everyone (including my manager)
My manager was hired after me and he was responsible for the product. This guy had absolutely no experience in leading product because he had come from sales background from another product. He neither took any effort in learning the product.
Fast forward 4 years - The product was acquired by giant MNC and there were other managers over us. He started acting very different as compared to pre-acquisition. All the time trying to show off that he knows about the product, uses buzz words, commands authority over the product, condescends other team members. 
He recently pushed one team member for promotion who licks his ass all the time. For instance, he’ll agree with my manager when he wrong and then try to act with us that it’s a messy situation instead of confronting him. I’m not a yes man and argue when things are wrong (against the best interest of the product)

All the low tier workers are fed up of him. Manager level guys don’t give a shit because it’s them and other managers from MNC. It’s absolutely a shit show. I have been observing other products in the market and they have achieve massive strides and ours is just petty internal politics. 

Current situation - I’m planning to quit and pretty sure will be given negotiated package. But don’t feel like staying here. On the other hand the job market is really slow in my region. 

Any thoughts, suggestions?

Sorry for long post but would appreciate any advice from experienced product guys. It’s affecting me mentally!",finyacht,1,1.0,1,1715617373,2024-05-13 16:22:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cr3ffq/advice_needed_manager_bias_and_ignorance/,5,2024
1cr3epa,"Career fell apart during covid, can’t find my way back into the job market.","I still don’t know how to tell the whole story succinctly. So many things have happened.

The short story is:

In 2020 I was laid off during shutdowns and I haven’t been able to find a job since.

I am 37. Lone wolf by nature, no support network. Just got kicked off medicaid. No income. No partner. A few friends. 

I have always been a career and work oriented person. I have been looking for work and upskilling constantly since 2020. I have been trying to meet people. I moved to a bigger city. I have gone to a LOT of networking events.

Have gone through my life savings (80k) over the last 3 years, only have a little left (I am very frugal).

My resume is music industry (producer, entrepreneur) and tech (aspiring jr dev, currently in post-bacc classes, have a year of freelance and open source projects).

The market being what it is, I apply for everything. (Resume is tailored to each role with a cover letter and I reach out to hiring managers)

My resume is mostly entrepreneurial (10+ years), with a couple corporate gigs over a few years, so many side hustles and manual labor gigs
that stay off the actual resume, and freelance dev since 2023.

Since 2020 getting an interview has been impossible.

I am getting close to homelessness. I don’t think I want to be homeless in my current city (cold, mean) but my hometown was a bad situation (also cold, very violent) and I didn’t have a support network anyway.

One reason I moved is because I was a victim of multiple incidents of gun violence (all were random, I am on the straight and narrow but have had bad luck).

Can’t afford therapy, can’t find a poor person therapist with availability. But I have gone to therapy in the past for 6 years or so. It was fine and I liked it. I wouldn’t say it helped me with my goals though (finding stable employment and a support network).

Career coaches have been less than helpful.

Temp agencies have been fruitless.

Body has been through the ER too much for any more manual labor (I have done a lot over the years), kitchens haven’t worked out (chaos + knives = blood).

I am in post-grad but the university won’t let me use the career center because my program is part-time.

Just looking for ideas. Job searching is pointless it seems.

I started working my current job back in November. Prior to getting the job, I had been speaking with a recruiter from a different company (my dream company) about a few positions that she had opened, but I never received an offer after interviewing. Unexpectedly, she contacted me a week ago about a job, got me an interview, and extended an offer. Despite feeling guilty about leaving my company after only a few months, I accepted the offer because it offers more money, is fully remote, and is with my dream company.

However, I'm struggling with feeling super anxious about giving my notice.. I work very closely with my manager, who is also the owner, and have formed close bonds with my coworkers in the tight-knit organization. The owner is the kindest and most giving person I have ever met. While everyone in the office is friendly, I know that the atmosphere during my last two weeks will be super awkward, especially with the office girls. 

I need to put on my 2 weeks soon. I've never experienced this level of anxiety before, and I'm unsure if I can go through with it. Given my short tenure, I worry about being perceived as a job hopper, which, given the circumstances, is essentially true. And the company really needs help, so I feel like I’m letting them down.

This didn't sit well with me as my previous merit increase was only 1.8% ($108k to $110k). I enjoy what I do but I'm not happy with my salary.

1cr0zck,Stat ar current company or look for something else?,"I have been with my company for almost 4 years. I moved to a new department about
1.5 years after starting here and have been in my current role a little over 2 years. It is a 100% remote job (but I have the option of going into one of the offices country wide; they call them hub centers since we went 100% remote). 

I am also currently in school studying cybersecurity and I am hoping to finish end of this summer (and then move to Europe later this year).

My job has crappy pay ($21/hour) and it's so boring. It's the same repetitive tasks everyday. I got so good at my job that I finished the work in half a day, rather than a full day.

So, there are some trainer positions open where I would teach new employees how to do the job. The pay is a huge increase (I would also go from hourly to salary). My current role does not have any room for growth and I'm tired of being at entry level position. 

Do I look for roles in the field I studied, or do I apply for a trainer role? The trainer role would also be 100% remote.

1cr0fa7,Cyber Security Engineer or Accountant?,"Hello,

I'm in a dilemma right now, where I don't know which career to pick from the two mentioned above.

I already have a bachelor's in Agribusiness, and honestly haven't done anything with the degree. I've just been working unrelated jobs and I've realized I don't have interest in Agribusiness and I would like to go back to school for either Cybersecurity/ IT or Accounting.

For cyber, I don't have any experience with it, but due to my interest in technology and a little bit of coding, I feel like I can do this. But I'm just worried about the job market, as I keep hearing of people struggling to find jobs; and I don't want to waste my time and money to be in that situation.

On the other hand, accounting is another choice, as I did well in math and I've heard the job security is better. I don't really get excited for accounting, but I feel like I can work in that industry and you know climb up if I get a CPA, which could increase earnings.

Honestly, none of these careers excite me, because for me at the end of the day, work is still work, but I can tolerate these ones and maybe build projects in either of them. I don't mind working, as long a work- life balance is fine, where I can clock out at the end of the day and spend time on hobbies and family. I'm willing to put in alot of hours for like 4-5 years of that helps.

TLDR:  TLDR: Currently torn between Cybersecurity/IT and Accounting careers after realizing Agribusiness isn't for me. Considering Cybersecurity due to tech interest but worried about job market. Accounting offers better job security and potential for growth with CPA, but lacks excitement. Willing to put in hours for either, prioritizing work-life balance.",davidxm8,2,0.75,3,1715609800,2024-05-13 14:16:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cr0fa7/cyber_security_engineer_or_accountant/,5,2024

1cr0cc7,Wrongful termination? Targeted employee ,"Hello,

I need some help in a situation with my boss. I have only been at the company for 6 months. For the first 3ish my boss was fine, super nice outgoing and I thought I was going to like her and succeed in the role. When I was interviewed I asked if I could analyze data and I said yes of course because prior I was a chemist. When I got to the job I did not know, nor did it say in job description I would have to know computer science such as coding, high excel, python etc. Every 3 months a data pull is done. I watched the first time then the second time I got a new laptop (old one burned out they gave me) and did not realize my accounts would not transfer when IT told me they would. I could not do the coding portion but the data analysts took that portion and I was to do excel. I did the excel portion with him walking me through and there was an error. Rather than walking me through it he just finished and told my boss and it made me look bad. She was very mad at me but I explained to her. Since then (I had 1:1 with her biweekly) she threatened to fire me every single meeting. One time I was about to go home and calmed down came back and she was sitting next to me and she got up took her stuff and moved desks after threatening me. A month passes by and it occurs consistently. I went for vacation and right before I left she apologized for threatening and said she wanted to improve our relationship and for me to come to work comfortably. When I returned from vacation she was antagonizing me in the morning first thing. She was at our meetings for 10 of 30 minutes and said she would call back. I did something for her she wanted done asap and submitted it to her before lunch. She then sent me a random invite an hour later and fired me. I had someone I know who is he look over the letter and they said it’s not termination it was a lay off and she gave me 6K in severance which I heard is high for only being there for a few months. I contacted HR legal 6 days ago and nothing yet. Is it possible there is investigation that she wrongfully terminated me. The letter was not even signed by head of department and it as saved 5 days before I got fired. Sorry this is embarrassing and I feel like a failure any advice is appreciated thank you!

1cr0b02,Be Real: Does my job sucks?,"I am currently working in a Power Plant as an maintenance engineer. As looking at the timings the job should be not more than 8:30 hrs per day , but as soon as i joined the job I realized that each day you are expected to work more , like on average 9:30 to 10 hours , so it is kind of frustrating because unlike IT jobs i get only 1 day a week off. Also this hours are the minimum we generally stay it can many times go up if some troubles comes up.  
Now the thing is , no one forces you to stay but still you have to stay because every other engineer stays and importantly the plant head stays , and for some reason there is somehow always work come up during the shift end timings which causes extra work and demand us to stay extra hours, and I didn't even get paid for this extra hours until I stay there for four hours because then I get a half day leave in return.  
Despite having an office I can barely sit there because as soon as I go in the office some senior would come and he would ask me to stay in the field and not to sit in the office, so regardless of whether some work is going on or not I have to roam here and there in heated environment with toxic gases and most frustrating fine particles flowing around all over the place and barely any place to sit beside the office. Even if the work demands it or not i have to stay on the field. Another thing is each and every day they ask me to carry out some task but didn't provide workforce for it and ask me to adjust from somewhere as we are short on workforce always , and I end up begging workers to carry out additional work which is all frustrating because tbh i am an introvert and doesn't like interacting with people much but my whole job is continuous interaction.  
And the other thing is the task I carries out doesn't typically align with that of a role of an engineer , like i have to beg workers to bring items from company store , ensure the cleaning of the area , searching for workers and then diverting them from one work to another.  
The job is very frustrating for me and it is mainly because i have to continuously manipulate and beg workers to carry out tasks, and basically to take the responsibility of someone else work on which i have no control, secondly i have constantly stand and move here and there in a toxic gas environment with fine particles and so much heat so you can barely breath and you have to spent your day 10 hours a day , 6 days a weeks like it is physically exhausting and that comes too with mental pressure if some workers doesn't complete his work on time and generally they ask to carryout 10 hours of work in 5 hours and i have to impose that on workers which i find frustrating.",Future-Pilot-234,1,0.6700000166893005,9,1715609488,2024-05-13 14:11:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cr0b02/be_real_does_my_job_sucks/,5,2024

Just finished my holiday of 1 week, currently my motivation at work has hit an all time low, and I am dreading coming in tomorrow. My task has also suffered quiet a bit, I used to care a lot about the job, but it has recently leaked into my personal life, to the point I'm doing free overtimes.

I've been in this company for 2.6 years now, haven't had a promotion, still stuck in Junior role. I've been onboarding people on projects, and helping others with direction of the projects and even training people.

Recently the person I trained has gotten a promotion, and a good pay raise whilst I still haven't. I am not very good at company politics as I tend to come to work and just do the job, and was asked to interact with others more despite being so busy as we have short deadlines.  
I don't know what to do, Im not sure how good it looks to have 2.6 years in a company as a junior role in my resume. But I am currently looking for a different job, within the same field but a different company, which I hope to give my best to. Despite the job market having been terrible lately, I am creating new resumes individually tailored for the company I'm hoping to join.

I have gotten a hold of my life recently, finally going out, and seeing friends and family instead of being busy with work, but now I can't help but feel that I will get fired because I've lost motivation and performance wise, im only doing the bare minimum now.

1cqv7um,I don’t think I can take this anymore.,"I have been working in the same company, in the same team, for the last nine years. I specialise in traffic signals engineering. Most of my work involves going to sites to either conduct initial site measurements or commission a proposed design. Outside of that, I spend a lot of time working on designs in CAD. The biggest issue with this role is that there isn’t much work to go around, which limits your understanding of the work and hinders your progression within the company as a whole.

I am at the end of the food chain, so I get most of the scraps left over from other projects. Don’t get me wrong, there have been projects where I was the technical lead, but the work was often prescriptive, with detailed instructions on what was required for the design. Additionally, my charge-out rate to the client is significantly cheaper than the rest of the team. The reason for my position is that while working, I was also pursuing a BEng in Electrical & Electronic Engineering. During my time in the course, my stress levels were at an all-time high, and maintaining a healthy work and school balance was incredibly challenging. This was reflected in my quality of work, which led to a PIP plan during my final year of university, at the height of COVID-19.

Fast forward to now, and I have improved mentally and ethically in my attitude towards work as a whole. However, since graduating three years ago, I have been actively seeking a job in engineering. This is where the problem lies for me. I have sent out over 100 applications and received just a handful of interviews, with no job offers to show for it. Just yesterday, I sent out an application for a trainee role, which I was happy to take, but I was disqualified for answering ""no"" to one of the pre-experience questions.

Long story short, I think I’ve had enough of engineering as a whole and really need some guidance on where to go next, as this situation has been affecting my personal and family life as well.

In hindsight, I would like a role with a blend of hands-on and office work, something with purpose that provides some level of satisfaction. Even with a first-class honours degree in EEE, my understanding only stems from what I learned at university. I would still like to be in the engineering or technology industry if possible. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and please wish me good luck.",msaglam888,1,1.0,2,1715593024,2024-05-13 09:37:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cqv7um/i_dont_think_i_can_take_this_anymore/,5,2024

1cquant,34M I've been a chameleon in my career and I'm going to take another career shift ,"Hi guys/girls,

this is more like the story of my ""career"" rather than asking for advice.

here the basic context about me: 34M, Italian, graduated in law. I worked as administrative employee for a company which produces military vehicles, then worked as trainee lawyer for a legal firm focused on IT and software licenses (never become a lawyer btw), then for a bank (bank teller). All the times I quit without another job lined up because the jobs were either boring as hell (first company), paid very little and was tired of reading ton of legal stuff (legal firm) or were extremely stressful (bank). Common trait of all these jobs: I never enjoyed them and I always felt imprisoned by the routine and constraints of 8-5 jobs.

The last time I quit it wasn't a piece of cake: I was in burnout and it was the time I was more confident about finding soon another job and actually it turned out to be my longest unemployment period (1.5 years). At the beginning I enjoyed it, then it's been hard. I traveled a bit, but didn't have clear ideas about the future.

In the end I found a job (my current job) as a business consultant at an IT consultancy company focused on IT asset management (software licenses like Microsoft, Oracle, etc.). My boss is great, I work from remote most of the time (I have to go to the office once a month), the salary is decent but nothing great. But I hate this job.

I like IT in general (it's always been a hobby for me) but It turned out to be extremely technical and basically I ended up finding myself doing what I tried to avoid my whole life: working 8h a day on spreadsheets, listening to people talking about SQL and databases and perform data analysis. I still have to create presentations and have meetings with customers, but the whole subject doesn't appeal me at all and I have no interest in putting extra effort to become better at this. I'm tired of reading ""terms and conditions"" to discover little words someone came up with just to spill money to companies and staring at data walls. My colleagues are good people but they're also flat as hell.

The company is weird: I've been basically training for a whole year (being a complete cost for the company) and although this may sound great I don't think is that great. My boss is aware of that, but it seems like he's pretending everything's fine. On the one hand he knew I didn't have a technical background, on the other hand they had a lot of turnover so he's scared about losing another guy.

I'm still not autonomous and lack the necessary skills to perform well because I spend most of my days doing nothing. They don't give me much to do, and I don't ask for it unless it's really necessary to not get fired. I feel guilty cause I received a lot of training on the job but I don't think it was really effective. I also don't like being paid for doing nothing, but I really can0t help it. I hate this job and I think about quitting almost every day.

Now I'm baring with this situation only because I need the money and because this job gives me enough free time to study for my 10-month Web Development professional course. I take classes twice a week in person, and I had been studying this on my own for a year before enrolling to this professional course. I had reached a point where I felt like I needed a more structured path to gain professional skills and land my first job as web developer and designer. I'm really enjoying this and finally I can do something more creative and fun, learning skills that are the same across the world. I also feel like I'm pretty good at it compared to most of my classmates.

My goal is to be able to do this as freelance in the future without geographical constrictions. I tried remote work and it'll be hard going back to a regular job. This is a bless but also a curse, in a way.

I still need to figure out a ton of things and have a ton of self-doubt (mainly due to my current age and the erratic and disappointing career path I had so far). But for once I feel that I may be actually ending up something I enjoy. So why not giving it a shot?

1cqu7ai,Lost and need advice!,"For starters I am located in ohio, and I am unsure of what the smartest next move is. Ive been thinking about trying to create a buisness or just an llc because I want some real stability and financial security in my life. I have the opportunity to do a few  bathroom renovations (i have done 1 before this) all by myself. I used to be a plumber and basically advertise myself as a handyman but bathroom renovations  keep falling in my lap, and I enjoy them so i feel it would be smart to try and pursue specializing in just that.

My dilemma is that I'm unlicensed uninsured and don't work under an llc. It's all under the table. I don't know what I should do to move forward. 

I would very much like to be legitimate, but I am unsure of requirements to do so. Do I just get an llc and run with that? Should I get a licence to be a plumber or general contractor or some variation? Should I suck it up and go get a job somewhere doing remodels while trying to attain said licences? Is it even possible to have a single person bathroom remodel business? Should I just keep doing what I have been and not worry about it? 

I'm so absolutely lost and want to make a future for myself but I have NO CLUE what to work towards because I have no insight whether any of it is even feasible or what it would even take to accomplish. So please, anyone who has ANY advice or input on this or anything remotely related   (I dabble in any household repairs so all advice or experience is highly appreciated)   that could be an alternative or solution please shed some light on this for me!",alwaysdowneverup,2,1.0,0,1715588506,2024-05-13 08:21:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cqu7ai/lost_and_need_advice/,5,2024
1cqt186,"Graduated with a Master's degree in HCI from a well-known university in 2021 hoping to make a career change to UX design, but life (family member illness/death) happened and I haven't been able to work in UX design at all. Did I completely waste two years of my life and all my savings?","I very much enjoyed and got very high marks for my degree and was planning on quitting my work as a freelance writer/translator to pivot to UX design full-time following graduation. But as in my title, life happened, I had to move back home to take care of a close family member (leaving this vague as I know a lot of people who frequent this subreddit) who was seriously ill, and who passed away last year. The whole time I was so mentally distraught I couldn't even think of looking for a job or having to move away (we lived in the middle of nowhere), so I continued my remote writing/translation work.  
  
Now that the cloud of grief and depression has lifted enough for me to think about the future, I am just so utterly saddened by the fact that I may have wasted my entire life savings and two years in the graduate school. Obviously I wouldn't change the spent time I spent with my family member but she was excited for me to make this career change as well. I can't imagine an employer looking kindly on the fact that it's been three years since I graduated and I haven't done any UX work. I still have my portfolio from my program but if I'm going to be completely honest, the shock and grief from the past few years has made me forget most of what I learned in the program.  
  
I guess my question is - if I still want to go into the UX field, where do I start? Do I review all my work from my program, reread textbooks, relearn everything? Do I go for a certificate? Do I try to apply now and explain away the blank in my resume? I have been feeling sad and angry at myself for not having had the energy to do this sooner, and would appreciate any advice people have to give.",Proof-Mathematician6,5,0.8600000143051147,2,1715583455,2024-05-13 06:57:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cqt186/graduated_with_a_masters_degree_in_hci_from_a/,5,2024

1cqsc0g,Tx Unemployment Denial ,"After an incident where my General Manager had been very irate with me and unfair treatment had occurred I put in my two weeks notice. After my two weeks were almost up I had asked that my two weeks notice be thrown out because I didn't have another job lined up and was willing to work there despite being treated like I was treated. My GM refused to take my two weeks notice away until I had a conversation with her. She assures me that this conversation is nothing to worry about and that on Monday we would have the conversation. She says this on a Saturday night. On my next shift, which is Monday, she still doesn't have this conversation with me. She avoids me all day. Now comes Tuesday, my last day, and unintentionally I was late. I was told to come to work my shift but after this shift I would have a conversation with my GM. In this meeting she tells me that her original conversation with me was to put me on a probation period for putting in my two weeks notice. I was going to be punished for putting in my two weeks that I tried to take back.Then tells me that due to me being late she now has decided to fire me. 
The following Monday I file unemployment and tell them this exact same story. My GM tells unemployment I quit and provided my two weeks notice as proof. I was told that she provided my two weeks notice by the unemployment customer service representative.
 This is obviously not the truth and i'm desperately anticipating a denial from unemployment because of this. Advice of I am denied? ",kelzzz333,0,0.5,5,1715580560,2024-05-13 06:09:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cqsc0g/tx_unemployment_denial/,5,2024

1cqre1k,Actuary vs Engineer + MBA,"Hello,

I 18M am currently in my last year of highschool and need to decide on a university program soon. For context, I'm from Toronto, Canada. I got accepted into two really good programs - chemical engineering and math and business double degree. I am unsure of what I want to do as I am equally passionate about both. If I were to get an engineering degree, I'd want to get an MBA afterwards. If I get a degree in math, I'd want to become an actuary.

I am seeking advice on which program to take. Perhaps this is bad, but I am quite money motivated. Which program would you all recommend if I want to live a successful life and make a lot of money. As I said before, I am equally passionate about both, so the only determining factor now would be the pay after school.

1cqrdyo,Should I quit my job?,"am genuinely at my wits end and I could really use some advice about my situation.

I graduated college last year in May and it took me six months to land any kind of job, let alone an interview anywhere. In January I applied to a job that I thought would be a hybrid administrative position. They gave me an interview and I was so grateful because I could start making money to assist myself and my family. I was grateful to get the job and while the schedule wasn’t the greatest, I was extremely desperate to get any job just to make some money to be able to survive. When I was in training we began with all of the information part so I wasn’t too alarmed or anything. And then when we began to do a test run of the job, I realized that it was a remote call center job. While I have known for awhile that I would not do good at call center jobs because of my sensitivity to other’s emotions and I over use my empathy, I thought I should try to give it a try because I need a job.

I have been at this job for four months and it’s completely ruined me on the inside and out. I spend everyday crying over work (before, during, after). I wake up in the morning absolutely nauseous and stressed. It’s caused some of the work migraines I’ve ever experienced. All of these issues got so bad that I had to go to the ER because my head was pounding and I couldn’t eat (I got a strike against me since the doc told me to take a day off before I get worse and I was still in my 90 day period). I had a complete mental breakdown one day after being yelled at for 8 hours straight and when I reached out to my supervisor, they read my message and ignored me (I ran a fever from the stress). I have also gained weight due to the stress. And I my social anxiety has worsened as I am home 24/7 at this point. And the cherry on top is that my schedule is from 11:30 am to 8pm, which is also messing me up.

I have applied a bunch of other jobs but haven’t heard anything back yet from some of those places yet. I am really terrified of quitting this job and going back to being unemployed.

I am only 21 and this job has really ruined me. I used to be sweet and happy, always wanting to go out and try new things. I now sleep with a mouth guard because of how much I clench my teeth at night and during work. Now my mental is ruined and it driven me to have awful thoughts about living. I’m just really afraid to keep going like this and it really just kills me.

I welcome any and all advice, tips and tricks to deal with stress, or any comments!

Sorry for the long post/rant but I appreciate you greatly and I hope you’re having a better day love!💗",summer12317,2,1.0,13,1715576867,2024-05-13 05:07:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cqrdyo/should_i_quit_my_job/,5,2024
1cqrd9r,Stuck between a rock and a hard place,"Hi all good people.   
I have a situation and looking for some feedback. Please read and respond as you like, I would love to read everyone's responses be it in their way or advice.

So I am a software developer, for about 17 years, and worked for the current company for about 11 years. We are a very small, but very well known company in GIS, in this country, local, as we are a projects company.  
I love working for the company under the CEO as his vision and drive, and just everything is relaxing. There has been about 5 developers in the company in my time. 2 juniors under my wing. I got ""promoted"" (quotes because it is not official on paper and I feel it is only a ""bribe"" to keep me at the company) last year November. Now in our office that are about 15 people... We are now 4 managers, me being the last. It is Projects, Sales, HR ad Finance and me, Technical. I don't have any staff working under me, but I am ""responsible"" for the IT strategy. I am LOVING the opportunity as I transisted from Development to management joyfully...  
Unfortunatly, I am quite hated. Firstly, the other 2 manager (not sales) has tried to get me fired since 2020, for some unknown reason. I don't have an opinion on this, but I have been told they are woman who cant stand competition, and the two of them are very close. They are terrible at the management job. I constantly complain about the stuff not putting in the work, we are only at the office 8hours, taking lunch ""after hours"", but everyone still takes about 1-2 hours of company time to do personal stuff, like talking, smoking,coffee, etc. Now personally I don't mind this. The company is small enough and the projects is relaxed enough, however we are heading for trouble. The CEO is heading for 70, and in his circle of business (we deal a lot with other businesses and there solutions), there is only 1 person older than him. I fear the day he steps down.  
The company is partly owned by another company, who makes sales of ZAR100M+ where we barely make ZAR5M+ and for this reason our company is a waste. We ALL know the company will be closed down went the CEO retires as the other company will take over, look at us and say ""no way..."". Now according to the CEO, he's hope is that we can become self statainable with the hopes the other company will just let us run, as long as they don't have to get involved....  
I have had many chats with the CEO and he ""claims"" of the management team, I am the only one (to his surprise) willing to step up and drive the company... But he gives of the feeling that he does not want me (a developer specifically) to run the company.  
Now I am working on one last MASIVE project, which is a whole complication on its own, then I am thinking about stopping development and stepping up management. Maybe taking classes and what now.

I personally believe this company will not be around in 5 years from now, and I am getting NO support from the other managers, infact, they try to put me down as much as possible. I openly told the CEO that I have been in the back of my mind ""thinking"" the COO (non-existant position in our company) position and planning steps that I would take. One of the demands is that I am about the other managers and they will take me seriously. The CEO is very direct-indirect. He did not tell me that that COO position will not happen, but his attitude did. Here is another think he does, the building we run our offices (shared building with other companies) flooded when the bathroom taps were not closes. I contacted the HR and Projects manager as they deal with the complex block and know all the building people - I arrive about an hour before everyone else. They I got this ugly attitude from HR saying ""its not my job"". I nearly slipped and feel because of the water, and they - managers told me ""its not their job"". Terible. When I told the CEO he said he will talk to her - but wont (he said this) attack her, he will simply ask ""what do you think your job is"".... Now the CEO is old and kinda short, so there is talks that he is scared of the 2 managers, so maybe that is is.  
Final thing I will say - Our CEO has been told directly from the other shareholder that he is very good at what he does, but he is VERY bad at managing...   
I don't have friends or family I can really talk to about this, so I am venting, hoping to get advice, but also hoping to hear stories of others who may have had the same situation who can give me advice.

1cqo2qq,[CA] Withdrew my resignation with the intention of taking a LOA,"I work part-time at a medical office and recently withdrew my resignation letter (submitted April 24th) under the condition I could take a two-week leave of absense, for personal reasons, after my planned last day of 5/9. 

I was verbally told HR had accepted my withdrawal 4/28 by my manager, but that there was some background conversations in management regarding my reasoning due to a second job, as I'd told my previous manager when going part time. 

For some clarification on the above, the office I work for is part of a chain, and separate managers handle different clinics. When I asked to be part time, I was still at the same location which was close to home, but was told I had to transfer to a further location if I wanted to stay part time - meaning new manager. 

HRs only attempts to contact me have been off the clock via phone regarding my leave, missed a scheduled appointment time, and recently (5/8) sent me FMLA paperwork with wording that contradicted a voicemail they left.

Their voicemail stated I could start my leave as planned, but the email said I needed to submit paperwork before it could be approved, and that my company email (which we were communicating through) would be deactivated. 

I already have an appointment to discuss related matters with my therapist this week, however given how HR has treated some of my coworkers in the past, and that there were some ""glitches"" in the schedule that led to me being alone in an office with missing medications - I did want to make sure I don't rely on HR and could use some advice on the legalities. 

I'm not entirely sure HR is including my manager in the loop as well, since, once more, I'm seeing a new schedule drop with me on to work.

I've already reached out for legal advice, but figured I'd post here to see if I could get some quicker advice as I'm considering repeating my last email to HR with my manager CC'd. Not entirely sure that's a good idea.

Already posted to r/askhr, which I'm not sure is the sub to post to, but for some added details: the place is short staffed and I have been getting some anxiety attacks while trying to keep up with the workload. We aren't trained on everything, but often have to learn on the fly to make sure the office runs smoother.

1cqnksy,Leave my stable job for the unknown?,"

Hello Everyone, 
In a dilemma and hoping someone can offer some advice or found themselves in a similar situation.

Graduated last year and took a job as a financial analyst in a rural hospital. Nailed a few projects and started reporting to the CFO after a few months.  6 months later was offered a promotion to project manager reporting to the CEO and CFO on a fair amount of large scale projects and initiatives. I have been here for around a year and a half now.

My main gripe is I am super bored. I finish the work I am given in a quarter of the given time frame, and am always praised and appreciated, but it feels so simple. 

Right now, we are looking for a strategic partnership with one of the largest and most influential healthcare orgs in the country, and was given the lead for due diligence and the clinical and administrative side of the deal, which is pretty much everything lol. I am sitting in these meetings with the entire executive team and looked at as a vital component, which feels kinda crazy.

Now, this is my dilemma. This deal will take 2-4 years to complete, and is a few months away from the start gun firing. I have lived in this area my entire life, and was exited to explore and branch out after graduation. I turned down offers from a few orgs like Disney, Citi, and a few others offering similar roles. The growth and opportunity at the hospital seemed much better, and pay was around 10-25% higher (75k current salary). The only caveat is no brand to attach to my name. While I enjoy the work life balance and exposure to the executive team, I can’t help but feel like I am being fed lob balls or something like that. The work is starting to feel pretty mundane and most of my technical skills/learning is coming from my own research. I brought powerbi, smartsheets, tableau and others to our org and taught some groups on how to use.

I feel like I haven’t “proven” myself in anything yet. Many of the people hardly know how to use excel, any of our reporting systems, and seem happy to coast in a job doing the minimum. People see me as the data and excel master, butI was under the impression this was a requirement for any business professional. It doesn’t give me any pride or confidence to help with these issues because I know this common knowledge today. The executive team are all rockstars with awesome careers before this gig, but even their praise doesnt fill me with a sense of accomplishment. They say I am a breath of fresh air and are happy to have someone who is able to speak the language and contribute meaningfully.

I find myself always traveling to the city closest city to us and vacationing to places like Disney frequently(Fam got me a season pass). It’s always gray and cold where I am and honestly feels depressing. There is hardly anyone near my age and not much to do if you aren’t into hiking. I walk around the city looking at all the young people and the fast paced environment and am drawn to it. I feel so energized and motivated there. I feel like I could conquer anything I put my mind to there. People talking about start ups, banking, tech, MBAs and the local sports teams.

So in short, thanks for reading if you are still here, is I feel like I am missing out on some experiences and gratification by staying in rural healthcare. I feel like my peers are shooting ahead and have these sexy brands to their names. Turning down offers from Disney etc is starting to keep me up at night. I am tempted to reach back out and apply to more positions, but feel bad because it would make me feel like I am leaving my current org and team out to dry. They are really investing in me, but it just is not stimulating me. A lot of people are jealous of me and claiming nepotism, which is really making me feel unwelcome to the general pop of the org. I am seen as the hand and ear to the execs.I don’t have many people to talk to about this, so I figured I would dump it here. I am really considering pursuing a position in Disney or reaching out to some connections to see if I can land another banking job.

Any advice or suggestions is welcome. I feel pretty lost and would love to hear from anyone willing to share.

If you read this, I sincerely thank you for giving me your time to review this. Happy to share more details if any questions arise",Neylliot,0,0.5,1,1715564082,2024-05-13 01:34:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cqnksy/leave_my_stable_job_for_the_unknown/,5,2024
1cqnfmy,"I work for a small SUNY school in a tiny department, how much notice should I give before leaving?","TL;DR my department relies heavily on each other and I want to give them plenty of notice so they can find a replacement before I leave. But I don't know how much notice I should give.


I work in the chem department as a lab manager, the other 8 employees are professors. I set up the teaching labs, the professors teach the labs. I also handle the inventory, instrument maintenance, and the preparation of all materials needed for each week's lab. My wife and I are moving back to our hometown in September so I will be leaving the job.

How much notice should I give? I want them to have adequate time to find a replacement over the summer while there are no classes. However I also don't want to give so much notice that I am out a job 2 months before we move. I know that people typically say 2-3 weeks notice, but it seems that my situation is different given how much we all rely on each other.

I am also somewhat worried that this will reflect poorly on me. I did well at the job but I think my leaving will come as a surprise to everyone. I am the youngest by about 15 years and I didn't get all that close with any of my co workers. I just don't want to get screwed over applying to new jobs if they give me a bad reference because I left them high and dry for the semester.

Problem: I want to have more hours for greater pay. I want to ask if they can increase my hours to 5 days a week. But if they can’t, I would have to take up on my summer camp job. But I don’t want to loose my tutoring job (the hours clash) coz I can do it after summer too.

1cqn49m,In a pickle of staying at current job or moving forward with an oppportunity,"Probably a vague description, but this is the scenario;

So, I’ve been working at my family-owned business for almost the last ten years. I’ve been stuck at $20/hr for the last 3.5-4 years, and my dad has pretty much told me I’m capped out for earning anymore raises. 

I’m in my mid-30’s and $20/hr is just not sustainable for me anymore, especially if I want to start saving for anything. It’s really difficult for me, even if I cut expenses (i.e., cooking at home, not going out on the weekends, etc.). I have credit cards I need to payoff, but it seems almost impossible to do so at this rate (I was dumb in my 20’s, I’ll admit that and was never really given any financial/savings skills). So, I told my dad (the owner of where I work) that I was looking for a new job, updated my resumé, yadda yadda yadda. And he pretty much told me, “Whatever makes you more money and happy, I’ll support it.”

I started applying and got an offer for a job where I’ll be making approximately $15K more a year (that is huge for me), and have plenty of room to grow, along with many incentives, quarterly bonuses — pretty much the works for me. My interview is tomorrow (Monday) at 1pm, after passing the “video” interview, and over the phone interview. 

I told my manager two days ago about my plans, and she was like, “Oh, alright.” And then 10-15 mins later came back asking if I write all my expenses down, have I presented them to my dad, etc.. which, I have. I have asked for more responsibilities around the store, so I can potentially earn more and be more vital, but he won’t allow it. All the while, he is also telling my younger sister how he wants me to get a different job and not be stuck at the family business because it’s stressful in the position that he’s in. 

Anywho, I guess my manager talked to him and told him that she needs me there (I am actually very much needed at this store, but.. idk it’s like a toxic relationship since my dad doesn’t want to pay me more but is willing to help me out in financial situations WHICH I DO NOT WANT. I JUST WANT TO BE FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT.) So, my dad/boss messages me stating he is willing to put me back on salary, and the top he can go is $47K/year, for the remainder of the year and then I’m free to go. That amount is still less than what I’m currently being offered. 

Busy season will start in the next few months, and we don’t have time to hire and train someone with our POS system. 

I told my dad that sounds better than what I’ve been getting, but I still need to sit and think about it because this is an opportunity for me. He responds with, “I need you until the end of the year. I’m asking this as a FAVOR for me and the company. Considering all the help I’ve given you over the years, you can at least tough this out.”

And, I had a feeling that was eventually going to come out. Now I’m feeling guilty, but none of this would have happened if I didn’t need to make more money. I love my family business. My grandfather owned it, my dads owns it and I initially went to school to hopefully own it too, but my dad isn’t willing to hand over the reigns, nor does he want me to be a part of it from what he tells my sister.

1cqlt28,"22 and no degree, how hard is it to enter a new industry?","Currently working as a cook after dropping out of 2nd year of biology. I realized I can’t do this forever because working hours are terrible and I don’t see my family and girlfriend as much as I want to, plus I work holidays and pto is terrible.

I don’t even know where to begin looking, besides from a 1-year uni diploma in physics/chemistry and a few years of restaurant experience I don’t have much to put in my CV. I’d love to have a job where I can write, I’ve always enjoyed it and I’m good at it, I also did some freelance graphic design for a family business for around 2 years. 

I could learn a skill online before applying to jobs, but I don’t know where I have the best chance to actually find something good. Working remotely would be a dream for me, and after the pandemic I’ve seen many people go fully remote so maybe something like copywriting or data entry could work.

My career plan was to keep working in restauration until my parents got me a green card to move to the US, where I would try to start a small restaurant. (For context, I moved to France at 18 to study biology, dropped out at 20, my parents recently got their green card approved and are applying to get me one too). But now I think moving to the US could be an opportunity to start again in another industry, hopefully something less stressful and time-demanding as restauration.

I have like 5-7 years left in France, my options are to keep working in restauration or find a remote job from a foreign company, job hunting in France as a foreigner is tougher than I expected. Is there anything that I could get started on learning or any skills I could be training?

Any general advice is welcome too, thanks!

1cqkzpx,Need help thinking out pros/cons of leaving job,"Sorry for the long post, but I need help!

I've worked at a college in Department A for the past 6 years.  I was hired to build the program that I run from the ground up, which I have successfully done.  Due to overspending by leadership, the division of Dept A that I'm in is in a budget crisis, and my team has been cut from 3.5 FTEs to 1.0 FTEs (me) in the past year.  Needless to say, I'm seeking other opportunities.

The exact same job has come up in Department B at the same college.  I have done round one of interviews and it seems they are very interested in me.  However, they posted a salary range for the job and my current salary is $282 over the top of their range.  I had a meeting with the supervisor of the position, who wanted to let me know that they wouldn't be able to go over the top of their range (not even $282 to meet my current salary).  We're also coming up on the start of a new fiscal year, and if I stay at Dept A, I would receive a 3% increase in pay.  If I move to Dept B, I would have to forfeit that increase this year.  Also, I currently work from home almost all of the time.  A move to Dept B would require me to be in the office 2-3 times per week, and I'd have to pay for parking ($13/day with no parking contract, $135/month with a contract) - another hit to my take-home pay.

I am about 10-12 years from retirement, so I'm trying to be very careful about moving backward, salary-wise.  But I have no idea if Dept A is going to decide that they need to cut my program altogether (lay me off).  I know that moving to Dept B is likely to immediately improve my mental health and reinvigorate my enthusiasm for my work.

Another wrinkle is that I just got a new boss in Dept A and my program is being moved under her umbrella, which could mean that I'll have a lot more support and my job won't be as stressful/could be more successful despite being the only one running the program.  I meet with her in two days to give her an overview of my program and to share my vision of the support I'll need from her new team.

I have a second interview with Dept B later this week.  I'm trying to outline pros and cons of staying at Dept A v. moving to Dept B, but I can't seem to organize my thoughts.  I keep wondering if I should say anything to my new boss?  What questions should I ask her to glean what the future at Dept A will be like?  What else do I need to think about?

1cqkypt,My former production supervisor joined our biggest competitor and is helping them poach business and employees,"Long story short for the backstory. I am a plant manager and I discovered my production supervisor was sleeping with multiple women on the production floor. I spoke with him about it and he offered to step down from his supervisor position and move to a chemical maintenance position (same pay). His technical skills were I credible in our field and he was far and away the most experienced employee and had been there the longest. 

I called my boss to see what he thought and he said to immediately terminate him, no questions asked. So I terminate him with my boss also on the phone and he says ""your loss, I'm going to the competition now, my skills allow me to get the same position and money in any competitor company in the country""

Fast forward a couple months to recently and I get word from a few employees that he is started at our biggest competitor and calling some of my best employees saying he can get them more money to come work for him. And a couple customers have said that same competitor reached out to them and offered them better pricing, faster shipping times, and these same customers had a strong relation with this former employee. 

So I have 3 of my most senior employees (I don't have many left) put in 2 weeks notices because they are going to the competitor.  And 5 customers said they are going to take their work to the competitor.

What do I do? This loss of experience and the loss of those customers will hurt the company and the employees massively. Hours will be cut because of lack of work and inexperienced people will have to take over spots that were filled with experienced people.

What is the best course of action? ",ExistingFront5601,1,1.0,2,1715556043,2024-05-12 23:20:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cqkypt/my_former_production_supervisor_joined_our/,5,2024

1cqiwa4,This job market feels impossible... Looking for advice (25y/o),"TLDR: After layoffs from an investment banking role and a short mismatched stint in business development, I'm struggling to re-enter finance or transition to product mgmt amidst a tough job market. Seeking advice on navigating these challenges.

Especially looking for advice from people with investment banking or product management experience or recruiters in those industries. 

Life has been rough since I graduated college. I graduated from a good school with a finance major, data science minor, with strong finance co-op experience, and went into investment banking. Starting in investment banking seemed like a golden ticket—until market shifts wrecked the product I worked on (SPAC, if anyones curious). My boss and I were laid off in June 2023, and re-entering investment banking became a herculean task. It was the worst banking recruiting market in decades, teams wanted perfectly matched experience (and SPAC-focused roles were nonexistent), and I was going up against literally thousands of laid-off IB analysts for the small handful of available roles. Networking didn’t get me anywhere either. It was bad. 

It took four long months to land a new job. Out of desperation, I accepted the first offer I received—a business development role at a private credit fund. Despite a strong paycheck, the job turned out to be pure sales, my boss was a dick, and I loathed every day. I got fired after 5 months, with the parting words that I ""wasn't a fit,” which is true, because I ultimately wanted to be doing financial analysis and building models, not cold calling. 

Now comes the challenge of somehow overcoming this red flag-laden resume, and finding a new job.

I’d be happy to return to finance, but entry-level roles at banks are basically off-limits as they typically hire directly from their intern pools, and for experienced hires they overwhelmingly favor those who are currently employed / those who are laid off but overqualified and willing to step backwards just to stay in the field. 

Somehow, I can’t even get the lower-pay corporate finance analyst jobs because they typically require over two years of banking or equivalent experience.

Simultaneously, I'm considering a career pivot to product management. The role seems fascinating, and I believe I'd excel at it. However, the current market lacks entry-level opportunities like Associate Product Manager or apprenticeships, and those available are fiercely competitive.

The job market just feels incredibly hostile right now. For example, I’m seeing finance roles openly discouraging applications from those who've been laid off, and every PM position demands prior experience.

My confidence is at an all-time low. Any guidance on how to tackle these obstacles would be deeply valued.",martini_rsg,3,1.0,3,1715550264,2024-05-12 21:44:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cqiwa4/this_job_market_feels_impossible_looking_for/,5,2024
1cqiqz9,Received new offer: Should I leave my current position for it?,"Hello everyone,

I currently work in cybersecurity for an insurance/mortgage company. I like my current role and I am not active in the job market - but when recruiters reach out on LinkedIn (which they have been doing a lot recently), I consider the new opportunities. I got an interesting opportunity, did a few rounds of interviews, and got an offer. I am ~2 years into my career.

Pros and cons of the new opportunity below:

Pros:
- Salary: New role is $120k annually (hourly so potential 1.5x OT), as opposed to $95k currently salaried (which includes 3% raise just received)
- Direct “promotion”: Going from Cyber Risk Analyst to Cyber Risk Engineer, good for career progression
- Company: New role is for a big well known entertainment company with cool fun perks, as opposed to current “boring” insurance company 

Cons:
- Commute/location: New role is 4 days on-site / 1 day remote with 1.5 hour commute each way, while current role is 2 days on-site / 3 days remote with 10 minute commute each way
- Contract-to-hire: New role is hourly contract that could expire without conversion and while on contract benefits are severely limited (no PTO and 401k, limited insurance, etc.), as opposed to current role which is permanent with good benefits, etc.

Please let me know your thoughts on if the new opportunity is worth it. Feel free to ask more questions. Obvious Yes or No or 50/50? Maybe counter offer new opportunity and only take if accepted? I’ve asked people close to me and it’s pretty 50/50.

1cqilgc,Software Engineer and considering an MBA (?!),"Hihi!

Back history: I’m 28, neurospicy, queer, and AFAB. I have a liberal arts degree in Linguistics and  American Sign Language, and worked in business, sales, marketing, and real estate post graduation. When COVID hit, I joined the flood of people that went to tech boot camps and FELL IN LOVE with software engineering. I landed at a great company and have been there for 3 years. 

I’m really good at my job and have climbed the ladder fast. I recently accepted a promotion as a Team Lead; I now manage the team (7 engineers total) for one of our products, have 2 direct reports (with plans to acquire more), AND still get to commit code daily (yay!).

I’m thinking about the future and how to continue to make myself as marketable as possible to other companies. The tech job market out there is STRUGGLING and, like a lot of us, I want job security in case of layoffs/restructuring/getting acquired/even selectively moving companies.

In an effort to continue to be as marketable as possible…..what do you all think about getting an MBA as a software engineer? I _adore_ the technical aspects of my job and also recognize that I have the brain for the business/organizational/process side as well. I make great money (let’s just say around $150k) and, if I stay at this company, I could easily see becoming a Director of Engineering some day. 

I wouldn’t be looking at any of the top colleges; I’d stay in-state and would price it conservatively - most of the programs I’m looking at are about $40k-65k in total. I’d work full time (this is a must, I have kids), take classes on nights/weekends/online, finish the program in a few years.

I don’t have any student loans from my first round of school, so taking on some debt for job security and the ability to climb the ladder would make sense to me. 

I recognize that many bootcamps are ‘frowned upon’ and part of my goal here would be for people/companies to take me seriously with my liberal arts degree and boot camp certificate 😂 Why an MBA vs a Master’s in Computer Science? Variety and not niche-ing myself.

What do you think? Good idea? Bad idea? Am I looking at this all wrong?",coffeescarvescuddles,1,1.0,0,1715549438,2024-05-12 21:30:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cqilgc/software_engineer_and_considering_an_mba/,5,2024

I'm originally from Germany, but there's no comparable subreddit for German career advice. I wanted to ask if there's anything I could have done better for my application to my dream student job. It all started in mid-April when I applied for a working student position at a relatively large software company in my area. The job description aligned perfectly with my interests in my field of study.  
To stand out, I coded an interactive website instead of sending a regular cover letter. I shared the website via CodePen along with my resume, job certifications and transcripts with the recruiting team and explained in an additional letter why I chose this approach, also mentioning that I was ready to provide a ""traditional"" cover letter at anytime.  
Two to three weeks later, I received an invitation to an online interview. I got the email on a random Saturday, and they wanted to interview me on Monday. They also mentioned that I would present a short presentation during the interview, which I did. I chose a topic relevant to the job. The interview and presentation went well. They liked my previous career steps, my answers to their questions, and my abilities and knowledge. They told me I would hear back from them during the week but at the latest on the next Monday, which is tomorrow.  
On Tuesday, a day after the interview, I sent a brief email thanking them for the interview and expressing my enthusiasm for the job. On Wednesday, I reached out to a colleague I would potentially work with via LinkedIn to inquire if there was anything I could do to prepare myself for the role (e.g. specific software they use, work methods I could research). However, my message was read and ignored, although he accepted my connection message. By the way, his profile was recommended to me, so I didn't actively search for him (I don't even know the names of anyone from this company except for the HR team).  
So, I decided to pursue a free online certificate course on the official learning website of this company, which would give me a deeper understanding of the job field. My goal was to prepare myself for the job and demonstrate that I was using the waiting time to proactively.  
The course took me about 2-3 hours and had multiple questions after each section. I successfully completed it, sent the certificate to my contact person in the HR team of the company, and again, received no reply back, no confirmation, nothing. Now, tomorrow is the last day of the timeframe they mentioned to decide whether I'm getting the job or not.  
I don't want any self-assurance from you. I just want to know if there's anything I could have done better or if I've done everything within my power. I have most of the academic requirements, the abilities, and soft skills for this position.  
Thank you!",Exciting-Use9263,1,1.0,0,1715548160,2024-05-12 21:09:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cqi3zl/what_could_i_have_done_better_in_my_application/,5,2024
1cqhu1q,Should I leave my current job or stick with it for one more year until I graduate?,"I currently work in an academic library and have an offer for another library on campus. In my current job I am a supervisor on a team of 3 who all report to one supervisor above us. This library has a lot of resources and my supervisor has a lot of good connections that would help as I finish my MLS and move on into the professional realm. I have been working on getting my MLS for the past 2 years, and while I have gotten a few projects the last year, I feel as though my supervisor has not been supporting me in the way they support the other people on the team. My supervisor knows that I want to do more projects while I am here to get more experience before I graduate next year, and I was given a project but that was after I had proposed a project and my supervisor said no and gave it to the other person on my team, along with giving him more information and smaller projects that he can also complete while he completes his MLS. I feel like my supervisor hasn't been putting all of the support that they put into him into me. I have told my supervisor multiple times that I would like to do more, but I have only recently discovered that I love doing outreach and programming and I am thinking about exploring something in the space of public librarianship. So maybe I haven't gotten more because they don't know what to give me? I'm not sure.

But what makes this complicated is that we had a one-on-one meeting a few days ago and I was told that another librarian left and that responsibility fell on my supervisor for the last few months and they have been busy and haven't been able to keep up with me. In our recent one-on-one meeting we had a good conversation about projects (specifically outreach and a capstone that I need to complete for my degree) that we can do and keep up on, but promises such as these have happened before and historically, once I complete them and there is no real follow-up so they have never really gone anywhere.

The current offer I have is for a smaller dorm library on campus that essentially functions as a public library. I would be the sole supervisor there, and my job would doing outreach programs, handling administrative tasks and collection development. I would also get to lead my own team and work with my peers at similar libraries around campus for a year (which lines up with when I would be finishing my degree). It pays similarly but is a 10 month position that ends around the time I would finish my degree and would plan to move. I originally applied because I thought this opportunity would be perfect since I was no longer receiving the support that I needed at my current job. However, I received the offer the day after I had my meeting with my supervisor and I am currently at a crossroads. Do I decline the offer to let my supervisor show me that she is willing to invest in me or do I leave and go to this other opportunity where I may not have as many resources, but I can essentially start over and do what I feel is best for my career? Any and all advice would be appreciated.

TLDR: I didn't feel supported at my job so I applied for another one and have an offer. However, my boss said that they were really busy and plan to support me now, but I am not sure if that is really true. I am not sure if I should take the offer at another library or continue working at my current job.",the-boi-1,1,1.0,0,1715547433,2024-05-12 20:57:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cqhu1q/should_i_leave_my_current_job_or_stick_with_it/,5,2024
1cqhmvj,Currently a medical assistant and not sure where to go from here.,"
So a little background about me. I’m 24F and I have my associates of arts degree (basically gen ed’s) and I have my certificate for a registered medical assistant. I live with my parents and the only bills I have are my phone and my car insurance. I paid off my car so i no longer have a car payment. 

Anyway, I’ve been in my current position for 2 and a half years. I used to love my job because management was great and I just overall enjoyed what I did. However, lately I’ve been really wanting to quit due to new management and they are now running the show without asking anyone’s input. They don’t even seem to care that their decisions are making our work harder instead of better. There’s a lot more too it but it’s hard to explain. 

So long story short I want to quit. However, I don’t know what I want to do. I know for sure I don’t want to be an RN, LPN, EMT, or work in the corporate world. I enjoy having a uniform.  I was thinking about going to school in august for clinical lab tech, but I’m not sure where I wanna go job wise. There’s no “step ladder” as a medical assistant so I can’t really move up anywhere at my office nor do i want to stay. I was thinking maybe going to part time and apply to be a monitor tech or a sterile processor or something like that where I wear a uniform. I currently make $19 an hour and I’m looking to find a better paying job. I looked into a couple programs at a community college but they are full time so I’d have to quit my job while doing clinicals full time for free…which does not interest me in the slightest. 

It makes me really sad how hard I worked in highschool and how much money I thought I would make as an adult to now. I feel like my 16 year old self would be so disappointed I didn’t make more of myself already. My sister is 25 and getter her masters, and my 19 year old sister is in the marines. I just feel like the black sheep of the family and a failure lately and don’t know where I want to take my life. I no longer know where I’ll be in 5 or 10 years. I just feel stuck….",Abject_Passenger9890,3,0.8100000023841858,3,1715546900,2024-05-12 20:48:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cqhmvj/currently_a_medical_assistant_and_not_sure_where/,5,2024
1cqhlgu,I feel like I'm demotivated easily,"Let me get this straight. I'm 22 and I already had over 5 jobs and I just only barely started working since last June. On most occasions I resigned out only after 1-3 months. Don't get me wrong out of these 5, I have been in retail 4 different times. My friends are all sick of me constantly switching jobs, and one of them asked me to slow down because it's starting to get bad on my resume. The 5th one, the current one I'm on, is being an art teacher.

I have always been curious how being an art teacher have been. I've always been an art kid but in general it's hard for me to talk to kids because I always avoided them before getting this job. Talking to children has been better for me nowadays, but on some occasions I felt really demotivated to talk to them, let alone anyone. I'm not really good at pretending to be nice either.

1cqgd69,Should I begin applying for a new job?,"My current role has been good for me up until the beginning of this year. For background I am an IT consultant which this has been my first job out of college. The company has given me more than fair raises along with \*paid\* OT which I am very thankful for.

However, cracks have been forming starting this year. I am on a new project traveling 7 hr car ride to a town in middle of nowhere America at least once a month for a week. Yes, I understand other consultants/people have it worse than this, but I don't necessarily enjoy being away from friends and family this much, and it will only get worse with being gone longer in the next few months.

The biggest issue is that I don't believe my manager is happy with my performance. The majority of it I believe is unfair to me, considering because of his busy schedule, I am forced to self-teach myself various concepts that are very customized to the client organization. This results in a cycle where I will learn things, forget because I'm learning something else, relearn it, but I have to make sure I am learning it the exact right way. Sure, some of it I could've picked it up quicker, but a lot of it is much more complex than other roles from comparable employees. Manuals on most of the subjects were written by people from other countries where English is the second language. The person I replaced struggled to learn on a similar project and quickly left after being called out by people in the company. He was more publicly called out than I was, for extra info.

I get mixed reviews from my manager and honestly have no idea what he thinks. My review ending 2023 pointed out a lot of areas for improvement and criticalities. Two months later, he tells me I am doing much better. Two months after that, he tells me that I am not performing as well as he would like and he is nervous about my knowledge. And now he's joining me on the next trip to the site, which could mean that he is nervous enough about me going by myself. But also, he might just want to look good for the client. IDK. He or my boss hasn't been mean to me to my face, so it isn't toxic.

Based on my degree that works more towards business, I'm considering if it is time to find a role that I may be better at and that could advance my career further. At the same time, I'm nervous of the risk considering I've been at a job for 2 years which has me focused on a specific software, and a lot of the excel knowledge I gained in college would need to be relearned.

1cqg97t,Employer allowed me to go on education leave and now says I resigned. What do I do?,"*crossposted* 
Toward the beginning of the year, I was set to study abroad elsewhere. My employers had known about this trip for roughly 5 months, long before I left, and told me I would have a job when I returned. They informed me I would be put on an extended leave and boasted how supportive they were of their employees pursuing their education. Well, I’m due to return home in a little bit and reached out to my employer asking about the process to resume my position. Come to find out, I had “resigned” 3 weeks into my study abroad and not a single person from management bothered to tell me. My direct supervisor does seem a bit regretful in the decision, but I feel like I’ve been blindsided and soft fired from one of the, otherwise, best jobs I’ve had? I have proof of my employer giving me the okay for my study abroad dates and am even still in all the business correspondence that occurs daily. I don’t want to necessarily sue them, but am I able to report them somewhere at least? I feel like this is really shady of them since they all acted like I would be coming back to work after I was home and now I’m finding out I’m unemployed and have to start job hunting while I’m in another country. Please help.

Sincerely, a broke college student.

P.S. I work for a small business so they don’t have an HR department I can go to. Nor are we unionized as employees.

1cqfnmf,How do I get my confidence back as an young professional? ,"Hello everyone,

My name’s Maria (27) and for the last couple of months I’ve been struggling with the way I perceive my work and me as a professional

I’m currently working as a communications officer at state research unit and I absolutely love what I do.

My day-to-day work is mainly managing social media accounts, reading research articles, , transform them into valuable content for our website and interview researchers. I’m responsible for a monthly newsletter and cover/organize some research events. Besides that, I also help my peers in their tasks, from time to time.

I don’t have a good relationship with my current boss and I believe that is affecting my self-confidence as a professional. For the first 3 months of the contract, I was on the communication office of the institution where the research unit is hosted. Some confidential information started to be spread and my boss, for some reason, thought I was responsible for that. I never said anything to anyone, not even my family, but somehow, she still wanted me to move to another office.

I did and I feel much better. Everything I do still has to be validated by her (which I don’t mind), but she talks to me like “I’m an nobody” and believes that I do some stuff with a second intention (which I don’t).

(For example, one time she told me that I always thank her when she helps me with something, and she thought I do that to make her feel less than me).

She talks to me like I’m dumb, like I don’t have value and even though my peers tell that I have to make stop, I don’t have the courage to.

This entire situation is making me feel like I’m a terrible professional, that I’m worth nothing, that everything I do is wrong. How can I overcome this and get my confidence back?

Note: Before this job, I worked as I journalist for 2 years.

1cqeoo5,Help with deciding: HelpDesk role vs Cybersecurity role,"Can someone please help me decide? I have gotten an offer for 90k+ hybrid, but I’m on the fence about taking it. My friends and family say to take it, but I’m unsure.

For context, I currently work a HelpDesk role mostly doing hardware repairs and troubleshooting. All the IT tasks as of now have been outsourced so I have not done much outside of basic HelpDesk duties. I make around 66k per year.

On the other hand, I received an offer for a long term contractor cybersecurity role from a F500. After negotiation I was able to get them to move up a bit in pay, for a total of 96k hybrid with extensive regional state travel most of the time, day shift. 

Here are the pros and cons I’ve drawn up:

New offer:
Big company  
Contract for 12+ months, then hire on

Full benefits, subsidized 

Salary - $96k, hourly wage 

401k match - 3% match

Overtime -> $3000+ (usual amount a year), rarely on-call

PTO -> 21 day unpaid PTO + 10 holidays



Current role:

All Benefits fully paid for

Salary -> $66k, salaried only

401k - 3% match

No Overtime, no on call. Close to my home too

14 days PTO + 9 holidays

The bigger company has a bit more learning opportunity. I'm just torn on whether the value of working at a huge fortune 500 company and getting a contract role is worth leaving my position now. I’m also in an online school to get my degree and if I take the cybersecurity role I would have slightly less time to study for school.

drawing (semi realism/ abstraction)
painting
character design
hand crafting
designing (creating things)
writing (poems/ stories/  screenplay)
human psychology 
reading (philosophy)
indie game design
decorating
sketching (anything)

Strengths:

attention to detail
good at sketching
natural skill when it comes to most art related things
a lot of fantasy/ creative
can be persuading 
doesn't give up easily 
likes giving good advice

Weaknesses:

unfocused/ gets lost easily
can be slow with math
unorganized
bad at memorizing things 
stubborn/ will only do things my own way
problems with procasination
runs out of energy quickly when it comes to social interactions
hates small talk

Career and lifestyle goals:

How much money is enough?

Enough to keep a family living a standard life without stressing out about money I guess?
(I can be really good at saving up)
Some guy said $70 000 a year is great so lets go with that (this kind of thing is different for each country though) Its better not to focus too much on money for now.

What type of jobs do you like?

Any job that involves creating things, it makes my existence feel meaningful. (Thats why I've been thinking of architecture for a long time. Buildings last centuries.) 

Do you want a leadership position?

I wouldnt mind leading others but I dont really care about that. I would just prefer not to be one of those workers who have to do what someone else says all the time. I want to use my own creativity. Id like working with a group of equals or alone. I like working alone. 

Do you want to eventually become an entrepreneur?

That idea doesnt seem so bad, in a way I like it, but it would probably be wayyy too tiring for me. I just want to create things and live a calm life.  Constantly networking and thinking about business would be too overwhelming for me. But the idea of becoming an entrepreneur eventually might grow on me with time since it gives off a feeling of independence and like every day will be different, which I really care about. I just know that if I were to open a buisness Id invest all of my time and thought in it which wouldnt be ideal if i also want to live calmly and take care of my family.

As of right now, I've only had Architecture in mind. Although it has many issues, I cant think of anything else. What careers would you guys recommend? (Im 16F)

I applied to some companies with the same job title, because I know I have experience and there's a chance I'll get them.

I have enough to live off for at least 1 year, but I also think is it right or safe for me to be doing that?

Also, the workweek was 6 days with 8.5 working hours plus a 2.5 hour commute. This took a big toll on my mental health.

Job 4: August 2023 - April 2024

Small company, procurement only. 5 days a week, 8.5 working hours plus a 40-50 minute commute. Super chill. A job that I loved with all my heart. Not much opportunity to grow, but I saw myself working there for at least 3-4 years. Until the company was bought last month and we were laid off.

Now I am back on the job market. I look and feel like a job hopper. I have been telling recruiters and companies that I am still employed but looking for another job because the company is being sold. (Technically, I worked until this Friday.) I do not want to say that I am unemployed to avoid being offered a lower salary.

My questions are:

1) Should I remove the first job from my CV? And mention it in interviews like an internship I did? It is relevant to the jobs I'm applying to but also does not create a gap since it was during my university years and my real work history starts after master's. 
I've always kept it to make my CV look fuller, but with it, my work history looks like 1.2 years, 2 years, 1.6 years, and 10 months.

2) Since in every interview I'm asked suspiciously why I moved from finance to procurement, when applying for finance jobs, should I modify my job 3 title to finance only and mention only my finance duties. I can say about the last job, ""Tried procurement, not a good fit, getting back to finance?""

While I'd love to continue working in procurement, there are very few jobs in that field, almost always require working 6 days a week and are located outside the city center (a 2 hours commute).

Any advice would be welcome. 🫶",PainToProgress,1,1.0,0,1715536265,2024-05-12 17:51:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cqdkqe/should_i_remove_a_relevant_job_from_my_cv_to/,5,2024

1cqc4x7,So what should I do for a living?,"Hi, I’m 26, from Italy. Ever since I finished high school I’ve found myself in something of a limbo. My biggest passion is writing (novels, short stories, etc.) in both English and Italian, and it has been almost all my life. I’ve been told I have a talent for it, and I’m trying to get published, but of course it’s a difficult industry to get in.

I tried university and failed to care about it or accomplish anything for three years before I decided to drop out. Wanting to make money and be independent from my parents, I’ve tried working in real estate and retail, and in both cases I was told I wasn’t fit for the job. The problem is I’m also socially anxious, and it seems the only jobs I can get without a degree are ones involving social interactions. 

Still, I decided to try retail again — also as a form of exposure therapy — as a part-time job while I try to get some writing done and hope to get published. The main issue is I don’t care about anything job related, the topics alone of ‘money’ and ‘career’ are so depressing to me, and I have no ambition outside of becoming an author.

The way I’ve lived so far has been essentially: make anything work until I get published and make a living from books. But I don’t know if that’ll ever happen, let alone to the extent of making enough money to do it full-time. 

So is there anything I could do that wouldn’t kill my soul? A feasible plan B, should writing not work out? I’m open to any advice.

1cqbx82,Is there such thing as work-life balance in the garment/fashion industry? ,"TLDR at the bottom. 


Hello! I've recently started a coordinator role in the fashion/garment industry and looking for some insight/advice:

For some background, I studied fashion design in university and graduated with a bachelor's. Creativity and design brings me so much joy and truly is my passion so I want to try for a career in the fashion industry. Some of my key interests are garment design/ product development / technical design. 

I know that it is hard to break into the industry so I took the first opportunity I found as a coordinator to get my foot into the door. I took this role hoping it will help me in future prospects, and I think there are valuable skill sets that I can build (using PLM systems, communicating with factories overseas etc.). 

However, the work itself is very intense and draining to the point where it has been damaging my mental and physical health (stress rash/ stomach+chest pains). I've had to stay overtime every day since I've started and I constantly think about work after I leave the office (this is an entry-level role with no overtime pay).
I also have overseas contacts messaging me on my personal phone outside work hours and on the weekends which induces a lot of anxiety. And as someone who takes pride in their work, it makes me feel like I'm not doing enough to fulfil my duties. 
My onboarding was also not thorough and I was basically thrown into the work with minimal support from management. 

I understand that this is a fast-paced industry, but is there an aspect or sector to it that allows a bit more work/life balance? Do all fashion companies operate like this? I have an active and fulfilling life outside of work (sports, friends, 3 side hustles) but since starting this new job I have not been able to participate in any of my after-work activities due to the overtime and exhaustion. 

I guess I am afraid that since the fashion industry is so tight-knit and competitive, I won't be able to find another full-time role so soon with minimal experience, or won't be able leave after entering or else I'll kill my future prospects. Generally speaking I am hard-working and have always been a key player at all my past jobs, so it's not that I don't want to put in the work. I just also value my time outside of work and would like some insight on if that balance is achievable. 

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far, and any advice (even from non-fashion professionals) is appreciated! 

TLDR: Just started a new job in the fashion/garment industry and it's killing my work-life balance. Are there any roles in the industry that allows more balance? I love fashion and design and would love to have a career in soemthing related but I also want to live my life outside of work.

A week or so ago, he started talking about changing the way our team (4 people + manager) works in the sense that each person would be working more with his/her strengths instead of doing all sorts of things. He proposed to talk about this in group and adviced us to do a bit of thinking beforehand and note what we would like to do.

The things that would have made me drewl like an excited dog now do little to nothing in terms of moving me. I wonder if this is because of my 'trauma' after working for a bad boss and thinking multiple times about quitting or if it's just time for a career change.

1cq9we7,Let moocher stress me out and mess up my chance at a big job interview,"This neighbour of mine who I’ve known less than a year and hung out with a couple times asked if she could stay with me up to 4 days a month. This is due to her arrangement with her ex - they can’t afford 2 homes so they are sharing and I guess couch surfing half the month. 

I said yes due to being distracted/overwhelmed at the time, feeling sorry for her and not thinking it through. I thought she was going to compensate me but she backed away from that.

She asked if she could stay for the first time last Tuesday and I said ok. Then I got a last minute interview invite after I said yes, for Wednesday morning. I told her it was stressful and I needed a distraction free environment. She said she could make another plan but it sounded insincere/she had nowhere to go so I said ok but I need quiet to study.

She came and I was so stressed. It was disruptive, her son came over, and it hit me that I stupidly agreed to have a free loader live with me part time for an indefinite amount of time.

I couldn’t sleep a wink from the stress and messed up my interview. Of course I might not have gotten the job anyway, but I would have performed better if she hadn’t imposed on me.

I’m so sad about the job. There’s not a lot of comparable opportunities. I consol myself that originally they were going to appoint another person, but HR told them they had to post the job internally so people could compete. It is possible that I would have had a tough competition anyway. I think I had more experience but the winning candidate, the one they were going to appoint anyway, had been in the department for years, vs me only 6 months.

I won’t have her back. I’m not sure if I should reach out to tell her and what to tell her, or just wait til the next time she asks to stay, in case she doesn’t even ask if she realizes she imposed. I feel like telling her she messed up my chances but that’s just because I’m upset about the job.

Job 1

Sysadmin - most of the work is outside of my skillset and they are willing to train me on their technologies that they and their customer use.

* Lots of potential upside/growth opportunities in the area, several large companies in the area do work for this customer
* In a major city (near St. Louis)
* 401k vests immediately, matches 4% up to 6%
* Company is at the beginning of 5yr performance period for this contract (up to 10yrs)
* Total compensation \~75k
* 40hrs/wk, no travel requirement.

Job 2

Systems Technician - A lot of this work is familiar to me and requires travel. I am expected to hit the ground running but it would be the same old/same old that I currently do.

* Basically no growth opportunities/3% raise per year
* Middle of nowhere (I'm fine with this!), job is on a smaller military base.
* 401k vests after 3yrs, match 6% up to 8%
* Company is halfway through performance period, up for rebid in 2-3yrs.
* Total compensation 100k
* 40-50hrs/wk, travel requirement in and outside of U.S.

The kicker: My fiance will be coming to the U.S. and will need a job. The area that job 2 is in has no jobs in her profession. The city job 1 is in has many jobs in her field. Of course job 2 pays a noticeable chunk more but job 1 seems to have far more potential upside for both of us.

1cq25yx,How to negotiate for a higher salary in a junior position after completing one year with the company - tips and tricks,"Hey everyone!

I'm seeking some advice on navigating a salary negotiation as an architect. I've been with the same company, starting with an internship in Italy (900€/month) and then a fixed-term contract in Paris (36k€ gross) for 8 months. Tomorrow, I have a meeting with HR, likely discussing contract renewal, and I want to negotiate my salary. I'm aiming for 40k, even though several websites suggest the average in Paris for junior positions is still lower ...

I acknowledge I'm still junior but I feel have still made significant progress and taken on additional roles like lecturing at a university in Italy and being a correspondent for a Tokyo architecture magazine that enrich my position

My question is, how should I approach this if the salary increase falls short of my expectations or if HR doesn't bring up a raise at all? Would it be perceived negatively if I assertively address this matter with the company, or might it be interpreted as ingratitude? I understand logically that it wouldn't, but there's an irrational fear lingering ... I'm pretty new to this side of things, so any guidance would be much appreciated!

Jobs after the military

I’m planing to join the military, probably Army or Coast Guard; So after my service I have three career fields in mind. Here is a list of them and why I want the job, please consider my opinion and comment which one do you think is the most rewarding field.

1. Law Enforcement

Seems exciting, I would love to go patrol in a police cruiser. I love helping people and I’d love the tactical aspect to it. I also think some of the stuff they do sounds really exciting and fun, the stereotypical police chase or bank robbery scenario sounds exciting to be in. But in my area the highest crime is mostly domestic violence and drug use which I just find disgusting and boring. If I was to go into law enforcement it’d be state police, my states pay average is $64,000-$90,000, plus overtime and diverse duty pay; first year. But there is also a ton of other benefits and you get your own doge charger and a cool uniform…

2. Firefighter.

Firefighting sounds fun you don’t have to deal with a bunch of criminals but it does seem like you will see more messed up stuff and dead people which is traumatic. I would mainly like this job Beucase I like the idea of operating all the trucks and hoses and machines. Also I have connections with the local FD. The pay is 50k average the first year.

3. Deck Officer/3rd mate

I would love to work on a boat, I don’t really want to be a seaman or an oiler. So I think being a 3rd mate would be awesome. It sounds like really hard work, but I think being at sea would be really fun and the mission and all the principles of a maritime job seems amazing. A 3rd mate is basically the first rank of an officer aboard a ship its obtainable by your experience on a ship or attending a merchant marine academy for 4 years. I’d probably go with the merchant marine academy just Becuase it’s shorter and you have a guaranteed chance of getting all the certifications, and I could also use the GI bill becuase I’m going to join the military. The pay is very good 100k-150k average, and the industry is in need for more workers.

1cpucb9,High school grade 12 student in distress about their options.,"Hey, seeking some insight here. I'm currently a Grade 12 Canadian student trying to navigate my admission options. Initially, I was drawn to mechatronics engineering due to my fascination with robotics, and I even secured admission to an engineering program at a decent school. However, after attending an info session, I found myself more hesitant than convinced. The first-year curriculum doesn't align with my interests, and since I wasn't guaranteed entry to mechatronics, I'd need a very high average to transfer into it or any other engineering program I'm interested in, like computer or software engineering. My second choice was computer science because of its tech aspects and creative potential, especially in fields like AI and cybersecurity. I've already dabbled in languages like HTML, CSS, Java, C++, and Python. The universities I got into for computer science are middling at best, neither top-tier nor bottom-of-the-barrel.

At the same time, I'm contemplating commerce, mainly because I could potentially transfer into it instead of sticking with engineering. The business school at the university I'm considering is ranked top 10 in Canada, offering numerous opportunities for international exchanges – a big draw for me since I love traveling. It's worth mentioning that I've defied expectations by even applying to university, let alone getting in. Coming from a background where even my parents doubted my potential to attend university, achieving admission to the programs I've received offers for feels like a personal challenge overcome. Initially, I was eyeing college degrees in areas like game development and animation, but I didn't pursue them.

So, here's the dilemma: Should I stick with engineering, risking the possibility of being forced to change majors or dropping out if I struggle with courses I'm not passionate about? Or should I settle for computer science at universities that aren't my top choices? Alternatively, should I aim for the reputable business school, even though I'm unsure about my major preference and find researching options overwhelming? Ultimately, I aspire to work with top international companies, and I know internships and co-op opportunities are crucial – luckily, most programs offer guaranteed paid co-ops, and the business program offers internships with a starting salary around 45k, which increases over time.

Any insights would be greatly appreciated because right now, I feel completely lost and uncertain about my future path.",Dark_Buterfly,1,1.0,3,1715470560,2024-05-11 23:36:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cpucb9/high_school_grade_12_student_in_distress_about/,5,2024

Title. I was hired for a job I don’t have experience in so I researched that the market rate was higher than what they had initially offered ($25) so I proposed a salary around $30-34, since the market is $35-40. This is her response:

“We will not increase the offer to $30 to $34 per hour.  That is unrealistic.  
Good luck in your future endeavors.” Did she just rescind the offer? How do you even respond to this?

It's a good job (office work), not overworked by any means, I'm paid industry standard, I have senority and respect, it's close to home, ok benefits, almost 4 weeks vacation, and I'm friends with everyone. The only downside to this job is that there is no advancement - none. It's a small business and I've learned several other positions, but there's no upward opportunities or even other lateral ones.

I'm in my 40s and have been thinking I have more than half of my career left - do I want to do the same thing for the next 25+years? I'll only ever get COL raises, which they do annually. I do not have time for a side-hussle.

I've been looking around for some new opportunities at a bigger company, maybe a different role, so that I can maybe find something with a path forward. Most roles would be further away from home, I'd lose some of the vacation time, and most likely very similar pay.

1cppzaw,How do I increase my employability as a post-masters grad?,"Note: typing this for a friend who doesn't have reddit

Hello, I graduated from a Master's Degree in Fashion Marketing at a UK RG-University in August last year.

Since then, I've managed to get a part-time job (20 hours a week) in a social media related role, basically running tiktok livestreams (dealing with product analytics and customer queries on the livestream). However, I'm not quite happy with this as obviously 20 hours a week of work at close to minimum wage is barely enough to get by, and progression in this company to a full time role seems to be non-viable.

I've been applying to full time roles including graduate roles for the best part of a year now, maybe slightly longer, and still haven't landed anything. My CV has been looked over and I've been told by various employers (even at career events) that it is well organised/presented well, but it still seems to be the stage where I grt rejected the most. I've also had some video interviews and regular interviews (got into the final round of 2 companies but didn't get offered the role ultimately) but none have yielded any results so far - could this be because I am a non-native English speaker?

Obviously I understand the job market is very weak right now, but as someone with experience working for 2 of the biggest global marketing agencies abroad (an internship at one, graduate role in the other), I thought that I would be getting more progression into at least the video interview rounds for companies. I'm largely applying for roles relevant to my degrees and experience, focusing on marketing-based roles across lots of didferent companies,, but have also applied to some HR and ops roles for the sake of trying my luck. I apply to jobs daily but rarely get any results.

So - what am I doing wrong? How can I improve my employability? I am happy to spend money on certifications etc if they'd help. Let me know what you guys think!

1cpo70n,Found out a potential new hire is being offered a salary close to mine with less experience.,"I work for a small branch (only 4 full time employees) of a larger company as one of 2 employees in the same job title (the other is my boss). I have been with the company for 7 years and have held my professional licenses which are required for my position for the past 12 years. For the past 3 years we have been severely understaffed as it is not a typical 9 to 5 and we are required to be on call several nights a week and on weekends. We recently interviewed a potential employee with less experience and less time licensed than myself (5 years less). They also seem to be apprehensive about one essential aspect of the job and has said as much. A few days after the interview, I walked by my boss's desk and saw the offer letter to be sent to the new hire. I currently make 89k and their offer was 85k. I was not supposed to see the letter and kinda wish I hadn't. It has put a bad taste in my mouth which is made even worse by the fact that I really like where I work and am paid above the average for a person in my position and location. I obviously can't voice my opinion as I was not supposed to know what their salary would be. I know they are sweetening the pot to pull in more employees as the market is severely lacking in people in my industry and I get it but now I am wondering what I should do. I feel asking for a raise would be the logical next step as I haven't had a non-cost of living raise in about 3 years. Am I justified to feel this way or am I being irrational as I do already make more than most people in my same position?

So one day, all the members in my team had virtual one-on-one meeting with our US manager and he instructed us to take a private booth or book a meeting room, or whatever is available for privacy, which meant we had to leave the four walls of the office. 

Me and another team member, our 1-on-1 got done. And we kept both our laptops at our respective desks and went to the loo.

1cpltgl,May or may not pursue a career change... Any advice would help.,"So, it was 2014. I was 18 and went directly into the labor force after finishing HS. Like many people, I started off in customer service (grocery store, pizza parlor, etc). I done that until I was 21 and then entered the world of production and manufacturing. I started off in shipping as I had experience with forklifts and pallet jacks prior and then moved to the actual production part of things. Within my first year in poultry processing, I had already gained experience in every department except for debone. Eventually, I left the poultry industry and started going into other different types of manufacturing and production. I had been in automotive manufacturers, a distribution center for children's clothes, a sock mill, an aerospace and defense manufacturer where I built PCBs, and a wire harness company where I built wire harnesses for various industrial machines.

At some point within the 7 years I had worked in manufacturing/production, my grandparents had been urging me to look into maybe a job in an office like my mother and my uncles, and my mother (though she didn't urge me like my grandparents did) told me a few times that production would wear your body out in due time. At that time, it had been my fourth year in that line of work, and I thought ""I'm still in my 20's. I think I have a lot of juice left in me. I probably shouldn't be concerned about a desk job just yet.""

I'm 28 now, and while I still enjoy what I do and the people I do it with, I'm starting to see what my mother meant when she told me that kind of work would eventually take a toll on my body. Lately, I had been experiencing pain mainly on my left ankle (not even an x-ray or blood work could figure out what was up). I had been dealing with this pain for the past year. Pain usually occurs 7 or 8 hours into my shift (I work more than 8.).

I guess what I really want to know is two things.
1) Should this indicate it's time for me to hang up my mantle and make a career change?
2) To the ones that do work in an office environment... Is it worth it?",chillbill2014,1,1.0,1,1715446371,2024-05-11 16:52:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cpltgl/may_or_may_not_pursue_a_career_change_any_advice/,5,2024

1cpjj0s,I just got promoted but will most likely take a pay cut. How do I approach management?,"Earlier this year I took a promotion which increased my base salary from 56k to 70k. This job also has a commission aspect to it which was previously set at a flat 7.5% and has been raised to 15%, but now I must reach a 400k quota before earning any commission. 

For context, last year I billed 400k and earned the flat 7.5% so roughly $30k making my yearly take home about 85k. I’m estimating I’ll bill roughly 400k again, but because of this quota, I’m taking a nearly 15k pay decrease.

While it is encouraged for me to network with potential clients, it is not expected of me to treat this as a sales job and go out and win new business for the company. I’m just not sure how I should approach management of my concern of decreasing my overall earnings by a substantial amount for the foreseeable future.

I have about 3 to 4 years of experience in data analysis depending on how you look at it. 

I’m currently living with my family in a city that doesn’t have many opportunities. However, I don’t have any expenses and I’m getting essentially a full time minimum wage from unemployment benefits.

1cphmcg,Cannot decide on what medical specialty to go into,"Apologies for the length, I could really use some insight on people both inside and outside of medicine!



Hi everyone, I'm 27 and entering my last year of medical school in the US, which is when we pick what residency we want to apply for. I'm projected to be about 180-200K in debt when I graduate. I go to a respectable MD program and have done well throughout school. I've ultimately narrowed my decision down to two specialties: emergency medicine and anesthesiology. 

For those of you that don't know, anesthesia is one the 'it' specialties right now. If you go on the medical school subreddit, it feels like people are going to recommend you go into it regardless of your interests or career aspirations. It's a very in demand job and people are getting absurd job offers straight out of residency. 

Emergency medicine, on the other hand, is at a low point and many people are hesitant to go into it for the last \~4 years. This is in part due to COVID and in part due to the fear of oversaturation. There have been a ton of residency programs that have opened in recent years and a lot of them offer sub-par training (this is due to companies like HCA wanting to take advantage of the cheap labor of residents without really being concerned about their training, very messed up and frustrating). The sheer number of graduates threaten to saturate the market, making some worried it will be difficult to find a job, let alone one where you feel appropriately compensated and respected.  Despite the fact that fewer MD students are applying, there is a process at the end of the application cycle where people that don't match scramble into spots, so these EM spots are still filling, often with people who weren't interested in the specialty to begin with (or with people from programs outside of the US). 

With all that being said, I went to medical school because of my love for emergency medicine. I love how you see pathology across the spectrum and can see patients regardless of their financial means/insurance status. I think I have a personality that meshes very well with the specialty and would be a really good ER provider. Anesthesia is a great job, but I don't have the same passion for it. I like certain aspects of it, but I also think that part of my decision is being influenced by peer pressure, ego, and fear. 

I have two rotations set up for this fall at historically well-respected emergency medicine programs and will likely have the chance to get trained at one of the 'better' programs if I choose to go down that path for residency. I'm not sure if that will change my outcomes or if the field is on the downtrend no matter what. Medicine is also weird in that sometimes specialties undergo peaks and troughs when it comes to demand, depending on changes in practice and legislation. For example, anesthesia was actually not desirable at all back in the 90s due to fears of CRNAs making them irrelevant. So it's hard to say if EM will eventually bounce back or if it's a sinking ship.

1cpgfwp,Stay or go?,"Stay or Go?

So here is the situation. 

I’m currently at job A and enjoy the work however, they have me working 60+ hours on a 40 hour salary and it has been this way for the past 4 months. Sundays are supposed to be my day off, but I’m still expected to go in to work so that I don’t fall behind. I can count the days that I’ve actually had off on one hand. I asked to be converted to hourly instead of salary, add to this, my manager kept giving me reasons not to do it, and explain to me, that if I was on hourly, I would not be working as many hours, as I am now. Basically an excuse to not pay me overtime.

Because of the schedule, I am working and how much I’m getting paid I had been casually applying to other jobs, and actually landed an offer. Upon letting my company know that I had another offer, they offered me a raise from of $10k so from $65k to $75k, a promise of an office position after this project, and told me i no longer had to work weekends. Why did it take me threatening to leave for them to do that? 

Job A: 75k, promise of future management position, 3 weeks vacation
Job B: $28 an hour, 10+hours of OT per week, living allowance, and opportunity for management position in the future.

1cpfw38,CS or Financial degree,"Probably posts like this occurred a lot of times here, but I searched for answers to my questions for a long time, but in vain.

I'm a lost 23-year-old man (this year 24). For a long time, I've been trying to find the field that will give me a safe financial future and allow me to realise my ambitions.

I cannot decide between a financial career or computer science. To be honest, I don't know too much about finance, and currently, it's not my interest. On the other side, I like computer science. I learned something about HTML with CSS (maybe 1 month of learning), C#, Excel with a bit of Power Query and VBA, Word (I did a 7-hour course), and now I'm learning about MS SQL Server. Of course, I don't have expert knowledge of these things, but I found myself wanting to learn about things like these.

At the beginning, I planned to go into IT (web development or data science), but I was not sure about my future in this field because of the current crisis in the IT industry and approaching AI. Additionally, I want to enroll in computer science this year, but here is the next problem: I will probably be forced to go to a weaker university due to my matriculation results. If I decide to go into finances, I'll have a chance of getting a better university.

I can devote one year of my life to learning and improving my matriculation results in the next year and enrolling in reputable universities, but due to my age, I don't want to do this. Maybe I should do this, but I'm really lost in everything. I was thinking about going into finances (in a more analytical direction, where I will be able to use some programming skills) and, in the future, maybe pivoting into a position that is more associated with IT.

I feel that I'm losing a lot of my time because I lack a definite direction for my future career. I feel a real desire to realise myself in one of these two fields, but I'm currently very undecisive. I know that nobody could decide for me, but I'm looking for any advice and guides. I don't have anybody who can help me, so I decided to write this post. I know from my autopsy that strangers can sometimes give the best advice.

At the end, I want to mention that I don't have any experience with jobs that could be associated with any of these two fields.",c4lder0n,1,1.0,1,1715428783,2024-05-11 11:59:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cpfw38/cs_or_financial_degree/,5,2024
1cpfvuq,At a crossroads at 31: Seeking concrete advice for significant transition,"Hello, 

I am a 31-year-old entrepreneur living in France, originally from Russia. I started with absolutely nothing and have built a leisure business from the ground up, achieving €500K in annual turnover. However, this isn't reflective of my personal income, and the business itself is projected to remain viable for only another 2-4 years without major reinvestment. It also holds me attached to the current place; I can barely leave for 4-5 days from time to time.

For over a year, I've been desperately searching for a new direction but haven’t found any realistic or appealing business ideas. This search has left me feeling utterly incompetent, as if I possess no true skills despite holding a Master's in International Management. My supposed lack of marketable skills is plunging me deeper into what I can only describe as a depression, impacting both my mental and physical health.

Currently, I am facing significant challenges both personally and professionally. Despite (relatively) successful business management and growth, I feel increasingly alienated and disconnected in my adopted country, even after 15 years of residence. This sense of isolation is compounding a deeper existential crisis, where I find myself struggling with my identity and purpose. I feel lost in life and genuinely desperate, caught in a loop of stress that consumes me progressively each day.

Financially, I have been prudent and have started investing in stocks, with a portfolio worth around €30K. Over the next year, I expect to accumulate a total capital of €150-200K. I don't have any real estate or major assets, but I am ready to invest €50-70K in a new venture if I believe in its potential.

My immediate priority is to identify a path for a career transition that can secure me a significant income (aiming for progressively reaching €10K net per month). I am open to intensive work, dedication and taking reasonable risks to achieve this. I try to explore any niche markets that aren't saturated and where entry barriers are not (yet) prohibitively high. Additionally, I am considering skills or software that can be monetized and scaled (3D modeling or other digital production techniques, Cinema 4d, Houdini?)

The idea of relocating to Scotland with my girlfriend remains an abstract plan for the future. Scotland appeals to me due to its beautiful architecture, spacious natural surroundings, friendly populace, and strategic location in Europe. However, any move would require establishing a stable and profitable business or freelance career there.

I am reaching out to this community for pragmatic, realistic advice. I need guidance from those who have navigated similar transitions successfully, especially in identifying viable business opportunities or skills that match my background and financial goals.

Motivational speeches and abstract planning have never resonated with me. I am a pragmatist seeking concrete steps and strategies. As my situation becomes more pressing, it's not only my mental health that's suffering—I am beginning to experience physical health issues due to this prolonged stress and uncertainty.

Thank you very much for taking the time to read this. I am grateful for any advice, insights, or experiences you can share that might help steer me toward a viable new path.",Few_Try46,1,1.0,0,1715428757,2024-05-11 11:59:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cpfvuq/at_a_crossroads_at_31_seeking_concrete_advice_for/,5,2024
1cpehmu,Can someone advice me on how to handle the situation?,"I graduated Law in 2023, as part of my 5 yr law school I also had some accounting subjects. I did internship at corporate law firm (M&A team) and I had also pursued a course on M&A, PE& VC transactions. I have come to realise I enjoy business itself than business law, and after some deliberation and thought decided to switch to Investment Banking.

I joined a startup Investment Banking Company in February, it was an entry level role and not very technical. I thought it would help me get started as I don't have core finance background and I thought I'll upskill along the way and use my skills and this job and shift somewhere better later.

Things in this place started to feel shady, at first I wasn't sure because I'm not from the industry. The founder actively bluffed to the clients, misrepresented financials in teasers, and he had claimed to have qualified CFA, CA, CPA, CS and served as board member on several companies and yet I couldn't find any information about him online. I also heard several other things from other employees. Whenever anybody questioned his credentials they would be fired and the attrition rate was crazy. There were lots of problems in this company and also improper payment of salary. I had joined in February and after two months I left immediately in April. The company didn't have any proper policies and didn't require serving notice, they refused to give my previous month salary as well as any experience letter.

Now I have problem finding job because I can't get background verification. If I don't put the job on my resume I had already spent three months looking for job before and two months on this job and I'd have a long unexplainable gap. I also don't have any other relevant industry experience so I have no choice but to include it to get my application through.

I tried being honest in one of the interviews and explain the situation but they ended up thinking I was the problem and despite my interview going really well in all rounds, they rejected me.

She told me the ""good news"" this morning that one of my coworkers could be coming back to the job. The one I slept with after he quit to pursue other endeavors and I thought he was never coming back...He talked to my manager about moving up and that if he did come back he would stepping up as he wants to become a manager, interviewed for store manager on his own for a different area and got denied for not having manager experience. SO he called for some advice and she recommended training at her store and giving him that experience to get him to the next level. For our store, it couldn't have came at a better time, we lost a couple of mid level leads, so were down on employees. It's felt very tight lately due to people leaving or newbies not working out and wasting training time. We need someone experienced and he would be the best chance at alleviating that. 

I have to make a choice both make me uncomfortable. First, just tell her before the process progresses any further which apparently he could come as early as next week which is wild.  I took just two days off and in that time she already has him in the background check phase, he already packing up and moving back up here from where he was. This is how far it has got. I could tell her and now she knows I fucked one of the ex employees which is something I wouldn't want spreading around. She rejects his offer out of nowhere after packing up his life, he'll know why lol because of me.....I don't know why he thought this was a good idea but we were intimate, he has like photo/videos of me, its weird. If I cockblock now, I fear of what might happen to the images on his phone, it never been threatened but he has them.... I have to then pretend nothing has happened and develop him into a leader at my store OR or should I just call him and just make like a pact to not say anything. is that better? Smarter?  I just don't want my boss to find out from someone else and then someone how I get fired or transferred. He's a young guy, I just don't want this hovered over me while I train him, manage him, give him feedback etc. I just worry. What should I do? thanksssss.

1cpcm9o,Big Boy Job Suggestios,"Hi all.  I’m finding myself in a strange situation and if you’re willing to read a synopsis of it, I’d greatly appreciate  some suggestions as to what I could do for my next career move. I’m 27 years old, I graduated with a bachelor’s in biochemistry when I was 22 (shortly before COVID), and I’ve been waiting tables since I got back to work after the pandemic. Two months ago, I was diagnosed and began undergoing treatment for ADHD. I essentially have a newfound ability to sit down and focus on whatever mentally straining task I decide without fighting (and losing to) whatever whims my brain decides to throw at me. My prior inability to do so is the reason I never did anything in STEM after college. Although I got my degree, I had a 2.8 gpa and didn’t do anything to establish a career path after graduation. I didn’t study until 10pm the night before most exams and I was only able to get through the curriculum with whatever raw academic talent I had. Biochemistry seemed like the most natural path for me after high school but in retrospect, I think I did it just because that’s what I thought I was supposed to do. I come from a family that’s incredibly high achieving (my cousin is a chemistry PhD who made Forbes 30 Under 30) and although I don’t have anything to show for it, I’m also reasonably intelligent. Since I started treatment for ADHD (i.e. crushing amphetamine), I haven’t used it for waiting tables. I’ve only used it to work on an entrepreneurial pursuit on the side and although I’ve been able to make significant progress with it, it’s not something that will be remunerative for at least a couple of years (optimistically speaking). In the meantime, I’d like to move on from waiting tables to something that makes more money and is perhaps better suited to my abilities. I’d be willing to do something that would take several months of online coursework but I don’t really know what’s out there. I’m not sure how realistic the following is, but I’d like to pursue something that I could do remotely and would yield at least $40k/year. Preferably no hardcore sales jobs either. Idk, this has gone on long enough. I appreciate any suggestions. Thanks bros

TL;DR: I never used to be able to do anything with whatever intelligence I had until now because I’m on speed.

1cp9x31,What does this mean?,"I have been employed at a non profit for roughly 4 months in a management role. I love the team I oversee, but there has been some concerning information that I’ve received about the organization from inside sources. Apparently one of the VPs is blackmailing the CEO, so this VP cannot be fired. This one VP is responsible for the majority of the horribly toxic culture of the organization. I report directly to another VP, who still has to run a lot of decisions through the toxic VP due to the power this person holds. This one VP does not trust many other individuals in the organization and will not delegate. HR is fully aware of the situation too. 

Outside of this, I genuinely enjoy the people I work with and I care a lot about the team I oversee. There are a number of people who have been at this organization for a long time simply because it is rewarding work and a lot of the people are wonderful to be around. 

Does this sound like an environment to try to leave? What would this kind of situation even be considered?

1cp8p9c,Should I take jobs that are adjacent to engineering even though I have my bachelor’s? ,"Hi guys, I’m a recent Mechanical Engineering grad, and I’m now contending with job market. I’ve had an engineering internship under my belt that eventually turned into a technician role once the internship ended. Was laid off from that in January. Sucks because that role was supposed to turn into an actual engineering position with higher pay and yada yada yada. 

Now that I have graduated, I’m finding it hard to find jobs with the title of “Engineer”, but I’m finding TONS of “quality technician” or similar roles that pay well enough. 

Should I just wait it out for a few more months and keep applying to hundreds of jobs until I get a position with the title of “Engineer”, or should I just take these “Tech” roles until I find something? I’m just wondering if it would look bad on a resume and make it seem like I’ll take lowball offers. I say this because I received a lowball $20 an hour offer with a sprinkler system company, and I’d have “design engineer” as my title. 50 cents an hour raise every three months until they think I’m “fully up to speed” on the industry. Is this the new norm?

1cp8beu,how do I go about changing my degree?,"I studied financial engineering.I struggled alot with it. It wasnt my choice at all, it was my parents and I was 17 at the time so I just went with what they said.

I always wanted to be an architect and I knew how hard it was. Bt I'm a hard worker in sth I'm passionate about
The only thing I think one would learn is time management,  not being hard on yourself ans actually enjoy the experience of university without missing out.

Anyways , I was to drop out in third year but I didn't, after complaining, they somehow convinced me still what to do.

I reached fourth year ,I convinced myself I could improve my grade, it was impossible.  I realised it was true, you can't improve your grade in fourth year.

I think its scary to not know how sth would turn out.
I could really use advice on changing my degree.
I'm 22 right now and I want to stand up for myself this time instead of pleasing others for nothing.

I missed out on alot in uni that I wanted ans forced myself to do the degree ans believed academics is everything but that's a stupid lie I believed from growing up in their house

I am abit confused and stuck
I want to unstuck myself ans move on

This degree ans uni experience, I want to put it behind me ans move forward but its tricky
Fitting in with young people honestly I'm not very good with socialising as I was depressed and isolated myself not to be a burden to anyone

1cp8b8d,Should I quit my job after sexual harassment? ,"I work in a really tense liquor store. It’s an extremely stressful environment and sometimes a scary/violent situation. I’m a young woman and working here after a financial emergency.

I am used to customers saying crazy shit, but today a customer said something so unbelievably vile and sexual that I was horrified and felt incredibly degraded. I screamed at him to leave the store while the security guard did absolutely nothing. 

My manager eventually came up and essentially shrugged his shoulders at the situation. The guard then said I deserved it for not being more pleasant when the customer came up to the register. All it actually was that I wasn’t smiling because I was counting money and restocking in addition to ringing the customer up. 

He thinks I should be nonstop smiling and never stand up for myself because I’m a woman, yet yesterday he threw the first punch at someone outside the store. 

I feel so violated and degraded, I don’t know how I can continue to work there. I can’t afford to not be working right now (not even for a couple days really) but this job also only pays minimum wage, so pretty much anything is an improvement. 

I have been interviewing for much higher paying jobs and expect to find out by the end of next week whether I have an offer at one. However, I feel so uncomfortable that I don’t think I can wait it out to quit.

What do you think? I have to work tomorrow night. Should I quit and spend tomorrow looking for a new job?

Job 1: 
~ $70k CAD
- 36 hr/week, 4 days per week, full WFH
- Cover home office and internet expense
 
Pros: Closer to family, more flexible, no living expenses. 

Cons: Higher tax rate (less take home), less interesting work, limited social experience (living in the middle of nowhere, family can be tiresome at times, no girls, etc.)

Job 2:
~ 100k USD, in San Jose
- 40 hr/week, 4 days in office, 1 day remote
- Cover transit pass

Pros: More interesting work, new experience and can meet new people, better climate, ~5k/year CAD higher take home including estimated living expenses

Cons: Requires a cross-country move, harder to change jobs (would be on TN Status), further from family, San Jose seems like a mediocre city, annoying items like getting a California license, SSN, Canadian/US taxes

Really not sure which way to go. Job #1 feels a lot safer and is closer family, but limited as it’s fully work from home. Job #2 is more interesting and pays more, but requires a big move to another country.

1cp7lgr,What are some certifications/credentials that would benefit professionals and engineers?,"I'm a fire protection engineer who has recently joined a consulting firm straight out of college. My goal is to enhance my qualifications and certifications to maximize my potential earnings, especially since my company conducts evaluations every six months. Despite lacking the necessary experience, I was fortunate enough to sit for the PE exam in my state (the statutes allow us to sit for the exam but not be able to get licensed until we accrue the necessary experience) and passed it a couple of weeks ago.

Now that I've passed the PE, I'm eager to explore further avenues for professional development. While I already have a master's degree in mechanical engineering, I'm considering certifications like Certified Fire Marshal (CFM) from the International Code Council (ICC) and Certified Fire Protection Specialist (CFPS) from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) to deepen my expertise in fire protection.

However, I'm also seeking guidance on additional certifications or qualifications that are more general for engineers and professionals in general. I've come across platforms like edX and MIT OpenCourseWare, but I'm uncertain about their credibility. So far, I've completed a couple of free FEMA courses focused on emergency response management but I'm eager to learn about other valuable certifications.

Although I'm currently a consultant, I see myself exploring different roles in the future. I've heard about pursuing an MBA, acquiring a Project Management Professional (PMP) credential, or obtaining a Six Sigma Green Belt certificate as potential options.

My work is both independent and collaborative with a team of 4 people. I'm the only non-chines speaker in the company, and it's been bothering more and more lately.

I got promoted early this making me the second in command on my team. However, recently they've been speaking exclusively Chinese with each other, only changing to English when they ask me a question.. I spoke out against this before and things got better for a little while but they always revert back to Chinese after a while. It's a very unpleasant environment to be in all day, they're all buddying up and socialising, and turn to me only for questions where my input is needed, even then I know no context or what the team is discussing, obviously I ask but I'm getting sick of being the outsider. I sometimes share stories from my own life/interests/news to engage with them and create English conversation, they'll listen, nod along, ask questions, then switch back to Chinese when the conversation is done..

Beyond this, the other senior-ish guy is becoming their go-to guy for questions and leadership, because I'm outside of the conversation all day. I also spend my lunches at the gym while they eat together which is on me but it's the only time I can work out (work-study is tough..).

1cp4rhs,Overthinking coworkers who are idiots?,"I just recently started a job doing sysadmin and IaC related work. I really enjoy the technical challenges. Management has so far been pretty content with the progress I’ve made and have been so far trusting of me. We are a very small team, so they are fine with me prioritizing the work that we get, which is a good bit of stuff going on. Given that this isn’t traditional software dev, and more on the systems side we don’t really follow any particular methodology. Our team is a small group of professionals who have been in IT for over 10 years so we all have a firm handle on our work. Our team is pretty solid.

So, as you can imagine I am getting lots of tasks for lots of different projects - I need a way to organize everything. I work mostly in office, and to keep organized I have a personal Kanban board  on my whiteboard, behind my desk. This is literally just personal sticky notes that I keep for my personal organization and I have them set up in a specific way for me personally. It helps me organize and not loose track

Someone in the office has been messing with my Kanban board, writing their own sticky notes that say immature things like “Ur Mom Lol” and sticking them on my board. To do that, they would have to come behind my desk when I’m not there and mess with it. 

I like to stay professional at work, so when I saw that I was extremely annoyed that someone would fuck with my personal stuff and add this nonsense. I’m just not used to dealing with childish behavior. 

I actually really enjoy the tech work of my job and enjoy the autonomy to self-organize. I don’t like it it when someone is trying to pull office pranks, it’s a waste of time. 

It put me in a sour mood, that I cleared my desk and moved to another spot. 

Am I overreacting?

I felt the subjectivity of it was driving me insane and it was not satisfying by dream of doing work with a purpose.

However, I wanted to stay in a creative industry so I tried different things throughout my 20's, publishing courses, advertising and most recently a master's in management for luxury and fashion, which I am grateful to have taken as it made me realize through some key courses I am interested in consumer insights/market research.

I realized that in order to land a job in this I may be lacking skills and foundational knowledge (we did quant/qual analyses, and focus groups in some of the courses but Im not sure if this is enough).

So I've been trying to become more competent and learn on my own. I'm using Marketing Analytics by WayneL.Winston and trying to learn RStudio on my own. It's a challenge but I like it so I'm on the right track. But I lack the foundational knowledge. And every analysis I want to try has me backtracking to understand the equations and what essentially they mean.

I know many people can get into market research from the different Fields but since I've been trying to get a job in it for a while now and haven't succeeded I cant help but wonder if it's because this gap that keeps recruiters from considering me.

So I need advice and clarity and recommendations and \*\*brutal honesty\*\*. Should I go into another graduate program to fill this gap? Should I just continue to power through on my own it until I develop enough capacity to build a portfolio of work? Should I have done a bach in mathematics?

My old coworker who I use to work with currently works at the place I interviewed. She put in a good word for me. She left my current job for the same reasons. Too much stress and she LOVES where she’s at. I accepted the offer and put in my two weeks notice. My current boss had a talk with me and does not want me to leave she hinted giving me a raise in 3 months if I stay. However the job that I accepted hasn’t sent me an offer letter. I emailed the hiring manager and she said she would ask her boss but never got back to me. I ended up emailing the big boss and his response was I would get my offer letter the day of my start date.

1cp0a66,Moving Positions Within The Company ,"So my company loves to hire within. I want to take advantage of that because I am currently in sales and absolutely hate it, but love my company. My boss is now a couple months pregnant and has put a lot of time and effort into me so that when she goes on maternity leave, she has someone she can count on while she’s gone. I feel horrible that I don’t want this position anymore and I want a different one within the company. If my company is sending out Job openings to our work emails is this really that risky of a move to make? I have the upmost respect for my team, my boss, and my Director.

1cozwz2,How much do you think i should be paid?,"How much do you think i should be paid?

So I’m going to be asking for a raise next monday and its my first time ever asking for a raise. 

Some background:

-i live in CT (high cost of living)
-Have a B.S. in Earth Science
-Working at a Environmental Laboratory

Number wise my lab grossed almost exactly 300k in the last 11 months. Total staff is my manager, and 1 other analyst with my job title.

Out of the 300k I pulled in a little over 135k, about 45% of revenue was under my hands. 

Essentially in an ideal world it would 33% all around between me and my coworkers, but i seem to be doing 1 and 1/2ths persons worth of work due to my work ethic.

Lab costs is maybe 10% of total revenue and thats stretching it.

How much would you expect me to make?

What i currently make is : >!$22.80/47000!< a hour/year
 
What do you guys think i should ask for? Currently im being paid %33 my total revenue. I understand thats not profit however the expensive are very slim for the lab. only accreditations, microscope slides and cover slips, and oil. I gross salary 2.9x a year. I’m obviously hungry to continue to outperform myself (and coworkers) each year, however i feel undervalued monetarily. Especially when the cost of living is so high right now, i cant even move out of my parents house without fearing that i’ll be struggling.",PresentInsect4957,2,0.75,6,1715374478,2024-05-10 20:54:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cozwz2/how_much_do_you_think_i_should_be_paid/,5,2024

I only have 200$ to my name and a high school education. I come from a middle class family. 

I went to university and dropped out in first year to trade financial markets even when I didn't have any knowledge of that, I worked endless night shift warehouse jobs to save money for day-trading. Over the past 2 years I lost $20,000 in trading markets. After that, I got extremely depressed and lost hope for pretty much everything. I didn't even focus on my health, later I was fired from my job.

When I start university I'll be 21, with a 4 year gap in education. When I graduated with my master's I'll be 25. I am starting university this year studying Aerospace Engineering, I'll be 25 when I finish. I am extremely disappointed as I am extremely behind of others.

1coy1dj,When styles are just complete opposites - A Rant.,"I have been in senior management roles for years. I pride myself on leading complex operational areas as well as projects that are messy but impactful. It's just something I've done all my career. 

I believe in momentum. I believe once a change has started to push forward and to keep going and to trust the process, trust the team, work towards solving problems, not just pointing them out. And to see how far we've come vs how far we have to go. It's just a positive mindset. 

But then.... there's always that person, that one person, maybe they are influential who has a complete different approach to work than I do. They are highly conservative, they see what is left to be done as this chasm. They pick apart at details and always paint the line towards the glass half empty vs the glass half full. If something is progressing, its not progressing enough. If things are working, they point to all the other things that aren't working. And these people drive me bananas, there's no other way to put it. 

The reason they drive me bananas is that people who look to make change and move forward actually make it happen. They will pull together resources and roll up their sleeves and pitch in and make it happen.

Whereas those that are negative will never have enough resources, don't have the budget, have other priorities, etc etc. They don't trust their teams and they don't trust themselves and they don't trust their customer. 

And I know there are real constraints, it is true. But to me, once an organization has committed time, budget, energy, and reputation to making things happen, to then be one of those people that bogs it down and always sees issues and problems and reasons to stop is not adding value in my opinion. It's what slows down innovation and growth.

Energy has always been an interesting topic for me since my college days, but I never had the chance to work in the field as life had other plans for me at the time.
I’d like to genuinely learn the topic as much as I can, down to the technical systems invloved, metering, renewables, grid distribution and the economic and regulatory aspects of it as well. 
I’ve been checking online training courses by the AEE (CEM) and the Energy Institute mostly and they seem to provide extensive programs on the subject, but I’m not sure how effective they are in reality, and if they are tailored specifically for passing their certification exam as opposed to actually learning the subject, so would love to hear your feedback if you had any experience learning with these institutions.

last summer, i was open to them about my plan to apply to grad school for the upcoming cycle and i was also honest about the fact that my former supervisor treated me badly. i was immediately put on a performance improvement plan and my employer started to find mistakes in me and i was recently terminated. This was my first full time job. Luckily, i was accepted to a graduate program. Since I'm now a student again, my program allows me to do on campus internship / part time employment (being a graduate research assistant / teaching assistant), I think this is better than directly applying to a second full time position because then, most likely, i would have to explain my recent termination to my second employer.

I'm applying to internships, going through interviews, and receiving offers for the first time, and I've realised that I'm incredibly nervous about how I come across to the interviewers and recruiters.

I'm just worried about things that I know I shouldn't be worried about, and it actually keeps me awake. 

This time, I'm anxious about calling HR to move my internship duration earlier than stated on my application form. During the interview, I was asked my preferred time once more, and I stated the new preferred time. Of course, this isn't in writing, so I'm calling to confirm with HR. 

It's Friday, so I can't call them until Monday. I'm stuck thinking about ""what if I'm not allowed to change my start date?"" or ""what if they decided they don't want me anymore?"". I never received an official offer letter from them, just an email saying I was accepted into the program.

The pay is decent, benefits are meh, but I have zero interest in this job at all. It is strictly a ""pay the bills"" type job, and I plan to leave as soon as something better comes along. A local article also came out last week about the company describing their terrible financial position. 

I've had some luck this week and have scored a phone interview for a company I'm really interested in, and also a 2nd interview (in-person) for a job that's a local startup and will pay well. I have both the interviews scheduled for Monday, because the job I'm supposed to start next week is remote Mondays and Fridays. I'm fairly confident one of these will shake out, but of course I could be wrong. 

Should I start the shitty job on Monday and deal with the consequences of balancing interviews on my first day or politely bow out last minute?

I work as a software engineer. I’ve struggled with my manager for a while now. He’s made me a lot of promises that he hasn’t been able to fulfil (ie building a team around me), but also he has also recently started working only 3 days a week and I’m finding it increasingly difficult to get the support that I need from him. There’s also a severe lack of technical support in my team as a whole. 

I would essentially be doing the exact same job, under a new manager who is more aligned to my goals and priorities, and with increased technical support in the team as a whole.

I’ve received the nod of approval from all other parties involved, but I’ve just told everyone to hold on actioning anything or speaking with my manager about it until I get the chance to have a chat to my manager about it first.

My colleague has been with the company for almost two decades and has worked his way up. He has been in the same position as me for almost six years now.  

We both have identical responsibilities and share the total workload. So far, we have worked together cohesively to balance the workload by communicating and working as true equals. 

Recently, our manager announced that he was going to retire. My co-worker and I both expressed interest in being considered to be his replacement. If given the position, this would have meant a substantial raise and perks. 

Our Senior Manager told us separately that we were being considered but that they had other people in mind for the role and that we should not get our hopes up. Based on that, my co-worker and I figured someone else would be offered the position, so our work continued as it had. 

Several weeks went by, and to my surprise, I was offered the position. I believe my unique skills and experiences played a significant role in this decision. 

I know that my co-worker will probably not take the news well as he feels that he is equally if not more, deserving of the position, especially because he has more time and experience in the position. 

I am looking for advice on how to navigate this delicate situation with my co-worker and soon-to-be direct report when the news breaks that I will be the new manager.

I was not actively looking, but an opportunity has come up and is a no-brainer for me on paper. It is the same thing I am doing but at a smaller company so I'm jumping a level up in hierarchy.. and the pay is almost double my current. (Going from 75k to 140k). I have met with the hiring manager a few times, and now it seems conversations are moving now in the direction where an offer is coming soon.

 I've built relationships at my current job that are pretty much my only friendships. It's where I've built the deepest connections in my life. Even the security guard I will miss. Oddly enough, I will miss my boss as well, and ill miss his mentorship. I know there are a couple friendships I'll be able to keep in touch, but many I feel would be odd or inappropriate to ask if we can stay in touch.

Are there any similar fields with good salary?(most helping professions like social workers have terribly low salary in my country)

Also big obstacle for me is the reason that I was almost finished in building career I could just continue living and making lot of money in my current field, rent a flat find a girlfriend and live. 

If I change career I would have to study another university, and probably live with my parents until I am 29 (so goodbye to finding a girlfriend)

1comj8y,Dying as a Programmer - Any Tips on Finding a $500/Month Online Job?,"Hey, Reddit fam,



I used to be a programmer, but in China, the work intensity is just too much. Many companies operate on a 996 schedule (9 AM to 9 PM, 6 days a week) or even a 007 schedule (24/7, every day). I don't know how someone can stand this kind of job all the time.



After a few years of this, my health deteriorated, and I felt constantly down, getting sick, suffering from insomnia, and losing hair. I felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown. Eventually, I couldn't take it anymore and quit my job, returning to my small hometown.



I've been trying to make a living by creating small products on my own, but it's been much harder than I imagined, and I haven't been successful.



Living in a small city in China, I can't go out to work for certain reasons, and job opportunities here are scarce, especially in the field of computing.



The average salary in my city probably doesn't even reach $500, so finding an online job that pays that much would be a dream come true for me.



I'm looking for advice because I'm at a loss about what to do next. Here's a rundown of my skills:



- Fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese, can read and write English, and very familiar with the Chinese internet. If you need me to search or collect information from the Chinese internet or translate, I'm your guy.

- Some basic video editing skills, a bit of social media operation experience, and I run a Xiaohongshu account with 7,000 followers (English learning category).

- I've started my own online store and am familiar with Chinese e-commerce platforms. If you need help finding products, I might be able to assist.

- Proficient in using Vue/React/Next.js to develop applications. I'm not a front-end expert and don't have an in-depth knowledge of every front-end framework, but I can handle common functionalities.

- My go-to backend language is Java (Spring framework), but I can also work with Python and PHP, though I'm not as professional in those.

- I'm open to what some might consider boring work, and I'm willing to do data annotation as long as it pays.



I personally prefer programming-related work, and I enjoy all things computer-related. However, I'm genuinely scared of working as a programmer in China again. Given my physical condition, I fear I might not survive if I continue down that path. Can anyone here offer some advice? If it comes to it, I might have to consider learning to repair electronics or farming.



Any suggestions from you guys would be greatly appreciated. I'm at a crossroads here, and I could really use some guidance.",Routine-Classroom414,0,0.5,0,1715337834,2024-05-10 10:43:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1comj8y/dying_as_a_programmer_any_tips_on_finding_a/,5,2024

1col622,I’ve got a bunch of mixed skills and need a change ,"I have worked for the same small dairy business for over 4 years. I started out as just being an orders person: keying orders, data entry, basic office stuff. But slowly more and more got added to my job role to the point where I’m not sure anybody even knows my title. I’m the person that when someone new comes along, when describing what I do it becomes a list. And not all of it related. 
Officially I think I’m listed as inventory manager. Here are my main skills and duties from this job:
Writing (literally wrote the employee handbook and instructionals with detailed step by steps for every task done in orders and production planning. Also writing and publishing blog.)
Scheduling trucks, routes, drivers and dock crew
Maintain our company’s click up 
Social media planning, posts, interactions etc
Graphic design using canva and adobe illustrator ( including full redesign of labels and cartons, brochures, ads, and poster)
Printing on a plotter
Newsletter marketing (including writing all aspects, graphics, and scheduling)
Orders (yep. Still doing it. Mostly data entry in access.)
Production planning (estimating and planning how much cheese and cultured products we produce and disseminating that info to the crew)
Sales data (mostly using power bi and uploading downloaded data to access) 
Excel (This is a skill I plan to improve but I built the sheets that estimate orders, how much yogurt to make etc.)
Updating and maintaining our website (wix) 

In addition to the above I have over a decade of retail customer service experience from previous jobs. I also have a BA in Anthropology. (I know. It wasn’t the best choice.)
I really want to get away from this job due to the mounting and wild array of tasks I am having to do. Also I’m barely making enough to survive (<$16/hr) and no benefits other than some pto.
Due to health reasons I cannot work on my feet or do lots of physical work. I’m not disabled. Lupus just makes it hard some days to do more than sit at a desk physically. 
I am currently in my free time making art to sell on items (think drop ship or things my husband can make with laser printer or press/dtf prints) But I have doubts that will be that lucrative or at the very least I need a backup. I also have novels to finish editing and self pub but I know that’s very unlikely to earn much (my sib publishes full time)

So I’ve been divided on what to do. I am in a unique position in my life where I could pick up and move to a degree as far as family obligations. It’d be super awesome if I could figure out something that didn’t care where I lived (remote)

I focused heavily on digital marketing and social media learning for a while. I don’t mind it though I’ll admit I’m not strong on video content. I got a google cert for basics of digital marketing and took some classes. I post/interact daily on my jobs socials on Facebook and instagram. 

I’ve also considered something like data analytics. It’s really weird how much I like looking at statistics and data. I would likely need a chunk of learning to quantify for this as even though I use excel and power bi, I am not an excel power user and the power bi repots I use were built by someone else. From what I read, experience is king in that field and I can likely learn these skills as I update my current jobs outdated stuff but this could take some time and I am really feeling the pain of low wages. 

I am not a particularly pushy person and prefer email/text over phone so would prefer to steer away from sales if possible. I can do low pressure suggests and marketing but cold calls and such is not my strength. 

I’m not closed to graphic design but I feel I’m not an expert and I’m not sure how complicated employers want. The packaging I designed was using mostly existing elements, color changes. Canva? I can do that all day any day. I could potentially learn the skills to round it out though I don’t have adobe suite at home. (I do have affinity)

I loathe anything about my job that is DOT/logistics related except maybe scheduling pickups and such. They forced it on me because nobody above me wanted it either. 

I am a planner and organizer by nature. I love productivity apps like click up and use a planner daily. I have organized events for a local nonprofit for several years. My management style is very democratic and coworkers describe me as super chill. I am the opposite of a confrontational person perhaps to a fault. (Probably part of how I got in my situation with my job bullying me into new tasks but I am getting actively better at saying no) I’m also curious and love learning.

1coko4h,Gave Expected Salary *before* interviews but was offered lower than that after getting offers. How to take this?,"Context: Software Engineer in a 3rd world country with 2.5 yrs of xp, current salary was $600.

2 offers:

1. Wanted $1300 initially and also revealed my current salary, $600(it was mandatory for them to know), went through the entire interview process, and finally they told me they could only do $1000, and $1100 was their final offer. I reiterated that $1300 is final. But they told me the budget for the role was $1100 and they were going full budget to hire me. If they couldn't meet my expected salary why the whole interview?(Not complaining, I'm curious) Ended up accepting offer because I didn't have multiple offers and wanted to work with the team.

2. Wanted $1500 initially, revealed my current salary, went through the process it was pretty short. Offered me $850. Since I had the first offer, I said $1500 is non-negotiable. Founder told me that the team initially wanted to just give me my current salary of $600(standard practice in my shithole country I guess). But he fought for me and got $850, and I appreciate that. Then they he offered $1200. Although I appreciated his honesty, the first offer was a red flag in terms of the culture they seek in the team so I declined their offer. After declining, they wanted to renegotiate but I said that won't be needed.

Now my question is, should I just stick to my initial ask for all these scenarios? I'm new to this and I understand these people also want to decrease their costs. I  just want to understand this from different perspectives.",Ok_Construction_3021,2,0.7599999904632568,6,1715330029,2024-05-10 08:33:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1coko4h/gave_expected_salary_before_interviews_but_was/,5,2024
1cokda0,"Need help deciding between two job offers.
","I have two job offers and I cannot make up my mind about which one to join (Company A & B). Long term I am looking to become a Senior Electrical Engineer and do contracting work as well as attain chartership. I have no desire to work the longer hours required of higher positions and pay is good enough at the senior level. For reference I live in London and I have a year and a half experience in the Building Services industry (both offers are in this industry).

Company A is offering a graduate position but for 1k more, and is a bit more convenient to get to initially. Company B is offering an intermediate position and only becomes convenient to get to if I get a car. The reason for the travel differences once I get a car is that Company A is in London (UK) which has great public transport links and Company B is outside. It would take a minimum of 3 months to save for a second hand car.

Company A is one of the largest in the industry and I would be working on large projects a lot of which are international. Company B is a medium size company where I would be working on several small & medium size projects. Both will have me working with senior electrical engineers to aid in my development.

Both seem to have good career prospects but I'm wondering which would help me the most in becoming chartered and becoming a contractor.",Shutdown4,1,1.0,0,1715328725,2024-05-10 08:12:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cokda0/need_help_deciding_between_two_job_offers/,5,2024

1cohpfl,"Would you get your certs from a job you just started, and find employment with higher pay/ benefits?","Hello! I just started working at a small business (only open for 6 years, 12 employees total) after not knowing what to do after leaving the military. They paid for all of the employees to get their IPC and soldering certifications, which is great. However, the pay is not great ($22/hr after certs) and neither are the (limited) benefits. Plus, time cards have been changed when people try for overtime, which is a red flag to me. There are no health benefits. From what I understand, there is a 401k but only after being with them for a year. There is only 1 week of PTO. 

My work background is in Avionics and Education/Training Management, making 57k-78k, depending on which job I had. I can't do avionics anymore due to a skin condition that does not allow me to work outside. I don't enjoy administrative work, either. My goal is to be an Electrical Engineer. My current title is ""Electrical Engineering Tech II"", which is just a fancy way of saying that I use wiring diagrams and written instruction to build cables and circuit cards to be shipped out to large defense contractors. 

I am not fully finished with my courses to receive my certifications with my current job. I feel like a jerk for wanting to take my certifications and run to work for one of the larger defense contractors that we make parts for; for higher pay, medical benefits, paid schooling, more PTO/ sick time, retirement accounts, and I get to keep my Secret Security Clearance. 

This probably sounds like a no-brainer, and the better job is the one to go for. However, I feel morally wrong. Should I stay for a year and then leave since they're a small business that spent a good amount of money on certifying me, or go and tell them that they can't offer me what I'm looking for?

If you're wondering, I didn't sign anything saying that I would have to pay back the money they spent on getting me my certifications. I just feel like a jerk.

1coh9q8,Contract work with big company or permanent with smaller?,"Hello all,

Long story short to save you (and me) some time:

* 32M, married
* Have worked in the journalism/newspaper industry for over a decade in a variety of roles (Copy editor, reporter, page designer, etc.)
* Was laid off (again) at the end of February
* Have been looking for work in and out of the industry while on unemployment for the last 2-ish months (haven't really had any bites)
* Finally received an offer from a TV news station nearby. Hours are excellent, it's a permanent role, job itself is cool but the pay is complete dogshit. Before you say it, all journalism pay is dogshit but this is dogshit that even dogshit would call dogshit. ($19.95/hr)
* At the same time, I am now going through the interview process with a massive media company that would pay very, very, very well for my services. The hours would be good and the job more stressful than the TV station but, financially, it'd be insane. However, it's a 3-month contract job. The hiring manager said there's a possibility of another 3-month contract after that (so 6-month gig in total). They made it very clear that I should not count on being with them for more than 6-months max.  It can happen but unlikely. I get why companies do contract work but you'd figure they'd want to keep someone much longer if they're actually good at their job? Very odd.
* My wife does well in her career so the need for benefits isn't really an issue as it pertains to my job.

My question: If this were you, how would you approach these opportunities? The pay at the TV news station blows so I would likely be looking for a new job in about a year anyway. But it's secure and better than unemployment. However, the other contract gig would look amazing on a resume and six months there would pretty much pay the exact same amount as one full year with the TV station. The downside is that I'm not guaranteed that second 3-month contract and I very likely would have to look for work again in a short period of time.

1cofuqz,Trying to Figure Out Next Step,"Hi everyone, I (29M) am seriously struggling with what my next step should be in my career, and would love some outside perspectives. This is a rambling post, but I've tried to break it up into sections to help. Apologies in advance for the length.  
  
Background:  
-quantitative undergrad, several years of healthcare consulting  
-pursued MBA at a top school  
-currently in healthcare investment banking in NYC

Considerations  
-student loans should be mostly paid off by early next year, but don't know for certain since bonus is variable  
-assuming loans are mostly paid off, we have enough in savings otherwise to put a solid down payment on a home if we decide to move & buy   
-married with baby on the way later this year  
-wife prefers living in a city, but fine with moving out for the right situation. She isn't married to her job, and would look at it as a fresh start for her  
-families are in the midwest, away from major cities. Looking at options very close to them isn't realistic

What I'm seeking  
-strong income, targeting $200k base, with some long-term upside. Willing to go lower if opportunity for *significant* long-term income is available   
-some level of autonomy/control over my work and schedule  
-flexibility around WFH. Don't want full remote, but don't want to be forced into office  
-location in/around NYC (preferred), Chicago (second option), Philly (third option)  
-appropriate stress levels. Banking has me in constant high anxiety mode, and I can't function like this forever  
-non-repetitive day-to-day work. would love for it to be ""meaningful"", but I have zero idea what that even means to me after years in consulting/banking 

What I'm thinking of doing  
-Pharma corporate development, the safest path. Solid income potential, but nothing life changing. Won't have full autonomy of time. Afraid of continuing to feel like a cog in a pointless machine  
-Search fund, a path with an interesting risk profile. Would result in 1-2 years of low earnings with no guarantee of finding a company to acquire. But if I do, will have solid, stable income for 5-7 years with potential for strong payoff. High stress, but near full autonomy of time and flexibility  
-Healthcare startup that allows me to stay in NYC. Lower immediate income potential, risky long-term potential. Will constantly feel challenged, but don't think I'll have much autonomy

Other notes  
-I can code, and tested an app with potential customers (failed due to unit economic assumptions not coming to fruition). Don't think I could code full-time though, and not the most creative with business ideas (nor do I think starting a company is appropriate risk-wise right now)  
-Love music, but don't think there's a realistic pathway to pursuing anything music-related as a job due to lack of industry experience  
-Not interested in private equity/hedge fund, it'll just be banking again

Of the ones above, which might be most appropriate? What other career paths should I consider? What have I not considered in making this ridiculous post? Honestly, looking for any means to pressure test my thoughts and thinking about my situation from a new lens. 

Thank you for your time, appreciate you reading and sharing your thoughts.

1cofuqb,help me make my summer job choice ,"i’m finishing out my sophomore year at college. i’m moving off campus for the summer for the first time ever in an apartment with a few friends. 

after i graduate i plan to be an ESL teacher. i eventually want to become a speech pathologist. 

i currently work at a program called jumpstart. it’s through my university- it’s essentially an assistant teaching position at underserved preschools in our community. it’s a good gig and looks really well on my resume. i did it my entire sophomore year and plan to do it when i return in the fall as a junior. 

my original goal for the summer was to get a job that “looks good” instead of going the typical money making summer job like coffee, retail, fast food, etc. i feel like as im growing up i should start focusing on that (😅).  however, i struggle with depression and anxiety really bad. this semester has kicked my ass COMPLETELY and i’m now feeling like i kind of want to relax this summer instead of getting that “job that looks good”. a few weeks ago i applied to a montessori school as a teaching assistant. to my surprise i got the job. so now i have to decide if i want to take it OR if i want to go the chill and relaxing summer route. i think i kind of know what i want the relaxing route i just need some words of encouragement that it’s okay. 

so here are the two jobs i’m left with 

Montessori job: good pay, m-f 9-5, 30 min commute by train(🤮). 

the alternative is that i have a mellow summer (no big girl job) and work at a pizza shop. (i was a dominos manager for 3 years so i have lots of experience). it wouldn’t be as good of pay but i feel like it would just be *easier*. 

but now that i got all attached to this montessori job and how it will look on my resume im having second thoughts about that belief. i feel like having a consistent position for 2 years (jumpstart) will look better than having this- jumpstart 1 year, montessori job for 3 months, jumpstart another year.

i feel like it’s just as important to have good history of length at a job. so really, am i missing out if i don’t do the teaching job this summer? idk. i’m just scared. and also scared that ill end up working at this local pizza shop and hate it. i fear ill regret my decision either way.

1codymr,Chase career dreams or stay stagnant and roll dice ,"25F married own a small home in TX. I have two choices and am really struggling on deciding if this is a smart idea or possibly a stupid one. 

I work for a Fortune 500 company, at a lower level position. However my company is heavily pushing for hybrid roles and I am fully virtual at the moment. I have a very low chance at promoting as a virtual employee. The problem here is there is the option to relocate in a higher cost of living area outside of my state in order to get a better chance at promoting with a salary increase and out of my role that is customer facing. 

So here is my dilemma
Option 1. Stay in TX keep my House at 2% mortgage rate and basically never get a chance to promote virtually. I have zero attachment to my house or my state. But I locked in such a good rate and worried to rent the house out for fear of bad tenants lol. 

Option 2. Leave TX move and rent an apartment in a higher cost of living area to either start a higher paid position or just get my foot in the door. The rent will likely be equivalent or higher than my mortgage. But I will have the chance to network, and apply for hybrid positions at a higher level and actually be qualified to do so since I’m already in office. I really want to stick with this company bc it’s hard to find me with such good pay and benefits 

Cons
Rent the house and tenants don’t pay 
Sell the house and lose my interest rate
Move across country and the climbing of corporate ladder doesn’t work out in my favor? 
Stuck in a small apartment with 2 dogs.

Pros
In office free food and gym 
Chance at higher salary 
Make work friends
6 weeks pto
Great insurance

1codb76,Have you read Extreme Ownership?,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something that has had a profound impact on my life: the book ""Extreme Ownership"" by Jocko Willink. 📚

I stumbled upon this gem a while back, and I can honestly say it's been a game-changer. The core message of the book is all about taking full responsibility for every aspect of your life, both the good and the bad. It's about owning your actions, your decisions, and your outcomes.

Since diving into this book, I've made it a part of my daily routine. I listen to it every day, whether I'm commuting, working out, or just winding down. And let me tell you, the lessons in ""Extreme Ownership"" never get old. They're like a constant reminder to stay accountable, stay disciplined, and keep pushing forward no matter what challenges come my way.

One of the biggest takeaways for me has been the idea of leading by example. Instead of pointing fingers or blaming others when things go wrong, I've learned to look inward and ask myself what I could have done differently. It's a mindset shift that has not only improved my leadership skills but has also helped me grow as a person.

I could go on and on about the lessons I've learned from this book, but I'll leave it at this: if you're looking for some serious inspiration and motivation to level up your life, give ""Extreme Ownership"" a read or a listen. Trust me, you won't regret it.

1cod5br,"Those of you who transitioned out of the service industry into a $150k+/yr position, how did you do it?","I’m 26, and a college graduate. I went to a good university. Not a top 10, but a top 70 school in the U.S that people recognize and many dream to go to. I got a B.S in Psychology with Neuroscience focus. After graduating in 2019, I moved around the country and took up bartending since it was easy to learn and I could use it anywhere. 

Well, here I am 5 years later and I haven’t switched careers but I’m pretty done with bartending and it feels pretty tough to break into another career path since the only things in my work history are all service jobs and a 6 month sales job I did part time in 2023. I know I want change and I have this internal need to be able to make 6 figures within at most 18 months or so. I always strive to work harder than others and will do what it takes to grind my way up as quickly as possible, but I just feel so much resistance to diving into something new. I also now live close to NYC where I should be able to fetch a higher salary. 

I’ve been applying to tons of sales positions but only a few have interviewed and the ones that offered me positions seemed like they have non-ideal pay structures. 

I have super supportive friends, family, and partner who all tell me I’m intelligent and can excel at whatever I strive for, but I just have no idea how to narrow down what I want. Every former manager has been upset when I left and all of them tell me I have so much potential. 

I flip-flop on a daily basis of whether I want to attempt to transition into sales, finance, psychotherapy, law or even other things. How do people narrow it down?

For context, I also have 12k in student debt and about 20k in assets + cash. Finances are okay and I have minimal expenses currently as I moved back in with parents.


TL;DR

I’m trying to transition careers 5 years out of college after only bartending. Difficulty choosing a path. Any and all advice welcome, please share your stories or ideas.",TuesdaysOnVenus,0,0.14000000059604645,6,1715302766,2024-05-10 00:59:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cod5br/those_of_you_who_transitioned_out_of_the_service/,5,2024
1cobyn5,Which job should I take? I’m lost…,"I need some help on what job to take. I need to decide asap. So I graduated last year May 2023 with a degree in business - management information systems. I’ve been looking for an entire year for a job. And I ended up with 2 offers. I’ve gone ahead and accepted the contract job offer because they gave me 1 hour to decide - I’m 1 week into it and i don’t really know how I feel about it. 

I ALSO accepted a full time offer too because they only gave me 2 days to decide and I couldn’t make a decision.

Here are the details: 

#1 contract job as a “data reporting analyst”
* Pay: $25 an hour or close to 55k a year 
* Fully Remote 
* 6 month contract to hire (which I think the hire part is not actually true and they’re lying)
* NO PTO 
* I can’t take any days off during the probationary period bc of training which is like 60 days 
* I use some python, sql, excel mainly cleaning things up and making basic reports that’s are some what already automated 
* The one thing that rubbed me wrong about the remote job is that I feel like these dudes are taking advantage of me because the manager told me that I need to keep my head down and do work and I’ll be fine - and that there’s no reason I should have any downtime because there’s gonna be a lot that I have to do. Also there is a good bit of micro management with constantly asking what I’m working on - idk how long this will last since I’m still learning 


# 2 full time job as a entry level “technical support engineer” at a SaaS company
* pay - $61k a year 
* 5 days on site in office 
* 1 hour and 15 min commute each way. So a total of 2 and a half hour commute more or less. Distance wise it’s not that far - only 30 miles but traffic is insane 
* Unlimited PTO (which I feel like is not completely true bc my days off depends on business needs) 
* Some preferred knowledge include things like Java, C++, VXML, C, Unix
* I may or may not have to be on call on some weekends and nights (they said it’s rare but idk how rare it is if they had to tell me) 


Now I know you guys are going to say take the career path you wanna do. The issue is, idk what I wanna do long term. I want to be working a somewhat technical role that has a good career output with both pay and work - life balance, which I feel like both of these may have long term career wise but you guys may know better. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated or if you guys have direct experience with either role I would love to hear your thoughts.

1cobg2u,Unfair treatment but don’t know what to do ,"I work in sales and I’m very good at my job. I work hard and put in a high level of engagement which means a lot of hours, a lot of short deadlines etc. 

What I’ve found difficult is going back to the office after having worked from home during the pandemic. On a team of ten people in which we support numerous sales reps, there are only 4 of us who have to work from the office. 

I have noticed that the people I go to the office with do not come in 4 days a week and if they do come in, they don’t stay for a full work day. They go home early and work. 

Considering they had been doing this for a while and I had been working often alone at the office, I decided to only come in when they came in and leaving when they left. 

The first time I got a warning from my boss. When this happened I assumed he warned all of us that we can’t be jumping around the rules. I started coming in the times I was supposed to but still noticed nothing changed for the others; they still weren’t coming in or staying for as long as I was. 

So then I left early only when my boss wasn’t there since he also doesn’t come in all the time either and stay the full day either. 

Then I got in trouble again. Yet the others still were doing what they wanted. I admittedly felt resentful so I once again left early recently when my boss wasn’t there. 

He completely lost his shit on me and went over board asking me why I even stay at this job, that he’s tired of “standing up for me” and that he’s tired of repeating himself. 

The thing is I’m not understanding why despite the same rules being applied to the others, I’m being singled out and reprimanded. He even makes excuses for the others like the one has a dog at home. I have two dogs at home! Or the traffic is bad for one of them so they’re not coming in. Meanwhile I have massive traffic jams throughout my commute.

1coax26,People asking to “pick my brain” for free on LinkedIn ,"Hi everyone, I’m fairly established in a somewhat niche field. I have a myriad of people reaching out for virtual chats. Some of them are students which I created office hours for them to join in group settings because I am happy to help students. 

However, there’s a lot of established professionals who are reaching out to “pick my brain”, chat etc. I always let them know I only do free meetings with students but for established professionals I charge a consulting fee. 

Some keep pushing back and some get so offended and others will pay. 

I’m just confused, is it normal that people are asking for me to do free labor then get offended when I don’t? 

Are there instances where I should be taking free calls with people? How do I figure out who’s there to waste my time and who would be a good person to talk to for free

1coa5tc,Politics or I?,"Throw-away account :) 

I'm in the public sector with a ND condition (AuDHD). I'm very confused about how my manager is acting and how I am still employed. 

I joined here knowing the department was a cost recovery structure.   
  
I keep going out there hustling for new sources of income so the department can increase their bottom line through increased output from the services.   


Year #1) Conflict with co-workers who thought I just sat at my desk, did minimal work, aloof etc. Found a resolution (more privacy) but at the cost of increasing my responsibilities.   

// Some drama here and the department lost the ability to perform certain services due to poor output...

Year #2) I've made friends now with tons of co-workers who occasionally ""circumvent"" the rules by contacting me directly. I still billed properly and my manager had full view of my day through calendars etc. I also started reminding folks follow the rules! Unfortunately, my time management skills occasionally made me late to meetings.  My manager decided to put me on a PIP which I passed 

// Some drama here due to my manager refusing to clearly layout hybrid work policies. Department stats looked like p00p. Some internal policies changes too

Present) My manager decided to change my role again. Now I've lost my ability to schedule anything and everything on my calendar must be approved from my manager.  My manager said this was to prevent me from being taken advantage of by my co-workers.   
  
I'm feeling like I'm being used my manager to show the other managers he ""owns"" my time/resources at the company. This individual is mine, go through me.

1co9mb3,Reference dilemma,"I work for a large UK financial group, and essentially my manager has tried to get rid of me by putting me on a performance plan (even though I’ve been performing fine). Now it’s passed the final review and they’ve decided to no longer employ me. 

In the mean time I started applying for other roles and got offered another role at another company, which will need reference checks. My current employer states that the reference will reflect reason for dismissal and will say something related to dismissed for performance reasons.

I am worried the new employer (using a 3rd party agency) will do these reference checks and withdraw their offer. My current employer deals with reference checks centrally and ones that have gone direct to a manager need sent to their central HR team. 

Is there any way around this? Or could I provide the new employer with a colleague (friend who also works at same company but different teams details?).

1co7tiz,"How to professionally handle a whiny coworker. How can I reword ""please shut the fuck up, I really don't care"" in a way that doesn't make things worse?","I have a coworker who comes from the ""don't quit, make them fire you"" school of professionalism. We live in a country where workers actually have rights so they're still building a case to fire her. 

I don't want to go into detail about our issues with her because I don't want a coworker to recognise this but all I'll say is that if this were in the US she'd have been chewed up and spat out LONG ago. TLDR; imagine the worst /r/antiwork stereotype. That's her. And I say that as someone who finds that sub very cathartic. 

I have much bigger issues with her that management and HR are currently investigating but right now there's a smaller one like popcorn in my teeth. I'm not going to go running to daddy about this but would appreciate advice on how not to lose my fucking shit. 

She won't stop fucking whining. She refuses to answer the phones, leaving me to answer them nonstop, but then she'll complain about the ringing. She complains about how much she hates her chair - mine is the better chair, and with my back pain I am NOT fucking giving it to her so she keeps dropping anvil sized hints that I should give it to her. She whines about how hard all the work I'm doing is. She whines that she is so hard done by because they wouldn't give her a raise for her shitty work ethic.

In full bluntness: I do not fucking care. Her whining is fucking annoying. I've been grey rocking this shit for MONTHS and it's not fucking ending. ""Uh huh. Mhmm. Uh huh."" Nope. It never fucking ends.

What's a professional way to tell her to STFU that doesn't give her an excuse to go off? Her attitude is so shitty I have to walk on eggshells around her (management is aware of this and it's one of the things she's being watched closely for). I'm one of those people who flinch and duck for cover when people raise their voices; she doesn't raise her voice, but passive aggressive sulking triggers the same response in me and she LOVES to slam drawers, sigh dramatically and make the atmosphere tense and unpleasant. Her bad attitude has been escalating so I'm genuinely worried that I'm going to set her off.

Management has responded to the situation by reassigning me and basically making her deal with the workload herself, but there's another coworker there who is very new so if that site is understaffed enough I have to go in in case she decides to go home early, in which case the newbie would be on her own, so I still have to deal with her from time to time. Yeah, she did that. Yeah, we're all surprised she hasn't been fired yet.

So what's a cheerful, plausibly deniable phrase I can put in my back pocket to stop her fucking whining that doesn't give her an inch?",Halospite,7,0.6499999761581421,31,1715288297,2024-05-09 20:58:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1co7tiz/how_to_professionally_handle_a_whiny_coworker_how/,5,2024

1co7g4d,"How to tactfully propose and negotiate career advancement?
","Hello everyone! I'm a 27-year-old male who recently started a new job in marketing in HiTech. Just a month in, I've managed to become a favored employee by my boss, thanks to my knack for optimizing complex processes. Using basic programming skills and Python scripts, I've automated tasks that previously took a week down to an hour or less, significantly improving the work lives of my colleagues. Despite earning what I believe to be an average salary, the improvements I've introduced merit recognition, as they have drastically enhanced efficiency and overall staff well-being.

My current manager supports every idea I bring and has indicated that the tasks I've initiated are now a higher priority than my initial assignments. I feel like he might be considering creating a new position tailored for me, and I want to ensure I approach this potential growth tactfully. My goal is to continue enhancing business processes, but I'm not quite sure what specific role I'm carving out for myself. Given the significant impact of my work I believe a renegotiation of terms is justified.

1co6lk1,Niche set of skills— what are my options?,"Preface: I am 23, and live within a reasonable drive of a large metropolitan area in my state. Originally posted in career guidance but got no interaction.

Hi all, I’d appreciate some guidance or routes I can research for my (moderately?) unique situation. 

The skills that I posses from my professional work experience are in rather niche areas, where not a lot of the skills are transferable. For example, I have:

- 3 years of Corrections experience at two different levels (state and county)
- 2 years of blue collar work, specifically cabinet installations, mainly 1099

I don’t envision myself being blue-collar my whole life, and I tried to make a break for it by subbing and doing cabinet work, however the work has dried up, and it’s difficult to source more work in my area, as I don’t have the connections that others do. 

I went to school for a year but left to pursue law enforcement, so no degree. I’m wondering what reasonable options I have as far as a more traditional white-collar occupation/career. My only real caveat is that I have a large amount of bills, including a truck payment, mortgage, and business insurance for my entity. 

Is there anything I can get into that has a reasonably successful career path? (And not an unreasonably high barrier of entry?)
How can I market my somewhat niche professional experiences?

I’m very open to any suggestions and I’ll happily engage and answer any questions to provide a better understanding. I’d greatly appreciate any feedback, even if you just call me an idiot in the comments.

1co61h2,I am overworked and aimless in my role. I feel like I have tried to express this to my manager over and over with no improvement. It feels like it’s time to move on. ,"TLDR: I am overworked, confused, and burnt out. No amount of conversation seems to be reaching my manager. How can I learn to be a more effective communicator to evoke real change? Is it time to move on since we are a bad fit?

I am a junior researcher working on a niche insights team within a large global company. I have a master’s degree and about five years experience. My team is trying to get their feet under them since it’s newer. Since joining, it feels like we are an after thought in business processes and my manager and director have done little to change that. I feel like I have no true understanding of how I should be working with my stakeholders despite asking numerous times. 

I feel completely ineffective and overworked in my role. Despite stating this to my manager in various ways, no changes have been made. It’s like he is dodging responsibility and trying to make it my job to reduce my workload. I feel like he 100% puts my management in my hands. Our team staff meetings are useless and provide no guidance. I watch my teammates flourish while I fight to tread water. I am managing things that aren’t in scope of my role and should be handed off to other functions or stakeholders.

Maybe I have a different expectation of what I should be doing vs. what I am doing. I feel like I am being misunderstood and I can’t figure out how to change my approach so it sticks.  My manager can never answer my clarifying questions. He always moves to shift things off my plate, not empower me to set boundaries to keep them from getting on there in the first place. If I want to remove something, he fights to make it so it doesn’t happen. It is the weirdest situation I’ve ever been in. 

Maybe he thinks I shouldn’t feel overworked but I am. I put everything I do in aWord doc and it took up five pages. He says “that’s a lot” despite me effectively begging him to help me define my role so I can focus on things.  I have given up on professional development opportunities and networking in the office because I am so tired. I have pointedly said “this is too much, it needs to stop” and he didn’t even react. 

I can go on and on about the hours’ long discussions we’ve had. I feel like he doesn’t have a full grasp of our stakeholders’ business needs and I am made to feel rude for trying to ask for them. It feels like it’s controversial to pointedly ask people for what they need and how it will help them. 

I feel like I am losing it. I am tired. My brain is slower and is turning into soup. I feel like the pandemic stunted some areas of my growth but I have done a lot of work since joining this team a couple of years ago. I feel like I have done most of this myself with vague guidance and I can’t take it anymore. I am reaching my breaking point.

My company doesn’t pay out unused PTO unless legally required, which isn’t the case in NY. I plan to give three weeks’ notice, with my last office day on May 31st. I’d like to use my 21 days of unused PTO in June for childcare before my son starts daycare, and then begin my new job on July 1st.

Given that the company isn’t legally obligated to grant this request, would it be fair to ask? I’m willing to be available via phone and email during June to assist with the transition. If denied, it would cause financial strain and personal inconvenience. Would it be appropriate to ask my boss to report my final day as June 28th to HR, allowing me to use my PTO during this period?",Leather_Thing_2665,1,1.0,1,1715283605,2024-05-09 19:40:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1co5y1v/asking_to_use_pto_after_leaving_a_job/,5,2024

1co5snt,Am I making a mistake by asking to go remote?,"Hi, looking for advice about how to approach my boss about going remote. Will try to give as much context as I can while still staying anonymous. 

I have been at this F500 company for >5 years and have been performing well and been promoted twice. We are currently working in a hybrid dynamic, but there’s always talks of corporate mandating us to be fully back in office. I have been in my latest role for almost 1 year, and have received very good feedback since starting it. I’ve gotten a couple of small bonus awards, and a nice % raise when it came time for merit increases; more than the standard amount. My boss has given me very positive feedback, my teammates like me, and I think I am a valuable contributor. I like my team, I like my boss, and I like my job. 

So if all this is so dandy, then why am I thinking of asking to be remote? If you guessed love, you would be right. My partner of 2+ years lives >3 hours away from me. They are doing a residency program in the medical field, so neither remote work nor relocating is a possibility for them. We have been making long distance work, but with multiple years still left in their program, I don’t want to tough it out anymore.

My plan has been (and still is) to be a kick- ass employee in this new role and wait until the 1 year mark to have the remote conversation with my boss. I have been trying to learn as much as I can and have been pursuing external professional certifications to level myself up and really be an asset. My question is what kind of approach should I take for this conversation? Are there certain things I should consider that I may be missing? 

Here is some additional context: 

1. Changing roles/changing companies is technically a possibility, but it would be tough. The fully remote roles at my company have really dwindled, and I’m not sure if they are even posting fully remote positions anymore. In addition to this, I’m in an expensive grad school program that my company has been paying for. The agreement is to stay with the company 1 year post graduation, otherwise the money (>$100K) needs to be paid back. So changing companies is not really an option either. I can pretend to play hard ball, but I don’t really have any leverage. 

2. When my manager started, he hired me along with 2 other individuals,both of whom are fully remote. Their jobs are different than mine, but my point here is that it doesn’t seem my boss has an aversion to remote work. But I’m not sure how much his hands are tied from the powers that be. 

3. I have not been saying “fully remote” because my job does require me to be in person for customer meetings that happen every so often, maybe 1 week every 2 months or so. I plan to make it clear to my boss that I will still be in person for those meetings. It’s really the consistent Tuesday/Thursday in office regardless of what’s going on that I’m wanting to get rid of. 

4. I’m a bit concerned that if I have this conversation with my boss and remote is not a possibility, they will forever after be worried about me leaving, think I’m not committed, not want to invest in me, etc. Their personality has not indicated that they would ever act with any malice, and I don’t believer they ever would, but they might from then on think that I always have 1 foot out of the door.

Is two months a reasonable amount of time to stay on in the role I’m leaving while they find a replacement?,"The company I work for has always treated me very well.

I told her that while I preferred to leave earlier, of course I understood and that I appreciated all that she had done for me. The thing is, and maybe I’ll get told to “suck it up” like my family has told me, I can feel myself slipping back into the depression that I somehow managed to claw my way out of maybe a year or so before switching to the new role, and it is because of the nature of the work (yep, I should have researched it better).

1co4wd4,"I am an engineer in NYC seeking career advice in hopes of transitioning to a more lucrative career, preferentially in technical sales or business development but I am open to suggestions.

","Hello Reddit,

 

I graduated as a materials engineer in 2019 and started off in a major defense company as a Materials and Failure Analysis Engineer. Due to the pandemic, I was laid off after 1 year. 1.5 years later, I landed a Development Engineer position in a sensor company specializing in aerospace manufacturing. I’ve been here 2.5 years, with a current salary of \~$77,000. I live in NYC and I do not want to leave. Financially, it’s been tough; I’m barely making ends meet, so I am posting because I am at a career crossroad and am hoping to get advice.

 

Compared to my coworkers, my position is very demanding. I handle experiments throughout the production lifetime of our units (while other engineers here typically have a singular focus), conduct failure analysis, material characterization, basic coding, drafting, 3D design and some 3d printing. I've conducted research aimed at boosting production efficiency and isolated and addressed redundancies and flaws in our processes. I was hired at 72k, a month before a handful of program managers, all fresh out of college mechanical engineers, each starting at 75k. Their roles are far less demanding—essentially overseeing minimal tasks and having lots of downtime in managing client relations, which contrasts sharply with my constant, hands-on work. For instance, a new program manager named Katie spent her initial months mostly reading books while waiting for work to come in. I run around all day while she sits and reads fantasy novels.

 

We have had two salary adjustments in the past 2.5 years- the first was a 4% cost of living adjustment at the 1 year mark that was applied to all workers at the company. Despite my broad responsibilities, I remained the lowest paid engineer- behind even fresh graduates. I attempted to negotiate an actual raise by leveraging not only my workload and my superior knowledge of our product and processes, but by pointing out my monthly deliverables, dozens of authored internal reports, proposals, highlighted my design work, hands-on machine shop work, as well as my unique engagement with different departments to accomplish tasks without oversight of management. I underscored my ambition and my loyalty and argued that I was more valuable than the entry level hiring pay that I was receiving. No change. Our second salary adjustment came 8 months later- everyone got a 4% bump. Frankly, its insulting, what is my incentive to work as hard as I do if I can expect exactly the same as everyone else?

 

Before my career in engineering, I spent a decade as a waiter and bartender, earning \~ $90,000 a year. I was the ""face"", interacting directly with clients and generally enjoying my time. The move to engineering was like moving from the front of the house—visible, interactive, and well-compensated—to the back of the house, essential yet out of sight, heavily loaded with tasks but undercompensated and underappreciated. This shift has been demoralizing and financially disappointing, a \~20k salary decrease to work harder, longer hours, miserable all day and limited interactions to the same handful of people who are great, but have no real-life experience outside of the school to corporate career pipeline, giving me little mental stimulation outside of just engineering work. My significant life experience, my negotiation skills, my sales skills, my social intuition, good looks (it shouldn’t matter but it so often does) and my ability to confidently interact with just about anyone, are all qualities that are useless here but would undoubtedly serve me well in other job, in another field.  I’m frustrated seeing all of my friends in “easier” fields making more than I do. I feel that I am just being foolish by devoting myself to this career when the people around me work less, think less, do less math, and make way more money, while working remote. It seems like a shift to technical sales, SaaS, computing infrastructure or client relation management may be better suited for my abilities and goals. Thus, I've been exploring positions in sales and business development, areas I believe could better leverage my skills for a more lucrative career, however, my attempts to pivot have been challenging without direct experience in these roles.

 

I'm seeking advice on how best to navigate this potential career shift. How can I effectively transition from engineering to a role with one that provides me with real opportunities in the business world? I feel that sales is the best route for me, but only because I cant think of any other way to apply my skillset. I want to wear the suit, to negotiate, to be involved in logistics. I want to manage rich clients, or successful OEM’s, to get legitimate bonuses and stock options, to travel, or take important phone calls, to represent my company, or my team, and push forward deals, to impress my bosses and earn more than those who put in less effort. I want to be involved with the business side, the sales side, the growth side- to become a front of house person outside of the hospitality industry.

Can anyone provide advice or insights for me?

 

Tl;dr

I'm a materials engineer (3.5 years experience) currently working in aerospace manufacturing, facing career dissatisfaction due to low pay and high workload compared to less demanding engineering roles within the same company. Despite my broader and more difficult role, I make less money and have less modes of advancement here. Attempts to negotiate a fair salary have been met with vague promises and bureaucratic delays, and even with recent company-wide salary adjustments, I remain one of the lowest-paid engineers, increasing my frustration and prompting me to consider a career shift. Looking for new engineering roles seems like it would be more of the same. I'm interested in leveraging my technical expertise and client-facing experience in more lucrative fields like sales or in business development. I have previously worked in fast paced, upscale hospitality environments as a bartender and waiter. I stand out from other engineers in terms of my strong interpersonal skills gained from a decade worth of client facing interactions and am knowledgeable on topics outside of just math and science, which I believe could translate well into a business or sales environment. I'm contemplating a transition to roles that would allow me to manage relationships, clients, negotiate deals, and possibly work in technical sales or business development- to have a seat at the table, to work with real money and people with money, and to bust my ass to become one of them. At this point, I don't even need it to be ethical- my job is a proxy for weapons manufacturing, at this point, whatever.  I am seeking advice on how to effectively move from engineering to a more lucrative business role, contemplating positions in technical sales, SaaS, or client management to achieve what feels like a more rewarding path.

1co42mx,"Work taking a toll on my mental health, any advice? ","Positives:
- Close to home, somewhat relaxed mentality in the office, a lot of friendly people 
- Good progression scheme if you can get the clients of the value (which isn’t distributed fairly based upon experience and skill). 

Negatives:
- I feel extremely anxious all day, because every time a client that in their own power decides to be difficult (because of their personality) it looks bad on me, my manager then my manager gives me points of improvement, which im keen to do, and I want to progress. Sometimes it is my fault but a lot of the time it’s the client that pulls some awkward bs because they’re on a power trip. 
- The progression scheme benefits people who are friends with the manager, as the high value clients are assigned to those people. I know because a guy that started a year after me (I’ve been there 2 years he’s been there 1) is all buddy buddy with the manager and getting all of the progression customers. 
- Mainly the anxiety and stress, it’s taking a serious toll on my mental health, I haven’t received a positive piece of feedback in a year from someone above me, when I met the criteria for a raise they still didn’t give me the appraisal I asked for. 
- Despite my improved skills and experience it’s then made me think I’m actually worst now when I started. 
 
I don’t want to blow things out of proportion because I too have been assigned a small proportion of the high value clients, but no where near as much as this one guy.
I don’t hate my manager but I do dread speaking to him because the last 5 occasions it’s just been constant constructive criticism which I find hard not to take personally. 

I’ve also been assigned a particular group of assholes that no other consultants deal with, others even refer to me as the “shit client whisperer” which should be a compliment but those clients make me look terrible

Like its not a livable wage. My (director level) is aware and constantly brings this up to her boss, and has for a year. Her boss is right under the CEO, and he always mentions that our promotions are on his mind but never does anything. Yet, I see some promotions and raises that come directly from the CEO happening immediately. 

The reasons I have not began to look elsewhere are three.

- My boss is a great boss, and is truly here for us. I have had horrible bosses and I am terrified of moving.

- I have been needing time off to take care of a family member, and the amount of time off allotted is one of the benefits. My boss has also been incredibly flexible about this. This is my number one reason of staying. 

- Speaking of flexibility, we work from home. I would consider myself very proactive and can get my job done efficiently, being able to do what I need the rest of the day.

 - The benefits are amazing. 

- I have a massive amount of debt and I cannot afford to quit with out another job in hand.

  
This however, has been breaking my soul. I have so much stress from all areas of my life that I feel also it is not the time to get a new job.

1co3pry,My Team Lead is almost bullying me,"I put down my papers last Thursday. When I sent out my resignation e-mail I purposely ignored my team lead and did not cc her and did not even verbally tell her that I put down my papers because she is one of the main reason why I am leaving the organisation. She had sent a message asking why I did not loop her in the mail. In that message she repeated asked why I didn’t include her in the mail about 5 times. 

Now, this week she has been constantly behind my back about different issues. First, it was about punching in and out rule (our office has a policy of swiping our card whenever we enter and leave the premises and nobody, including her follow that rule religiously), she had sent a long message in the group saying that she got complaints about how some people(me) are not following that rule. After this, she messaged me multiple times in my personal chat asking if I had done it,  even after work hours. 

Second, she sent a message in the group telling our team to not watch videos, series etc during work hours. I have a habit of listening to podcasts or music, ON MY HEADPHONES while working and she does too. She watches videos like “how to be THAT girl”, “How to speak English fluently” which is none of my business but she specifically picks out things that I do. 

Now today, she set up a meeting with our general manager and then went to talk to the HR. It was none of my business, I didn’t bother, I didn’t even know, UNTIL the HR called me, because I’m on good terms with her and told me that my team lead set up a meeting to complain about ME. She said that I don’t listen and ignore her messages and when I don’t punch in I waste 1 productive hour etc. 

I am really not understanding what she wants to prove by doing all this. This is kind of frustrating and I’m really tired of this game. I am leaving anyway, what does she get by complaining about me constantly when I’m no longer even going to be a part of this organisation in a few weeks? And what do you think I should do?

1co3kz4,I am part of a team that noone seems to get a promotion or significant raise. Is this a huge flag for long run?,"I work in the R&D department of a global company, one of the big players in my field. I joined their one of their research teams in Europe. It is a team of 20, people work on different things but everybody has the same job title apart from the manager. 

I have been there for 3 years now and realized that whatever I do, I will not get a raise higher than the annual raise that the whole team gets. I did pretty well in the last years and got lots of praises from the management. I even got the chance to discuss my project directly with the CEO. However I never got a promotion or a payraise I was silently expecting. My responsibilities has been increased multiple times though. 


 A few months ago, I decided to ask for a raise, first time in my life, showing my additional responsibilities as a reason. My manager said he will try but never came back with a response. Then I brought the topic up, this time showing salaries for similar roles I found in glassdoor, that I am  underpaid by 20%. He finally told me that he can’t give me a raise as he does it, he has to do it for everyone in the team. I then realized rhat there are people with 10 years of experience in this team, never getting a salary raise or job title change.

Dear NAME,

I hope this message finds you well.  I am writing to inquire about the status of my application for the TITLE role at COMPANY NAME.  I recently received an offer from another company, and committed to a response by this Friday.

Could you kindly provide a status update on the hiring process?  I continue to be very enthusiastic about this opportunity and would love to be part of the COMPANY NAME team.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

And this is the response I received:

""

Thank you for the update and congrats on your other offer! You are very much in consideration for the role, however we are not in the position to make a decision by tomorrow unfortunately.

1co1sly,How to decide hourly rate as an independent contractor?,"I work for a consultancy, but I sometimes have the option to become an independent contractor. I work in software development/software architecture at the senior level.

My company has never shared my hourly rate with me, but I believe it's somewhere in the $150 - $200 range. My salary is in the 70-75 / hr range plus benefits.

If I were to go independent, should I charge the same hourly rate that my consultancy charges? They can offer some more as a business than I could on my own. For example, if I were on a contract with a client and for some reason had to come off of that contract (like I found another job or got sick or something), then they would be able to rotate someone else into my place with less procurement hassle than if the client had to go back to the job market to find someone.

If I were to go independent but still work with my current company as a subcontractor (A few people do this at my company), what would I charge them? I assume they would be saving some money on my benefits + vacation + bench time + payroll taxes and administrative overhead - could I charge them $110/hr or more?

1co1f2j,Not sure where to go or what to do.,"Advice under this post would mean a lot to me but I’m mostly using this just to rant and get this off my chest.

I (23m) graduated college 1 year ago with a BS degree double majoring in Computer Science and Computer Information Systems. The college I went to is very small (under 2,000 students). Halfway through my degree I realized I didn’t want to program or be a software/application engineer. I still want to work with IT but more so on the business side of IT (Analyst positions). I then got more involved with the business department at my college. I made a few connections, won a collegiate pitch contest, co-president of the entrepreneurship club, etc. I also had an internship for a few months with an AI startup company and a few months when a financial company partnered with the college I attended for a potential app for students of the college. 

I know the job market is shit, especially in the IT industry, but I am having absolutely no luck in finding a job. I had one interview that I traveled for an hour and a half away for. I got there and the interview was only 10 minutes like they never even had the intention of hiring me. I also had an interview for a help desk job at the college I attended. I basically got ghosted as I haven’t even heard back from it in a month. My plan was the take the help desk job and the college will provide free schooling for me to gain my masters in data analytics. I have a few connections with this opportunity so I will probably make a hail-mary this week and hope for a response.

Even if I do get an interview with the job I want I feel like I will fail any technical questions they ask even for an entry level position. I’ve been thinking about trying to teach myself PowerBI and Tableau because a lot of the jobs I see require experience in either program. 

I feel that every day that goes by that I don’t have a job I become even more unattractive to employers. I’m not sure how to stop this. I can’t even get responses from jobs that only require an associate’s or high school degree.

So now I’m here at 3:30 in the morning sick to my stomach typing this out because I feel like an absolute failure. I see all my friends who was with me in college get great jobs and here I am unemployed.

I’m not sure what I should do. I already have bad anxiety and depression and this situation I’m in certainly isn’t helping any.

I’m sorry if this post seems erratic or is formatted bad or has bad grammar. I’m on mobile and have been panicking and crying the past 20 minutes. I really appreciate it if you’ve read this far and advice means the world to me.

1cny9pz,Waiting 5 months for my salary adjustment raise in IT (is this normal?),"I have been working full time for my company since January 2023. This was my first job out of school and got a little bit lowballed but I told management that I was willing to prove myself and show my worth for the following raise cycle, they agreed this would happen if I proved myself. When my performance review came around I received high ratings as I went from no knowledge of the IT role I was in to a specialist certified fully functioning Admin/Developer.  Massive projects were also completed during this time and have received recognition and praise for the work I’ve done from both management and upper management. I feel I’ve done a lot to earn my raise but it seems like I’m in a cycle of bureaucracy and my manager has to jump through hoops to get me my raise and has to keep going through different people to pass it along. I’ve been told several times I would know it a few weeks, a week, a week and a half, and still nothing and now it’s been 5 months since the initial discussion. In that time I did get my merit raise (which is small), and my yearly bonus (which was decent), but not my salary adjustment. It’s suppose to be at least a 20k adjustment from what I’m currently making so on top of being told several times I’ll find out in a week, I’m also loosing out on all that money from waiting nearly half a year for my adjustment. I’ve been vocal to my manager about how it’s bothering me and he says how the IT department has a long annoying process with this stuff but 5 months seems totally ridiculous. I could be more verbal about how much this is bothering me but the compensation space in the corporate world is still new to me and I don’t want to cross any lines. 

My questions are:
1. Is it normal for unscheduled raises to take this long? Am I being played/breadcrumbed? 
2. What if any action can I take in the company for his?

1cnvavg,"Inexperienced manager in crisis, not sure what to do from here","I manage 10 direct reports and was promoted to this role in October.

Things have been going great. I was getting accolades at work and my team was super happy with my management style. I'm up for a big raise next month and a bonus in the meantime for my efforts.

A month ago, our workload on my team suddenly increased by 500%. The reason for this is a change that the client made and refuses to roll back. Initially the team did really well dealing with what was expected to be a temporary increase, but it's now clear that the situation is permanent and we can't keep up. I'm in the thick of it, doing IC work right alongside my reports and trying to balance my management responsibilities as well, and it's becoming unreasonable for everyone involved.

I held some meetings with the client and other leadership at the client's company this week in hopes of a solution that would decrease volume and improve my team's efficiency, and was not only shot down but completely disrespected.

1cnrrru,Not sure where to go or what to do.,"Advice under this post would mean a lot to me but I’m mostly using this just to rant and get this off my chest.

I (23m) graduated college 1 year ago with a BS degree double majoring in Computer Science and Computer Information Systems. The college I went to is very small (under 2,000 students). Halfway through my degree I realized I didn’t want to program or be a software/application engineer. I still want to work with IT but more so on the business side of IT (Analyst positions). I then got more involved with the business department at my college. I made a few connections, won a collegiate pitch contest, co-president of the entrepreneurship club, etc. I also had an internship for a few months with an AI startup company and a few months when a financial company partnered with the college I attended for a potential app for students of the college. 

I know the job market is shit, especially in the IT industry, but I am having absolutely no luck in finding a job. I had one interview that I traveled for an hour and a half away for. I got there and the interview was only 10 minutes like they never even had the intention of hiring me. I also had an interview for a help desk job at the college I attended. I basically got ghosted as I haven’t even heard back from it in a month. My plan was the take the help desk job and the college will provide free schooling for me to gain my masters in data analytics. I have a few connections with this opportunity so I will probably make a hail-mary this week and hope for a response.

Even if i do get an interview with the job I want I feel like I will fail any technical questions they ask even for an entry level position. I’ve been thinking about trying to teach myself PowerBi and Tableau because a lot of the jobs I see require experience in either program. 

So now I’m here at 3:30 in the morning sick to my stomach typing this out because I feel like an absolute failure. I see all my friends who was with me in college get great jobs and here I am unemployed.

I’m not sure what I should do. I already have bad anxiety and depression and this situation I’m in certainly isn’t helping any.

I’m sorry if this post seems erratic or is formatted bad or has bad grammar. I’m on mobile and have been panicking and crying the past 20 minutes.

I said yes to a 12 month maternity cover role, because it was in a part of the business that I have less experience and thought I would benefit most. They’ve expressed a strong desire to keep me on and find a new role for me once the 12 month cover is over. The role starts in a week.

1cnqg6b,Career Transition Advice ,"So I (31M) don’t even know where to start, but I want to transition from self-employment to something more stable, potentially corporate. To start, for the last 10 years since undergrad, I have been involved in the professional wrestling business. Prior to Covid, I was on the event side, operating a promotion, selling tickets, hiring talent, etc. During the pandemic I realized that while it is my passion it does not meet my financial life requirements and in the long-term it would just accumulate far too many expenses and debt, especially with the limited opportunities for live event sales with the capacity restrictions. During that time I decided going back to school to acquire an MBA would be the best route in positioning myself into the job market considering my undergrad was an unused liberal arts degree. While full-time in the MBA, I began consulting with other wrestling companies on venues, demographics, talent, creative strategies, B2B vendors and actionable financial frameworks to try and help them succeed (for pay of course). 

Now I would like to transition away from that into something more stable and I just don’t know where to go or how to get there. I have nearly 6 years of event experience and 4 of strategy consulting experience but I have no idea how to market that into a resume or what fields I should target. I also never officially filed my consulting as a legal business (obviously to just get Venmo and cash payments), is that something I should do for employment verification? Maybe a sole proprietorship? I get worried about how I would be able to confirm something such as self-employed consulting if I was required.

Any guidance would be most appreciated. It’s a tough market out there, best of luck to all. ",BeneficialEmploy3071,1,1.0,3,1715235786,2024-05-09 06:23:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cnqg6b/career_transition_advice/,5,2024

1cnpy2j,Have it good but want more,"Here’s my situation. I’m in IT Sales for a regional provider. I work mostly from home, I make around 150-175k annually with commission (which is capped and I usually cap out), we get ridiculous good PTO - 6 Weeks, I’m a top rated employee every year I’ve been here. 

I’ve hung around primarily because of the great time off, work from home, a boss who left me alone, and was retiring soon so potential promotion to his spot and because generally I’m good at what I do so I don’t actually have to grind too bad. 

My Old boss William has just retired and instead of me getting a chance to get his job, my team and I have been shuffled under a different AVP who owns the product teams (which are mediocre at best) I was given an explanation that they wanted to bring the sales and product teams closer together. I was also told second hand that I was too valuable where I was to move me. New boss is a decent guy but his product managers are incompetent Idiots. 

My dilemma is this, There are basically no other roles at my company that will pay me equivalent that I have any interest in and that I’d have a chance at getting. 

 I’ve worked for a large Global IT company, I’ve got an MBA from top school, I’m great at what I do. But I’m not challenged and I have been vocal about wanting something more, something new, more responsibility, etc for a couple years. The answer was always that my old boss Will wasn’t going to be around forever and that I was the natural successor. 

The flexibility, the wfh, the paid time off and decent pay are all good but I feel like to progress my career I pretty much have to leave. 

But if I leave I’d need probably a 30-40% pay increase to justify leaving and the fact I’d probably have less pto, and that I’d likely have to grind a whole lot more in a new job.

1cnped8,Still no clear direction. Thoughts on what to look into I may like? ,"

Hi, 
I have never had any real direction in my life and want more than just working different jobs to pay bills. But I have only basic ideas of what is out there. So any ideas you think I might be interested in, I’d love to take a closer look at. I’m in my mid 30s so I feel like I’m coming in really late, but still ready and willing to go for it. Whatever it is. 

I’m great in customer service but I don’t wanna deal directly with people all the time. Currently work in the alternative media department at my school (first year CS). I’m not great with computers but I do enjoy the little bit of programming I’ve learned so far. Figuring out and trying to understand why something works or doesn’t. Same with math. Plugging things into formulas and working something out is actually fun, especially when it works. I’m not great at it but actually like it. I love helping people, like those little moments when you can give someone an ease in their difficult situation, no matter how small. 

I have history as a home care assistant. I definitely don’t want to do that again. 

I have an aa in social/behavioral sciences. I wanted to be a counselor at one point but realized being involved in other’s emotional well being can be draining to my own. 

In my current position if I am not working front office then I am tagging digital texts for others. I like that I’m helping others to succeed, also that I can throw some headphones on and just zone out at work. So some repetition is cool.

1cnoxz9,My manager doesn’t want to be a manager,"(UK)

Hi all,

Looking for some thoughts and maybe some experience on what I should do at this point. Expect to see a lot of red flags in my post.

I have been working at a new role, for just over 2 months now. I am still young, 26, but have been working in IT since I was 17. This new role is the biggest side-step in my career, in terms of what I’m actually doing. For those who know IT, I was mostly doing Infrastructure previously, now I’m doing Linux System Administration (essentially DevOps - we’ll come into that). Quite a big side-step, as I have barely any development knowledge (it was not sold to me as DevOps, nor was mentioned on the JD). Overall, I do enjoy the work I do. It is something that i’d very much like to learn more about.

With all the negativity I’m about to write, in terms of my development and progression within the role, I am way ahead of my developmental schedule and doing very well. The company have no “concerns”. 

Anyway - 

I have been having some issues with my manager. 

Things at this stage to highlight are;

- it was advertised hybrid, 2 days in the office a week
- travel
- My manager has always been very open with the fact he never actually wanted to be a manager, it was sort of ‘put upon him’
- it’s now DevOps
- he is very hot and cold, I find him very hard to read and to be honest, I don’t think we have a very good relationship
- my girlfriend is pregnant

There’s a lot to unpack, so let’s work through it.
—————-
Remote working:
(To preface, I have no issue with going into the office, I live a 5 minute drive away, I’m just more concerned about the “bar changing”.)

- 2 days in the office, or “whatever” based on managers discretion

So, it’s well known within IT, that it’s a role that can mostly be done remotely, especially in this role, as we don’t provide any on-site IT support, and our Linux servers are in the cloud. Generally, IT, from my experience are kind of an exception to the rule of “you need to be in X days”, and it was strongly hinted by the IT Manager, that it was the case in this role too. 

I was told we would initially be in the office together (me and my manager), every day, for 2 weeks. Fine. It then moved to a further 2 weeks. It then moved to “the foreseeable”. It then moved to mid-May, and having challenged him on it yesterday, it’s now two days for the foreseeable. Again, not a problem, I just don’t like having the goal posts changed from underneath me.
—————-
Travel
Again, not really an issue for me, but something that was not advertised on the JD, I think it was brought up lightly in the interview of “are you OK with travel”. But now it’s - “It would be good” in some circumstances to go to the Brussels office once, twice (max) a year (we’re advertising it as a choice, but we want you to go, so you’ll go).

Also, doesn’t say anything about travel or a “second location” in my contract.
—————-
Manager not wanting to be a manager/Dev Ops:
This is quite a big one, and I think where a lot of the frustration comes from. He has told me a few times that he “doesn’t believe in the hierarchical structure of business”. Okay, great?. The vibe that I get is that he’s resenting being my manager. He saw my CV, I was open to the fact that this is a big side step in my career, in the interviews, and that I had very little experience in “it’s now DevOps”. I think he resents the fact he’s needed to spend a bit more time helping out, than he’d have liked.

Now, he’s very much the type of person who would say “I’m here if you need help”, but then when asked, would say “read the docs ☺️”. Which isn’t very useful, because I’ve already read the documentation, and need further clarification. I mean, I’ve got this far in IT, does he think this is my first IT job?

I believe that so far, we’ve had some fairly passive aggressive and toxic communication via Teams IM, and I put it down to his frustration with not wanting to be a manager. So much so I had to walk away from my desk for 10 minutes before I “laid into” him.
—————-
Pregnant girlfriend
Nothing else really to add here, other than the fact it ain’t just that I’ve got to think about anymore, so whatever decision I make, it’s gotta be thought through. It’s well documented with the firm, and she’s due in a months time.
—————
From a personal perspective, I am stuck on what to do, as I am the sole income for my soon-to-be baby, my girlfriend, and our dog. I don’t know whether to just stick it out and deal with the passive aggressive toxicity, or brave it and look for something else. IMO, if it’s going to be consistent and not improve, it’s not worth it.

I do have a feeling that our relationship will get easier, as I am more comfortable in the role - but should I wait to see if that’s the case?

If I quit, it’s because of him, not because of the role itself.

TL;DR - job isn’t what it was advertised, boss never really wanted to be a boss, communication is fairly passive aggressive and toxic. Do enjoy the role. Not sure what sto do.

1cnoxjn,Where to go from here?,"Hi everyone!

I’ve been in the Automotive industry since I was 20 (now 32), primarily as a Service Advisor (a couple years as a Service Manager). In October, 2020, I started a new position as a “Fixed Operations Implementation Consultant”, with a base pay of $61,000 annually.

We were bought out by another company in 2022, and a few people that were hired on after the buyout started out at 70,000, some even more. I got a raise of $2,500 shortly after and I didn’t bother to ask for a more at the time because I really didn’t care, and my manager and I did not get along well.

Long story short, I was finally able to land a new position through an internal transfer as an Implementation Coordinator! I was incredibly excited, until I heard what the pay was….. $70,000.
I feel that is incredibly low for what my responsibilities will be, and also feel they just looked at my current salary and said “bump him up a bit”. I feel a little taken advantage of, to be honest. I did ask him if the salary was negotiable, with a “No.”

Despite the disappointment, I plan on using this new position to increasing my skillset, and using it to my advantage in the future. I wanted to vent a little because it’s kinda BS, but I’m also looking at the bright side of things - no more travel! Fully remote, Monday through Friday.

Anyone care to share their opinion/any career advice moving forward? Thanks!

1cnnv1w,How do I approach a remote work situation with my boss,"

Looking for advice and guidance as to how I should approach this situation and question with my boss. I work in a position where I manage ordering for a large group of heavy equipment dealerships. My job can be done completely remote, as I occasionally work from home. But normally I am in an office M-F. 

My wife just finished up grad school and is set to start making significant money this fall of almost $80K a year. I currently make around $65K after overtime. We were just approved for a first time homebuyer loan, something we have dreamed about for some time now. We found a place we like, however we are yet to go under contract or set a closing date.

Here is the catch. We want to move to my hometown which is about an hour west of where we currently live, and around an hour and a half from where I currently work. I would love to keep my current position and transition to a remote work role, or a hybrid scenario where I am in the office once a week or a few times a month. We have other employees at my company who are 100% WFH full time. So part of me thinks it’s possible, but I’m hesitant as to how to approach this. (Wife’s new job is 100% work from home)

Do I wait until we go under contract on a home to bring the question up to my boss, wait until closing, or do I say something now? We don’t want to raise our son where we currently live now that my wife is done with school. And both of us agree that a job shouldn’t be the overall deciding factor on where we want to live and our long term happiness. 

I am afraid of saying something too early, am told no to my question, and they start to silently prepare for my departure. Then they find a way to let me go prior to closing and we lose our home loan. Worst case scenario is I keep my job and commute 3 hours round trip daily while searching for a different role elsewhere.

1cnnpdb,New to corporate world and job and I am being asked to help reorganize organization,"Hi

I recently started a new job. This is a new position for me and kindof for the company. I have previous work experience adjacent to the role but accepting this role was a big jump. This is my first time working for a private corporation, previously worked for state and fed government and for myself. The role existed before I started with high turnover- less than a year. The job description wasnt very clear and I now understand this to be because the company is still defining roles. 

A little before I started the company started attempting to reorganize and try to redefine a new system of business. At the same time I started at a very busy time. These past few weeks I am preparing for a big presentation that is a big part of my role. This has lead me to be working extremely hard to make up for the high turnover, lack of organization, existing communication, all while trying to learn my job with little onboarding and support. 

With the reorganization my coworkers are asking me to play a direct role in building the new system. I am intimidated by my lack of experience and fear speaking out about anything will put my job in danger which I desperately need. 

How can I navigate this request and feel confident in the asks I need when I don't know what those are and these is so much history to wade through? I try to keep myself separated from the previously existing politics but without a new way to move forward it continously weighs on me and my ability to do my job. My boss is also new and is positive and great but hard to get help for concrete solutions, also making it more difficult to bring things to him or provide a space to talk through things. We've talked through some things but I'm still so new and when I bring up concerns or ideas, they are not heard. There is not another place or person that I know I should be going too. But I've kind of been directed to ask people and ask around about figuring out what support would help me do my job more but I am so stressed about my job and current responsibilities I push it off. After this presentation I should have more time but I could potentially be damaging relationships now. 

I need advice on how to stay professional and stand up for myself by finding a way to ask for help constructively without jeopardizing my job. The high turnover rate is from both people getting fired and others leaving. It's intimidating.",saltofthe3arth,1,1.0,1,1715225640,2024-05-09 03:34:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cnnpdb/new_to_corporate_world_and_job_and_i_am_being/,5,2024

1cnmca0,How can I leave on good terms,"I have been with this company for just under a decade in charge of accounting. It has been rough, and we run lean so the workload never dies down. We recently went through a sale and have new owners. As part of that sale, I made a nice bonus, like nice enough to not work for a while. Meanwhile, I’m tired of being overwhelmed, stressed out and not seeing enough of my kids. My boss could sense it and bluntly asked if I was staying, in which I replied I was sticking around to get a feel of how our new private equity owners are going to run this and I’m curious to see what the next long term equity incentive looks like. The news of the new equity grant is out, and it’s not great for me, and so my boss came in again today to ask if I’m staying. And he kept saying things like “you owe me a long transition period if you do leave” and “you owe me a decision and if you decide to stay it needs to be a year.” It felt very confrontational. And frankly, everytime he said “you owe me” it was really having the opposite effect on my idea of staying. Well, I talked it through with my partner and we decided I should leave, we need to do what’s best for my health and the family and I can’t bear to keep working these hours until another sale in 5 years. But this transaction has meant a lot of work went to the way side, the team is stressed out and we wee on survival mode. The position below me has quit already and is open. I would like to leave having filled and trained all the open positions, implementing software changes and catching up on backlog…but I just don’t think I can get there, even in like 6 months. How can I propose an exit plan that makes me feel okay that I tried to repair things as best as I could but gets me out of there in 4-6 weeks before I break? How can I shake the guilt of leaving? And how do I explain that I don’t feel like I owe anyone a explanation, commitment or long transition?!

1cnm913,Is this even remotely reasonable?,"
I just came on as a Sr Account Executive for a new company. 50 different countries. Large US presence. 

I came on with a base of $60,000 but I quickly realized I’m doing 3-4 people’s jobs. Instead of SDR’s I’m making all the cold calls and sending cold emails. No warm leads. I’m doing inside sales and all the paperwork that comes with closing. I’m submitting all my own orders and dealing with any errors when they get kicked back to me from admin. And I’m doing account management and everything post sales including PAR’s.  

I started with a few accounts but a bunch of large ones already attrited from the territory because of poor management by the reps and leadership before me. In addition, the largest account in my territory was READY to attrit when I came on but because I singlehandedly fixed a billing issue they’d been having for nearly 2 years they’re ready to let me name their firstborns. Im only just now getting it under control after 5 months. 

I don’t really get paid for any of that. The billing issue for example was all created by the people before me and 3 or 4 different people couldn’t figure it out before I came on. I get paid on sales, not fixing admin issues. Sure, it will lead to sales eventually but so far in the first 5 months that I’ve been on, Ive been dealing with inefficient internal processes and teams that don’t even know how to use the tools I’m being told I’m supposed to use. 

Finally. I’ve closed 2 deals but they were small and because of internal issues one of the two took 4 weeks to close. Technically the asset hasn’t even shipped yet so it’s not even final. And don’t get me started with the CRM as old as the dawn of the internet. 

TLDR: Comp plans are coming out any day now and I want to use this feather in my hat to negotiate a higher base. I haven’t been able to progress any deals or do the business development I want because of all the unpaid admin. Is pushing for a $90-95kk base here crazy? I cant pay my bills with the $60k im making now and there are zero meaningfully sized deals happening any time soon.

1cnm8yz,Can quitting your job be worth it?,"**Has anyone quit a job they kind of like to work on furthering their career?**

I am (25F) currently working as a surgical tech in a surgery center making $30 hr (starting at $28, 2 years ago) and I really enjoy it most days. However, my hours dwindled to about 60 hours biweekly for the past year. It never reached 80 hours since I worked there (2.5 years). I found out I lost out on $8,000 with all my hours cut this past year. However, my average workday 7am-2pm, which I enjoy having the extra free time at home. My husband works in IT and says that he is comfortable where I am to afford our life... for now. (As Dinkwad we don't have kids)

I have been thinking about the future and my grandmother said to never rely on a man to provide as you do not know what the future holds. The people who have worked at the company long-term are having trouble retiring, are paid only a few dollars more than I. On top of that we want to have kids which the many moms are able to go per diem which is a plus, however, they get called off constantly. I don't know if I can see myself there in 10-15 years.

I have a bachelors in Healthcare science and I was thinking on going back to school for my masters degree. (Another thing I could use advice on) My workplace does not offer assistance and once I get my masters there is no position for me to move into. Most jobs that are hybrid/WFH (which I am aiming for) are going to be a slight pay cut. I would work 80 hours to get $50,000. Where recently I have been working less hours and got $50,000 (I work overtime some days at a bonus rate). I am scared to leave my job because this is my first career that I kinda do enjoy, but I feel like I can do more! ANY advice is helpful!

1cnm7cn,"24, some success but no path","I’ve worked primarily in remote roles (covid really made things weird) for early stage start ups in industries like data and finance. I’ve always been the first true sales hire mainly doing technical stuff like growth hacking and creating systems, but solid at cold calling w/ small glimmers of closing experience. I like balancing introverted and extroverted stuff. 

Helped generate ~4m revenue in 2 years at my last role and watched them grow headcount about 10x before leaving. Not sure if common / fair, but I think my equity would be worth maybe 100k if they reached a 1B valuation (felt scammed with dilution, golden handcuffs, etc). I’ve been able to get my salary to around 85k-120k but still feel broke / insecure.

Without going into too many details, I think I got bait and switched at my new role - things just feel off. I’m now at a weird point in life reflecting on what to do. I’ve made a lot of sacrifices almost burned out so much I’m considering just leaving sales for maybe an operations role. That way I can relax, focus on things like dating and enjoy life. Thing is I don’t feel complete / the best version of myself yet.

In any job I’ve had I always resented authority. Sometimes when I interview I get vibes that the hiring manager is intimidated by me. Always been entrepreneurial. I’m ADHD so I need challenging and creative work. With that I usually don’t find too many people amusing and I’m an INFJ so I just read through all the tiring bullshit too easily. Im also really competitive with an athletic background, so I just feel the need to absolutely shit on others if they rub off the wrong way (staying humble / quiet though, letting results speak). But I don’t like the competitive stuff really when emotions come into play.

All these start ups out there don’t really fascinate me either, everything just looks like cheap cardboard. Nothing seems like a sustainable or innovative idea. AI makes things less impressive as well. I don’t even know what working at a larger company would look like or if my skills would even translate, that doesn’t seem exciting either. I don’t know how to find someone respectable enough I’d want to work for and generally just don’t trust others.


I’m a lil crazy yes. but what do I do? So many questions ……

How do I network with people when I only find 0.5% of people interesting? How do I find people smarter than I am? How can I find others who can help bring ideas together?

How do you search for meaningful work while always being held down by a paycheck?

Are sales people always hopping around? Is sales worth the stress and insecurity? What careers are good to pivot to?

Is it possible to work for others you can actually learn things from?

Is progressing in a career path / role while adding new seniority accolades to your LinkedIn possible, worth it? Is that a satisfying life 

How do you make entrepreneurial leaps in the age of AI, when everything seems saturated? 

Anyhow if anyone can tap into my brain or relate would love some advice 😂

1cnluk0,"When approaching a recruiter on LinkedIn, do you mention the job you're interested in right away or start a general conversation and move onto mentioning the role later? ","Additional context: 

* This is an existing 1st connection on LinkedIn.
* Asking for my sister who refuses to make a Reddit account, so I can answer some clarifying questions but probably not all. :) 
* The now-recruiter was once my sister's co-worker, but they were never close and they only overlapped at the company for about 2 months (it's possible she many not even remember my sister, from the sounds of it). 
* Job is at the recruiter's new company, which is my sister's dream company. It doesn't look like the connection is the recruiter specifically for the area of the business that's hiring for this role (i.e. she's likely not actually the assigned recruiter). 

  
In this case, it is better to check in socially or ask to generally talk about how she likes the company? Or should my sister jump right in and share that she came across the job post and would love to hear if they're still looking for candidates or if someone might be open for a chat to share more about the position? 

This will be the first time she's trying to utilize a connection on LinkedIn for a job so any advice would be great. None of my jobs have come from networking, so I'm hoping some crowd-sourced knowledge here will be helpful for her!

1cnlt71,Tips/advice for Potential first career opportunity?,"I’m currently undergoing a complex 5 stage hiring process, and so far I’ve been passing the stages. 
This would be my first direct marketing/consulting job If hired. From the experience and confidence in the talent I’ve developed, I think this would be a great fit for me career wise. But I’m curious if this would be considered a career, and any advice for either this industry/position. I may just be overthinking it, but if I land this job (based on interview process it seems promising I might) it would be the foundation of my financial independence.

The new opportunity I’m currently interviewing for a consultant strategist (marketing/revenue) position with the focuses on data-driven email marketing. I’d consider this my first career-like position if hired . ($70k+ salary) And with where I’m at in life, that salary would change my financial state. I’m in my early-mid twenties, under my parents roof, funding my own education, and barely about to complete my associates degree from a community college I’ve attended for 4 years(I feel behind).

Little background:

I’ve been employed working for various jobs since 16/yo. I have about 5-6 years in sales experience, 4-5 in service industry, and about 2 years in leadership / management (service industry). My previous position contained most of my marketing/consulting experience as I was hired to take on one of the largest cities in the US solo under my industry.
Long story short, it basically felt like I did a little bit of everything (inside/outside sales lead, account management,customer support,marketing, analyst, etc.)I excelled in this role basically because yeah I basically worked 5+ positions for the same pay, but mainly because I see it gained experience and self growth. I’ve transformed my skills in adaptability and analytics into talents resulting me to excel in every line of work I commit to.
I’ve been let go due previous company going under which explains why I’m job searching.

Although my degree may not be marketing/consulting, I feel pretty confident I can excel in this role if offered the position. I dislike traditional sales, but consulting seems more where I’d appreciate doing as I’m providing solution based services, etc.

Again I may be overthinking things but the hiring process of this company has me both excited and overwhelmed. I’ve completed 2.5/5 stages so far. 
It’s an interesting yet innovated process and if I continue pass each stage I should receive an offer by the end of next week. Even if I don’t get the offer I think this industry suits my skills and talent.

I know in asking for tips/advice but at this rate anything helps. Thank you! If you need more details ask me! I wanted to keep this post “short”

1cnkz6x,PM/ ERP Implementation advice?,"Hey all! Looking for some advice/guidance.

Backstory: I recently left a fairly small company in a very niche construction industry where, due to my competence and high turnover, I was made responsible for many different roles simultaneously. At the end of my time there, I was managing the entirety of operations(purchasing, inventory, logistics, & production). In addition, over the past few years I was the lead for a full ERP implementation then to optimization and management of the system (among other side projects I would take on). I have no formal project management training nor am I a tech savvy person(but more than the typical person in the industry) but found it the ERP implementation very exciting and enjoyable. 

I am currently talking to a company in the same industry that is FAR more advanced technologically and growing extremely rapidly. After I explained my past experience to them, the conversation shifted as they realized the bigger impact I could make as they are looking to implement a new ERP software as well. I really enjoyed this process in my last role and I am very excited about the potential for this new position. I will likely have another conversation with them next week to talk more details and would like to have a better plan and be able to speak more intelligently in the interviews. 

I was already looking into getting my PMP cert but on top of that would like any advice into programs or courses that might help me get a better grasp on “proper” procedures for implementing an ERP system so I can be successful in the role.

1cnkyxh,Help a high school girl with anxiety pick her future major and career?,"Hi all! I'm from Toronto, Canada. I'll be applying to university programs this December. I enjoy maths and physics, so ideally I'd like to major in something which involves that. I like Olympiad/puzzle type of math if that's relevant.

My goal is to find a career I don't hate, and can help me retire as early as possible. I want to maximize the amount of money I make with my career choice because I view work as a means to an end. I've also looked into managing my personal finances, the importance of investing, retirement savings, and how to start with that in Canada, so I don't need a lecture on that lol.

I have very high grades, have coded some personal projects, and have a part-time office job (...which my parents did help me get lol.) 

The current career paths I've been considering are: 

- Computer engineering, and get a master's degree in math or CS with hopes of landing a job within quantitative finance (real ambitious and probably unrealistic, I know). I say this because I'm hoping a bachelors in CE keeps my options more open than a bachelors in CS. Especially given the current job market. I also enjoy hardware, circuitry, and robotics so I'm not opposed to doing more low-level stuff within CE. Some Canadian universities also don't make you choose between electrical and computer engineering until third year, which gives me time to bail out into EE if even CE becomes too saturated.

- Civil engineering, and hope to get a job within mining. I like that civil engineering has quite low unemployment rates and seems to be a relatively stable industry. Mining engineers, on average, also seem to get paid well. I'm fine with working odd shifts, being in remote locations and having to relocate frequently. 

- Take a gamble with CS (not even sure if I can get into Waterloo/UofT because of how competitive it is). Believe me, I completely understand that a degree in CS will not guarantee me a high paying job. I know the important of internships, personal projects, etc. But the field has gotten so competitive, and I fear being unemployed or underpaid grunt work for the rest of my career. 

I've been having a lot of anxiety over the fact that I don't think I have any passions and I don't know what I'm doing with my life lol.

1cnj6lh,Urgent Advice Needed: Brother-in-Law Harassed at Work - Quit Job - But Regrets It.,"Hey Reddit fam,

I'm in need of some serious advice regarding a situation that's been weighing heavily on my mind lately. Here's the deal: My brother-in-law (let's call him Tom), who is only 19, and I both work for the same company. Recently, we hosted a birthday party for the owner of the company outside of work hours. Sounds like a fun time, right? Well, not quite.

During the party, something happened that has left Tom feeling incredibly uncomfortable and upset. A guy in a lead position at our company thought it would be funny to grab and squeeze Tom's butt. Now, Tom is quite shy and skinny, and he didn't retaliate or say anything at the time. He simply walked away, feeling humiliated and violated.

The aftermath of this incident has been devastating for Tom. He's been fuming with anger and embarrassment every time he sees this person at work. It got to the point where he couldn't take it anymore, so he quit his job. He was too ashamed to explain the real reason for his resignation.

However, after talking to his sister (my partner) and me, Tom finally opened up about how he's been feeling. He's struggling with emotions he's never experienced before, and he desperately wants his job back. More than that, he wants management to take appropriate action against the person who harassed him.

Here's the latest development: The perpetrator of the harassment incident actually admitted his guilt via text message to Tom. Shocking, right? Tom was so taken aback that he didn't even reply to the message.

To make matters worse, there are multiple witnesses who saw the harassment take place. So there's solid evidence to support Tom's claims.

Given these new developments, Tom is feeling a bit more hopeful about the possibility of resolving the situation and getting his job back. But we're still unsure about how to proceed. Should we take this evidence directly to management? Or should Tom confront the perpetrator again, now armed with proof of his guilt?

We want to make sure we handle this situation in the most effective and professional way possible. Any further advice or insights you have would be incredibly valuable.

Thanks again for your support and guidance.",Neegex,0,0.33000001311302185,2,1715212092,2024-05-08 23:48:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cnj6lh/urgent_advice_needed_brotherinlaw_harassed_at/,5,2024
1cnj0zm,"Career Change for a Caring, Extraverted People Pleaser?","
26F & still haven’t found a job that I want to stick with. I most recently worked as an in-person personal trainer and tried to transition to online in hopes it would give me that entrepreneurial freedom. I decided that I don’t want the thing I love to become the thing that stresses me out so I put that on the back burner and became a server. I make good money doing this as I excel in fast paced work environments & am really good with people. However, I don’t want this to be my forever job. I have gone back to school many times and I’m considering it again. I originally did a year at a community college to be an Elementary teacher, and have switched majors a couple times since.
Connecting, caring, and making people laugh has always come so naturally to me. I am also a people pleaser so I have always been very in tune with other people’s emotions & tend to put them first. Some fields I have thought about are…

Therapy - Lots of my family members struggle with their mental health. My younger brother is also currently battling OCD. It is pretty severe and we haven’t had many people who show they care and try to find him help. This has made me consider getting into the field.

Nursing - I get a kick out of running around and being as efficient as possible & I love helping others. However, I really value my health and would not want to do overnights; as well, I need time to eat a full meal. I also have been advised not to do nursing by some nurses so… 

Working at recovery center - My dad is an alcoholic

Social Work

The lifestyle I want is to be able to take trips to go hike & stuff with my boyfriend. So having weekends off would be ideal as well as PTO.",itgivinganonymous,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1715211653,2024-05-08 23:40:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cnj0zm/career_change_for_a_caring_extraverted_people/,5,2024

>Her: “Oh so is the apartment no good? You only like the location?”

>Me: “I’m doing pretty well. It helps that we have some third party vendors to work with for help. I like the collaboration.”

>Her: “And because it’s less responsibility for you.”

 I’m becoming friends with a coworker and HR manager suddenly and intensely came up to me while I was in line at a work function:

>Her: “Hey, [coworker friend] wants to cut in front of you.”

>Me: Im Confused so I start looking around me but I don’t spot my friend. 

>Her: (reiterates) “[Coworker friend] wants to cut in front of you. Will you let her?”

>Me: I’m increasingly confused but I say “….sure?” Still looking in the crowd for coworker friend. 

Then she says “it was a joke” and immediately changes the subject.

Am I insane? It feels like she’s always twisting my words or testing me.

1cni1ib,Laid off last year and finally got an offer but I’m struggling with it ,"I was laid off in late 2023 and obviously it’s been a terrible market, especially for someone who works in talent acquisition.  I’ve been contracting for an old colleague since but part time and I don’t know how long it will last. I’ve applied to so many places and finally got 2 interviews last week. 

Job 1 was more money, 5x per month in office, and a growth opportunity to do something slightly different.  job 2 was a pay cut, 2-3x a week in office, a familiar culture with a boss I like, seems like there’s growth opportunity, but it’s also a job I’ve done for many years. 

Of course I got an offer for job 2 and while I felt kind of excited, I’m starting to spiral a bit more because I have a dog who can’t be left home alone so now on top of making less money, I have to pay for daycare (that she also doesn’t like) and I’m doing a job that I’ve already done at 2 other companies (and I’ll have a lower title than I have had).

1cnhvj1,"24, some success but no path","I’ve worked primarily in remote roles (covid really made things weird) for early stage start ups in industries like data and finance. I’ve always been the first true sales hire mainly doing technical stuff like growth hacking and creating systems, but solid at cold calling w/ small glimmers of closing experience. I like balancing introverted and extroverted stuff. 

Helped generate ~4m revenue in 2 years at my last role and watched them grow headcount about 10x before leaving. Not sure if common / fair, but I think my equity would be worth maybe 100k if they reached a 1B valuation (felt scammed with dilution, golden handcuffs, etc). I’ve been able to get my salary to around 85k-120k but still feel broke / insecure.

Without going into too many details, I think I got bait and switched at my new role - things just feel off. I’m now at a weird point in life reflecting on what to do. I’ve made a lot of sacrifices almost burned out so much I’m considering just leaving sales for maybe an operations role. That way I can relax, focus on things like dating and enjoy life. Thing is I don’t feel complete / the best version of myself yet.

In any job I’ve had I always resented authority. Sometimes when I interview I get vibes that the hiring manager is intimidated by me. Always been entrepreneurial. I’m ADHD so I need challenging and creative work. With that I usually don’t find too many people amusing and I’m an INFJ so I just read through all the tiring bullshit too easily. Im also really competitive with an athletic background, so I just feel the need to absolutely shit on others if they rub off the wrong way (staying humble / quiet though, letting results speak). But I don’t like the competitive stuff really when emotions come into play.

All these start ups out there don’t really fascinate me either, everything just looks like cheap cardboard. Nothing seems like a sustainable or innovative idea. AI makes things less impressive as well. I don’t even know what working at a larger company would look like or if my skills would even translate, that doesn’t seem exciting either. I don’t know how to find someone respectable enough I’d want to work for and generally just don’t trust others.


I’m a lil crazy yes. but what do I do? So many questions ……

How do I network with people when I only find 0.5% of people interesting? How do I find people smarter than I am? How can I find others who can help bring ideas together?

How do you search for meaningful work while always being held down by a paycheck?

Are sales people always hopping around? Is sales worth the stress and insecurity? What careers are good to pivot to?

Is it possible to find a mentor I could learn and work for, if so how?

Is progressing in a career path / role while adding new seniority accolades to your LinkedIn possible, worth it? Is that a satisfying life 

How do you make entrepreneurial leaps in the age of AI, when everything seems saturated? 

Anyhow if anyone can tap into my brain or relate would love some advice 😂

I answered the questions on May 1st during the morning.
Shortly after this interaction I saw that the position was taken out (but my application is still as accepted/under reviewing on the platform) so I'm unsure of this is due to enough applicants or due to it being filled?

Looking for some resignation advice. My situation is tricky because I’m employed by one company and embedded within another company, very far away.

I want to put in my notice, but don’t know the most professional way to do it long distance. Do I write it via email and mail a hard copy? If so, do I include HR?

1cndzqw,I want to switch my career to CS,"Hello,

I'm a Translation Studies student about to graduate. I picked this major cause I didn't know what I wanted to do, took me a long time. I thought language skills may come in handy at any job. I'm not so sure how logical that decision was but I had panic attacks during exams so didn't have much of a choice back then. 

I realized that my dream was to make video games all along. I love drawing and singing. I also learned some photoshop. I don't wanna be a translator anyway. Some info about me:

- I can do maths and science. I can learn if I need to, my only issue was panic attacks caused by horrible teachers and uncertainty about my future. 
- No loans whatsoever, my education was free.
- Masters might not be a choice since I don't have a STEM background. Do I have to do Bachelor's? Would you recommend any online courses that aren't too expensive? I'm from a country where its currency isn't valuable.
- I have free access to Coursera courses thanks to my university but I heard they were useless.
- The most logical way to go about this, in my opinion, is to do master's in a related degree to my field. I think working in my field for a while and finding a good online certificate for CS is the most risk-free option.

Please help. Everyone says that I shouldn't go back to school and I can't blame them. However, I'm miserable. I feel depressed every single day because I feel like I ruined my life. I would appreciate any sort of advice. Thanks in advance.

1cndxib,Boss is taking a month off and asking me to take over here duties. Thoughts? ,"So pretty much what the title says. My boss is going to be out for 4 weeks and she wants to train me to do her job. I understand that work needs to get done, but I literally started this year and make about 16 dollars an hour. Also, I'm not a receptionist and I have my own job to complete, which can be pretty hectic on its own. I'm the only other person in our office (it's a super small office) so there's no one else to share the work load. There is a main office in the next city over, but all the upper management workers over there seem to think I will be taking over my boss's role while she's gone. They haven't said this to me directly, but it's what my boss is telling me that are saying.

So what do you think? Should I say something? Ask for more pay? If it makes a difference, my boss is regularly absent and leaves early almost daily. I think upper management is somewhat aware of this. I just feel like I'm doing lots of things outside my job description (and in my boss's) and receiving no compensation for it. I'm looking for another job, this is just the situation currently. Any advice is appreciated!

1cncgna,Just got fired as an Architectural technologist and thinking of trying something new,"
So I’ve been working as a technologist for 2 years in canada with a bachelor of architectural technology from the uk. However this degree doesn’t exist in Canada, so I’m thinking of going into something different away from the construction industry. I wouldn’t mind going into a masters programme as well to try something new. Would have to be in Edmonton,Alberta or entirely online. I’m open to suggestions and advice. 

The role of a technologist is not for me and taking the architecture route can take time before you start earning. Background: I’m 24 years old so i think nows the perfect time to look into a career change and try something new. If I can jump into something else right away works great for me too.

Reason as to why i got fired? I wasn’t told but i have the least amount of experience in the firm and I’m a recent hire. They just hired a technologist with 8years experience so i assume that they’re a bang for their buck. Grateful for this opportunity so want to make the most out of it.

1cnc0my,Possibly Getting in Trouble for Small Talk at the Office?,"Writing on here with a throwaway account because I don't want this tracing back to my other accounts. I work at a relatively medium sized nonprofit as a coordinator and frankly, its been struggling in many aspects.

With this, its been extremely tense the office and it is very palpable. For my occupation, I speak with managers and to some extent their staff to understand how their employment capacity is like on a regular basis. While doing this I made a friend along the way, which to me is a great thing because I also am not from the area I am working in and I'm able to speak with someone about things outside of work.

I stop by her office sometimes to talk about non-work related things for less than 5 minutes. Nothing malicious is ever said while we're on the work premises because I'm not stupid enough to do that and its usually small talk (how she's been doing, how her family's been, etc.) just so I can get through the last leg of the day. 

I guess I do it often enough for one of upper management to see and pointed it out to someone else who let me know about it but I feel its a bit extreme to get to this point. My nonprofits office environment is notorious for separating management with their staff and as someone whose technically within both spaces, I think this will just add on to that sentiment.

For context this is my first time working in a nonprofit and I never had issues with my previous office jobs about having a bit of small talk with colleagues so I guess I'm just out here asking to see if anyones had to deal with this before? Every day lately just feels like I have to keep looking over my shoulder because anything I say or do gets back to upper management and the small things I do throughout the day seems like a thorn on their side.

There's definitely more to unpack but I don't really want to reveal too much in case someone finds this but I guess some advice or opinions on this would be helpful to see if I'm in the wrong or not.

1cnbxj9,Should you ask for a promotion if you’ve technically not “accomplished” anything?,"A little back story. 
  
I joined this team (IT field) last year as a total noob but was promised I’d be taught and caught up to speed. The team was just myself and my boss who promised to teach me. 
  
Fast forward and at the end of the year my boss quit and my company gave me a crack at running the whole show. They allowed me to hire an offshore engineer to assist with technical tasks that were either above my skillset or I just didn’t have time for as they specifically asked me to focus on the big picture stuff. 
  
I am getting excellent reviews and really doing very well for someone with next to no experience. However I am very stressed nearly all the time and everything requires tons of research and self learning to accomplish. I’m trying to survive as long as I can to gain the experience and knowledge. 
  
I want to ask for a title change and a raise since I’ve taken on 10x the role and responsibility but I can’t really say I’ve “accomplished” anything yet. I did save the company about $400k annually, and I have a few changes/improvements in progress but nothing finished. 
  
My boss that left had a full manager title and was paid likely twice as much as me, easily. I make $80k/year and have an administrator title. 
  
I’d like to ask for a “lead” title as I am the leader of the team and I’d like to ask for a salary at or over $100k. 
  
My apprehension is because it’s been nearly 6 months and I don’t have any like “wow!” accomplishments, just that nothing has exploded and I am setting up the steps necessary to start moving our environment in the right direction (upgrades, optimization, clean up, etc), but still very much in the planning stage. 
  
Also my apprehension is the company is not doing well financially. We didn’t get merits this year and our budgets are being slashed across the board. Every penny spent is being scrutinized. So maybe there is no money for me or maybe my bosses will get mad I even asked knowing we have no money. But I want to hope they are being honest when they say I’m crushing it and would want to make sure I stay. Or they could hire someone else more expensive than me. Or honestly outsource the team but they had the opportunity to do that when my old boss left and they didn’t want to.

1cnbtjr,Which University for Future Career and Life?,"I am currently at a crossroads, I have been accepted to Mcgill University for the Bachelor of Science program, which in the second year my plan is to declare a computer science major, and I have also been accepted to the University of Edinburgh Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science BSc. I am an international brazilian student. My doubts lie in which of both universities could lead me in a better way to my future goals. After my undergraduate degree I want to do a masters at a top US university, my favorite candidates are Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Caltech, UC Berkeley or UPenn. Moreover, I want to live in the US, more specifically the bay area due to it's high concentration of talent and opportunity. While doing my undergraduate and masters, I wish to get work experience and also tinker with some business ideas, because after finishing my masters, my end goal is to start a successful tech company. The curriculum of the University of Edinburgh course seems more hollistic and to be better, but I fear Mcgill may have better connections to these American Universities as well as better job and entrepreneurship opportunities due to it being at Montreal, a way bigger city than Edinburgh. Also, it would be ideal to make money while I am studying, be it through work or entrepreneurship, considering I will probably get a student loan for my masters. In general, considering my goal to understand Computer Science extremely well, get a masters in one of those 6 universities, go to Sillicon Valley, become a US citizen, start my own company, work and be entrepreneurial while I am at university, which of both paths do you guys think it is better?

On April 30th (evening time) my application was accepted, and she asked me to answer a few questions about the role and previous experiences and mentioned ""and then we can see if the next steps are in order"".
I answered the questions on May 1st during the morning.

Shortly after this interaction I saw that the position was taken out (but my application is still as accepted/under reviewing on the platform) so I'm unsure of this is due to enough applicants or due to it being filled?

Then the whole ‘is this even worth it?’ question came about. Money doesn’t come easy for me or my family, loans are immensely stressful if I want to buy a house one day with my partner, and I don’t want to spend a bajillion dollars and years, to go to school for something that is so limiting in career without having to take extensive lengths to diversify my treatment options for clients or whatnot. I have been then reconsidering switching back to Communications, with yet again not a clue what ‘job’ I want. As it can be very versatile in what job options. Nonetheless every job in most fields want years of experience or you can get an entry level job for less than I make right now? I already have college background and am at an AA level right now for credits, just not anything in specific I’m leaning towards a transfer pathway program to transfer into a bachelor’s program, but in what is my struggle. 

I’ve worked with children in early education (considered being a teacher, but again income/they’re basically on strike right now in my state and definitely others), front desk jobs (salons and spas while in high school/college), administrative assistant job for a behavioral health company (current role), and also data entry for a courthouse. I’m very good at the administration job tasks and I truly don’t mind doing it, however making it my career doesn’t sound fully appealing to me? I’m very people skilled, communication and leading or listening, and coming up with solutions to issues come to me with ease. Except of course this issue. I fear having a career that I’m good at, but I dread doing for the rest of my life, and also in today’s economy unfortunately income is definitely a factor. 

How do people find out what they WANT to do? Versus just what they’re GOOD at?

1cn8467,Does a robotics graduate degree open more doors or completely pigeonhole you?,"I'm looking at going to grad school for a Masters in robotics so that I can work in more mechatronics systems design or even something like embedded systems. Theres a good university I'm looking at that has a very programming focused robotics degree, and I am allowed to take electives from the CS and EE department which should be very useful.



The only problem is I'm worried that I won't really be eligible for these roles as I come from a MechE background instead of EE. Would doing this masters overwrite my BSME, making me a candidate for these jobs or is it a terrible idea because I'm just pigeonholing myself to exclusively robotics? My country (NL) doesn't really have a great robotics industry, but honestly MechE is insanely saturated at all levels here and in most of the EU now, so I'm looking to try and move over to electrical related roles without getting a second degree, since its very very in demand right now. I'm hoping this degree also opens me up to software roles if the market ever gets better, but maybe thats just wishful thinking.



What is your guys' experience? Have any of you successfully made the jump to EE/SW from robotics or controls related roles? How likely is it in this market?",umerfreshballs123,1,1.0,1,1715183949,2024-05-08 15:59:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cn8467/does_a_robotics_graduate_degree_open_more_doors/,5,2024

1cn7bw4,I feel so lost idk if I chose the right career,"Hello I’m a graphic designer (24) I turn 25 on august this year and I feel so lost, I feel like I haven’t really figured it out what I really want to do. I genuinely love to design but when I was a student I always told my friends that I was not going to work on agencies or studios and since i graduated (one and half year ago) I been working exactly on those places, tbh I want to be a freelance but everyone told me I need to have experience in a studio before going freelance so that’s what I been doing but all these jobs leave me so burned out. Like I’m just waiting for the day to be over and look forward to the weekends. I was working in part time job and I was working on personal projects and liked it but I was so financially stressed I needed to find a new job and I got it. Well one of my school  friends got it from me but like we’re so different, she always knew she wanted to work in a place like this but I didn’t, and now I feel sad all the time working here. My contract is for three months and I’m like alright, mostly because i need the money and because I don’t want to disappoint my friend idk. But sometimes I wonder if this is the correct path for me. I feel like is too late to change my career entirely and also don’t have the money to do it. I been thinking in a way to keep working in the design world but without being in agencies or studios. I’m really into web design and I do know a little bit of front-ed. Also I’m interested into getting into the music industry with graphic design but I feel like this one is too hard to get into. I just feel like I have no direction and no idea what to do with my life but I feel like I’m too grown to struggle like this. I just want to do something that is gratifying  because what I been doing it really isn’t.

I loved being an environmental scientist but I wasn't paid enough to survive on my own so I made the switch to safety.

1cn7aqe,"My dad lost his job at 62 years old, in the height of his career. He was an executive. Has he aged out of being employed? What more can he do?","This is the first time he's been unemployed in 40 years and was at this company for nearly 9 years before his department was dissolved. Out of 60ish employees, he was one of the last remaining (straight) men still working there (the women in the company and CEO actively discriminated against hiring men, but he was hired and placed there by the parent company) and was the highest paid. It was a miserable place to work but he got paid well for it. 

He was making 280k a year, has won multiple awards for his work over his life and has been featured in several publications. 

He's been applying for jobs for the last month and has only gotten one interview, and I'm worried that when recruiters see the year he got his degree (which is always mandatory in those online forms) vs the most recent job they'll see his age and discriminate, whether on purpose or not. He's only about 5 years away from retirement, and due to unexpected medical bills a few years ago my parents don't have enough to retire now.

He has an extensive network but nothing has manifested through it, and in the last month only got one interview. He’s working with recruiters and his resume has been worked on by them as well. 

If he doesn’t get a job soon we’ll have to sell the house, which is a nightmare scenario for my family. The idea that his incredible career would end on this terrible note is devastating. What more can he do? What can I do? Other than teaching, what other career options are there for people like him if he can’t get a similar position?

1cn76ld,Quitting full time job for masters?,"I (M26) graduated with a bachelors degree in mathematics from UT-Austin back in December 2020. I am currently working in a field completely orthogonal to my degree and I absolutely despise it (I work in tech support, been doing it for almost 2 whole years now). It does not even pay enough to allow me to live independently in my area (I am in Texas near Austin) and it's not something I want to do long term. I currently work remotely and live with my parents.

I recently applied to and got accepted to a middle tier state school for both an M.S. in Computer Science and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering receiving conditional admission at UTSA. CS/Engineering is what I originally wanted to pursue in my undergrad but I failed to get into the program I wanted and it was really competitive to get into.

Going back in time, I probably should have transferred to a university that would give me the opportunity to earn a bachelors degree in these fields. But I wanted to ask if it's worth it for me to change my career before I enter my 30's in this current job market. I've been out of school for almost 4 years so I personally feel that it would be challenging to enter the academic environment again especially in these fields. I also feel that it would strain me financially; I have saved most of my disposable income but it's probably not enough. I luckily graduated undergrad debt free but I'm not sure if I want to take the risk in this job market.

Basically I need help making an informed decision. I feel miserable in my job and I'm not sure if I simply need a career change or if I should just try my luck applying for jobs again even though it's already been nearly 4 years since my bachelors. I also feel like a failure for my STEM degree/school I attended. I know it's up to me at the end but any advice would be extremely appreciated.",LPFanVGC,1,1.0,3,1715181602,2024-05-08 15:20:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cn76ld/quitting_full_time_job_for_masters/,5,2024

1cn4kah,When to follow up with hiring manager?,"I applied for a job around late February/early March. 

* 3/12 Screening interview with recruiter
* 3/22 virtual interview with hiring team
* 4/15 out-of-state, on-site interview and presentation. I was told to give them two weeks post-interview. 
* 4/16 references requested by recruiter; 3 provided
* 4/24 reference #1 contacted by hiring manager- verified positive review
* 5/1 references #2 & #3 contacted by hiring manager - verified positive reviews
* 5/7 Pinged the recruiter inquiring if they were aware of a status update. Silence. 

For the on-site interview, I felt like everything went well and believe that I connected well with the team. After the interview, the hiring manager told me to give them two weeks because they had one last interview to conduct the following week, and to allow for time for their HR process. The post-interview two week mark was roughly around 5/2, a day after they contacted my last two references. 

The cynical interpretation is that I am #2 and they're awaiting a response from #1. The optimistic interpretation is that they have a slow HR process and/or people are out, and that the offer is still coming.

Considering I have already pinged the recruiter, at what point/timeline should I reach out to the hiring manager? Do I need to allow for more time, considering the delay in reaching all of my references?

1cn477z,Nightmare older co-worker (software developer),"I have been working with this 65 year old software developer for a year (I'm half his age). I'm the only other developer in the company. Since day 1, he tried to tell me what to do even though I was hired at the senior level (he doesn't have a senior title but basically is senior). He tells me super basic stuff like ""upload the files in this place"" multiple times, and I just nodded and moved on. It continues to this day, but he will monitor everything I am doing, and ask the manager why I deployed such and such on a certain day, or ask me what I just deployed, like he is somehow my manager. I told the manager, and the manager being a softie just says ""he is usually a nice guy, I doubt he has bad intentions"". I said I don't want this guy micro-managing me, and the manager said ""he just seems to want to communicate with you"". 

First, this coworker criticized a very small issue with one of my scripts relating to a security-related function I built, in which I was using an acceptable method to secure a page, just differently than how he does it. He said ""some offshore developer wrote this weird junk"" and I am not an offshore developer so he will just claim ignorance that it was my code. Then the guy said he wants to review all my code moving forward, so I said back ""you need to let me review your code as well then"", then the manager sent me a message saying neither of us will review each other's code. Later I discussed it all with my manager and my manager just said he would separate us so we wouldn't work together any longer.

On email chains with anyone important, this guy will remove my response when he sends his response right after mine, especially when the CEO is involved or another company. On calls with other companies he presents himself as the lead developer which he is not. He will even steal my questions, as we had vendor reviews and I wrote out a list of well thought out questions, asking them the first meeting, then he would jump in and repeat all my questions with the next vendors so I had nothing else to ask.

Recently, he started nitpicking small things like old files I had left in a directory that I should have deleted (4 files) while he had several files of his own in there at the same time. He will also jump in while I speak on our daily meetings whenever I say something and just ask ""why did you do that?"" or ""what in the world are you talking about?"". My manager just says he is a little rough around the edges or makes an excuse for him, but I get nervous every morning before our calls because it's always so stressful having to be under attack. I have to see his angry red face every time I talk. I think he's so full of rage that I was hired on as senior and that he didn't get the official senior title, honestly.

I have health issues and this makes them a lot worse. I am concerned that he is going to cause heart problems for me or other issues as I am already recovering from a major issue. I told the manager this week about the constant double standards from this guy, because of how he wanted to review my code and not let me review his and how he nitpicks small issues while he does the exact same stuff, and my manager just said ""feel free to call him out every time it happens"". I guess I just have to argue with this guy myself every day, but it's not exactly healthy. Is there a better way of dealing with this?

Honestly, I thought I could had a 5 day in-office job, but I’ve learned that I just don’t enjoy it, especially with a 45 min commute each way.

What’s the minimum amount of time you’d recommend staying at a job?  I’d like to eventually look for a hybrid or full remote role.

I was thinking of maybe even putting in my 2 weeks, going to Europe or Asia for 2-3 months, coming back and start applying for jobs, saying I’m still employed (with a little over a year tenure at that point), and if the prospective jobs asked about contacting my employer as a reference, I could just say no because i “still work there”.

1cn0gd7,5 tactics on LinkedIn to help us land our target job,"Hi - Hope you're doing well in your job hunt (if you're in one)  
We've been working with 1000+ applicants since 2015 and see that there's *still* a lot of LinkedIn features missed. 

Here's 5 easy steps you can take to improve your job hunting -  
1) **Utilize free trials**  
*What to do:*  
 \-Take advantage of free trials for premium features, such as LinkedIn Premium's 1-month free trial when you're actively job hunting.  
\- Set up a reminder to cancel the trial before it ends  


*Why/How it will help:*  
\- Increases the likelihood of a stranger or mutual connection responding and providing a referral on LinkedIn. (tbh - Referrals make a huge difference)  
2) **Faster/Streamlined applications via alerts**  
*What to do:*  
Sort job listings by ""New"" instead of ""Recommended/Relevant""  
Set up job alerts on LinkedIn using a combination of common and unusual keywords related to your desired position  
*Why/How it will help:*  
Guarantees that you're one of the first applicants for new job openings on LinkedIn  
Helps you find unique job opportunities on LinkedIn that others might miss  
Alternatively, it ensured you're not the 205th applicant (or worse) which can happen if we're only applying few days of the week  
3) **Attract the Recruiters -**  
*What to do:*  
Interact with content in your professional domain by liking, sharing, and providing thoughtful comments on posts by Founders, Influencers, and fellow domain members on LinkedIn.  
Share any article, and add a few lines on what you found interesting. You're aiming for discussion here or at the very least some thinking about topics you're fascinated by.  
Recently, you must have started getting notified by LinkedIn to contribute to some posts/questions. Seize those opportunities. Make sure you elevate the discussion and not just outsource that thinking to chatGPT etc like tools!  
*Why/How it will help:*  
Basically helps position you as a person of authority on LinkedIn, someone deeply interested in that domain.  
Increasing your visibility on Google, as LinkedIn posts are indexed  
Reaching 2nd and 3rd level connections and getting to more audiences on LinkedIn. Which can lead to opportunities coming to you.

  
4) **Video resumes - not just for sales/marketers**  
*What to do:*  
Create a 60sec video resume that showcases your goals/strengths quickly  
*Why/How it will help:*  
Helps recruiters better understand your personality compared to a traditional resume  
5) **Active account**  
*What to do:*  
Stay active on job platforms by updating your profile every 3 days with more keywords  
Edit your Indeed, ZipRecruiter etc profiles at least once a day, even if it's just adding a space or changing a spelling  
*Why/How it will help:*  
Increases your visibility in recruiter searches, as most recently active users' pages appear first  
Signals to recruiters that you're actively looking for a job  
A healthy LinkedIn won't pay off immediately, but if you ignore the noise and memes about it being a deteriorating platform, there's value available for you still!",what-you-need-is-you,2,0.6299999952316284,4,1715160863,2024-05-08 09:34:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cn0gd7/5_tactics_on_linkedin_to_help_us_land_our_target/,5,2024
1cmzsl2,Leaving PhD for later returning? What to do during that break?,"Hi all,

I will try to keep it short.. otherwise I don’t get much feedback.

I am on my late 20s and a year and a bit ago I started a STEM PhD in a top uni. I want to leave (bad supervision, depressing working environment and questionable research --> I can explain more in comments).

I am quite positive I am leaving, I do not want this to be my PhD. The question is, what do I do next? Given that I still want to do a PhD and still like research, reading papers, etc. I thought to have a break and then come back. I have 2 approaches: 

1. go to industry. Pros: learning useful skills, getting insights of how industry works for future PhD. Cons: pays less for entry job, not sure if I am learning as much as I imagine if staying 1-2 years
2. go to top consulting. Pros: high salary, dynamic environment, growing other skills. Cons: Just doing PowerPoints might get rusted in math, physics, coding.  No work-life balance

Other constraints pressing on me are the fact that my partner is doing also a PhD. We both have a modest salary (that allows for OK living if you are childfree and renting). If I just switch to another PhD now, I push my finish date 2 years further in the future which starts overlapping with potentially starting a family, buying a house etc.

My thoughts so far were, spend 1-2 years in a high paying job, save as much as possible, apply again for PhD after the break and use flexibility of PhD to start family etc + switch breadwinner roles with my partner (he will have finished his PhD and ideally will be in industry or academia, almost making double).

  
What are your thoughts?  


Thanks!

1cmz716,"I signed a JO letter, would I be still okay if I decided not to continue?","So, I already received a JO letter from this company... I was too shy not to entertain their call regarding their job offer that upon talking through phone I immediately signed the JO letter, and already had an onboarding date finalized.

HOWEVER, I am having doubts on this one.

First, it was explained to me that the job is very strict about punctuality that can lead to termination (which I understand of course) but they have an hour call time before the actual starting time of work and my problem is that it is far from my house, and I had to ride three transport vehicles with my commute and also I need to walk a lot, given our trains in this country.

Second, they mentioned that the job sometimes will require me to work until late hours around 10:00pm.... also to think that I need to wake-up again so early for the commute. The set-up is so tiring that I feel like my body would just give up on this. Given that, I also have to do chores in my house, during my free time. Adding to that, I need to commute via train that usually trains are already closed around that time.

Third, they emphasized the HEAVY workload since it is in the auditing department.

Lastly, in terms of the pay, it is really not rewarding given that the workload is very demanding. Plus, the commute fare.

Now, I am very conflicted with this one. I already signed the JO letter and had onboarding date finalized, can I back out? What are the consequences if I'll back out?

Please give me some advice, harsh truth or kind words. I really need some assurance and guidance. Thank you!",SomeSkill7,1,1.0,0,1715155362,2024-05-08 08:02:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cmz716/i_signed_a_jo_letter_would_i_be_still_okay_if_i/,5,2024
1cmz5h8,I 17F can’t go to college because of my dad,"
I 17f was supposed to go to a trade school soon in about august of 2024. I am going to graduate from highschool in less than a month and i am excited but now im screwed. My parents have been separated for 2 years and my mom didnt get any child support whatsoever, and i live with my mom. I dont stay with my dad because he was a really terrible father growing up, he hurt me mentally and physically, was an alcoholic, was on drugs and had terrible anger issues. 

 Now my main issue is that i am the youngest so everyone has tend to baby me and it’s annoying. No one has taught me how to drive and i am not allowed to get a job. It really sucks and now my Dad is refusing to talk to me because we got into a big argument because he was talking disrespectfully about my mom and i defended her. I tried apologizing and everything to at least make amends even thiugh it wasnt my fault but he told me im “dead to him”. Now my dad isnt paying my mom anything for me and isnt going to help buy me a car or help pay for my college. He has completely stopped helped providing for me and this is why my college, MY CAREER has now been delayed for a year. He makes around 500k a year and owns a trucking company. My mom barely makes 30k a year unfortunately and she cannot provide me a car. She says if i were to get a car that she wont allow me to drive to school since im inexperienced and said im not allowed to drive on the freeway yet. I also refuse to use my moms money because she works so hard for it and can barely provide for me. She says i have hold off on College for a year until she figures out something. 

This whole situation sucks badly. My sister 19f got everything a car and a was able to go to college but she got lazy and dropped out on her own. My dad favorites her because shes the only one who’s sees my dad and she only does this because she scared to tell my dad no. 

My mom and everyone is telling me its too late to get child support since i turned 18 in a few months. Im from California so if anybody knows any laws to help out please let me know. I need advice on what to do and i really dont want to have a gap and my whole career process is about 4-6 years. Any advice you can give i would appreciate it. Sorry for the terrible grammar im extremely stressed, mad, sad and so many emotions.

1cmyw3s,"Art instution realated question - UAE - Do I leave for the promise of a better space, but pay cut :'( ? ","
**tl;dr**: potential job switch with a potential 20-25% pay cut (maaay be negotiable), but possibly a place more aligned with ground-up/grassroots interests, as well as smaller team + more freedom to do things. I have a decent bit of trust the latter is true by virtue of having worked with some of the prospective team, as well as what I've seen them create/do.

This is evidently turned out out more into a rant, but I think a core question is: (esp in art context) I'm at a point where most people would think the institution/position I'm leaving is stupid, esp by virtue of what it could grow to be. The big caveat is that the new prospective position, by vitue of being an institution (albeit of a smaller scale) might still end up having similar issues, in which case... I'm back at square one. But atleast from a preliminary conversation I had with a member there, it feels quite different in terms of intention.

What would you do/ how could I think about this.

- - 



26 year old in my first-ish job. Long story short I've had a string of freelance/interventional roles in various art institutions in the GCC and UAE - and landed on what should be a dream gig on paper. Large name institution, significantly higher pay than usual. However things have been uninspiring and tending on toxic at work. Began as the usual barrage of coming to terms with corporate structure, but over time it's just been a reckoning of feeling like I simply could be using my time better, even at a place where I was recognized and allowed more doing, and maybe also one where there is more transparency between what they claim to want to do, and are actually able to do.

When I try to think this through with most people, I'm unable to put to words anything that sounds unlike just first-time-at-a-desk issues, but I do genuinely think its beyond that. A mix of micromanagement, lack of freedom to actually exercise the role, and general ups and downs in terms of things becoming interesting and actual work is happening, vs weeks of dreary and bureaucratic delay. At the worst of times I once woke up dreaming of our work culture and boss being actually open to critique, listening, and finding ways to balance out immediate requirements vs long term goals, insteead of the constant barrage of urgent requirements/arbitrary requests from all over upper management - only to realize, I literally was dreaming.

Again, most of the advice I get from people I've spoken to (esp since I've only been on the job for 9 months so far, and if I were to move it would be at the 1 year mark) has been around the idea of trying to make use of the access I have through this job, by virtue of its scale and governmental access, to see what ""over performing"" here looks like. In essence thinking of this as an initial place to gain experience in framing things, for instance to meet larger incongrous mandates/interests. Essentially using the access as a way to gain skills for later in life. This feels confusing to me though because:

1. I'm realising that while I'm having access to learning/resources, the scale at which this institution works means I don't end up actually digging into the nitty-gritty, and therefore mostly am gaining executive/administrative skills at best, while only having surface level interactions w the aspects of the institution I'd like to actually learn more about/from.
2. The reason I've brought up toxicity, is because besides individual issues with line-manager's working style (which many people in the team have tried speaking about), it truly does feel like ups and downs - for instance this week where things feel like they're headed in the right direction, I'm more motivated/inspired by the work, but it's these cycles of doing, and then absolute lows where its just some sort of
3. It's not like I had not thought about pivoting style and process, even a few weeks into the job, but it's been simply met with - do as we think is right, or nothing else flies - atleast for the most part.

There's also a lot of really messy things by virtue of specific people/work structures, but since this has become a story of itself (And I suppose for privacy concerns) I won't share too much of that.

But on the flip of all of this, outside of the pay cut, my gut read of the new place seems to be quite positive, in most of these areas (freedom, ability to grow/plan, proper work structure). However there's no guarantee of that, and again... the first response I get from most people is to just stick around. And that just feels so messy :/ I'm hoping for these jobs to allow me to grow together eventually a communal/collective space that can sustain its own making/doing, as opposed to climbing up the art admin ladder, so... idk. idk.",Alive-Camp8442,1,1.0,0,1715154026,2024-05-08 07:40:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cmyw3s/art_instution_realated_question_uae_do_i_leave/,5,2024

1cmxn50,Should I stay if bored?,"Hi! 

I've been working at my current employer for 5 years. I just got vested into our pension plan which is great! I work for a large hospital system, and I can say that I get paid pretty well. I'm a health educator. I live in the Bay area California, and my annual salary is $115,000 Plus around $4,000 in bonus. I am an hourly employee and I'm in a union. Like I mentioned earlier my workplace has a pension and we also have a 401k. I accrue about 19 hours of PTO every month, which is not very difficult to use if I need to or want to use it. And I would say my job is pretty low stress. I'm  also the most skilled person for the topic areas I cover in my team.

So what's the problem?

This job is very non-challenging to me, and I work with patients everyday having very similar conversations. Day in and day out. I also facilitate many of our classes, and it's the same thing everyday. I have a high achiever personality, and I I like the opportunity to get to use my brain and I feel like I haven't used my brain at all in the past 4 years. The reason I didn't leave the company before now was because I was close to being vested at 5 years so I stayed. 

My mother died a year and a half ago and it's changed my whole perception on everything. I feel like I need to live my life more fully and not be so focused on climbing the career ladder. I also recognize that moving up in a company would require me likely to go into management of which I have no interest. It would also cause me likely to become salaried which always comes with working many more hours. Because I'm in the Union currently, there is a strict no overtime rule unless you are paid to do so any volunteer for overtime. 

I feel like on one hand I want a job that I find intellectually stimulating that uses my brain and is more aligned with what I'm interested in. I never wanted to work in clinical health since my passion is public health and they are a bit different. I also don't like how hospitals are in general and I have grown a bit jaded with American healthcare because of this. 

On the other hand I recognize that I do make very good money in a low stress job and I don't want to move up the corporate ladder anymore because I recognize that it will come with increased stress and likely increased workload and likely not that much increase in pay. 

I want to travel the world more often now and I do see that my job allows me flexibility to take PTO whenever. I'm starting to think now that maybe I should just stay at my job even though every day is like...monotonous and un stimulating. Maybe thinking about it as the job funding my life? 

Begin decentering work in my life after my mom died. I was very much interested in climbing the corporate ranks before then, but after that I realized I'm focusing on the wrong things. 

Lastly, I know I could ask for more duties at work maybe to diversify my job a bit, but I know how my employer is and if you ask for more work you will get it, and you will likely be swamped, and you won't get paid anymore, so I don't want more work without getting adequately compensated for it. 

What are your thoughts on this situation? 

TD:DR. I make good money and have good leave at my current job even though it's super non-stimulating. Should I stay or look elsewhere?",Secure_Ad_1808,3,1.0,1,1715148861,2024-05-08 06:14:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cmxn50/should_i_stay_if_bored/,5,2024
1cmwng4,Advice on Resigning,"Hi all,

I've been with my current company for over ten years. I may have the opportunity to take a role in local government that I'm extremely interested in, but I'm having a lot of anxiety thinking about resignation. 

I'm on a small team, and my relationship with management kind of depends on the day. My manager micromanages and forces lots of team time and can be extremely passive aggressive. When other employees have gone to our director about concerns, he just loops her in and then she practically interrogates them. Our director put me on the spot once and asked why I applied for another internal position when I was meeting with him about something totally different. Once, the two of them took me into a room and basically told me I was being too depressed at work and I needed to leave personal stuff at home because other employees had asked if I was okay (my dad's liver was failing and my grandfather had passed away shortly before this).

That said, my manager has occasionally been very flexible and understanding with me. That said, I did blindsided her with a couple of previous internal applications and she was super frustrated about that.

I wasn't to be respectful but I'm not sure I trust my manager, even after working for her for the last seven years. But I have a second interview next week and though I may have a slight pay cut, the role is in a field I'm interested in and has great benefits/retirement. I also feel like I will learn a lot from the manager in that role and hopefully better work/life balance. 

Should I tell my manager now so she's not blindsided? Or wait until I get an offer in case it doesn't work out? I have no idea if or when they might contact her either. I want to respect the kindness she's occasionally shown, but I don't know. 

TL;DR: I have a long history with my company and manager and I don't know if I should make her aware that I'm moving on to final round interviews for a role I'm really interested in.",KeybladePrincess,3,0.8100000023841858,11,1715144994,2024-05-08 05:09:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cmwng4/advice_on_resigning/,5,2024
1cmwllr,Finance vs Aviation industry.,"Seeking Career Advice: Finance vs. Aviation Industry

I'm currently facing a dilemma regarding my career path and left to choose between either my passion or practicality. I would greatly appreciate insights and advice from professionals in the finance and aviation industries. Here's a comprehensive overview of my situation:

1. Passion for Aviation: I'm deeply passionate about the aviation industry and planning on to becoming an aircraft maintenance engineer. However, I'm confronted with the practical reality that the aviation industry in my country is not thriving, with limited job opportunities and potential salary discrepancies compared to the finance sector(my current field).

2. Challenges in Aviation: While I'm aware of my passion for aviation, I'm also aware of the challenges it presents. The main concern is as I mentioned the aviation industry in my country is stagnant, and opportunities for entry-level positions in aircraft maintenance engineering are virtually non-existent due to the lack of operational aircraft and industry demand. Moreover, without prior experience, it's challenging to secure employment abroad directly after obtaining a license. Additionally, pursuing this course abroad is prohibitively expensive, making it financially unfeasible for me.

3. Pros and Cons of Finance: On the other hand, the finance industry offers broader career prospects and potentially higher salaries. However, it's also oversaturated, and I'm concerned about finding fulfillment in boring accounting roles

PS: I'm aware that pursuing aircraft maintenance engineering might seem unconventional given my background in accounting. However, I have knowledge of few aviation training hub that doesn't require an engineering prerequisite background, which has sparked my interest in exploring this field further.

I'm seeking advice and guidance from professionals in both the finance and aviation industries.",WhoisWajih,1,1.0,0,1715144805,2024-05-08 05:06:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cmwllr/finance_vs_aviation_industry/,5,2024

1cmvlgi,Using PTO before quiting after a demotion?,"I was fortunate to receive a promotion earlier this year that put my family in a great financial place after many years of struggling. Everything appeared fine in the beginning but after the first couple of weeks it became difficult to fit in with the office culture.   
  
This is not my first office job but it is my first big office job, as there are more than 3-4 employees in the office. I am not from this state and the culture in the office is starkly different than I expected, not just the office politics but also the culture of the people in the office is wildly opposite of anything I've ever experienced before. Everyone in the office is from around here, and they all have the same interests, go to the same bar, and love sports. I was having a difficult time fitting in with everyone because I’m not interested in going to the bar or talking about sports, etc. Anyways, last week I was pulled into the office and was told that it wasn’t working out and I was not a good fit for the office, and honestly, I knew this time was coming for a while; I was just trying my best to make it work for my family’s sake. 

  
I have to give an answer tomorrow morning and with that said, I don't want to go back on the factory floor because it is very hot and there is no AC. I also have an autoimmune disease that makes it difficult to handle heat without getting sick or overheating and breaking out in rashes. Additionally, the floor is very long hours and grossly underpaid. I’m taking a nearly $12 an hour cut.  
  
I have 6-months savings and would like to take 2-4 weeks off to visit family, decompress, and get some rest before starting work again or finding a new job.  
  
I’m trying to decide whether to sign the paperwork and use my PTO, which HR says I can use upon being rehired onto the factory floor but I kind of just want to lose the PTO and walk away peacefully. I already have a good reference from one of the office managers and fear taking the PTO and quitting right after using it will ruin that reference. HR said should I not sign the paperwork, it would simply be me not taking a position offered and would consider me being neither fired nor quitting and just a peaceful parting between parties.  
  
Should, I take PTO and then quit? I do not want to be on that floor again, especially after experiencing the cushy office life they foster with tons of free snacks, food, and AC.

I was MUA for 5 years, then I had my first child and I quit to be a SAHM. It was my choice, as wanted to prioritize my child. After he started play school around 2y/o, I started working as a Digital Marketer, but I didn't enjoy that. Worked for around a year.
 Then got into content writing. That's when covid hit.

I freelanced for a year and a half as a content writer pand worked full time as content moderator. 

Then I conceived my second baby and some medical complications so was on bed rest for a long time. So I had to quit. Now, my second born is about a year old, and I want to preparing for skill upgrade but I want to build a steady career now. Hence, would need guidance for which field to pursue and what skills should I acquire.

Note: I have done BE in IT but never did any work as per my qualifications.

Pls help

1cmvatm,"23 and working evening shifts to gain experience, but I’m worried about the sacrifice to my social life 🥲 Is it worth it for career growth? ","Not sure if this is a good place to ask but figured there might be people in this sub who have experience working late night shifts. I’m 23, graduated last year, and got an opportunity to work at a hospital with career growth, benefits, and better pay 🥳 This is what I want for my career (healthcare administration/patient access) but the only shift available is evening (3pm-11pm). I didn’t initially apply for this shift or position, but it was offered to me after cold-emailing on LinkedIn. And it’s a REALLY good hospital!  

However, I have a fear of missing out (FOMO🥲) and wanted to ask if there are any seniors or experienced professional who can reassure that this career sacrifices is worth it? And maybe share their experience.  

I won’t have time to date, my friends work 9-5s (but we are all free weekends), and I won’t be able to attend as many concerts as I’d like (I’m an avid concert go-er). I know I can ask to change my shift in a year, but I just feel anxious about the change and “missing out” on things. That and I know the older you get, the harder it can be to maintain friendships.

I work in digital marketing and have 5 years' experience in this industry (including 2 years in management), and 3 years experience in other roles (admin type stuff). I am based in Australia but all of my marketing experience was in Europe (I am Australian). I am also in the final week of completing my MBA which I have done part time over the past 3 years.

About 9 months ago I paid to have my CV professionally written thinking this was the issue, but this obviously hasn't helped.

I have applied for junior roles in marketing and a range of other job functions completely seperate to marketing, but I am constantly rejected. I'm assuming that they think I am too senior for some roles and I won't stay long, with the issue being for the other positions being my lack of Australian experience. I've tried recruiters and temp agencies but I don't hear back from them or am rejected by the client. The only piece of feedback I have received is:

- lack of Australian experience

- not stayed at a company longer than 2 years

","M/35, Married and no kids yet.

I was offered a position by my company to be a manager but need to relocate in Arizona. I am currently living in Upstate NY.

Just a back story, I've been with this company for almost 9 years now. It is basically my first real job. I did not have any experience/degree that is related to this job, I started as a field technician for $15/hr and over the years I felt like they compensated me well. Now as a Senior lead tech, I am at $38/hr. I never had any experience being a manager but I've become a great asset to my boss/manager by helping them in my own ways to make things easier. I like being organize and that is also one of the reason why they think I fit in this position. Anyway, the offer was $95,000 in salary. I told them if I will accept the position It will be at least 2 years commitment to see if we will like it in there and it should be per hr instead of salary which they said that might be able to do something about it. My problem is I have a house in NY that I don't want to sell. We still owe $111k on this house but we got it in a pretty good interest rate back in 2016 so we definitely do not want to sell the house yet until we know for sure. There is also going to be a relocation reimbursement up to a certain amount. I was also told that if I ever want to come back here in NY after 2 years they will not take away my pay.

One of the reasons why I am considering this offer is one, I like the position and second I will not be travelling. Because here in NY we have several customer sites that we go to which also includes the northeast. Some are a few minutes drive and some of course will need to take a plane and stay there for a week which happens constantly.



Here are also my Pros and Cons:

Pros:

- Salary increase

- New position(something I can put in my resume)

- No winter( but love the 3 seasons though)

- Will get me out of my comfort zone

- No travel

Cons:

- Will be away from family( my wife's family side)

- Extreme heat(like a lot people were saying) and worried about the drought

- AZ rent + NY mortgage( until we find someone we can rent it to)

- NY property Tax

What else do you think I need to consider that I am missing? I have never been in this kind of situation and this will be one of my biggest decision if I decided to accept the offer.

1cmt74c,Advice on how to deal with a workaholic micromanager ,"I've just started a new job (4 months) and I've been struggling a lot at work. It's a new field for me and I was promised training in the interview, but my manager has left me alone to figure things out on my own. Initially I was a little taken aback as I had expected some level of training at least but I’ve been doing my test to learn as we go along. 
 

We had aligned on projects that I need to accomplish in the year which is fine by me but he has been constantly adding to my workload at an almost daily pace. Some of these are important (e.g. clearing invoices/ data analysis) but some are a waste of time (e.g. testing out a new software that our global team is proposing but we are not using and raising over 50 tickets on Jira + follow up). When I asked him why we are doing this if we aren't going to be using it his answer is that we need to follow what global says but concurrently I will have to work on sourcing an alternative for this software. 


The real kicker is that he is constantly micro-managing and pressing me on timelines and status of these projects that I am unable to concentrate on because he continues to add on to my workload. In our 1-1s he’ll be asking me “what’s the status of xx, have you started sourcing for vendors on this? Or have the vendors replied to you on what is the next step? Have you sent out chasers to remind people to submit their reports on time?” 


 I've been working around 10~11 hours a day now to clear my work but frankly it's not tenable in the long run and I’m feeling early onset of burnout already. I have asked him to help me prioritize my work, but he told me that everything needs to be done and “that’s just the way things are around here, you just have to get used to it”. 


It’s fine for him because he works from 9am – 6pm, 8pm – 12am on a daily basis and on weekends but for me I’m struggling to keep up and at my wits end.

1cms454,Should I still be passively applying for other jobs.,"The short version of it was that I was unhappy with the position I was in, and still am to a certain extent. Ultimately found out the Senior Manager who was supposed to be advocating was actually doing something more like stuffing information under his bed. His desire to make everyone happy created situations where there was havoc, and people were left unchecked for their decisions, especially the bad one. Crushing morale of our team. 

That guy left, and the new guy had some new personal setbacks, but in his short time at the site, he has made more of a profound impact than his predecessor in my opinion. He is going back to taking strides of developing me, rather than just standing on the sidelines and giving me a silent thumbs to assuage me. He seemed to also have picked up on the culture of the site and building being an obstacle he's slowly worked at and holding teams accountable when they aren't doing their due diligence but expecting us to make a full on cake after only giving us sugar and make their ""favorite cake"" while refusing to give any details or parameters in a metaphorical sense. Again, current boss is making swings at developing me and exposing me to more opportunities. So much so, that I'm being volunteered to take more responsibility to do evaluations across the company, with the additional, passive motive of learning new things and meeting new people to add to inventory as I look for future open positions. 

With all that said, I still have the nagging feeling to keep applying for jobs, rather than waiting for something to happen with high hopes. The impasse I'm at, is I'm at a place where I'm being sought to be developed, versus going somewhere that might pay more and be a better all over work culture.

I like strategy and research, but I also like to do some amount of hands on creative work. What sort of jobs should I be looking for?


I’ve been working at a startup for the past 2.5 years. I was originally hired as a UX researcher, then transitioned into a product management role. My day to day really ranges based on current needs. Some days I’m working through our roadmap and writing briefs/tickets for our external dev team. Somedays I’m editing video content for 6 hours, making 3D renders for pitch decks, redesigning app screens based on user feedback, or laying out and writing our weekly news letter. I have learned so much in this position, but I’m really struggling on where to go from here? I’m only a few years into my career, and I would love to find somewhere where I can work on a team again and have mentorship, but the skill set I have now feels like a better fit at a startup.

My portfolio is good, but not phenomenal. I’m a good designer, but I’m not landing a job at the UX team at google. Where I do think I excel is being able to solve complicated, ambiguous problems without needing a lot of direction. I think in the right organization being able to deliver results based on a vague task (for example creating a 1 month SMM plan to drive more sales, then executing it) would be seen as really useful. But I’m not exactly sure what that title would be? Flex creative? Maybe I’m way off base and people only want excellence in specific areas, and I need to buckle down and really hone my craft. The thing is, I like the variety in the work I do now. Jumping around from Figma to Fusion to Audition is fun, and it keeps my easily distracted ADHD brain engaged.

For some background I studied industrial design and worked in the industry for about 1.5 years before transitioning to ux/ui. I love product management, but it seems to be a mid to senior level role at most orgs. 

I would love to hear from anyone who feels like they’re in a similar spot, walking a confusing line between digital/physical product/marketing/research

1cmrybl,Money or experience?,"Money or experience? Big raise, or should I take the co-op?

Hi Everyone,

I could really use some advice as I'm currently at a crossroads in my career, facing two good but very different paths, and I don't have many people to turn to for advice.

**My Situation:**

I'm 25, studying supply chain and marketing, and set to graduate in December 2024. My resume is decent, with past experience as a project coordinator and current work as a purchasing coordinator. I’ve been eager to move out of my area since I’ve lived here all my life and find it limiting and lack luster.

**The Decision:**

I'm deciding between staying at my current role or taking a six-month remote co-op position with a Fortune 15 global medical equipment and pharmaceutical manufacturer and distributor.

I've technically already accepted the co-op role but was then offered $75,000 (up from $53,000) to stay with potential for profit sharing bonuses and another raise in January. In function, my role would transition from purchasing coordinator to operations/purchasing manager. Not in a super strict sense because it's literally just another new hire, and then a warehouse guy who has been around forever, leaving the office team to a whopping 3 people. 

The company is run by two co-owners, and one of the owner's sons. They're all sales-focused which leaves the office staff essential in charge of any internal process as they're pretty much hands-off as long as their orders and what not gets handled (this can be frustrating at times).

**Current Role - Purchasing Coordinator (Industrial Tool & Equipment Distributor/Wholesaler):**

The company is very small with a lot of cross-function due to it being such a small business. 

* **Time in Role:** 12 months
* **Team Size:** Less than 10
* **Offered Position:** Purchasing/Operations Manager
* **Offered Salary:** $75,000 (up from $53,000)
* **Pros:**
   * Immediate raise to $75k and full health insurance coverage
   * Freedom and autonomy due to the small business environment
   * Relatively low-stress work environment
   * Full control over operations with opportunities to implement changes
   * Clear path to six figures and potential partial ownership
   * Resume boost from purchasing coordinator to manager
* **Cons:**
   * Office-based, five days a week
   * Significant responsibility with little support (management is mostly focused on sales)
   * Limits my ability to leave the area or gain co-op experience
   * Few established processes; changes rely heavily on trial and error with little support
   * Not a lot of real experience as a lot of what we do is very much done in a small business way (throw shit at the wall and see what works) and not very sophisticated.

If I stay long term there is also the potential I can become part owner 

**Co-op Role - Data Analyst (Global Fortune 15 Medical Equipment & Pharmaceutical Manufacturer):**

* **Pros:**
   * Valuable experience at a global company
   * New analytical skills for my resume
   * Remote work
   * Potential job offer, though not guaranteed
   * Broadens my resume for future flexibility as I do not have any analytical roles on my resume
* **Cons:**
   * Pay is $23 per hour without health insurance (though my university can cover this)
   * No guaranteed role post co-op
   * Uncertainty around how this co-op will be valued due to me already having work experience

1cmrsvs,What career paths are available??,"Did a BA Sociology with Psychology honours degree in London, UK and have been working in schools as a teaching assistant, learning support teacher, 1-to-1 SEN (special educational needs) educator and cover teacher. But, I want to do something different now but have no idea what other options are available for me as the only opportunities I’m finding are in the education sector. It also doesn’t help that my degree is broad so I’m thinking that I might have to go back to uni to study for a masters degree in a specific subject, I just don’t know what subject yet because I’m wary of the opportunities I’ll get after the course. All I know is I want to branch out and discover new opportunities in London and don’t want to stay stuck working in similar positions in the same sector when I feel like I’ve learnt and experienced enough from it now.  

Does anyone have some advice on what other prospects are out there for me to look into to help me out of this situation?

1cmrc3f,What can I transition into after being a teacher?,"TLDR; I have been a teacher for the past 2 years and realize I cannot stand teaching, what are some other options?


So I went to school to become a doctor and I was pre med until I was a junior and I realized I did not want to be a doctor (shadowing was miserable and I realized I only want to do it because I was kind of mesmerized by being a woman in stem and I knew doctors were paid well).

So I graduated with a BSc in microbiology and then I went on to get a MEd in general science education (a lot of help that does me now not wanting to be a teacher)

I kind of enjoy working mostly alone or on a really large team (so team of 1 or team of 10+ I like the feeling of anonymity). I really enjoy being creative and creating new products or programs - I enjoy being able to create custom worksheets for my students or designing lab activities (this has led me towards instructional design or educational outreach - but I have not found many good resources on how to get started in these areas).

I really enjoy have checklists and predictable work schedules (so not super spontaneous and unpredictable work flows) but I also like being able to do something different from time to time (meaning like I do not want to be an accountant that does the exact same thing day in and day out, I like some variety - maybe like a broad job scope) 

In terms of things I’m good at vs bad at, I’m a bit of a perfectionist and extremely detail oriented, I love creativity or adding a little bit of a creative touch to the things I do and I love staying focused on a single task until I see it through to completion. I’m not great at working through conflict (I’m a pretty anxious person overall) and I am not the best at being micromanaged (like to the point where I have no autonomy - I don’t mind being told what to do but I like some autonomy).

I make about 60k as a teacher but I also do a lot of “extra work” like working sports games, working on a science team contract, co counsel a club, and work pretty closely with special Ed (I do get satisfaction from these things but they are big time commitments and I do them largely for the salary boost)

I have thought about being an event planner because I enjoy being in a role where I create the outcome, and I really like to make people happy/ have a good time. I have also thought about going into med device or pharma sales because I enjoy stem and the technical aspect of sharing things and teaching about medicine or devices.

I feel like I’m a bit of an ambivert (I enjoy being around others but I don’t like working on teams where others aren’t pulling their weight)

I originally became a teacher because I love science and I love sharing my love of science with other people who are also interested in science. I also really wanted a chance to make a positive impact on the youth and be somewhat of an inspiration for my female students who also wanted to be in stem. I really enjoy developing my own lessons and lesson plans and being able to deliver labs or assignments the best way I think will teach the lesson.

Since starting teaching I really do not like how disrespectful and unruly these kids are, I’m also in a school system where I find that there is a lot of pressure/ stress placed on us to be liked by parents and to present as a certain way in public (like I can’t just enjoy what I want to do because I may see someone from school or the community that may say something bad about me or the way I was dressed or what I was doing and call my tenure into question), and to a point I made earlier I really do not like working with other teachers who just do not care or will not put in effort to lessons or labs..

Any advice or guidance is highly appreciated!! I’m not really even sure where to start so even just an accurate career inventory or personality inventory rec would also be appreciated. I just feel a bit lost in where to even start..",Jah0047,1,1.0,2,1715128166,2024-05-08 00:29:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cmrc3f/what_can_i_transition_into_after_being_a_teacher/,5,2024

1cmq03n,Possible relocation from MN to KY,"Good evening,   
I work for a large company as an IT systems analyst. I currently live in MN and we have an office in Louisville KY. Our current analyst in Louisville left the company due to personal reasons and I am down here for the week filling in while our company tries to find a replacement which isnt going well I'm told. 

I am 37 years old dont own a house or have a family. I have a dog and that is really about it holding me in MN. I floated the idea of relocating down here and was wondering if you guys had any questions I should ask or havent thought of yet.

I asked about relocation assistance and my boss said he doubts it based on the fact that it is a lateral move and not a promotion. I feel like I may have some leverage as backfilling my role in MN would be much easier than here in KY.

My list of questions is mainly will my salary ($80,000) change as the cost of living is higher in MN than KY  
- Cost of Living Comparison Between Louisville, KY and Minneapolis, MN. You would need around 5,883.5$ in Minneapolis, MN to maintain the same standard of life that you can have with 5,500.0$ in Louisville, KY.

  
Another would be what would the timeline be for me to be down here fully?

  
Would there be short term housing while I find a place or something?

Any opinions or ideas would be appreciated. Thank you",Dull-Biscotti-8542,1,1.0,0,1715124323,2024-05-07 23:25:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cmq03n/possible_relocation_from_mn_to_ky/,5,2024

1cmoyal,Summer internship or volunteer camp comittee,"Hello,

As I approach graduation from undergrad with an administrative degree, I find myself at a crossroads regarding my summer plans. I have two enticing opportunities before me, but unfortunately, I can only commit to one. I've been offered positions in both a freshman 3-day camp paid internship at my current college and as a member of a church 3-day camp planning committee. While both roles offer similar skill sets and knowledge, they differ in terms of compensation, time commitment, and personal benefits.

**Freshman Camp Internship (Pros and Cons):**

Pros:

* Paid internship with 30 hours of work per week.
* Provides valuable experience to add to my resume.
* Allows me to remain connected to my school community for a little longer.

Cons:

* May lead to a more professional relationship with friends, potentially limiting social interactions.
* Lease ends before the internship does, necessitating the search for alternative housing.

**Church Camp Planning Committee (Pros and Cons):**

Pros:

* Opportunity to contribute to a cause I'm passionate about.
* Located in my hometown, facilitating connections and potential future involvement.
* Chance to overcome social anxiety and engage with members of my church community.

Cons:

* Volunteer-based role may not carry the same weight on a resume.
* Requires moving back home earlier than anticipated.

I'm feeling torn between the two options. On one hand, the paid internship at my college offers a clear path for career advancement and the opportunity to build my resume. However, on the other hand, the church camp planning committee in my hometown appeals to me because of the chance to overcome my social anxiety, connect with my community, and contribute to something meaningful especially since I plan on settling there long term. I'm unsure which path to choose as both offer unique benefits, and I'm struggling to determine which aligns best with my long-term goals. It's a challenging decision, and I'm feeling unsure about which direction to take.",Interesting-Help-147,1,1.0,0,1715121544,2024-05-07 22:39:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cmoyal/summer_internship_or_volunteer_camp_comittee/,5,2024
1cmoke6,should I major in engineering if I’m not 100% sure it’s what I want to do in life?,"I’m planning on majoring in engineering at a state college that isn’t really known for engineering, but since I come from a low income family, I want to save as much money as possible. However, I’m not entirely sure if I’m interested in engineering since it’s a hard field to go into, so should I try it out or should I skip it? 
For more context, I wasn’t always planning on going to college (I was actually going to be a nun lol), and I also wanted to take a gap year to work on my music production and business ideas. However, with my family’s financial situations, I thought it’d be good to go to college and get started on a career path so I could get a stable income someday. Because I always had some interest in the mechanics of things, I was planning on seeing if engineering was a right fit for me at the school and then if it is, transferring to a better engineering school with more prestige. However, if I don’t like it, that means I have a lot of college debt and I have to restart my career…

1cmoaon,"32 year old with a Masters Degree in Human Resources from 2017, but minimal experience in industry...","So I got a a MS-HR from a really great program (it was second in the country at the time) and did ok with a 3.25 GPA. It was 3 semester and after the 2nd we were placed into internships for the summer. I got one of my preferred picks in the Compensation department for a decent sized cloud computing services company. Fast forward to graduation and I was not in a great place mentally, so I did not really pursue a job despite good jobs being laid at my feet. I was hanging on by a thread internally.   
I tried to pivot back to my undergrad degree and got some certifications there, and took a crappy finance sales job that i quit after 8 months. After that I just did Uber Eats/Door Dash for the last 5 years trying to ""heal"" myself. What I ultimately realized was that I got really messed up from SSRI antidepressants. The symptoms were debilitating and if you are curious, look up PSSD.  

In the last year, I said enough was enough and I started experimenting with different supplements/medications/diets to try and cure myself. I am now at a point where I am on stable enough footing where the idea of taking on a more challenging career role does not seem unrealistic, and think a remote job as a compensation analyst could be doable. Don't think I could handle an office job. 

So how screwed am I with the huge resume gap? Any thing I can do to help my marketability?

1cmnuts,Job asking me to resign or take a demotion after having 2 weeks off to recover from surgery,"Long story as shortened as I could get it...

I had surgery and had to miss weeks 2 + 3 of orientation at a new job position (same company, basically a promotion - nursing assistant to nurse), job said it was okay and I could make it up at the end of the program which is 16 weeks. I told them before I even started. After starting I got my schedule up to mid-June which blacked out those 2 weeks I'd miss implying I'd be all good. They 100% made me believe coming back after 2 weeks would be fine. Only reason I'd HAVE to miss the 2 weeks is because they wouldn't allow me to work with lifting restrictions. I never asked for more than 1 day off to make it the least inconvenient to them or myself. It was a minor surgery, but yes necessary as without it the disease would spread further and cause more damage.

Small bump in the road - doctor's note said 4 weeks, they told me making up 4 weeks was impossible; got a new one at my one week appt saying I could come back 5/6 with no restrictions (which was original return date), manager tells me, ""great news! see you back on 5/6!"" making me think I was all good to go. Then I get an email on 5/3 from HR saying I don't need to do anything on Monday (which I was scheduled to work) but come in and talk with HR and my manager to discuss how I will make up the missed time. They even said I'd get paid for that whole day...

At the meeting they told me that they've discussed it with everyone, including the union (yeah, okay 🙄) and feel that since I missed these 2 weeks it would be really ""unfair"" to me to continue on with orientation as I'd be really behind everyone else and it would be near impossible to make up at the end. I get what they're saying, but in all reality, I am NOT that far behind and it's not a stretch to make it up. They offer me the following o**ption:**

- Get a job within the hospital that is lower than an RN and work until August. They gave me a list of open jobs and said ""Why don't we touch base again on say, erm, Wednesday around noon? Does that sound good? Take some time to think it over and let us know what you decide to do.""

I asked, what if I go get a job somewhere else? They said if I chose to go that route I'd **need to give them a resignation letter.** But, why am I resigning? I'm not resigning of my own free will, you people are forcing me to. 

Basically, I have 48 hours to decide whether I want to take a lower position (demotion) at the company until August or resign. They didn't give me any other resources, people to talk to, nothing. I feel like this is so illegal and am so god damn lost. And no, I do not have them listing out my options in writing, but I think I should send an email outlining the points, perhaps, to see what they respond with.

Now I'm out of a job and I feel completely blindsided by them as they literally made me believe it would truly be okay to miss those 2 weeks. I completely understand where they're coming from and all that, but why wouldn't they have just told me at the beginning so I could have made the decision whether or not to start or even get the surgery!?!? I feel so completely deflated, degraded, *all* the down feelings. I also feel like this is totally illegal to ask me to resign when I don't want to resign at all. I want to work there and I was determined to work there. I applied for PFML and FMLA which is in the process still. The company has given me such differing information on how to apply for FMLA and it was slightly delayed, but all within the alotted time frame. I also wasn't that worried about it as I was coming back to work anyway. They also told me they'd give me a few days of pay too for the shifts I would've been working this week.

**TL;DR -** Got a promotion from nursing assistant to nurse at same hospital I've worked at for 16 months. Had to have surgery (told them before I started) and missed weeks 2 and 3 of a 16-week orientation. I started orienting on the unit/did week 1 where they 100% made me believe it would be fine to come back, gave me my schedule and all that, then let me ""come back to work"" only for them to ask me to resign or take a lower position/demotion in the company and start back again as a nurse in August.

I need advice! What would you do? Would you say eff the company & find a job elsewhere? Or would you to take the demotion and start back in August?",jamminman430,2,1.0,4,1715118803,2024-05-07 21:53:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cmnuts/job_asking_me_to_resign_or_take_a_demotion_after/,5,2024

1cmm9am,[28M - Biotech] Seeking advice on where to go next in a pretty scattered career,"Hi all, seeking some advice as I'm feeling a little lost in the current job market. 

I studied biology in school initially thinking I'd be a doctor, then a PhD, and eventually scrapping all that and ending up in the biotech industry. I worked in the lab as a research associate for 2 years at a mid-size startup before transitioning to the commercial team at that same company. The company was going through a lot of change as a result of basically being a failing business and so over the next 2.5 years I got tossed into a variety of roles including project manager, product manager, biz ops manager, portfolio manager, alliance manager, program manager, etc. each for ~1 year or less. I also worked across agriculture, industrials, and pharma during that time. 

Eventually my company got bought out and I was offered a full time position at the acquiring company where I have been working as a Pharma Alliance Manager for the past 1.5 years or so. 

My problem is that I basically hate my job and would really like to go back to working in product, but I only have about 1.5 years of actual ""product"" experience on my resume. Most biotechs/pharmas are looking for 6-10+ years of experience for product managers and there aren't many other product roles. My problem seems to be that I don't really have enough experience in any one discipline to qualify for the available roles in my field. I also don't have any experience outside of biotech to try to apply to different fields. 

I'm basically left feeling like my only option is to go get an MBA to essentially reset my career and be able to get new higher-level opportunities elsewhere but curious if anyone has any thoughts or has been in a similar situation and can provide some advice.",jesus321,1,1.0,0,1715114891,2024-05-07 20:48:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cmm9am/28m_biotech_seeking_advice_on_where_to_go_next_in/,5,2024

1cmkroj,Internship Advice,"Hey everyone,

I've currently found myself in an interesting situation. After a month of applications and interviews, I've gotten an offer for a planning internship (I'm an urban planning major) at my city's local government. This is one of my dream internships, but it's an unpaid summer only position. On the other hand, I had an interview at a public-private partnership that's based around attracting businesses to my metro area, and it pays more than my current uni job and has a really neat office. Even better, they said they're willing to keep the position open for me when I get back from a study abroad in London that I'm participating in over  the fall semester. The only issue is that I have a second interview for the position that I still need to attend, so the offer is not a done deal. I've emailed the organization telling them my situation and asking how likely an offer is after the second interview, and they responded that a second interview is very promising and leads to a job offer more often than not. But they did say that they can't promise anything. 

How do I approach this situation? Ideally I'd like to stall on accepting the first position until I have more clarity on whether I'm getting offered the second position, but what's the way to do this that won't offend the place that's already offered me an internship?",Cactus_Brody,1,1.0,0,1715111223,2024-05-07 19:47:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cmkroj/internship_advice/,5,2024

1cmk4by,What artistic careers are actually stable and decent paying,"I currently work in the animation/vfx industry, which I love and is what I’ve wanted to do since high school. The industry is quite unstable and it’s not precisely high paying. I’ve been doing pretty ok since I got out of school tho, I’ve been working non stop for the last 7 years so I can’t really complain (fingers crossed it stays like that), but it’s scary to think that I could be laid off any moment and not have anything else to resort to, since I don’t have a degree in anything else.

I’m trying to think of what jobs I could do that I could enjoy and are somewhat stable and with decent pay, nothing crazy. I’m interested in artistic jobs, I don’t mind if I have to get some diplomas and go back on a 1-2 year program to learn it, but not something that requires a college degree. I’m too old and tired for that. I was thinking something along the lines of UX design, but I don’t know much about it.

1cmjttv,I’m lost. ,"Hey all - Quick question, but also not so quick. 

I’m lost in my career. “Lost” being dramatic, but more so that I am trying to look to the future, and am unsure where to go. 

I have a BS in Business administration and an MBA. I’ve worked at an advertising agency for the past 1.5 years out of school on some big clients. I’ve learned a lot. 

However, I’d be lying if I said that any area of the job provides me with a sense of fulfillment and enjoyment. I know straight out of school the chances you’ll enjoy the first job are slim, but still. It’s fine. I also know there is a school of thought that believes you do not have to enjoy your job to have a fulfilling life. I agree with this somewhat, but sitting at a desk in excel for eight hours a day is just brutal in my opinion. I’m a creative guy, I love art, and I love sports as I’ve played hockey my whole life. I love helping people, so do I go into sales? These are the questions I asked myself.

Wanted to ask the good people of Reddit if there was any advice and/or any other business avenues I could pursue with my experience. Heck, even anything completely different, like being outside or something of that nature that can make a respectable salary. I am realistic that I’ll need a good salary to create the life I want, but I just don’t want it to be in some highly analytical, number-based role. Always thought I would just go to the NHL, but we all know that ain’t happening haha.  I’ve had plenty of ideas over the past couple of years to use my creations on adobe and morph them into T-shirt designs, and then use my paid social advertising experience to grow it. A tall task, but a dream. Thanks all.",ng411,1,1.0,0,1715108817,2024-05-07 19:06:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cmjttv/im_lost/,5,2024

1cmjcbs,My manager doesn't want me reading books during breaks.,"Okay I love to read, my manager does not, she has been on me for awhile since I transferred that I read entirely too much. She got on me with a break where I read for ten minutes outside. 

Most customers find nothing wrong with it, manager says it makes me look overly educated and not a cashier. It makes me look lazy in her eyes.

I do the job, so why does it matter what I am doing on my breaks we don't have an area to take breaks? It's a freaking gas station! 

So I got told I could no longer bring books for my breaks, I just can listen to music or read whatever on my phone. I am now pissed its a break and I don't want to deal with this BS. Why does my manager think book reading is weird? I can't just NOT read on my breaks! 

Should I just not bring any books or should I just walk to work earlier and read in the park before my shift? (My work is within walking distance of my house)

Update: Okay I talked to my manager and she actually said she came off as an asshole. She told me that I was reading outside when a customer bitched I should be working and when she said I was on break, he threated he would rip my book up because he found what i was reading offensive.

Currently I am reading White Trash Warlock which is a comedy about an incompetent Warlock who has to save Denver Co. She said she has no problem with me reading but was worried about the break situation since I can't always break in her office. She is starting to figure out something because I am not the only one that this customer has threatened to do this to. 

Sad part is he works at the Car Dealership which fills up at our station often. We don't really appreciate it and have ranged complaints to their managers on this guy. He also likes to voice Qanon conspiracies ro those who listen. So we're in for a long haul with him.

New Update since this morning:
Manager at the Car Dealership actually has fired said employee because other employees came to my defense and also the defense of the store manager. So far the dealership manager apologized to me.

My manager has arranged to have a new break area set aside for employees that is covered and between one of our sheds and the store which is fully covered and has benches. Also we are issued a key to it as it is gated off and has cameras. We will have it finished in a few days. 

So far I was surprised how quickly this was handled since she was upset that she had to come off as a bitch to everyone.

1cmjc57,My coworker told my boss I'm a huge racist. What do I do?,"It's my third week working in Admissions at a community college. Right now I'm just shadowing someone to learn the ropes.

This week when I went to the (public) bathroom, a guy came in and started pacing back and forth really fast, singing hymns loudly in Spanish. I waited for him to leave but he didn't. Eventually I came out of my stall and washed my hands, and he came up to me and started asking me lots of questions about who am I, why am I there, etc. His head was all bandaged up. I made awkward small talk then quickly slipped out.

When I got back to the office I told my trainer what happened, just like how I wrote it here, and laughed. ""I thought I was about to get murdered."" She said, ""Sounds like he had a disability"" and walked off.

Cut to the next day when I'm called into the boss's office because I've been making ""racist comments, and inappropriate remarks about people's religions and disabilities."" 🙃 The way my boss was looking at me... ugh.

Obviously they don't tell you who made the complaint, but I went up to my trainer and apologized, saying, ""If I ever overstepped any boundaries, I'm sorry. Please let me know."" And she smiled and replied, ""I'm the type of person that if I have a problem with you, I'll tell you to your face. 🙂""

What do I do

1cmjc3n,Is it inappropriate for a woman to be unshaven at work?,"This question kind of doesn't matter anymore, because I no longer work at the place I will be talking about, but I just wanted to know others' thoughts.

Obviously, I am a woman who doesn't shave. Not for any political reason, I just feel I have no reason to, and I have no desire to except that I am kind of insecure about it. I think it is also important to mention that I am very hairy too, like more than the average woman when she doesn't shave, and my body hair is very dark.

At my first job, which I loved working at, it gets very very very hot. like over 100 degrees regularly, and the dress code was just to wear what is comfortable, so I always wore shorts and a tank top like my coworkers. However, my second year working there is when I stopped shaving. I felt very uncomfortable going to work with how hairy my legs were, but I just did not want to have to waste time regularly shaving for work. That felt ridiculous to me. I had a coworker who was a lot older, but we were super friendly, but she brought up quite a few times to me that I should shave, so I just ended up wearing pants instead of shorts, even though it was hot. I wasn't refusing to shave just to prove a point, I just really did not want to waste my time doing that, and there is another reason I didn't shave which I won't get into.

She was the only one who ever said anything about it, and I never felt like customers were judging me for it, but I am aware it may make some customers feel bad, and it made me uncomfortable feeling like people were judging me. I don't think anyone should have to shave at all, but I am aware that it was my job and I could be making people uncomfortable, and I don't want that, but I feel like I shouldn't have to shave just to make people comfortable. I really am conflicted on this.

&#x200B;

Edit: There are a lot of comments! Thank you everyone for their input! I wanted to clarify some stuff. Mainly, most people did understand the question but I saw a few other people that didn't. I was asking specifically if not shaving would be inappropriate for the workplace, not if people would judge me and say bad things about me, because I knew that would happen. It didn't bother me a lot though because I am very quiet and most coworkers don't try to talk to me unless they are very friendly.

I also want to clarify, I worked at a garden center, and I worked in the greenhouse, and there were also many men there that had full beards. It was also a very small business, so maybe that will give a better idea of the work environment.

Also, that coworker and I were pretty good buddies, and I know she is just old and has different beliefs, but I also think she brought it up because she was just looking out for me. It did not open my eyes that other coworkers were probably talking about me, because I already knew that may happen, but it made me worried that it might be inappropriate and effect the business' image with customers. I always try to be nice to everyone and I never want to purposely do things to make people uncomfortable or to get in the way, but I am also used to people thinking I am weird because I am autistic, so that is why knowing people would think I'm weird for not shaving didn't bother me.

The consensus seems to be that it is not inappropriate, but might cause some people to make fun of me. This is pretty reassuring, so thanks everyone.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: I like my body hair. I am not willing to permanently alter or permanently remove it. I no longer work at this place so it is not an issue anymore, and I don't plan on shaving again from now.

1cmjc2t,Did my employee rage quite or did I fire her?,"
I’m 30 F super excited at my new job as a first time manager. 

I had an employee that was accepted for this position before I was working there but she started the job after I started mine. 

HR informed me she got the job because her husband lost his job and they have two kids, they felt sorry for her.

She was fired 7 years ago from this same company because she simply didn’t work.

She didn’t have work experience after getting fired from this one - her salary is for mid career range yet she doesn’t know how to write a simple email. 

She worked for me for 4 weeks exactly, still under probation. 
This one time she was an hour late for work and I called to ask where she is and kindly requested if it’s ok next time to let me know that she’s running late. 
She cussed me out and said it’s rude  to tell her that she’s late because it’s non of my business, yells at me through the phone that she quits. 
She Arrives to the office after to tell me that I don’t know how to be a manager and that I’m not fit for the job because I should know that her attendance is not under my responsibility. “You call this being a manager? You really think you’re doing a managers job?” 

 -I got the idea that she thought I wasn’t an actual manager with actual authority because Im younger than her, she has expressed her thoughts previously by yelling at me that I’m not fit to be a manager and I don’t know what I’m doing- other instances where she said that include - because I asked her “can you please not wear see through leggings and red sport shoes when meeting with clients”- 

I calmly and quickly told her okay if you wish to quit your job let’s go ahead and clear out your desk, got IT to take her work phone and laptop, a quick two minute handover -she doesn’t do any work to begin with- 

She started scrambling and wanted to wait for my manager the GM and HR head, I told her that’s fine just send me your resignation email first which she did via her phone. 

HR and my manager call me in after and said the employee doesn’t want to leave and she is begging to stay! - shocking

She wanted to quit but begged all the upper heads to please keep her, she was shocked to learn that they don’t have authority over that but me! 

They informed her to apologize to me and to ask me for the job back, she refused and they had to let her know a couple of times that they can’t do anything. 

Next day I walk in to HR to fill out the job position requirements for LinkedIn and there she was, all messed up, bags under her eyes looking super defeated, begging HR to have her job back”

she said “GM told me I need to apologize to you and that you’re the only one who can give me my job back”
 “I don’t want to leave I need the job” with no apology! 

I apologized and told her she’s putting me in an awkward position and the answer is no. 

She said “I’m putting you in an awkward position?….ok” and she left. 

She told every single person that work there that I fired her instead of her just formally resigning.

This typically doesn’t bother me, but they also stay… past the time I show up. I show up at 7? Then I am leaving at 3. I show up at 8? then I leave at 4. 

if I have to work until late then I do, but lately we have been in a slow season. 

They stay until 4-5 pm. Every day.

this means that I show up after and leave earlier. We share the same office (2 desks in the same office). and I am beginning to feel uncomfortable since I am starting to feel as if they make me look bad. 

I spoke to my direct manager and my ‘mentor’ about this and they said to not overwork and that I didn’t have to show up at that time. 

However, recently we had a training where we had tests, and the training had nothing to do with what I do for work (but it had to do with what they do for work). 

majority of us didn’t take it too seriously, we participated and answered questions but we didn’t spend time out of our day to study or anything. 

we had a test after, and they had to grade my paper. they shouted my answers out loud, knowing when they were wrong (example, instructor would say “if there is anything other than [answer] it’s wrong” and they would say “what about [my answer]?”) 

it is starting to feel like a competition, except I am not competing, and I am beginning to worry that there is something else going on here. 

how do you deal with overworking colleagues?

edit: to answer your questions:

* we are both salaried 
* the coworker is in a different line of promotion. So we aren’t competing for a position. Not until exec positions anyway. 
* as for those suggesting they just hate being in the office with me. I go out to the ‘field’ about half my time. And we don’t take lunch together. so Unless the 4 hours I am there really bother them, that can’t possibly be the reason 
* a certain problem the coworker has been having is that they run out of things to do. Then ask us to delegate work to them. Example, they asked me if they could help me organize some data. And I said… no because I wanted it a certain way. They asked me give them a step by step booklet on the format I wanted and to share my VBA. 
* yes they have a car 

so yeah, I hope that answered some of the common questions here

1cmjc2g,Colleague went on homophobic rant (I'm not straight). Legally and morally what should I do.,"So, I was in the staff room with 3 of my colleagues. One of my colleagues, out of nowhere, went on a homophobic rant. She said that gay people are ""disgusting"" that they ""make her feel sick"" and she ""hates them"". She said a lot more but those were the strongest things to stand out. When she found out her comments had upset me because I'm not straight she said ""she needs to fucking get over it. It's my opinion and actually most people's opinion"". So realistically I think I have 3 options:

1. Make a formal complaint and ask her to be removed from the company
2. Ask for them to transfer me to a different practice 
3. Put up and shut up

The reason I'm struggling to decide is because at the time of her homophobic rant she wasn't aware I wasn't straight. So, is getting her fired a bit far? And legally am I even allowed to ask for that?

Edit: for reference I live in the UK

Edit: For everyone that has actually given me constructive advice, thank you, It would take me a very long time to reply to you all so to sum up; I have decided to have a meeting with my manager and see what they suggest, and leave it all up to them.

1cmjc1d,Why is working at McDonalds or Burger King always used as the default “easy job” or “minimum deserved pay” job?,"We all know what I’m talking about. People complain about a $15 minimum wage by saying “do you really think that kids flippin’ burgers at McDonalds should be paid as much as a [insert arbitrarily more “difficult” job]??” 

A couple points about this. First, I absolutely don’t want to work there. It wears you down, physically. Bad joints, bad skin, hair. It’s hot and smelly and dangerous. It’s exhausting as hell. Customers have zero respect. Secondly, it’s got to be a very repetitive job. Whatever kind of sandwich you’re making, you’re still making a sandwich. For 8-9 hours. Third, McDonalds is one of the largest corporations in the entire world. Billions of dollars in revenue every year. Why the fuck wouldn’t we want employees to earn more or that?

1cmjc0z,I'm going to be fired today.,"I just made a mistake that has affected the websites of thousands of customers. I have a strong attention to detail and rarely make mistakes. Very rarely, in fact.

The problem occurred during a lengthy process of creating information consisting of dates, numbers, various fields, etc. I have 140 of them to go through on an individual level. My manager is a very nice guy, but he is subject to the influence of his boss and rarely checks things because he trusts me, which means I can't do anything about it right now.

I feel too threatened at work because there are only 2 people (me and my manager) in charge of it. There's a lot of crap I have to watch out for, and I've been in this role for 6 months now, and quite successfully too.

I've made a few mistakes in the last 6 months that I've been working here, but they've been much less serious than this one.

The whole problem was solved in less than 10 minutes and cost the company nothing. But now there is an uproar of people who have already started the witch hunt,  tagging the head of the company in different channels and pointing their fingers at me.

Do you have any advice? What should I do?


EDIT: I have an update. Even after my honest attempt to accept the situation and suggest further improvements, I was greeted by a passive-aggressive company's boss who made sure to underline that our development is ""expensive"", despite the development team being paid a minimum wage close to a Walmart's one. Apparently, the fault lies on me and my manager for not reviewing the entire 1 billion fields of information with our 4 eyes despite QC/QA being completely non-existent in the whole process and my manager's honest inability to properly check my work since he is assigned to work on 1 trillion other things. I am left on my own, and as I expected, I'm being asked to provide documents on our QA process which does not exist. My 2 very own eyes make up the entire QA process, and the blame continues to fall on the 100% manual review process that 1 person does instead of 2 (me).

P.S. My manager has yet to respond to me on any of this.

Few months ago, my web development partner asked for working remotely two times which was due to sickness at the first time, then due to being unable to sleep enough in the previous night time and even closer to the office than my home in distance like 20 mins, and he sent the message via email to the HR department and to the boss like 15 mins before at the morning time. He had no problem at all by doing that.

  
I also started to feel sick and cold from last night, and it got even much worse this morning so I asked my boss and HR department if I could work remotely. I didn't email them last night only because I thought that I was going to be able to go to the office as always.

  
However, my boss texted me and said that my asking for remote work couldn't be approved even if I told her all the reason why I didn't contact them much earlier, and just told me to take a whole day off which means I wouldn't get fully paid because my remaining sick hours are less than 8 hours now.

  
Am I crazy or may there be any chance they are treating me differently from my co-worker?

1cmgx66,Should I leave current job if offered new job?,"I've been working part time at a veterinary hospital as a vet assistant (doing basically all the same things a registered tech does) while also working reception here and there. I've loved it for the most part, but it was originally just a way to get experience while trying to get into vet school. Now that I've decided to go a different route (something along the lines of Account Manager or Regional Support Rep in the veterinary industry), I've wanted a change to help my resume. 

I casually started looking for a new job once when I was denied going full-time at my current hospital (even though we had just lost an employee), then took it more seriously once I really noticed how toxic the environment has become recently. My hours have been getting cut, I've been sent home super early, and I recently learned that as the mid shift tech, I would be the one sent home each time we are slow instead of taking turns. I've been blatantly disrespected by coworkers (not to mention the drama, ugh), and I push myself way too hard to get everything done when the other techs neglect tasks or slack off, and one of the techs with seniority has almost russian roulette of who she's mad at that week. If the manager makes a mistake in the schedule (which happens frequently), it is somehow our responsibility to find someone to cover for us and she makes you feel like it's your fault. I'm lucky if I get 20 hours at $15.60 (a whopping 60 cents raise in 2 years, despite hospital prices increasing 5-6 times since starting).

I found listings at another hospital for full-time positions at $18 an hour for vet assistant as well as receptionist. I got a phone interview and it went well, currently waiting to hear back to schedule an in-person with the hospital manager. I just don't know if I should take it if I am offered a position.

It seems obvious, part-time at $15 or full-time at $18, but I'm struggling due to loyalty and necessity. I adore the doctors I work with, and the main one (owner of the hospital) has done a lot for me in terms of getting the job originally and helping connect me with people to advance my career. Even though I'm a quick learner, I would have to relearn a whole new computer system at the new hospital, how their hospital runs specifically, and get to know the staff all over again. I know I'm capable, but change and messing with loyalty are usually big no-no's for me. I also don't NEED to go full time or get paid more, but it would be nice and would help with financial anxiety. My fiance is an RN and makes plenty for the both of us to be comfortable, I just want to feel like I'm contributing more. We are going to be trying for a baby after the wedding, so it would be nice to be able to get full-time maternity leave.

My dog also loves the daycare (free while I'm working) and is great at getting out his energy, but it isn't a service at the new place. I also get 50% off services now (full time is 75%), but I don't know what the employee discount is at the new place.

1cmgfno,Should I take a job outside of my career of civil engineering?,"Howdy, 

I graduated college and immediately took a job for a heavy civil general contractor in a PM role in a big city about 10 hours from my hometown. I was making $70k at this job, and got bumped to $73k after a year. Anyway, I absolutely hated it. All I did was process change orders (typically not many on the small county roads we were building), send out purchase orders, and make the occasional schedule. Of course I had meeting and things throughout the week, but I always felt that I was useless here and was nothing more than a paper pusher.

Anyway, this led me to find a design role in the same city. The matches the $73k I was making. This role wasn’t too bad, they kept me busy and I felt like I was in a role that actually mattered. However, I realized working 60 hours in this new city was killing my social life. I also randomly got homesick and decided to move back to my hometown so I found a job with a family friend and quit this one after 3 months. 

My current job back in my hometown pays $57k a year. We work a lot in marine applications which I find interesting. I took a significant pay cut but am in a LCOL area now and was actually able to purchase my first home in March (lived with a buddy for a few months to save up for closing costs). However, including me and the owner we have 6 civil guys. All other 5 have their PE license. I do not even have my FE (I’ve failed 3x and have to wait to take again, something that has made my boss angry). Not a lot of work seems to get to me, and all of done this calendar year (2024) is the occasional BMP stormwater inspection, post construction inspections, and maybe once a week I get something to do in AutoCAD. I have sat on my ass for most of my days here with nothing to do, and when I ask for more work my boss seems to get annoyed. 

Alright so my current predicament: another family friend owns a company doing marine surveying (inspected cargo shipments). He offered me 90k to come work for him. I would be working non-standard hours as ships come in at any hour of the day/night but would get my out of the office live which I am growing to hate. However, the thought of abandoning civil entirely after 7 years in it (including my 5 college years) is a scary step to take.

I want to take the new role. However, I’ve job hopped some and the fact that my current boss and my new boss are both people I have a personal relationship makes me nervous. 

Is it a good idea to take this new job?should I wait to quit for a while due to my relationship with my boss?

1cmg0mx,Want to give it a fresh start,"34M here. Completed my masters degree in computer science around 11 years back. Joined a digital media company right after as a campaign manager for global brands, focusing on mobile ads, working full time for over 2 years. It was a great company and paid well too.

Unfortunately, things were not going well towards the end, especially because of the toxic environment inside the new team I had joined and back then, I had no idea how to safeguard my best interests. The company was downsizing at the same time and I was asked to leave.

Went back to live with family and started freelance content writing to pay the bills. I'm still doing it for a UK company. With that being said, I'm feeling lost since then and have no idea which way to go.

My personal interests are in digital marketing and data analysis. How can I make a comeback to the job market? Is it too late to give it a shot? Is it possible to find something that aligns with my interests and also justifies my degree coursework at the same time?

bit of background. I've been with the company for 3 years, after 1 year I got promoted. These were the good times. My ex-boss is a difficult and toxic guy, the concept of managing up was quite new to me. I managed to keep going for 2 years. Having enough of this once I had crying people in my office, constant flipflopping on contract renewals and him cursing me out on a political snafu end of last year. I backed out of the lead role and took a breather. I watched everything go to shit last couple of months. Well my boss his kingdom got downsized so he got a new job and bailed. Now our Director has reached out to me and is asking me to step in to salvage. I've asked r/manager more on how do deal with the team [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1cmdu3s/asked_by_our_director_to_lead_a_sinking_ship_boss/).

Focusing on the meeting with my director I'm preparing a Confluence page. To discuss my contract, my boss offboarding, how to (re)organize the team and a list of important issues/project with priority & RAG.

One thing that would be difficult to discuss is and did not do Monday is my rate. They really need me for both this leadership role and technical knowledge I posses (as our architect just quit lol). I'm payed least of all contractors. However it's a really bad time in the company to discuss rates as we are in a merger and 50%+ of the contractors were let go.

I do not have a degree in any of the related fields, I have a bachelor's in translation. Besides, I lack experience, as during my university years, I was an ESL tutor and the idea of being in sales never crossed my mind till last year, as I hoped that my field would still prosper. A lot of the workplaces I've seen require having at least half a year (if not a year) of experience with a portfolio of documented successful sales outcomes. My only advantage is being bilingual, which is sought out in many companies. Is it too late for me to try starting my career in this field, considering the thought ""you should have thought of it sooner"" never ceases to bother my mind? I also heard that there can be 1 year classes, will having a certificate from there help me start my path in sales? Can there still be companies that accept people without experience or is it too much of a hassle? Is there still hope for someone who isn't a college student anymore or is it really something I should have considered back when I was getting my degree?

* The company is based abroad in a different time zone, which makes synchronous communication challenging
* In addition to still not having a work contract, I haven't received any log-in details for any internal company platforms, and I'm not sure how or even if I'll be getting any equipment for my HO (company laptop, etc.)

My community college offers the Associate of Applied Science Degree in Human Resources Management. This program includes earning a Human Resources Assistant Certificate after completing the 1st semester and a Human Resources Associate Certificate after completing the 3rd semester. I need 15 classes to complete the program because I've already taken 5 classes for my Associates of Science degree.

1cm5y88,MBA vs continuing work in UAE,"Hi redditors. I'm looking to get some honest advice as I am facing a severe career crisis and do not know what to do next.

I am a 27 y/o male from Pakistan.

**Academic Background:** Bachelor in Finance from a top school in Pakistan + CFA Charterholder

**Professional Experience:**

* 2 years at a top FMCG MNC in Pakistan in Finance: learnt treasury mgmt and finance business partnering
* 3 years in a fast-growing MENA startup in Finance in Nairobi and UAE (which I had to leave due to downsizing globally which severely impacted the business): built finance functions from scratch, worked on the company's IPO on Nasdaq, did post-merger integrations and led  FP&A for the group
* 1 year (currently working) at a somewhat low-profile B2B SaaS company in the UAE (having a good geographical footprint): leading FP&A, very involved in M&A
* Alongside my full time job, I consult a couple of companies part time; its a good way to stay intellectually stimulated, build a network and also make money on the side

**Other considerations:**

* A few years ago, I was seriously considering an MBA from Rotman (to eventually move to Canada). Ended up getting in with a 50% scholarship but then realized Canadian economy wasnt doing so well + I was doing well in my career so it did not make sense. Rotman also did not seem like a top school globally. I feel that I should do an MBA only from the top schools in the world for it to make sense with regards to the investment and opportunity cost.
* I have a good GMAT score \[750 (Q50 V41)\] thats valid till Dec 2025 (usable for 2026 Fall intake)
* My wife has a well paying and stable job in the UAE and so moving out of Dubai isnt the most exciting proposition but I am open to it. 

  
**The dilemma:**

I have been extremely unhappy with my current job due to a sheer lack of growth and a very weak employer brand. Additionally, I really havent learnt a thing in the past year that I have been here. Future prospects look very weak to me.

The job market has been extremely tough, with both a dearth of good opportunities (specifically in the startup space where I have spent the last few years) and also because everyone and their grandma wants to be in Dubai and so employers lowball everyone. I have been unable to secure something worthwhile + have been extremely unlucky with a few opportunities which almost worked out (long story). I feel I have had an amazing career and experience but I see things plateauing; my confidence is at an all-time low.

I have been researching on MBAs as quite a few of my friends and colleagues went down this route when they wanted a pivot, and my profile and GMAT seem good enough for a top school (still, fingers crossed; top MBA applications are no joke). But I am super skeptical about US MBAs specifically with the lottery program. I feel the investment is too big to be made if one doesnt eventually work in the US. The economy hasnt also been doing so well, evident from the shrinkage in MBB, big tech and general hiring trends from top schools.

  
Now the big question: what do I do next? MBA (I'm willing to consider only US M7s and INSEAD - should I be open to more options?) Do I keep trying my luck in the UAE job market? Are there other options I am not considering?

1cm5aeg,HR student seeking advice,"Hi everyone, I am currently a student double majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in Human Resources, and Sociology. I am set to graduate in about two weeks, and as you may be able to imagine, I am terrified. 

I initially wanted to go in to the field of social work as I have always felt very passionate about helping others; however, while I am going through this post-graduation crisis of trying to figure out what I want to do, I now feel that social work may not make me feel fulfilled in the long run due to the possible risks that comes with the job and high burnout. I feel like I am being selfish in making this decision- but I am now leaning more towards human resources.

I currently work as a supervisor in a cafe and unfortunately, I do not have any previous HR experience. I feel like I am already falling behind and would greatly appreciate some advice.

I’m looking into the SHRM-CP certification as well as the SHRM membership but I feel so lost. I hope some of you may be able to give me advice and answer some questions, anything is appreciated.

- Would you recommend studying for the SHRM-CP and taking the exam as a student who is about to graduate and doesn’t have any prior experience besides taking HR-related courses? Would it be a smart move? What is the process like?
- Is the SHRM membership worth it? As of right now, I qualify for the student pricing; however, I’m not sure if it would still apply after I graduate in two weeks
- What was your experience as someone coming into the field for the first time? What jobs were you able to land? How was the pay?
- What is your experience/timeline in being able to move up the ladder as a HR professional?
- Did you go back to school to obtain a Master’s in HR? If so, how soon did you go back after receiving your Bachelor’s? Any regrets/things you would’ve changed?
- What are the best companies to work for as a someone in HR?
- What should I look for while job searching?
- What skills do you believe are most important in your work?

Any other advice would also be greatly appreciated. I am confident that I am a good worker and can be successful; however, I am just terrified of what my future holds at the moment. 

Thank you in advance.

1cm406j,Engineering to Business?,"Hi, I just finished my junior year of chemE. Throughout this year, I have been thinking a lot about post-graduate plans and I really don't think I want to work as a process engineer/manufacturing/supply chain after finishing all of my technical classes. I am more interested in the business side of things (consulting, analytics, etc). I don't love chemE but I don't hate it -- don't really have a passion for it but too deep to drop out because of ROI (I'm a first generation, low income college student w/ financial aid + scholarships). Currently, I'm pursuing a minor in management, and I really enjoy economics and the business classes I've been taking.

I want to pick up a second major in econ (I only need 35 more credits) because I think I want to pivot into business right after graduation. If I do pick up the degree, I think I may graduate a semester late (I think my financial aid/scholarships will be able to cover the costs). I have had 1 internship in supply chain (did not enjoy) and 1 upcoming in R&D for a big food manufacturing company. Currently hovering around a 3.45-3.5 GPA.

Do you think an econ degree would be a waste of time? Should I work as an engineer post grad and learn all of the skills on the job and then pivot into management? Should I do a rotational program instead of picking up the econ degree to learn practical skills on the job? Is a chemE degree enough for me to pivot into business early?",ComfortableBet5981,2,0.7599999904632568,1,1715058387,2024-05-07 05:06:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cm406j/engineering_to_business/,5,2024

The only problem is that this new position is a “public trust” position where my responsibilities are going to become increasingly complicated and confidential in nature. Because the level of security clearance is higher, I am subject to an extensive background check through the FBI. 

Two years ago I got a DUI- the only major infraction on my record. It was horrible luck and not in my character to take such risks when it happened but I ended up getting a misdemeanor…it’s very shameful and the worst thing to happen to me in my life. There was no collision, no one got hurt and it was all very basic. I was pulled over during a routine traffic stop after a night out with a girlfriend. Very stupid and shameful…

In any case, I made sure to report it in my paperwork and I provided all of the documents they asked for proving that I had done my due diligence. It takes them a week each time to get back to me and it’s all making me very nervous now that I haven’t yet been cleared. 

Can anyone here shed some light on the seriousness of the situation? How worried should I actually be or is this all standard?

My schedule of classes is back to back until December and we are a small team of 10 so it’s not like I can ask for some space. 

I really want to quit but I’m a single mom and a homeowner and the career I want (teaching) isn’t in the cards right now. 

The only perks of my job that keep me going is that it’s work from home and that I make $62k. Other than that I do not enjoy my boss, I do not enjoy what I teach (health care) and I do not exactly feel like this job is stable with all of the changes. 

How do I learn to just push through this? I’m almost 40 and feel like I just need to suck it up and make the money. ",Conscious-Desk9957,11,1.0,10,1715041214,2024-05-07 00:20:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1clyj4f/how_do_i_learn_to_love_my_job/,5,2024
1cly3ij,Should I be concerned about padding my current salary to a new employer?,"I make $40K in my current position. 

My friend’s dad is the hiring manager at this company & asked me to apply, and my friend disclosed to me that the base pay for the position is $52K. Big deal for me!

They are going to hire me as I have a lot of relevant experience, but friend’s dad told me that his boss wanted to offer mid-$40K as I don’t have specific experience in this field.

I panicked at the disparity and told them that I am currently making mid-$40K. Friend’s dad was happy & told me he would use this as leverage and try to get me closer to the $52K mark. 

I feel I should not have padded that number and I really hope it doesn’t come back to bite me, but I know I’ll excel in this position. 

Anyone ever padded their salary and had it be an issue or non-issue? Please share. I hate being dishonest but also feel I needed to play the game!

1clw9n4,Making more on 2nd job than my own company?,"Hello, cross post so I can get more opinions 

So, weird situation and before diving into it, just want to point out that I'm very fortunate to have these things to ""complain"" or just question, so hopefully this doesn't come up as me complaining and being discontented.

Will try to be concise with my points:

I started a company with 4 people that we all co-founded it back in 2021. The company is now doing $1,500,000 in revenue per year, with 35-40% margins. With all the expenses, employee salaries etc, we can get around $2,000 per month as a ""salary"" for us 4.

In the early days of the company, I landed a remote job that now is paying me around $8,000 per month, but have no other benefits as in insurance, paid off time etc as it's in a different country.

I'm working around 10-12 hours per day as my most time goes in to the job where I need to be more focused since those people would not allow me to have a different job and mostly be exclusive, and I'm more flexible with the time on my company since I mostly manage people. But now I reached a point where I feel kinda trapped in this loop where I question myself if it's not worth just being more free with less money with the possibility of my company failing at some point or just grind it out for as much as possible on both since would be safer in case one fails.

What would you do? I'm 21, male, just having some burn out crisis perhaps and asking advice to probably smarter and experienced people who would see this more straight than I do right now.",SparePeach9794,1,1.0,4,1715034927,2024-05-06 22:35:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1clw9n4/making_more_on_2nd_job_than_my_own_company/,5,2024
1clw7gm,Should I accept their offer?,"Hey all!

  
Okay so I'm in marketing and have been working with the same company foe 3 years now. I love my work and the people I work with, it's 100% WFH, lots of flexibility, I've had 2 promotions in the 3 years I've been there (salary is shit though and we don't get raises, when I got promoted my salary went up like 2%). It's a pretty comfortable situation but...have you seen grocery prices lately? Also, it's a big company where each department has a specific task and I feel like I need to be touching on more aspects of digital marketing for the sake of my career. I am currently making $54 800 + bonus with brings me up to $64 800 before txs (I'm in Quebec, Montreal).

  
I started applying to other places and I went through 4 rounds of interviews with this company that's pretty popular with SMEs in Quebec. At my second interview I realized the job posting didn't include all tasks that I'd have on my plate, due to HR limiting how long the posting could be so the hiring manager had to cramp it up. That's actually good for me because I want to be more 360 in my tasks. Now where it gets tricky is that they didn't say in the posting that the job requires occasional travel (Montreal-Quebec city) so that's a 3 hour drive. and usually means staying overnight so you could be at the office at 8am. They say it's occasional travel but when I asked for a number, they said it could go anywhere from 5 to 8-9, anywhere from 1 night to 3 max. They said the person that was there before me traveled about 6 times that year.

  
Now the travel part is all payed for by the company, but I personally am not super down for it. I'm married (no kids yet) but have responsibilities, a senior father I go visit often, gym, friends and a life outside of work. Spending a few nights out of time to me means giving my time to the company, because it's never a 9-5 or 9-6 situation when you're out of time, it's dinner as well and events, and even though I enjoy my coworkers where I'm at right now, I prefer giving my time after work to my family > coworkers. I asked for a specific number or % of how much time I'd be required to travel per year, or how many nights, they couldn't give me one and said it depends. I asked if there's a maximum like damn...would 8 times go to 20 times per year? Since it's not in the contract, I'd like a maximum. They said I would never go over 10 max and that's stretching it.

  
Also note that I'd be required to work at the office 3 times per week, parking isn't paid for so I'm probably need to take the subway because it's impossible to find parking over there. Also, having worked from home for 3 years now, I'll need to buy a lot of new clothes and such, appropriate office attire basically. 

I also know that the workload is big, we're a small marketing team of 4 people (the others are in Quebec city), and one of the questions they asked me was if I'm the type of person to occasionally work longer hours if needed, I said if it's occasionnally, then yes, if needed.

  
So during my screening process (interview 1), they asked for salary expectations I said 75k. Now I know I'm currently the only candidate they have, and at 76k, knowing all of the above, which was not mentioned in the job posting, I'm thinking I should counter-offer with 80k?

1clvp4b,Promotion delays - valid or not?,"
We have two promotion cycles a year at my company, October and April. I've been speaking to my management about moving up a level in my role at a tech company since summer last year, really ramping it up and pushing them to put the process and framework in place to make it happen. They made supportive noises and started pulling together a framework. I dedicated myself to the process and filling out the competencies etc. I was told by my manager I fulfill 80-90% of those competencies for the higher level. 

I was confident the promotion would happen for the April cycle, but I was then informed by our Director that because it's a ""senior hire"" (still just an individual contributer, not even director), they would have to create a promotion board to vet the selection. I was disgruntled but learnt to live with it. 

I then found out that someone else who reports to another director has been promoted, without this promotion board being in place or having to go through the same level of scrutiny. 

This has sent me into a downward spiral mentally, I'm either seething (at my Director for delaying and then making things purposely difficult for me via promotion board) or disappointed/angry (at being treated differently - I'm a minority so these things creep up on you).

I have a good relationship with my VP, who the director reports to and have set a meeting with him to share how I perceive the process to be biased against me and being treated differently to other hires. I'm not quite sure what I expect the meeting outcome to be, but it's my job to present the situation, not come up with the answers?

I feel going to HR at this point would be premature. My manager is generally supportive and wants me to complete the framework conversation so we keep the ball rolling for the October promotion cycle, but honestly I will tell him I want to freeze that for now. I just don't feel it's right that I grin & bear it. 

Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated

1cltukr,"Looking to start over at 47. I'm a smart guy who can do almost anything, but I want to change fields. How have others tackled this?","I graduated from college in 2000 and worked for a couple of years as a laboratory chemist. I loved interacting with intelligent people every day, but needed to change careers in a hurry when I found out that the owners were doing quite a few questionable things. I found myself in car sales, making twice what a seasoned chemist with a masters or phd would make, at only 25 years old. I stayed in the car business for the next 18 years, the last 10 of which owning my own dealership. As part of that, I dabbled in manufacturing and, when I closed the dealership in 2020, I continued to manufacture and sell a few restoration parts. It has made me a decent living for the past 4 years but, the cars/boats I make parts for are aging-out, and sales have been steadily declining. 

I need to get into something that will give me 20 years of consistent income, but auto-sales is not the place for me. The current market is one that I don't want to participate in, and I hate living life on straight commission. I could easily handle any kind of technical sales but, again, I don't want to rely on straight commissions that depend on too many factors that are outside of my control. I've been out of the lab/science business for over 20 years now, so I don't think that much of my experience is relevant. If I had to do it all over again, I probably would have gone to school to be a mechanical engineer and not a biologist/chemist. The traditional education system really isn't for me, so I don't see myself going back to pursue another degree. 
 
I am someone who can, quite literally, do almost anything. I'm generally very humble, and nobody knows this outside of my wife and parents, but I have a super-genius level IQ and I can learn anything that I want to. As an autodidact, I would much rather just learn something on my own than sit in a traditional classroom. I have no idea, however, how to communicate this to prospective employers.

1cltm88,Decision Time: Stick with a Safe Promotion or Take a Risky Yet Exciting SECOND Lateral Senior Analyst Move?,"I’m facing a tricky career decision and could use some advice. I've been with my company for three years, starting as a senior analyst. My first lateral move within the company was incredibly rewarding—challenging and full of growth opportunities. However, after a recent internal reorganization, I've been shifted into a less exciting role focused on standardization and reporting. I'm still supporting my old BU but in a different area, so think of it as this: I did a Sr role for a year, and then laterally moved to a Sr for 2 years, and now I'm due for a promotion.

In my current role, I was promised a promotion by December, which would elevate me to a level just below management. Yet, I've just been offered another role that mirrors the one I loved: dynamic, full of stakeholder interaction, and highly strategic. The downside? It's another senior position, with a promise of promotion in 12 months—pending stellar performance. This means the BEST case is that I leave the Sr role after FOUR YEARS and little to no pay increase, and the worst case is that I don't get promoted at all, which would be a double miss and then what?

I have three choices: - Say no, stay in current role and push hard for December promotion - Say yes, take new exciting role and kick ass for a May 2025 promotion, putting me at four years Sr - Say yes, IF they make it a promotion vs lateral. If they say no, then I say no

1cltj6l,First job & mistakes ,"Hello,

I have my first real job as a data analyst/biostatistician for a really intense and prestigious PI at a really intense and prestigious university. This is my first real job out of a masters program (I am 24.)

I am 7.5 months in and I feel like I have made so many mistakes it’s embarrassing. My PI is old and very mean (he yells) and will have days where I’m “so fast” and “he can’t keep up!” and then have days where I’m too slow and I make many mistakes. 

While some of these mistakes are from him changing his mind later on from initial instructions, 90% of the mistakes are from me. And I fix them, admit to them, and have been doing so much better. But I feel so dumb. Everyone else at my job is much older than me and has been there for years and has told me that they’ve been yelled at too. 


Now that I have reached almost the 8 month point, I feel like I should be doing better. I have implemented many new ways for me to avoid mistakes that have been working. However I feel like I have already embarrassed the shit out of myself and now I am being seen as dumb. I have done many good things too and I know this and I do not think I’m at risk for being fired at all, but I feel so incompetent. I love my job, I love coding, but I’m starting to think that maybe I picked the wrong career. 

Is 7.5 months in too late to just be getting better? Am I forever going to be branded as someone who makes many mistakes because of my first year of work? I just feel really disappointed in myself. My supervisor (not PI) is much kinder to me and has expressed my weakness and strengths but my PI sees me as a moron. When is too late in the first job to still be learning? Am I being too slow? :-( ",Substantial_Bee_3993,1,1.0,0,1715028077,2024-05-06 20:41:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cltj6l/first_job_mistakes/,5,2024

1clsmrl,38M Sales engineer - wondering what to do after 2 dead-end jobs,"Hello,

So I'm a 38 yo sales engineer, been in the role for 12 years now, and having the position of Senior Sales Engineer in a tech company for the european region. Before that I was software engineer. 

I have been in this company for 1,5 years now, they came to hire me from my previous job and were very convincing and provided a salary upgrade especially on the commission side. However for the last 4 years my fixed income has been rather flat. 

I decided to make the move because at my previous company they were laying off people and they killed the line of product I was expert on and refused to make me move to the other core business. Needless to say I felt in a dead end. 

Recently I learnt that the situation in my new company, despite what was told, is worst than expected and that the prospects for my future in short / medium term are not very good for me. I've not received a raise, no one has been promoted, and while I'm considered good performer the future is not looking very bright. I also have a more important workload than many people in my team.

I'm a bit tired of this situation. It seems to happen in every company nowadays. 

In my current position the career management is really awful, my manager did not set any goals or objective for my progression, training for new skills in my job is non existent and they seem to absolutely not give a shit about people.

Thinking of my next move I want to be sure to have the right approach, whether it is to have a direct conversation with my management stating clearly my situation and expectations, or if I start to interview somewhere else. 

Has anyone been in this kind of situation ? Any advices ?

1clskjv,How to deal with a controlling senior coworker ,"This coworker has been trying to show his “seniority” over me ever since he joined, but his behavior is starting to devolve even more day by day. Here are some of his unhinged behaviors that have driven me up the wall:

1. Asked me to share a presentation I was working on, and then proceeded to tell my manager I shared it with him for feedback. He then setup a meeting to give me “critique”, and basically tear down my work. I ended up presenting the same presentation to 40+ people with minor changes and it went great. 

2. Asked out loud in front of my team if I am really going to be the one facilitating a meeting with the VP out of “curiosity” since all of us are well equipped to present. 

3. Mobbed up with my manager to provide unfair and untimely criticism on a project he joined midway. Held up a deliverable because he just “didn’t understand”.

4. Took over said project while I was on PTO for a couple days. 

5. Kept mansplaining me about how the professional world is different than academia. I am a mid-level employee with work experience who just finished grad school. 

6. I have been doing pm work now for an event segment which is outside my area of expertise/what i was hired for. I have been leading and planning in-depth. He sees my plan document and sends a message that he looks forward to seeing a different format because he doesn’t “understand” this. 

7. Went on to criticize me again in front of clients saying my plan is “too complicated”. 

8. Barked orders at me during an update meeting with the VP to make it seem like he has been giving me direction on this event work all along. Saying “You got that scorpiorising” after everything my VP said. 

9. Went and created an alternate formatted version of a plan I had already approved with my manager and shared with the client. 

He is in his 50s and I can’t imagine how insecure he must feel to keep throwing his weight around unnecessarily. I find it extremely difficult to respect someone like this. Unfortunately, he is providing “communication coaching” to my manager who doesn’t have expertise in my field so has to rely on him and they are both teamed up. He is zero help with his own history of abusive behavior. My anxiety is triggered, but I am unsure how to curb this? I am actively looking for a new job, but anticipate being here for at least a couple more months.

1clscrz,My company thinks the OT I work for the year is part of my bonus. ,"My company thinks the OT I work for the year is part of my bonus. They feel that they're giving me some of my bonus ""up front"".  I'm thinking that it shouldn't be the case. I work OT not only to be able to fulfill the requirements of hitting the goal of 1,800 billable hours in order to ""be considered an effective and contributory member to the company"" but because my position is extremely busy and to not let things get behind. I am salaried, billable and am able to get OT which is generous, but it goes with the job based on their requirements in order to meet certain standards. There's 144 non billable hours for company holidays and PTO that I need to make up for to reach the 1,800 billable hour goal, so that also quantifies OT. What are your thoughts on this? If I'm completely wrong, please tell me as I feel a little defeated on this situation. I absolutely LOVE my job but its hard to not have some sort of reaction to this.

UPDATE: I received a response to my email stating that I was doing an in-depth analysis of my OT and the 1,800 billable hours requirement. ""If someone is billing very low hours but they are really all in getting done what WE THINK is important, they are more valuable.  The fact that we provide objective things you can touch to measure how hard you work is only ONE SMALL part of the equation...My advice to you about how to be perceived as more valuable is to prioritize the things that WE think are valuable.  Sometimes, you have ideas on things that you consider valuable, that we don’t value to the same degree...""

Um...I think this is saying I need to anticipate what they think is valuable...I guess I should go to the non-existent company bulletin board that lists out what is valuable to them or become a mind reader - either way, its on me, and I failed if I didn't guess correctly.

1clrvfs,Feedback on toxic MFG environment,"Post: 
So this is a long post…


I was onboarded onto a carpet company in 2022 as an Industrial engineer. My degree was in Mechatronics engineering, no background in manufacturing or process improvement. Salary was pretty good for a starting position, so I went with it.  I was fresh out of college and I wasn’t given very clear guidelines beyond “make it better” or “automate.” I am listed as “Continuous Improvement” leader. For context, my plant manufactures and distributes carpet, vinyl, wood, and laminate samples boards. These boards could have anything from 8-30 different color squares on them based on what marketing tells manufacturing to produce. It’s also highly seasonal, and the product distribution has very little rhyme or reason to it aside from a new market trend or customer priority. 

My role was and kind of still is ambiguously defined for the longest time. For a while, I reported to the VP of operation and really, whatever CI projects he wanted was what I focused on. He told me that my role is to “push” the supervisor leadership team across the manufacturing/distribution and hold them accountable for change for the better. He uses the corporate buzzwords “5S, LEAN, Six sigma” but generally has very little true understanding of how complex the manufacturing process truly is or what six sigma actually requires from an organization-wide approach. 

Gradually, over time, my role has become more the “go-to guy” when someone wants to find some sort of financial cost justification for an idea they have, or, more accurately, an idea which they are pressured to implement by higher ups who don’t understand what we do. People have been obsessed with the “automation” buzzword for years. The higher ups don’t understand that we produce high-mix, low volume products to the point that we are almost like a custom shop in terms of our seasonality and variance. I’ve tried to be someone who has a listening ear and learning our manufacturing processes rather than doing the top-down, “crack the whip” approach. We just had 50% of our overall capital budget taken away, and there is constant pressure from the higher ups to “automate” the plant. THe current CFO is also obsessed with cost savings…To the point that he won’t approve maintenance projects such as new required batteries or machinery without showing that we are actively reducing current costs. Also, any project that is more than a year break-even point is almost never going to be approved. We literally have a battery energy assessment from 2019 that showed all of the batteries which are half dead…Not a single battery was replaced or has been replaced since wanting to save costs for the fiscal year. 

I’m the only engineer/continuous improvement person in the plant. All of the leadership in the plant has been there for 10-30 years. Company literally has a reputation for never firing people.  My boss’s boss moved up the chain and my boss was moved into a new position so he moved me under a different supervisor. He told me my role doesn’t change, but he moved me to report directly under the supervisor of manufacturing. Keep in mind, these supervisors report to him, so it essentially was a demotion on the corporate chain. He also is incredibly bad at understanding people, so he didn’t understand why moving me under a MFG supervisor completely changes the dynamic. 

This new boss basically skips the essential steps of “Define, Measure, Analyze” and now tells me what she thinks the solution is (even if it doesn’t make sense.) She gives me a list of her wants (like ambiguously defined automation) and asks for cost saving estimates.  I once approached her about one of her projects which would produce a ton of cost with no payback. I told her that I’ve been consulting some of our floor workers and just getting a feel for the process. She tried to set up a meeting with all of the other potential stakeholders and keep me out of the meeting to basically bully them into her idea. I politely asked her about it and we butted heads pretty hard. Then, after a  couple weeks, she told me in our 1on1 that “shes been thinking about this really deeply and she’s come to the conclusion that the project doesn’t make sense.” Which in my mind is just her wanting to take credit for decisions.

My role is still ambiguously defined enough to where people in different departments try to use my time. I literally had someone from the financial department tell me that his standard costing project was now my project. The new financial guy regularly calls me up and asks me what he’s supposed to do when doing financial analyses of these projects. On Tuesday, I had 6-7 different people call me, asking for help on different new projects and asking for things by the end of the day. This was only in the morning. I also don’t really get credit for any of these things.

I’ve been trying to implement a true LEAN six sigma kind of project approach for the past couple of years. I legitimately feel like I’m set up for failure. I was given 0 guidance about processes so I had to literally teach myself about how everything runs and works in the manufacturing side. I’m working on obtaining my Six Sigma green belt certification now, and it’s reiterating just how far behind things are. We have no labor management system so random sample time studies are the closest thing I have to being able to be data driven. Bosses love meetings here, and 90% of the time it doesn’t get anything done. 

 I know that I am far from a perfect engineer and that I have a lot to learn, but am I crazy or is this a toxic work environment? Don’t most places have dedicated continuous improvement teams? I don’t have any sort of baseline to compare it to since this is my first job out of college. 

 I have been applying for other jobs for some time, but it’s felt like a really tough market. I want to actually do something related to my major, which is robotics/automation oriented, but I’m scared that I’m stuck because I don’t have experience that’s truly relevant to that. I’m in a field that I really don’t want to be in, and in an environment that really doesn’t allow me to have a change or at least get credit for that change.

1clrlci,Applied to dozens of jobs and can't let a single interview. ,"Hi there, everyone. I have applied to 55+ job listings in the past two months and can barely get a call back, let alone progress to the interview stage. I'm lucky if I even receive so much as an automated rejection email. I realize the job market is extremely rough out there right now, but even my safety net/low-hanging fruit applications are going nowhere so I figure I must be doing something wrong. 

For context, I work in marketing and PR. I graduated with my Bachelor's in 2018 with a double major in Public Relations and English and a 3.98 GPA. I have over 6 years of experience working as part of an in-house marketing team, where I developed a broad set of skills. I am Google Ads and Google Analytics certified (through SkillShop), I have experience in HTML/CSS/Java/Shopify Liquid, have built and managed multiple custom Shopify and WordPress websites, have managed entire departments and multiple third party agencies, and have managed multi-million dollar marketing budgets. I also have graphic design experience (Canva, PhotoShop, InDesign, Premiere Pro) as well as video creation/post-production experience (wrote scripts, staged, and directed several commercials and edited the final the cut in Premiere). I've done copywriting, SEO, social media, PPC, event planning—you name it, I've done it at this point. 

I currently work as Marketing Director for a medium sized luxury home goods company. They hired me fresh out of college as a marketing assistant and I've since worked my way up to Director, where I now manage the department and report directly to the VP and CEO. The company is based in NYC but I relocated cross-country during COVID and now work remote. I have to travel to NYC on a regular basis and it's starting to wear on me, so I'm eager to find a new role in my local city.

The two callbacks I've received so far turned out to be scams/MLMs (""We offer you an EXCLUSIVE OPPORTUNITY to start your own *turnkey business*! Start earning up to $10k per week!"" type of crap).   
  
I really don't know what I'm doing wrong. I write cover letters and tailor my resume for every application, which of course is incredibly time-consuming—so to not even get a single interview after over 55 applications is disheartening. Is that I'm simply not specialized enough? Is marketing dead? Are companies resorting to freelancers over hiring someone in-house? (I've definitely observed this to be true since COVID, but still, they're obviously posting the positions...)

1clqi8f,Transitioning from Aerospace Engineering to Software Engineering,"Howdy :)

**TL:DR -** I'm looking for help on how to transition from the Aerospace Industry to the Tech Industry.  I have experience doing embedded software development, but the architecture of many tech stacks in the tech industry is very different. I have applied for an MS in Computer Science, and have been studying LeetCode and applying to jobs, but I'm struggling to get my foot in the door for even a first-round interview at tech companies.

# Background

I'm an Aerospace Engineer with 5 years of experience. I've been working primarily on modeling/simulation software and embedded flight software.  I have a good understanding of C/C++ and MATLAB/Simulink as well as DevOps infrastructure (at least compared to my peers in the industry, which are comparatively old-schooled and slow to adopt new technologies).  A lot of the work I do is writing flight code and then integrating that onto our flight hardware and testing that hardware in a simulation environment.  This demands strong knowledge in how operating systems and electrical communication protocols work, as well as requiring a solid understanding of how to simulate these systems (AKA I need to know the physics behind how these vehicles fly and how the various subcomponents like sensors and actuators work) such that I can accurately model these systems in our simulation environments.

After 5 years in the industry, I've felt like I've reached my wits end with Aerospace.  I think there's cool problems to solve but I get frustrated by how monolithic and glacially-slow the pace of innovation is.  All of the big ""primes"" (Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, etc.) are so sleepy, and there's so much bureaucracy and a frustrating ""this is how we do things around here because we've been doing this for 60 years"" mentality that permeates the industry that I just can't bear anymore.  

I also feel like I'm a very profit-driven person.  I feel like I'm reaching the top of what I can expect as far as compensation (currently at $125k/yr, which is entirely salary).  I've set the goal of doubling my salary within the next 5 years, and I know this is achievable (although definitely NOT realistic in the Aerospace industry).  I am also REALLY interested in working for a company that offers equity, as I feel like that motivates me to do my best work, as I have vested interest in the success of the company.  This is VERY uncommon in the Aerospace industry. You might be given a 401(k) match in company stock but the defense primes are so large that it doesn't feel like I'm really getting anything - nothing I do in my day-to-day work will have an impact on how much a company like Lockheed Martin is worth in the next few years.

For all of these reasons (and because I'm passionate about integrating new technology into compelling products as well as computer science in general), I've decided that I should transition my career more into Software Engineering, specifically in the tech industry.

It seemed like getting a Masters in Computer Science (even though my undergraduate degree is in Aerospace Engineering) would be a great way to prove (and extend) my foundational knowledge in computer science.  I've already applied to a few different Masters of Computer Science programs but haven't heard back yet. These programs typically will last 3-4 years, but can be completed concurrently with a full-time job.

In the meantime, I'd like to find positions more immediately in the tech industry, but I'm find it very challenging to 1) find positions I qualify for or 2) hear anything back from recruiters.  I've only gotten far enough to have one technical coding interview, which went relatively well, but was my first-ever coding interview.  I certainly need more practice before I would find those interviews easy.  I'm doing LeetCode questions daily and have taken a course in data structures and algorithms to help prepare me for these technical interviews (as well as prepare me for doing my MS), but I feel like I'm never even getting my foot in the door to get to the technical interview to begin with.

I'm worried that the tech industry is looking for skills and technologies that I simply haven't cultivated in the Aerospace industry.  Many roles are looking for 1000 different front-end frameworks (for front-end positions) or extensive knowledge of cloud infrastructure or distributed computing (for back-end positions).  Full-stack positions seem to be looking for both (that's understandable). All of my experience working on software in Aerospace Engineer has been focused primarily on embedded systems (AKA cloud infrastructure is NOT a thing for how our software operates), and there really is no ""front-end"" element of these systems.

I feel like I can write strong code, and have good understanding of how the code I write ends up getting executed on the machine it's written for, but I worry this knowledge is lost behind the candidates that have all the buzzwords on their resumes.

# Questions

Any advice for how to find a software engineer role that isn't necessarily in the Aerospace field? Am I being too cynical with my perspective here?

I thought that perhaps I could transition more towards the robotics or some other industry that demands software integration onto hardware (like self-driving cars, etc.), because that is a happy blend between my current knowledge (integrating software onto embedded systems) with a more tech-focused and forward-thinking industry, which perhaps I could then transition fully into SWE from there? 

I had briefly considered quitting and going to a bootcamp and just hard-pivoting to something like front-end of full-stack web-dev, but I worry that bootcamps just teach you the immediate skills without giving you the underlying understanding for how or why these systems are designed.

Am I even asking the right questions? Do I have my priorities all wrong? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as I definitely feel impostor syndrome even though I consider myself a software engineer :(

1clqaoe,what to do when manager constantly (re)does all of your work,"so my job is mainly writing. i have 2 degrees in comm, one is a graduate degree. my manager has essentially no expertise in writing or digital comm (social media sort of stuff), whereas i did have significant exposure to it in my nearly 8 years of university. don't get me wrong, not everything I write is perfect, but before coming to this job i was confident i knew what i was doing. Now i question both my abilities and my worth daily. so. anyhow, manager continues to absolutely demolish-- not edit-- but totally rewrite everything i write. less than 20% of what i write remains by the time they're done with it. the reason they are the boss is bc they've been here longer and previously before my position existed, they had the writing responsibilities tacked onto the end of their job description bc no one else was around to do it. the company is very very small and our team is less than 5 people. so no one else can edit / it's their responsibility to do it, but every day i feel extremely invalidated and like i don't know how to write despite doing really well at it in school n at all my previous jobs and internships. I'm at my wits end but I can't leave because if I do...well, a lot of my student loan stuff is contingent upon my job and income so if i have to leave, i need a job in this very specific field to keep my payments at bay and keep some forgiveness in my future. so. idk this sucks and it's really negatively affecting my mental health because i feel very trapped and hopeless and like i'm not good at anything that i worked SO HARD to learn and establish in school. Also. did talk with hr at one point n it got me nowhere but having to confront my boss and for maybe 2 days things seemed better but now they're back to being awful- all the same things are happening and more frequently. Any advice is really appreciated. I feel so scared of being at work and constantly painting myself in a bad light by not doing exactly what my boss wants-- and yes, i have asked but the expectations just keep shifting and contradicting so everything i do ends up being ""wrong"" and needs totally redone i guess",tireddxwner,1,0.6700000166893005,8,1715020135,2024-05-06 18:28:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1clqaoe/what_to_do_when_manager_constantly_redoes_all_of/,5,2024

1clpbmc,I'm always chasing something new. How do I find what I like?,"I graduated with an associates in Biotech and a lab techniques certificate. I don't officially get either of these until I complete an internship. I currently have an associates in science as well. I found an internship by accident, and it's three months long. I'm halfway through it right now and while it was interesting at first since everything was new and I was learning how it all worked, I'm now on my own and I'm not so sure I like it. It's mainly chemistry, and I don't actually have to know chemistry, but I hated it in school. I'm working as a lab tech and I know I could find another company to work for as a lab tech, but I'm starting to doubt myself on if this is what I want to do.

College was hard for me because I didn't know what I wanted to do. I switched several times which I know is normal, but the only reason I landed in Biotech is because of the drastic overlap in credits with my associate of science degree. I'm starting to think I don't actually enjoy anything and no matter what I do the novelty will ware off and I'll be looking for something else. I'm not sure what to do with myself. If I stay at this company I feel an obligation to stay for a year, since they didn't want to hire me if I wasn't going to stay a while (hence the internship), but if I leave I don't know what I'd do. 

There are many pros and cons to this job. The pay is the most I've ever been paid hourly, the people are nice, the culture seems good so far, my shift goes by fairly fast since there's always something to do which I like. But I just turned 22, and I'm not sure I could live off this income if down the line I wanted to move out of my parents house. It's a little far from where I live, I don't feel passionate about the work, and I can't tell if I like it or like that I'm capable of doing it. 

The hiring manager (and I agree) said the benefit of this internship is that it's a win-win if I stay or leave. They get my labor either way, but if I leave then it wasn't a permanent position and if I stay they get me for a while. The thing is that I don't like feeling indebted to a company. I don't know if I'll like it three more months from now. I don't know if I'll resent it three more months from then. I'm not sure I want to be here a long time, even a year. 

I'm just having a hard time figuring out what I want to do for a career. I know the degree you get doesn't mean you have to stay in your field, but I'm just so lost on what to do or what I like. I know I like science, I enjoy learning about biology, but I've always questioned if I just like learning it or if I want it to be my job. I'm wondering if I should've gone the medical route or mental sciences route. But school was hard enough to get through I don't think I'd go back just yet. 

I just need a push in the right direction and any advice that could help me out. ",cliticaltypo,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1715017755,2024-05-06 17:49:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1clpbmc/im_always_chasing_something_new_how_do_i_find/,5,2024
1clpa19,Should I (M27 and unemployed) accept the job offer n move or stay with my girlfriend (F24) of 1 year? ,"Hi,

I moved across the country for a job about a year n a half ago. I got laid off from that job due to budget cuts. I’m currently residing in a smaller city that has no opportunities for my type of work (data analysis). I have a about 4 years of experience in the type of work that I do.

My girlfriend of 1 year is in law school here (1 year n a half left) and has a summer law job. She doesn’t want to stay in this town for work either once she’s done (it’s mostly just a college city).

I feel very conflicted because she’s pretty much great to me and we get along well. She envisions us getting married and the family loves me.

The position I’m getting offered has the title “manager” in it and I feel like it’s a big step in the right direction. 
Given that I’m unemployed and there’s no work for me in this area and I’m living at my grandparents place, I feel like I should take the offer but I’m not sure because I haven’t been put in this position before.

1cloc4j,Company is eliminating manager roles and placing more work on contributors. How to proceed?,"I work for a prominent cyber security company. I won't get into too much detail, but some relevant history that occurred in the past year are as follows:

- changed and limited our bonus structure
- plan to open an offshore office and hire cheap developers en mass
- eliminating manager roles and moving people around to different teams or roles, or letting them go.

My team is being hemoraged as we really benefit from a manager but they are being forced to a higher level role and directly told not to aid us.. Or do basic manager duties. Makes no sense since their title is still manager.

 I'm just wondering if anyone has thoughts or ideas around this situation, have similar experiences, and what we can do on our team? 

We really aren't happy with these changes and we are already lacking a role or two on our team as it is. It feels like they want us to manage ourselves and do our normal work at the same capacity and it takes many more hours in the week to do this now. We take more time in JIRA and less time doing work now. Our JIRA situation is a mess and admittedly it takes hours organizing work without someone dedicated to helping. We often chase down people for answers and get none without our manager as people take them seriously.

This is seen as a net negative for our work delivery. How do we communicate this to the business to back our manager who we all see as crucial to our success?

1clnq1l,Confused at a crossroads as a fresh electronics engineer ,"Hey 

I graduated last year as an electrical engineer and life has given me some jobs here and their . I had a job in the electronics sector (embbeded hardware) which i hated . Got laid off due to some company financial problems. It took me 7 months since to find a job and i have been able to secure 2 of them and at a crossroads which one could be better in financial, security, life and career aspects. I can't fumble around either hence I'm looking for vetern electrical engineers to guide me which path to chose. 

First company that i secured job in is a consultancy based in the UK that does substation designs , cable layouts , earthing and other aspects with respect to the DNO/IDNO requirements. Alot of power distribution planning is required and the work is kinda fun . As I'm not in the UK i some experience here could land me a job somewhere in the future in the UK with UK power networks or northern power grid if i have a good grip on the job 

Second job i got selected for is an oil refinery with a year of training program . I have previously done an internship here and loved it . It involved broadly understanding process,  doing Corrective and preventive maintenance, understanding work to permit , instrumentation drawings PNiD diagrams and SAP system. The field work was amazing as well. This might perhaps be one of the biggest refinery's in my country.

Which one should I go for . I enjoy both equally but my ultimate goal is to make good amount of money and be able to move out of my country as their is literally no future here it's terrible and everyones main objective is to leave as soon as possible . In my eyes and i could be naive . I could work with the power one and could get a masters after a year or two and would most like secure a job in the UK DNO . On the other side i could complete training with the refinery and get hired as a engineer and move out to Aramco or aim for Chevron or Oxy as a instrumention and maintenance engineer. Maybe get a masters in process control somewhere along the way.

Which one is more lucrative direction to take please help 😂 (work life balance, money, future,peace) 🙏

1clm7wq,Should I do Bachelor's in Computer Science or Master's in Data Science?,"Hello. I need your advise about my future studies. 

I have finished my bachelor's in Economics recently and I want to be a data scientist. However, I am troubled, should I do bachelor's in Computer Science or in Master's in Data Science?

My GPA is 3.22/4 and I have to admit, I have a really low score in Statistics. To compensate this, I have taken online courses and learnt what I do not know. I value the knowledge and I wanted to actually know Statistics. I have 80+ scores in Mathematics, Calculus and Econometrics. I got really fond of them when covid lockdown ended. 

My English is really good, because all the studies at my university are in English. I can say my level is C1. 

I also have done a 6 month internship as a data scientist. However, it was a really narrow specialisation and only thing I did was learn algorithms and practice them on already sorted data. I realised its narrowness when I finished it and I could not fit into any data scientist job descriptions.

I want to pursue my education abroad, outside of my country (which is not english-speaking). I already sent my documents to one university for Master's in Data Science and they refused to approve me as I ""do not have proper knowledge"". I know that maybe only that university is rejecting me and maybe some other one will confirm but now I have another thought.

Will it be better if I do another bachelor's but in Computer Science? It will give me all the core knowledge I need, I can go many ways from there, not only towards data science. Additionally, my mentor at the internship said that com. science students get hired more than eco students.

My school grades are really great, I was a valedictorian. The only valedictorian in my class actually. I have all the right documents and the consultant girl I am working with on this matter, says that I will get accepted easily.

I just want other opinions about this.

1clkx69,How can I address situation with HR if it seems like company is making money off of me? ,"

For a background I work as a language interpreter, and all my managers were language interpreters with the same company. I work as needed, i get all the bonuses, certifications, praises from my management(we get weekly report of our work and I am always the #1). But it seems like they promote everyone except me. With my background the hourly wage is quite low 14.5 bucks an hour. I requested raise - they said other than bonuse they cant offer me anything else. Then I let my managers know that if a position like this opens to let me know, but they didnt because I got email from HR yesterday that someone else who worked less in this company than me got promoted instead. 
They already know how I work, and that I always follow guidelines, but nothing seems to work. As if they dont wanna do anything. From one side I am afraid that if I leave this job im not gonna find anything better.

My boss told me that one of our customer coordinators is going to be leaving at the end of June. He told me that instead of hiring someone new, they want to have me train this lady on how to do my job and I would replace the person leaving at the end of June. 

This would completely change my job and responsibilities. I specifically got this job for experience in the role I am doing and do not want to change positions. I have not told my boss this yet because I needed time to think. 

He told me that I would be getting a “raise” by needing to work one more hour a day, from 7 to 5 as opposed to 7 to 4. That also doesn’t sit right with me as I don’t really view that as a “raise”. 

Overall I don’t know how to approach this as I don’t want to somehow be let go if I don’t do what they want, but I know that I am getting more experience in the role I am doing now vs what I would be doing.

1cljgx7,Struggling with work and my health,"I've been working at a regional bank in the Middle East for nearly three years now (I am a  26F), and I've encountered some challenges recently that have left me feeling frustrated, undervalued, and questioning my career path.

I've been deeply involved in a crucial project at the bank, spearheaded by our deputy CEO, aimed at implementing significant changes. This project has been consuming much of my time for the past two months, often requiring me to work late into the night to meet deadlines. Despite my dedication and efforts, the feedback I received during the test run draft presentation to our CEO was kind of harsh. I didn’t know every number and it was kind of embarrassing. 

While my managers reviewed the concept of my work, the numbers were not thoroughly reviewed, except by my direct manager. Sometimes, I feel like my direct manager may not be as knowledgeable as the executives, which adds to my frustration. Additionally, I struggle with comparing myself to my peers, despite receiving recognition in the form of a special bonus, salary increase, and a recent promotion.

However, I still feel undervalued and constantly find myself getting sick due to work-related stress. I have an anxious personality, and the stress from work exacerbates it. Since starting this project, I've been sick three times, and it's taking a toll on my physical health. I'm beginning to wonder if this career path is truly right for me, or if I'm simply unable to cope with the demands of the job.

Has anyone else experienced similar challenges in their career? How have you dealt with feelings of inadequacy, health issues due to stress, and doubts about your career path?

I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights you could share.

If I try to explain why it's impossible (""I'm already neck-deep in the things you needed done last week,"" or ""This project requires input from John who is out this week""), his response is usually along the lines of, ""The Big Boss needs it,"" or ""It's simple; it shouldn't take more than 30 minutes."" Well, yeah, if I had John's input or if I had literally nothing else on my plate.

This morning I got an email from him at 11:43pm last night (Sunday) asking, yet again, for something that needed to be ""wrapped up first thing this morning."" 

Naturally he wants updates on why previous projects aren't getting completed (Um, because you keep telling me to drop them to work on something else). It wouldn't be so bad if he understood why nothing is getting finished because of this way of operating, but when I tried having a ""come to Jesus"" with him on Friday last week and he kept cutting me off saying ""You're being ridiculous. Just stop with the nonsense.""

2024 will be my 10 year anniversary with the company. I haven't had a raise in 7 years and doubt I ever will, and yes--the pay was crap when I started. I'd LOVE to just up and quit but there are perks that come with the job, such as being able to work from home and a flexible schedule, not to mention I'm 55 now and just don't want to start all over again with a devil I don't know. He wasn't like this until about a year ago. 

Any advice on how to handle this? What to say or do to get him to understand that things take time to get done?

I’m in my 50s working w a younger team, and now wondering if  I was a pity hire? 

The first two weeks, which were training, were the best onboarding experience I’ve ever had. My boss had schedules and days full of meet n greets, meetings and trainings and met with me at the end of every day.

Last week, though, was radio silence. It was bizarre and I feel so unsettled about it. She gave nothing but positive feedback, but barely spoke to me. She assigned me work going into August, but I could do all of it in a few hours

I haven’t worked in house in so long. I’m a nervous wreck. I want them to like me. I’m probably trying too hard. I really need this job because I have to now take care of my mom

This is one of those Best Places to work, but two people on my team of 8 were out sick for almost a week each. Other team members seem unhappy and don’t talk much. There’s a weird vibe

My much-younger boss is posturing. She gives me laughable feedback on my work that I humor because I realize she needs to make it look like she is needed and managing

The amount of work the dept does, which is in a project mgmt tool, I could do all by myself in a week

Everyone works remote and, I guess, they are all just milking the situation. 

I should do that, too, right? Just shut up and go along? Don’t make noise or waves?

I’m not really looking into corporate jobs for now but I’m interested in finding jobs in customer service or retail just to build some working experience. I’ve had 6 months of internship prior to my studies and there were quite honourable achievements but I don’t know it that counts as working experience and if I can use it in my resume. 

Overall, I'm wondering how to explain my employment gap as a fresh graduate and whether it's normal to apply for jobs after several months.",Snoo-42199,0,0.5,5,1714974046,2024-05-06 05:40:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1clblou/how_do_i_explain_my_employment_gap_as_a_fresh/,5,2024
1clasq5,How to (gracefully) quit a startup job?,"I've learned a lot in the past two years, but I'm burned out. I've had enough of this job (software engineering at a startup). Planning to take a few months off to travel, study for a professional certification, and recruit for jobs at a company with a better work culture.

I know that the standard notice period is two weeks, but I'm nervous that this will not be enough:

* I'm in charge of a couple projects, one of which will be particularly difficult to hand off since it involves a new technology that nobody else has experience with
* Parts of our infrastructure are a total kludge; replacing a specialist with years of experience will be difficult
* Management has expressed that they expect me to promote me (to Engineering Lead, FWIW) in the next few months. I'm afraid of pissing them off; the company is still relatively small (20 engineers when I joined), they invested a lot in me, and I'll need some of them to write me rec letters eventually.

So how do I quit gracefully? Is there to say besides ""I'd like to leave soon""?",pt1090,2,1.0,3,1714970960,2024-05-06 04:49:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1clasq5/how_to_gracefully_quit_a_startup_job/,5,2024
1claos4,How can some switch out of healthcare but halfway through college?,"I’m (21F) currently going to be “senior” in college this fall. My college goals were to work in healthcare…. I’ve grown to realize I’m not a people person, and I hate healthcare 😭 (I’m currently working as a CNA in a hospital)

I had thought about switching to accounting, engineering or Computer Science in my sophomore year because it fits my personality type. I notice my best work are in environments with little distractions. Ive consider accounting because both my parents are accountants. But I’ve been talked out it multiple times by my mother who is in corporate accounting. For mainly of the toxic work culture, pay and long hours. CS apparently all I’ll find is low paying IT job. 

I’m so confused what to do. All of my credits can get me into any nursing or X-ray program. But I have zero desire to do it 😭😭. I’ve considered other options like lab technician with the experience I have (Lab techs don’t make a whole a lot and very little advancement) But the desire to be in the healthcare field is GONE. The pointless drama between coworkers , families, patients, long hours etc. 

Any advice on how to proceed while still in college and working this job?

1claofi,Thinking about changing jobs,"I’m a sales rep for a semi conductor distributor. I’m closing up on 2 years, at this company, and starting to see the writing on the wall for a lot of our senior reps retiring in the next year or two. 

I’m not sure what will happen to our office once 90 percent our team is gone. I’m the youngest in the branch (29) and not sure on the fate of where we’ll end up.

The flip side is, once these guys retire, there’s a good possibility I could take their whale accounts, which are big money.

The money is fairly good, I made about 85k my second year, unlimited vacation time, work fully remote with the exception of team meetings in person twice a month. But the struggle I’m having is that it’s an industry that I’m not that interested in. Don’t get me wrong, I work on a lot of cool projects, and help design in a lot of electronics for robotics, med device equipment, and other cool military applications.

 But the company I’m with really never provided me with any training in the field on how to actually do the job. It’s even harder when it’s such a technical industry. Two years in, and I still feel like I can’t get into the “party”, if that makes sense. And trust me, I’ve taken all the necessary steps to address this and went to management to seek help and never got anywhere. Luckily I perform and keep the bosses happy.


I guess what I’m getting at is, when do you feel is the right time to jump? I’m pretty content with the perks of my job, and don’t want to take the chance of going somewhere else where I wouldn’t be happy I guess is what scares me. I also feel like 2 years at one place isn’t that attractive to other employers when applying, and feel like I should try and stick it out before moving on. Also, what are some companies, industries that would be a good transition from the semi conductor space? I’ve always been in sales but open to the business end of things aswell. Hopefully looking for a company that possibly a younger, more modern company culture, or a smaller company where I could be more hands on and learn a lot more.

1claii9,Quite possibly on the verge of being fired after 2 months,"I just started a job two months ago, intially I wasnt getting much to do because I was brought in smack dab in the middle of a project so onboarding and training took some time. After a while I was given some more tasks to do, all of which I completed by the given deadlines.

Cut to last week where I was given an assignment on monday and told to complete it Friday, I pretty much finished most of the project by Wednesday and decided to use Thursday day to fine tune it but this was very minimal work so I really took my time with it to fill the day. This also meant I was on my phone sporadically throughout the day and it looks like one of the higher ups noticed this and told my PM as it seemed like I wasnt doing anything at all

In retrospect I shouldve just wrapped up the project and handed it in earlier instead of trying to stretch it out to the given deadline. I made a bone headed assumption that as long as I met my deadlines with quality work nothing else matters but I can see how being on my phone at the office doesnt inspire much confidence. 

The Jury is still in air on if im gonna be employed or not but assuming the worst case scenario, how do I move on from this? Should I even bother mentioning this on my resume? If I am fired should I ask for feedback from management?

1cl97fs,Advice on how to care less,"So, I was so close to internally deciding (lol) that im gonna send in my two weeks this week. But i’m not gonna do that because I don’t want it to show on my resume that I quit only after a few months, and I just dont wanna feel like a quitter despite being in a horrible workplace. Even though I know that quitting is the right thing to do, I don’t wanna because I know SOME people are gonna see that as “oh she wasnt good enough.” Not to toot my own horn but, people at work, including management, tell me im doing a great job. But I know that part of the reason why they say that is because they know I won’t ever let them down even if they give me unrealistic workloads and unofficial hats to wear every day every week nonstop, without overtime anymore because they think we can all do it in 40 hours or less (which we just cant like it’s just not possible, and this is with no one ever taking lunch and barely any room to breathe or pause for a couple minutes at work). But I’m tired, and I’m done being taken advantage of.

So what I wanna do instead is to start developing more of a “i will only care about my job for 40 hours a week” type of attitude. When it hits 40, i’m not doing any more work no matter what. And I will communicate that when I hit 40, not just surprise them. 

But…now im worried that they’ll fire me for working normally (and how they want, which is no overtime) especially because these people are known to fire people a lot. And I dont wanna get fired because even though I know there’s not like an official firing department that tracks down people who have been fired, It still won’t feel good and some places do ask if you’ve been fired in the past.

I guess my question is: does anyone have any advice on how I can develop a healthy and reasonable sense of “not caring too much” without gettint fired?

Should I just quit my job?

It’s important to note that I have some plans to go to law school some time in the foreseeable future, and so a big reason as to why im not quitting is because i want to have an impressive resume where im not quitting jobs

1cl8ird,Need advice: Should I take my dad’s company or join a startup? ,"
I'm at a major crossroads in my career and could really use your insights. I have two exciting, yet very different opportunities in front of me and I'm struggling to decide which path to take.

Option 1: Join a startup as a co-founder. It's an exciting new venture in an industry with a lot of potential for growth and innovation. The original founder told me that after things settled I will be appointed as CEO and grow the business. This startup can go IPO with 8 years after taking a look at its financials and pitch and I have a good chunk in it.

Option 2: Take over my dad's business that he bootstrapped it from the ground up. It's well-established and operates overseas. I could bring it to the U.S. market (his business is accounting focused so very saturated here in the US), which could be both challenging and rewarding. My dad is looking to retire within the next year or two as he is getting older and tired of traveling. 

Note: I don’t have experience on my dad’s niche but could learn from him and grow the business with my experience. 

Both options have their pros and cons, and I'm torn between the thrill of starting something new or stepping into a legacy and taking it to new heights. What would you do in my shoes? Any advice or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated!

Being a nurse doesn’t interest me much, especially their schedules (no offence). However, I’m broke and want stability quick, it's only 15 months of school, I can start right now, I can get a 8k bursary for nursing and it's like 200 bucks and there are lots of job opportunities. My plan is to be a LPN and finance a bachelor’s when I have money saved up. I know it sounds pretty difficult. I was thinking of doing a computer science bachelor’s. I also think physiotherapy is really interesting.

So now I’m in my mid-20’s. I struggled with ADHD until I was 24, and still have to work on some aspects of it. I didn’t have many friends before. This past year, I’ve been catching up a hell of a lot on my missed experiences of my teenage years and early 20's and I spent a lot of time going out and expanding my social circle. I have a strong desire to do this. When I was 20, I dropped out of computer science, but when I returned with ADHD meds at 23 as a science student at university, I got straight A’s in physics, chemistry, biology and calculus (pre-requisites).

When I struggled with ADHD my parents bailed me out many times and it was a little expensive for them. I don’t want to take their money anymore. I am passionate about medicine and kind of like nursing. I was a nurse assistant for a while (idk what they call them in english) and liked it but don’t really want to do it my whole life if I can help it because of the working conditions and schedule. But I honestly just want to enjoy life as most as possible and catch up on late teens and early 20's. I enjoy computer science, medicine. I am very disappointed that of all the messed up opportunities. My parents have PHD's, my siblings have master's and I was on the path to a CS bachelor's. Now I'm in a trade school for a job I hate. I just compare myself to the non-ADHD me, but I shouldn't. I hate nursing so much with all my soul but I hate poverty more.

Do you think it’s a good idea if I do LPN school? Are there other viable paths? Are there things I can do while studying nursing to transition out of nursing quick when I start being a nurse? And any ideas to be more positive about nursing and deal with disappointment?",LilTony53,1,1.0,3,1714959459,2024-05-06 01:37:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cl79z9/is_it_a_good_idea_to_become_a_lpnnurse/,5,2024
1cl75au,Am I crazy for wanting to leave a high paying WFH job?,"Hi - I've been having a hard time recently coming to terms with my current position, and keep circling back to ""should I leave"" or ""just be happy with what you have"". I'm hoping some people on this can give me some perspective. 

I'm 45, 3 kids, mortgage, live in Bay Area so cost of living is very high  + high taxes. Moving to another state is not an option as family is here. 

Current a Director level at a tech startup - all in comp is $350K. I was making 25-30% more than this a few years ago as a lower level manager at a large company, but took a shot at a higher title and skills growth opportunity at a startup for less pay. 

It's been almost 3 years now, and I'm just feeling really uninspired. 100% WFH, but on top of that I never see customers, my direct reports, my manager, etc. Company is HQ in another state and we do not get together. I asked for a co-work space but was told I'd need to pay for it, so really just alone in a room every M-F. 

Comp wise while I understand $350K sounds like a lot, I am taxed almost 50%, plus all the other costs, it really don't get you very far in the Bay Area. We're not struggling by any means, but have had to make a lot of life choices/sacrifices the past few years. 

When I got into my career, I didn't do it so sit in a room on Zoom calls and be removed from my co-workers, clients, etc. I do enjoy spending more time with kids and not commuting, but it's quite lonely and feel like I'm going a bit crazy. I got a gym membership thinking being around other people would help, but everyone keeps to themselves with headphones on. Going to coffee shops is challenging as I am on calls and loud background noise makes it challenging. 

My manager, while nice, is never really around either so I kind of just need to work on things myself, which is fine but I'm not really learning anything new.

I keep thinking I'd be happier a) making more money to better support my family b) being in a hybrid role. I feel like I have more to contribute than what I'm currently doing. I have not spoken this directly to my boss about it, as admittedly I'm scared of what the outcome is. Also I know the job market for tech workers isn't good right now. 

  
Should I just enjoy the aspects of my role I do like and keep at it another 6-12 months and see where things are? Or should I start seriously looking for another role? I keep coming back to this, so clearly need to either come to terms or start making a move. Appreciate anyone's thoughts.

I'm really interested in drones, aerospace, and robots; and would like to work in those areas, preferably on the electronics/hardware side of things, but ideally on the whole system. I like the satisfaction of designing something from scratch, building it, and seeing it perform and work as I imagined. But I'm worried that even with a masters degree I'll still end up at the same spot (boring desk job). When you're a kid they convince you by saying ""become an engineer and you can build things like cars, robots, planes, rockets, etc"" and I think it would be awesome to work at NASA, Lockheed or DARPA building jets, drones, and/or rockets; or at Boston dynamics building new robots. How can I work towards getting one of these cool jobs? It seems like so many graduate with engineering degrees but only a few people go on to work at those kinds of jobs so I'm not even sure a masters degree would help. Am I naive in my perception of these jobs? Realistically, would I only be working on one part of a large project (like the microcontroller code for windshield of an airplane, analyzing data, designing a cup-holder for a new car, etc)? I feel like I'm wasting my life at my current job but I also don't see a path forward. Also if you're an electrical/computer engineer working in these areas, what's your job like?

1cl6fzf,Advice on Opportunities Available to Me,"Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out to get some insights and advice on potential career paths. Here's a brief background: I graduated from a reputable law school but with less-than-stellar grades and worked in civil litigation at a small firm for a few years. During this time, I began pursuing a Masters in Accounting and transitioned into a role as an international tax senior associate at a Big 4 firm. I’ve completed my Masters, but I’ve had some setbacks with the CPA exams, which I’m planning to tackle more seriously now.

While I'm doing well in my current role, promotion to manager has been delayed as I needed to bridge a significant knowledge gap in technical areas. I don't see myself aiming for a partner position here, so I'm considering what opportunities might be available outside the Big 4. Given that I’m moving away from my legal career, I find myself in a bit of a unique position in terms of experience and credentials.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on alternative career opportunities where my background in law and tax could be beneficial. Any suggestions or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.

1cl53qy,Should I Quit My Job And Travel Or Accept This Promotion?,"Hi All, I could really use some perspective here. I am 24F who works in sales for a fortune 500 company. I've been at my company for almost 2 years now and am currently on my 2nd role. In my first role, I made between $75-80k, and in my 2nd role, I'm making between $90-95k. 

I hate my job. I feel like I'm not learning anything and my work can be done in 2-3 hours per day. My manager is super uninvolved and rarely checks in on me. My company is great, it's just not for me and I don't care for the industry it's in. I'd like to switch to a marketing role, as I don't think I'm well suited for sales. I don't enjoy working with the products I'm selling and overall, I don't have the personality for selling. 

During the 4 months between graduating college and starting this job, I went on a solo backpacking trip in Asia and fell in love with travel and the world of backpacking. I've been thinking about it for nearly 2 years now, and have always known that I want to go on another trip. 

Considering the fact that I hate my job and want to switch industries, I've made a plan to quit my job in August 2025, shortly after I hit my 2 year mark. I want to travel for 7 months, and then come back to the US and apply for more marketing focused roles. I am very financially frugal, and have saved a very good portion of my income to prepare for this trip. I have \~50k in stocks, 20k in HYSA (all funds in my HYSA to be used on this travel), 25k in my Roth IRA, and 25k in my company's Roth 401k. 

So, everything was set for me to quit BUT I recently learned that my boss wants me to apply for the role above mine, which is another sales role and pays $115-125k. She said I would very likely get the job. I currently work very closely with this role and I know everything about it and have NEVER thought about doing it, as I know I wouldn't like it. The money isn't a huge lure to me, because I value the experience of traveling at this age, while I don't have any major responsibilities (kids, morgtage, etc.) over money that I know will come back. 

The reason I'm now second guessing my decision, is because some people are telling me I should take this 3rd role for the title and work in it for just a few months. This feels a little slimy to me, although I know I know I don't owe my company anything, but I'd want to stay in it for 6-8 months if I take it. 

Now I'm stuck...should I keep my original plans to quit in August and then go travel? Or should I take this job and do it for just 6 months for the title, and then go travel??? WWYD?!

1cl4cld,"Is Medicine the most financially stable and secure profession in the USA? Is it worth going into medicine at 26? If you could read and help me with my situation, thank you!","
I am 26 years old, graduated in Business, and don't like the field. I am unsure if it's worth entering medical school and changing careers, considering the financial return and opportunity cost. Are there better paths for making money and having a good work life balance? Disregard the costs of private medical school. 

From what it seems, medicine is the most guaranteed path that allows for good financial conditions and stability, with fewer risks. Is there a better path that I'm not seeing that still provides quality of life? A doctor hardly earns less than $200k/year or becomes unemployed, and it will continue like this, while in most other professions, only 1% of professionals will manage to grow in a company and earn more than $100k/year after years in the market, starting with a low salary. I'm not talking about professionals who start their own businesses, OK? In medicine, after the difficult and exhausting training and residency, it's practically guaranteed, unlike the 2% of exceptional professionals in other areas, because someone who earns well even in philosophy will have it, but the question is the probability of this happening

Furthermore, if I earn more per hour, I can choose to work fewer hours and still receive more than a good portion of professions and have a quality life after graduation. So, I can have a part-time job, work 30 hours a week, have work-life balance, do something fulfilling, and still earn over $100k per year. Am I right?

BUT, the resident doctor earns little and works a lot: ""I know, but only for 4 or 5 years, whereas in the rest of the professions, it's like that forever."" BUT, you have to spend time studying and specializing to earn more: ""Yes, but what profession doesn't require studying, specializing, and waiting time to earn more?

And before you say it, No, I don't want to do medicine JUST for the money, but I want to know if it compensates for the quality of life, financial gains, and opportunity cost at 26, and it's about this topic that I want to see your opinion, because if nobody thought about money to work, there would only be volunteer work in the world, and I don't see any problem in analyzing what financial standard I want. If it were something I hated, I wouldn't do it, I would be unhappy. I don't find medicine as enjoyable as traveling and watching series, but I enjoy studying. I would be a good doctor, and I see many cool and rewarding things in the profession, although I don't like everything 100%.

Even if for any amount of money, I'm not willing to work in IT or Software, do not consider this possibility as a better path for stable financial return because I don't like it at all and I don't have aptitude. I also detest Law and would not do it at all.

Entrepreneurship is also not compatible with my personality profile, even with any financial potential. I find the job of charging people, managing, and the lack of monthly billing stability and risks stressful, and the work routines in the beginning are long and exhausting. Despite creating millionaires, I guess that 90% of entrepreneurs in the USA cannot put more than $100k per month in their pocket. Think about the bakery you go to, the beauty salon, and most of the businesses on your street, for example. 
Entrepreneurship is a process I'm not willing to go through, and it didn't make me feel good when I tried it. It's also not a possibility for me, and I don't have a calling for it, just like technology, engineering, and law.

In medicine, the probability of earning more than $100k per year working part-time is much higher than in entrepreneurship, for me, that's good enough. I don't want to be a millionaire.

After residency, I think medicine will give me more quality of life, balance, and free time because if I earn well per hour, I can work fewer hours, and medicine is one of the few professions that allow this after residency. I also won't give up on quality of life and wouldn't do any profession that consumes all my time forever or that I hate.

To conclude. Do you think it's financially worth going into medicine at 26? Is there a better path/profession that I'm not seeing to earn $100k/year, always have a job, have stability, free time, and quality of life? 

Am I on the right path in wanting medicine? What other profession allows me to work part-time, have work-life balance, and still allow me to earn more than $100k per year? I'm not referring to professions where only 1% of people manage to earn well because that exists in all areas, but rather one that has a higher and stable probability of providing that return, just like in medicine. 

Do you think what I said makes sense or am I wrong? Are there better paths to have money and quality of life?

Medicine doesn't seem perfect for me, but I don't see myself doing anything else, and all the other things seem like I would like them less, be more unhappy, or not provide a good financial return with stability. Furthermore, I would be a good doctor.

Thank you, I want to hear your opinions on the topic and my situation. Do you agree with me and is there a better path for what I'm looking for? Cheers!

1cl4a7l,Should I write to the director that hired me explaining why I left?,"My boss's boss's boss is the one who gave me a huge internal promotion with my last employer. I was happy for the opportunity, good relationships with my coworkers, moderately stressful job description but good company culture. 

Slowly though, my supervisor and their boss started treating me differently. Not a before and after difference, per say, but I could spot some glaring differences between expectations of me vs other people on the team with my role. 

Just to name a couple examples, my work products, productivity, etc were scrutinized very heavily, any time off requests, when accepted, were met with scrutiny when I came back, and the final straw was how I was treated after a family member passed vs shortly after when another coworker lost a family member. I was checked in on briskly and expected to get back to work where they were given all the time they would need and even remote employees were called into the office to sign a card. I harbor no resentment toward this other coworker and their loss deserved a humane response. However, the different treatment felt intentional. 

I put in my notice for a role elsewhere that is significantly better pay, fit, etc. Exit interview went smooth as one could expect and as far as they know, I only moved on for the better pay.  

I'm happy that coworkers saw how I was treated and validated for me that they didn't think it was right. Especially the response to my 2 weeks notice being 'tomorrow will be your last day. Don't forget to give us our property back from your home office and dont let the door hit you on the way out' after working there for years. 

Recounting this story to a family member recently, it was recommended that I reach out to the director that gave me the opportunity in the first place.

However it's very tricky choice. It's all because the job I worked at is now different company. Still same factory at same place but it got brought by another company.

Reason I'm making 22 an hour is because when I first worked there 6 years ago. They started 17 an hour. Then get give me raise every 6 months. Until two years ago. After factory changed to different name different owner. They give raise every year not 6 month anymore. Also they don't start at 17 anymore.  It's now 11 an hour for any new hired.

So if I quit then got fired or lay off from new job not long afterwards and if I want to return back to my old job. I will get only 11 an hour. Plus won't ever gonna make 22 an hour again all because they changed started wage and not giving raise as often anymore.

Kinda like i only been there 6 years to make 22 an hour. But if quit then come back then it gonna take 20 another 18 years to make 22 an hour again. By 20 years from now 22 dollars won't be worth 22 anymore because of inflation.

1cl1yud,Exiting Timeline without Burning Bridges,"I am 29 years old and have worked in the marketing department as a marketing manager at my current non profit organization for just a little over four years and they have really invested in me as an employee in the following ways:
1.) Kept me on-board during COVID-19 restructuring in 2020
2.) Kept me on-board during 2021 restructuring 
3.) Director advocated for me to work fully remotely since my job became a national role 
4.) Invested in flying me out to New York several times to our headquarters for professional development and trainings
5.) Invested in flying me out to the Middle East for 10 days for an all expense paid trip that gave us the opportunity to see our work on the ground 
6.) Gave me annual raises every year and gave me two raises in one year during 2022
7.) Gave me my first promotion with a salary increase
8.) Recently restructured and promoted me again while letting go of others in my equivalent role

Over the last four years, my director and I have developed a very close relationship and she had requested that if I ever decided to look for a new job, to just give her a heads up so they aren’t left in the dust without someone to fully transition into my role and replace me before I leave.

During the most recent restructuring a few weeks ago, they promoted me a third time and let go of someone in an equivalent role and flat out asked if I was seeking to leave - which I was - to inform them so they don’t restructure and promote me just for me to leave two weeks later.

I had also told my director I wouldn’t intend to give two weeks notice, I don’t want to burn bridges. 

All this being said, I really do want to leave and I have been interviewing and I’m worried the new job which requires me to start at the beginning of June would only allow me two weeks notice to the current job I have which is completely opposite of what was asked of me out of respect and personal relationships. 

Should I give them a heads up I’m actively looking to leave so I don’t take this promotion and they are left in the dust? It would look very bad on them to promote me just to leave amidst a restructuring as a department.

1ckzhaa,How do I decide on a career path?,"I am currently in school and will be graduating next year at the age of 20 . 
The last couple of years my plan was to study psychology and pursue a career as either a therapist or a psychologist since I am really interested in this and I would like to work with people. I know that this is not an easy way since you need good grades and you need to study for a long time but I could definitely imagine myself doing this and I think that this kind of work might fulfill me or give me some kind of sense in life. 
However I also always loved art and I always had a secret wish to try to pursue a career in that direction. I always thought that it was a ridiculous idea since it is a very unstable career but lately it has been on my mind a lot. I really love art and I know that it will always be a part of my life no matter what. I would really like to try to pursue an art career, it doesn’t even matter that much to me anymore what exactly, I feel like I just need a way for self expression. I know that I would not be happy in a regular 9-5 job but I feel that it would be safer. I am afraid that if I chose the wrong thing now, I will regret it my whole life. Because if I don’t at least try to pursue an art career I will always wonder what my life could have been like. I would be okay with failing, because I would then know that I tried and that it isn’t for me, but I am scared that then it will be too late to begin a new career path and I will be stuck with a low pay job that I don’t like. 
Has anyone been in a similar dilemma?
Or is there anyone who chose the “safe option” and has some experience?
I would be really thankful for any kind of advice. ",Deep_sky_565,4,1.0,5,1714937974,2024-05-05 19:39:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ckzhaa/how_do_i_decide_on_a_career_path/,5,2024
1ckz1po,Seeking Advice: Brother's Sudden Business Departure Causing Family Stress,"I'm in a bit of a tough spot and could really use some outside perspective and advice on a family situation that's been weighing heavily on me. Changed some personal details.

To give you some context, my dad (61) has been a successful local businessman in interior design for most of his career, having started his own business and retired early. Recently, my brother (28) and I both found ourselves at crossroads in our careers. My brother, after finishing his MBA in '23, decided to join forces with my dad to start a new business venture in our hometown of Oklahoma. Meanwhile, I just graduated from college with an undergrad degree and landed my first professional job in tech sales, which I'm not finding fulfilling.

Fast forward a bit, my brother and his wife made the decision to relocate from NYC to Oklahoma to start this business together. However, his wife struggled to find a job in Oklahoma and missed her high-paying job in NYC. Unexpectedly, my brother decided to bail on the business just seven months in, leaving my parents with a significant burden. They had invested $300k into the venture, not to mention assisting my brother with his relocation expenses and supporting his new lifestyle, like store rent, apartment rent, a new car. They don't want to ask him to stay for longer than he needs to. They know his heart isn't in it and they would rather him to not work on it than resent the work he does for it.

Now, my brother wants to return to NYC without a job waiting for him, leaving me feeling resentful and stressed. My parents are trying to convince me to take over my brother's role in the business, touting it as a great opportunity for me to be my own boss and potentially earn a substantial income. They estimate it could accumulate one million in profit in a few years. However, my brother has already resigned his NYC lease without consulting them, and he doesn't even have a job opportunity lined up there.

Adding to the complexity, my dad, being older, is not looking to fully manage this store himself. Additionally, the city where the store is located is two hours away from our hometown, so it's not even directly located in the same city.

I'm torn between following my heart and feeling obligated to help my family out of this situation. On one hand, I've been contemplating a move to NYC to be with my boyfriend and pursue a career in marketing, which is more aligned with my interests. On the other hand, I'm considering taking over my brother's role in the business, especially since my parents mentioned they could add a partner so I wouldn't have to sacrifice weekends or work long hours like my dad did. I feel really bad about the situation he put them through. I don't know if I will end up regretting either path that I do take.

I feel stuck and unsure of what to do. Should I take the leap into entrepreneurship and potentially regret it, or follow my own path to NYC and risk disappointing my family? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.",ayyemi,0,0.5,1,1714936830,2024-05-05 19:20:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ckz1po/seeking_advice_brothers_sudden_business_departure/,5,2024

1ckyg5d,"How do I make my ""useless"" degree useful?","So I'm studying this degree that's about animals. The study plan is very similar to Animal Science and Vet, which have their use. The biggest difference is that the last year is focused more on the husbandry part. However, I talked to my advisor and she told me I could switch most of those courses for courses from related fields like Animal Science, Vet Tech, Fisheries, and Zoology.

And to graduate I also need to complete an internship that I can do working in basically any facility that keeps animals like zoos, farms, labs, natural parks, vet clinics, rescue centers aquariums, fisheries, and almost anywhere that has animals. The study plan for the last year changes a bit depending on what kind of place I choose for doing the internship but I can still take a few electives from other areas.

As of now, I cannot take Vet courses but as the study plan is quite similar I'm allowed to transfer to Vet after graduating, and to become a vet I have to complete 2 extra years to graduate as a vet. I'd still have to go through some selection process to transfer to vet school but I think it's not too difficult.

However I see a major problem with that, and that is that I'm in the EU and I've had a terrible time adapting to life here and I fail to see any opportunities for young people who have any kind of ambition in life, and I'm getting very homesick. And I know that for vets, it's difficult to practice in countries other than where they got their degrees and that it's even harder to be allowed to practice in the US.

Also, the internship options are not great, I know there are some renowned zoos and aquariums but it's hard to get jobs at those places and they do not pay well. For lab animals it's a bit better cause there's an option at UPenn (I don't study there but can go for the internship) and at one of the big Pharma companies. For the other areas, the options on the list are not great but I'm allowed to request places not on the list.

So I do not know what to do. I know that I like animals and that I want to have the option to work away from cities as they are becoming unaffordable everywhere, but I just don't know what to do as apparently there are not many jobs involving animals with decent pay. I'm thinking of maybe becoming a farm vet but there's no point if I'm not allowed to practice.

1ckybkn,Should I work as a Chipotle crew member or as a veterinary receptionist?,"I’m a high school senior with plans to eventually become a veterinarian. Should I work as a Chipotle crew member or as a veterinary receptionist?

Chipotle offering $20-21.50/hr

Animal hospital A offering $22-29/hr

Animal hospital B offering $19-23/hr

The main draws of Chipotle are the $5,250/yr tuition reimbursement and the free meals. Potentially I could work in my hometown over the summer and then transfer to a Chipotle location in the city where I will attend college.

However, experience at an animal hospital, even if it’s not working directly with animals, would be valuable. A receptionist position would be a way to get my foot in the door and possibly work up to a kennel tech position.

1ckwi55,Seeking Career Advice: Recent Termination from Deli Manager Role,"Hey Reddit Community,



I find myself in a bit of a career crossroads and could really use some guidance from those who have been in similar situations or have valuable insights to offer. Recently, I was terminated from my position as a manager at a deli due to upper management issues that were beyond my control. It's been a challenging time, especially considering I've dedicated over a decade to that role.



Here's a little about me: I'm a 47-year-old female with two kids, one of whom is currently in college. My educational background consists of a high school degree, which has unfortunately limited my options in terms of job prospects. While I'm open to entry-level positions and labor jobs, I'm also hoping to find something that offers a bit more in terms of pay, preferably on the higher side of minimum wage.



I've always been willing to work hard and adapt to new environments, but I'm struggling to pinpoint the right path forward. That's why I'm turning to this community for advice. Are there any fields or specific jobs you would recommend considering given my experience and qualifications? I'm particularly interested in roles that may not require extensive formal education but offer opportunities for growth and stability.



Additionally, if anyone has gone through a similar transition or has tips on how to navigate this period of uncertainty, I would greatly appreciate any insights you can share. It's a challenging time, but I'm determined to find my footing and pursue a fulfilling career path.



Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this and for any advice or support you can offer.

Advice for 20M ,"I’m 20 M, been working shitty jobs for a few years now (golf course, restaurant bus boy, host, movie theater, etc), and I’m finally getting to that age where I’m getting tired of working these long hours and tedious jobs for little pay, while seeing several of my peers start finding better jobs.

1ckv85h,How do I deal with a hostile supervisor?,"This is a long one, sorry folks. I’m at a loss. It’s been about a year of working in a hostile work environment and it is having a massively negative impact on my mental and physical health.  I work in marketing in a Virginia state institution and need help figuring out what to do. 

For the past year now I have been documenting times when my boss has made inappropriate comments, lied about work-related issues, or has otherwise not performed his duties, leading to the entire team, but especially myself, having difficulties staying afloat when it comes to work. This person (I’ll refer to them as S) is incredibly manipulative and petty, and I have a long history of diagnosed trauma and related mental illness regarding people who speak to/treat me the specific way this person does. I have been hospitalised by this environment once before and I do not want to give this job up. I want to fight back, but I’m not sure how. 

I’ve kept the document for about a year now. It started with S telling me about a year ago after accidentally messing something up (after I warned I hadn’t done this type of project before and may make mistakes) that “if you fuck that up again I’m going to kick your ass.” He had been mad all day and didn’t say it in a joking way. I know I have a good chance at having that be something he gets in trouble for. I have a witness to this comment who may testify against S.  The witness is a genuinely good person who I like a lot, but I am worried because they were my boss’s friend before they worked here.

I have gotten accommodations to work from home to specifically avoid S for certain days  of the  week. HR and the office of accommodations both have been aware of the conflict in the office for months. Back in October a close coworker and I both sat together and spoke to HR about formal actions I could take against S, as he has been generally getting in the way of and treating everyone in the office poorly, and for some reason has a target lock especially on me. (I have had other coworkers confirm that it’s not just me thinking that.) 

That coworker has since left, specifically because of S and their inability to maintain any modicum of professional behavior or managerial assistance. S ended up dumping literally half of their job duties - a full half of their job title - on my coworker and as far as I know didn’t get so much as a slap on the wrist for it. My coworker left, and instead of making S pick the rest of their job duties up, they changed the position to not include that half of it, and the position no longer exists. 

Back to the HR situation last oct: at that point, I thought maybe the situation would be resolved soon in another way, and it would have been difficult and time consuming to prove it was harassment based on any particular protected class anyway, so I dropped it, leaned on my accommodations, and tried to keep my head down until something was resolved. 

Fast forward to a few months ago. I had been preparing for an event for two months and doing everything I could to make sure I executed this project correctly. Being an institute-wide event, I was in charge of our department’s specific marketing for it and making sure it stuck to the unusually narrow branding requirements that the higher marketing office required. S, at the last minute, tells me I’m doing everything wrong; that they met with another person from another office, and that I need to start over completely on a project I’d been working on for two months - and have it ready in two days. I ended up finding out that indeed I was doing the right thing and he was lying about everything - including speaking to someone else about the direction of the marketing for said event. This is not the first time his lying and impulsivity has nearly steered me in a direction that would not only have made me look bad, but the department in general. I fought with S twice over this, and emailed his supervisor after, explaining that I, along with my colleagues, have been dealing with this for too long and that I could feel myself burning out, and my performance suffering thus. I explained my frustration and lack of inspiration at having to not only figure out how to do my job essentially on my own, but also while trying to untangle lies, misdirection, and other roadblocks on a daily basis. I explained that I could feel my performance slipping and that I wasn’t sure how much longer I could keep up the way I had been if nothing changed. I received nothing back, and still have not heard anything as far as any possible solution goes. 

Skip to very recently, when I am surprised by HR sitting in my S’s office, ready to go over a list of everything I’ve done wrong for the past few months… some of it is stuff that I absolutely own as poor performance. I don’t know how to combat the burnout while in the depths of it and fighting my boss at every single turn, and this lead to me missing certain projects and misspelling things, and not following proper procedures for things. On the other hand - some of his ignorance at what his own employees even do shows through in some of these “issues”, where they may appear as violations of policy to the layman but are not actual problems, that I have solid proof against. Some of the points are as petty as typos that were fixed almost immediately. 

This meeting happened very shortly after I stood up to him and told him I needed things entered into our task management software to know to do them in the first place. He’s been extra aggressive since his own disciplinary meeting a while back and he’s been latched onto me as a target still. The last time I was having some severe mental health issues and explained that it was the reason for some poor performance, he told me “I know - that’s why we’re talking about it here and not at HR.”  That comment felt very off, but I wasn’t sure what to do with it at the time.

Anyways - I was given this list of issues and told I had a certain amount of time to prepare any comments I wanted to make on this subject, and that an appointment had been made already to give me the chance to do so. My mental health being in shambles by this point, I had a full on mental breakdown that night and admitted myself to an inpatient ward for a week-long stay. I am waiting to hear back from HR as far as when I will be able to make my comments. 

I know I want to stand up for myself and argue this case in the places where it is blatantly a nonissue. I also want to own my poor performance and genuinely fix the issue. I WANT to be a good employee. I love this job. But I cannot perform my job duties like this. I promised myself at the beginning of all of this that I would stick it out until a solution was found, because I love and care for this job so immensely. But I can’t keep doing this and expect my mental health to be good, and my coworkers are fed up as well. I do not want to keep having s*icidal ideations because of my damn manager, who seemingly doesn’t even care about his position, integrity, maturity, honesty… I don’t want to leave this job. I don’t want to keep running from people like this, I want to fight for what I (and honestly, my coworkers) deserve. 

While in the inpatient unit, I spoke with the doctor about my issues and she recommended I open a case with the board of labor and skip my institution entirely. I’m thinking about also opening a formal complaint at the institution but I am not entirely sure I will. To be honest, I’m lost, I’m overwhelmed, I’ve never had to deal with anything like this. My performance has always been good. I’ve won 2 awards in the year and a half that I’ve been here. I’m about 4 years into my career and I want to keep growing. I am ambitious and good at my job. I am also very mentally ill, specifically having to report to someone who genuinely triggers me the way my abuser would, and I want to stand up for myself in the face of someone who has been bullying me and using that against me for at least the past year. 

My questions I guess would be; does anyone have any advice in general? Advice about going to the VA BOL? About filing a formal complaint? How to keep calm and professional during the memorandum meeting and own my performance while standing up to a bully who’s in charge of me professionally? Should I get a lawyer’s advice? 

It would be difficult to prove this is based on any particular protected class unless I use the comment S made last summer about my gender identity being “not real” and “it doesn’t make any sense” and how he’s “tired of hearing about it”. (There was at least one witness, but they no longer work at this institution). 
I feel like the “I’m going to kick your ass” comment can be considered a violent threat, right? Surely there’s something I can do? 

How would you all handle this situation? I’m such a new (and anxious) professional. I want to do this right, and I want to make sure people stop stepping on me. My last position was one filled with mental health issues because I let myself become a doormat and by the end of my time there, I was having weekly panic attacks because of it. I was hospitalised then too. I’m done being a carpet, even for superiors. This job has been amazing with the exception of him. I love my coworkers, I love the work that I do. I even love the messy parts of it. I’ve never complained about staying late, because I genuinely love this job. I don’t want a bully to be able to run me off of something I care about anymore. I just need to go in prepared and keep professional. Any advice, even just little words of encouragement, is so incredibly appreciated. 

Thanks in advance for any help.

Some additional assorted incidents I’ve tracked from the past year that may or may not matter: 

- Lied to me about comments another office’s supervisor made about me during meeting (that I need to “tone it down, be less wild”). I confirmed that supervisor hadn’t even mentioned me 

- Said once I dress “like a homeless person”. I dress in a very similar way to how another coworker dresses and follow dress code. I stated this and S said “well, they dress that way because they need mobility, they need to move.” They do not need to do much more movement than I do. 

- Said they hope Donald T gets r*ped. I do not enjoy DT at all but this comment (from a male especially) was extremely uncomfortable to hear while alone in a car with him

-  S hired someone even though they were completely unqualified, against the wishes of the entire office, simply because they were S’s friend.",HashtagBackpain,1,1.0,1,1714926740,2024-05-05 16:32:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ckv85h/how_do_i_deal_with_a_hostile_supervisor/,5,2024

I know I want to stand up for myself and argue this case in the places where it is blatantly a nonissue. I also want to own my poor performance and genuinely fix the issue. I WANT to be a good employee. I love this job. But I cannot perform my job duties like this. I promised myself at the beginning of all of this that I would stick it out until a solution was found, because I love and care for this job so immensely. But I can’t keep doing this and expect my mental health to be good, and my coworkers are fed up as well. I do not want to keep having s*icidal ideations because of my damn manager, who seemingly doesn’t even care about his position, integrity, maturity, honesty… I don’t want to leave this job. I don’t want to keep running from people like this, I want to fight for what I (and honestly, my coworkers) deserve. 

While in the inpatient unit, I spoke with the doctor about my issues and she recommended I open a case with the board of labor and skip my institution entirely. I’m thinking about also opening a formal complaint at the institution but I am not entirely sure I will. To be honest, I’m lost, I’m overwhelmed, I’ve never had to deal with anything like this. My performance has always been good. I’ve won 2 awards in the year and a half that I’ve been here. I’m about 4 years into my career and I want to keep growing. I am ambitious and good at my job. I am also very mentally ill, specifically having to report to someone who genuinely triggers me the way my abuser would, and I want to stand up for myself in the face of someone who has been bullying me and using that against me for at least the past year. 

My questions I guess would be; does anyone have any advice in general? Advice about going to the VA BOL? About filing a formal complaint? How to keep calm and professional during the memorandum meeting and own my performance while standing up to a bully who’s in charge of me professionally? Should I get a lawyer’s advice? 

It would be difficult to prove this is based on any particular protected class unless I use the comment S made last summer about my gender identity being “not real” and “it doesn’t make any sense” and how he’s “tired of hearing about it”. (There was at least one witness, but they no longer work at this institution). 
I feel like the “I’m going to kick your ass” comment can be considered a violent threat, right? Surely there’s something I can do? 

How would you all handle this situation? I’m such a new (and anxious) professional. I want to do this right, and I want to make sure people stop stepping on me. My last position was one filled with mental health issues because I let myself become a doormat and by the end of my time there, I was having weekly panic attacks because of it. I was hospitalised then too. I’m done being a carpet, even for superiors. This job has been amazing with the exception of him. I love my coworkers, I love the work that I do. I even love the messy parts of it. I’ve never complained about staying late, because I genuinely love this job. I don’t want a bully to be able to run me off of something I care about anymore. I just need to go in prepared and keep professional. Any advice, even just little words of encouragement, is so incredibly appreciated. 

Thanks in advance for any help.

Some additional assorted incidents I’ve tracked from the past year that may or may not matter: 

- Lied to me about comments another office’s supervisor made about me during meeting (that I need to “tone it down, be less wild”). I confirmed that supervisor hadn’t even mentioned me 

- Said once I dress “like a homeless person”. I dress in a very similar way to how another coworker dresses and follow dress code. I stated this and S said “well, they dress that way because they need mobility, they need to move.” They do not need to do much more movement than I do. 

- Said they hope Donald T gets r*ped. I do not enjoy DT at all but this comment (from a male especially) was extremely uncomfortable to hear while alone in a car with him

-  S hired someone even though they were completely unqualified, against the wishes of the entire office, simply because they were S’s friend.",HashtagBackpain,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1714926724,2024-05-05 16:32:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ckv7wv/how_do_i_deal_with_a_hostile_supervisor/,5,2024
1ckumad,Should you follow your passion or be realistic? ,"Hi friends, I need some career advice, I'm hoping you guys can help me :) 

Some background, I'm 25 and currently working at a biotech in the US. I have my B.S in chemistry. 

My dilemma is that while I greatly enjoyed my chemistry career so far, my passion has always been psychology. I frequently find myself thinking about psychology problems while in work meetings. I've also been interested in psychology as a little kid. Most of the books and podcasts I listen to are psychology related. 

Recently, I've been thinking about going to graduate school (Ideally I could be some sort of professor but I'd also be happy to go back into industry/research). Of course, the logical conclusion should be to do my PhD in chemistry. However, there's this annoying little voice in my head that is telling me I should consider doing my PhD in psychology instead (for psychology research and not clinical psychology). 

Realistically I know I should choose chemistry. It's something that I'm relatively good at, and I really do enjoy it as well. All of my prior background is in this. However, I know in my hearts of hearts that psychology is the thing I'm interested most in. I have no prior experience in this field (except for a few intro college classes that I took for fun). Graduate school for psychology would be a lot harder to get into, and I think the field is overall more competitive/less job opportunities. 

Please help me pick a side between passion and pragmatism. Any advice is appreciated! ",nowwhat2379,13,0.8600000143051147,44,1714925110,2024-05-05 16:05:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ckumad/should_you_follow_your_passion_or_be_realistic/,5,2024
1cku84g,Feeling directionless at 27 years old.,"I am 27 years old right now and turning 28 in a few months. I earned an M.Sc. in Physics in 2019, and after that, I did a project for one year. In March 2020, COVID-19 started, and I came back home. The project was a shitty one, and I just gave up doing that after coming home, and it remained incomplete. During the pandemic, I was doing online question-solving on Chegg and used to get some money; I was doing that for the entire day for almost a year. After that, in 2021, I took online coaching for the PhD entrance exam (I am from India and in India, there are entrance examinations for PhD), and during 2021 May, the second wave of coronavirus came, and all the entrances stopped. And during that time, I just gave up on coaching and did nothing. After that, I just kept giving the government entrance exams, which were also half-heartedly without any conviction. Only in 2023 did I start doing an online course on Data Science because there were no jobs with a Physics degree. With so many wasted years, I was utterly drained and hopeless, and it was like a last-ditch effort to turn things around. But, even with this degree, I struggled a lot, and it's 2024 now, and I still need to complete the degree. I am feeling so defeated and so directionless with my life. I feel like I did some irreversible damage to my career and life, and there is nothing to look forward to. I am questioning the meaning of life and getting convinced that life is meaningless, that nothing will work out in the future, and that it will keep getting worse. I am comparing myself to others who started their career at 21 and are now in senior positions in their respective jobs. I always thought I had talents and would do good in life, but here I am with no career and no motivation to do anything. ",TipProfessional3258,2,0.75,1,1714924044,2024-05-05 15:47:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cku84g/feeling_directionless_at_27_years_old/,5,2024

1cksh6k,How do I advance In my career?,"How do I advance In my career life?

This is my first post. So hopefully I'm doing this right. I (29f) am a mom of 2.5 kids, (we get my step daughter when we can, but that's a story for another time.) In between pregnancies, being a mom, and working what I consider ""starter"" jobs, I managed to earn a Bachelor's in psychology. Yes, I am one of those.... I did not realize how little this would do for me. I am currently working two positions at the same company. I am a client service representative, and a Social Media Manager for a clinic an hour from me. However, I feel like I am underpaid and extremely under appreciated, I drive a distance, and the group of people I work with isn't always easy to get to participate in projects. I was promoted to my Social Media Manager position with no guidance of what is expected of me. So for the past 3 years I have been kind of winging it with this position. I don't even know if I'm doing a good job or not,  because I never hear feedback from management. I don't have background on being a Social Media Manager, but I feel over the past 3 years I have grown.  Of course there's always room for improvement, and gaining more knowledge. I currently work around a 3 year old's schedule. So truly weekends and afternoons during the week. I also have the opportunity to work from home on Social Media content, but the company expects me to limit this as much as possible.  Currently this job works for my life circumstance... However, it's definitely not an environment I want to stay in and I really need to make a better income if I want to move forward in my life, as I currently live paycheck to paycheck.  Ideally I would love to work administration,  or I even thought about going into marketing. But in order to be successful, I would like to gain more knowledge. Gaining a master's degree isn't really ideal, as I don't think taking on more student debt would be beneficial. I guess I'm wondering if there are other alternatives or sources for gaining more knowledge in these areas? I'm looking for any advice anyone could give me on what I can do next? Or am I just forever doomed?

1ckrfy6,Next steps advice- weighing options and commutes!,"Hi everyone, I wanted to get everyone’s take on my next move in my career. I am trained to be a school counselor in New York, it’s extremely hard to find a job and I never really did! But I am happy I never did. I was in the city for about 10 years, I worked for the city of New York at a small city agency focusing on youth and community development, and funding nonprofit agencies across the city for various programs. My mother passed away about five years in to my employment. I do believe if she never passed away, I wouldn’t have left the city job. There was really nothing for me to do but go to her home with my husband and fix up the house and make decisions from there. 
I found a job closer to my home and started working there. We had a baby about four months ago, I have been staying home with the baby but now I’m ready to go back to work. Going back to work at the place I was at that was local, is not an option nor what I wanna do. It was mainly with a student base that is not my ideal population, And it was a nonprofit, where they expect you to do five jobs at once. Don’t know if anyone else had that experience at a nonprofit! 
Anyway, after some career searching, I realize I really am interested in development (building and funding) nonprofits, as well as getting back into workforce for youth, like career guidance and gaining them internship experience.
I currently have a great opportunity in development, with a nonprofit. The pay is not nearly as much as I was making and will likely not be sustainable even through I really believe in the work this nonprofit does. Passion don’t pay the bills!
This other job is literally perfect and down the path that I want to go down, both youth workforce and development. I’m still waiting on an answer, but I am believing they’re going to offer me a position, And the pay range is perfect. It’s actually for a corporate position, I’m happy it’s not nonprofit.
In my third scenario, my old colleague reached out to me as there will be an opening on his team in the city of NY again, education admin office side. The pay is great, hours are 8-4, and it is hybrid, 2 days work from home, 3 days in office.  Great benefits and they match the retirement I put in at 8%. If I take this job, I will probably retire with it, or at least be there for like the next 10 years. Two problems, it can take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour 10 minutes to get there those 3 days a week in. And, it’s not really what I thought wanted my next career path to look like. I’d pretty much be a cog in the wheel, but, in a way, get more time to spend with my family mentally and maybe even physically, even though I’m commuting so far. 
Another thing, this third job will likely not start for 2-4 months and I need to start work before that. Do I take one of the offers presented and not feel bad for leaving after a short period for the experience, or go through a temp agency for the time being?
Thanks I know this was a long one!!! Any insight is appreciated!",Salt-Bedroom9251,1,1.0,0,1714916196,2024-05-05 13:36:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ckrfy6/next_steps_advice_weighing_options_and_commutes/,5,2024

the past 5 years i’ve (23M) been “pretending” to be an electrician, i have around 2 years worked as a unqualified domestic electrician and have done 8 months for my apprenticeship (legally) i had to quit because i needed massive funds for a major dental accident costing around $11,000

i have done warehouse work for an electrical contractor ‘Middys’ who wholesale equipment

i have never gone to tafe / done my electrical schooling 

i did get an electrical award in highshool for the highest achiever in electronics 

the main reason why i picked to be an electrician is because my deadbeat father made me piss on an elec fence when i was 6-7yo (wild lol) and it curved my shi like 20-30° (since fixed, too much information) so i identified with my trauma sort of

the problem with being an electrical apprentice is i started when i was 18 and am classified as a Jr apprentice so therefore companies will only pay me $500 a week, this is rough as a 23 yo 


my next option is to go into being a Developer Operations Engineer (IT)

i was fantastic with computers as a youngin, use to hack people, sell hacked accounts, give people printing money, shut down peoples internet & a whole bunch of other shi.. i was a “black hat hacker” per say

the course is none. there is no course, it’s straight into IT

i’m really stuck between being a glorified labourer or perusing a new carrier path which won’t burn me out physically as an adult, i also no longer associate with the people who i was tradie friends with

1ckpy93,A question for local employers,"Just wish to know from the perspective of local employers with regards to the following question:

What is the complete list of consideration factors that you guys would personally adopt for giving your employees the pay raise and/or job promotion that they deserve? What are the solid pieces of advice that you guys as the employer of your company/organisation would give to your fellow employees who are aiming for consistent pay raise and/or job promotion within short periods of time?

On top of this, what is the periodical intervals that you guys would adopt for giving them their deserving pay raise and/or job promotion? (Eg. Every 4 months, 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years etc)

Certain examples of consideration factors:

1) Being a good team player (Can value add to the needs of the team well)

2) Displaying good character at work (to both fellow colleagues and superiors)

3) Ability to hit different KPIs within short range of time

4) The amount of earnings that the company/organsation manage to accumulate

Since then, I have worked in a market analysis/research/intelligence role in an industry that doesn't particularly interest me. With over a year's experience, and more than a touch of (masked) bitterness, I recently handed in my notice - yes, it's better to secure a job while you're in one - and have been looking for roles in Belfast, to which I recently relocated. Suffice it to say, there isn't a lot of work in my area that grabs me, and I want to take some time to experience the city, see family, pursue sports/fitness, and consider my next move. 

  
I've maintained an active interest in politics for years and have toyed with the idea of doing something think tank- or policy-related (I like writing and sounding important). I was put off doing an econ MSc due to the theoretical component, but an MA in International Relations or Politics would almost certainly be my cup of tea in terms of course content. And I don't live far from Queen's Uni.

  
My question is: would undertaking such a degree be worth my time and significantly improve my chances of landing something in my interest area, or am I better grinding it out in the working world and trying to steadily accumulate relevant experience? The latter would entail moving away most likely, which is something I would be prepared to do if necessary for my future sanity, but I'm also not feeling invigorated after my first role out of uni.

1ckl799,Unable to satisfy my employee and two major clients,"I am a technical writer having started in a new company 6 months ago. I work in what can be described as a documentation agency, where we produce technical documents for a range of clients. 

Previously, my colleague was responsible for undertaking/delegating the work we do for major client B. This took up all of his working hours. Most of his workload was assigned to me when he became the manager of the agency after the former manager retired.

We have also recently acquired a new client C who has a series of projects that they need to outsource. Each project would typically require 3-4 weeks of work.

I have found myself unable to properly concentrate on satisfying the priorities of both clients B and C, in addition to smaller projects from other clients. I usually work 1 hour overtime, sometimes 2 hours and on occasion up to 4 hours. Delegating work still requires time to explain the task, monitor colleagues, coordinate with our clients, and check the work at the end.

A month ago, I very openly explained to my employer (including one senior manager) that there is not mathematically the time for me to complete my work on time and to the necessary level of quality. The problem has essentially not been resolved because client B has some substantial projects queued for us and client C has a continuous workflow for us.

I am gaining good skills in this current role, I am happy with my pay and I very much like the region, but I detest being unable to give each project the attention required to achieve high quality and comply with deadlines without stress and regular overtime.

1ckkh7l,Advice for a photography career," I have been a professional photographer partnering with one of my friend for the past 2 and half years- small scale commercial shoots for fashion, food, product, content for social media management teams, some events and some interiors.
          Thinking to move forward Im puzzled where to look jobs for! Im moving to Bangalore,IN. I guess I have a decent portfolio built during my 2 & 1/2years. 
           Should I be building a website for portfolio, curating every projects including some of my personal projects? Or just half baked Instagram and behance is enough? 


Main thing i wanna know is"" how does commercial photography, advertising agencies work?""

Should find a senior photographer to assist? Or join a production company?

I have really been wasting my time thinking about these. Couldn't land on a firm decision. 
I'm also really interested in documentaries- saving the Earth idk if that is the job that i could land on I would dedicate my whole life.

And also i have no clue how to find these agencies and photographers if I'm searching for a job under them.

Please help me🙏🏼

1ckivdr,Conflicted about what to do. ,"
I walk in a week for my B.S. in Psychology, I know, probably not the best degree, but when I started I had a plan that looked feasible. I wanted to do school counseling, but with how the education field is looking I decided it wasn’t for me. 

I would really like to get into Higher Education particularly as an academic advisor, but I’m willing to start in other departments and break into it later. 

My problem is, I don’t have any work experience. I was told by all of my advisors/professors to not work if I didn’t need the money. So I, being the naive first generation teenager I was, listened. Of course that was a mistake, but there’s no sense in fixating on it. 

My conflict comes with what to do next. Higher Ed jobs all want experience, even at the entry level and they really want it to be “relevant” going so far as requiring past experience in that particular department. 

So, should I continue trying to find the unicorn that will take a new grad with no experience, or should I look for different career opportunities in other fields? What would be good options for a psych grad that’s not mental health? 

If it helps: I graduate with a 4.0 GPA, highest honors, and zero student debt ",Tired-Octopus-22,2,1.0,2,1714882548,2024-05-05 04:15:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ckivdr/conflicted_about_what_to_do/,5,2024

Now that I actually have an offer, I’m super conflicted because the benefits at this new place are worse. But I might’ve made a mistake and told my current job about the role to leverage a raise. 

Job A (current role): I do all the marketing for the company and do not have a team. There are some issues with favoritism and sexism and not feeling valued in the workplace which caused me to search for another job. But I love the few close friends I have made at work here. 
-$65K/yr with $2-3K bonus (increases yearly), they are also deciding if they can match what the new job offered me. 
-Health insurance high deductible plan $27 a paycheck (bi-weekly). $3400 deductible but $2400 put into HSA at beginning of year. Free vision insurance. 
-Employer paid dental, $25 deductible. 
-Employer paid basic life $50K 
-Employer paid long and short term disability. 
-13 PTO days a year, accrued. 
-401(K) plan with profit sharing which typically is 10-12% a year and 3% safe harbor. 100% vested after 5 years, currently been there for 2 so am 25% vested. 
-Employer paid cellphone bill. 
-Better job security as it is a well established company and continues to grow rapidly. 

Job B (new offer): Also in marketing leadership role, but for a newer company. I will have an actual team to distribute workload, but will have more pressure as I will be making all the marketing decisions. 
-$75K/yr.
-Health insurance $2,500 deductible, $133 a month. $600 put into HSA for year. 
-Dental $50 deductible, $50 a month. 
-Vision $5 a month, full coverage. 
-Disability $10 a month. 
-Life insurance $50K, $10 a month.
-Hybrid remote. 
-10 PTO days a year. 
-401(K) plan with 3% employer match, 100% vested after 3 years. 
-Lower job security as it is a new company. 

I have such a knot in my stomach over this decision I’m not sure what to do.

1ckcf4u,Is it possible to switch from engineering (geotechnical/geological) to business roles in other industries?,"  
I am a 21 year old geological/geotechnical engineering student who will be completing my last year of undergrad this fall. I have thoroughly enjoyed my studies, however am having doubts regarding a long-term career as an engineer.  
  
I spent >1 year in an mining consulting intern role at a well-respected consulting company. Although I have been very engaged and the overall projects are interesting, I am realizing that I do not want to spend my entire career in a technical role. The main reasons for this is the lack of interaction with others, as well as my growing interest in business (e.g., sales, marketing, etc.). In general I get the feeling that I won't be making the most of my people skills and creative problem solving. I plan to finish my degree and try another job related to my degree (may aim for power or transportation, rather than mining).  
  
This leads me to two main questions:  
  
What potential is there for sales/marketing related to geological/geotechnical engineering (or other business roles)?  
  
Is there a possibility (either 1-5 years into career, or >10 years into career) to transition to business roles in other industries (e.g. products, retails, travel, etc.)?  
  
I know that deviating from engineering would not be the ideal path, but also don't want to spend 40 years in a career I am not satisfied with (i.e. keep becoming more confined to mining). My current (loose) plan is to work for at least 3 more years as an EIT (to obtain PEng), and then after that explore opportunities to obtain additional education and/or roles to transition to project management and business roles.

1ck7148,Stay with the Safe and Stable or Venture?,"Apologies for the large amount of text but I am in quite the dilemma and I hoping someone with an outside perspective could help me out.

Some background, I have recently left my long time job and industry in pursuit of something entirely different.  I used to be Chef within a corporation where I had close to 10 years under my belt. Due to the workload, the lack of work-life balance and the desire to try something new I took a federal government job in the hopes of seeing what is out there. 

The job I accepted was a client facing casual position (90 day contract) which paid a bit more than my previous management job. I quite enjoy the work, learning new things as well as the work-life balance. However, after my first week a few concerns have arose. There doesn't seem to be a concrete plan for how I will be utilized, it is very much a fill in the gaps role. It was also communicated that I will need to hop from office to office whenever needed. If I had known about this I wouldn't have accepted the role as I am very much someone who likes routine. This is also difficult as the locations are difficult to get to for me as I cannot drive due to a medical condition. Also the humbling experience of going from management to an entry level position has affected me more than i anticipated

After leaving my previous employer the workplace has turned to shit as I was a integral part of the team. I have kept correspondence with my boss as we get along and I was very transparent in the months leading up to my departure.  I was told that my old position is open to me if I want to come back as well as a potential promotion. He did request that i let him know sooner than later. I will be honest and admit that leaving a permanent position for a casual has left me more stressed than I was expecting. The corporation also offers a program that can help with furthering my education which is something I am seriously considering. 

I guess my question for whoever reads this is that if you were in my shoes, what would you do? Go back to a workplace that offers a permanent role where I was an integral part of the team despite the brutal work-life balance. Or stick with the job that is very much temporary but has the potential to open doors for me later in life. Both options are affecting my mental health. Thanks in advance

1ck6lks,Help! Is nursing my only hope ? ,"Hallo everyone ! 

I would really appreciate if you guys can  advise me. 

My situation: i am almost 30 and still feel like a loser. I was working various jobs like hotel, restaurants, and recently in retail, it is hell everything and i want to decide on something better and new. I am considering nursing. 

However i am currently live in Germany so i will do:
- 3 years nursing apprenticeship 
- then after 3 years undergradute nursing degree so i can work as nurse in USA later. 

The reason:
- money (better paid in comparison to other social jobs)
- stability (rarely get fired) 
- plenty of jobs and less competitions 
- can take care of my mom later 

However what makes me doubtful:
- whether i still can do this job in next 5-10 years
- i am sensitive and soft spoken person, also often hard to say no (end up taking more responsibilites) 
- flight mode when facing agressive people 
- burnout risk 

At the same time i plan to study something in economics so that i can work in office but there is high competition, risk of layoffs, office politics etc 

I have hardly chance in IT, i cant sell myself, too much competitions now, even if i attend bootcamp, risk of layoffs, need constant self learning (i learn methodically and under guidance)

1ck67kt,Need advice: Applying to a company after turning down a job?,"Was offered and turned down a job last year. Now the company has posted a new role that I’m interested in What’s my approach?

**Background:**

Last year I was offered a job at a large company that wanted to open a small office in my city. They planned to hire a director based in my city (me) to manage a long-established team based at their home office. I didn’t think this was viable so after a long process I turned down the offer. I’d had reservations from the beginning and probably should have exited sooner. To my knowledge, they never did fill that position and I think they’ve eliminated the role.

Fast forward to now, I can see on LinkedIn that the company has posted several roles located in my city. One is similar to the role I turned down. It looks like they may be building a proper team here, and I want to throw my hat in the ring. I think I’m a strong candidate within this organization, but I don’t have direct experience with this particular product.

I can’t tell if the role is under the same leadership as the previous one, but I think so. There’s a different hiring manager. 

I’m going to apply for the role, but I’d also like to reach out to my previous contacts.

What should my approach be when reaching contacts from the previous role?

Should I mention the previous process in my cover letter? How?

1ck5qs8,What career/degree should I pursue?,"Hello,

I am currently at a crossroads, shortly I will have to choose a degree to pursue.

I am currently in between Finance, Psychology, and Architecture. 

As for Finance, I am pretty good with numbers and enjoy dealing with the logistics of business, etc, in addition to this both my parents are deeply rooted in the finance world so connections that may lead to internships and jobs, although I hate to admit it, are easily attainable and at my disposal. 

Regarding Psychology, I gained an interest in it due to Dr. Andrew Huberman and was fascinated by the way the brain works. The only issue is, that nowadays, well-paying jobs all require a min. of a master's and most prefer a PhD. I just cannot see myself pursuing education for that long, and thus I have essentially closed that door but who knows? I am aware that it is a stable field as we, humans,  unfortunately, will always have issues regarding mental health.

Lastly, Architecture. This was my chosen degree at the start of my HS program and I accordingly picked my subjects to match this, but as time passed my interest slowly diminished in the field. The only reason, I have not closed this door as well is due to the fact that I have been told by both, my peers and teachers, that I have a talent for it.

I don't know, I don't really have a passion for much other than sports; which has been halted due to recurring injuries. I guess my requirement is to have a good college life and post-college life in which I have a stable and somewhat high-paying job yet also an enjoyable life. 

If you guys were in my shoes, perhaps have been in my predicament, or maybe are in one of the fields mentioned above; please give me guidance and insight into how I should come to a decision.

1ck5d15,Not sure where to go or focus,"I am 35 years old.  No kids.  Currently live with my parents.  I moved back in with them during covid after a wreck and just never moved back out because I was like whats the need really?  I do help them out with their bills.  I got a bachelors of science in kinesiology and certified to teach physical education when I was in college.  I also got additional certifications to teach any subject in middle school.  I was great in college as far as grades, but it turns out teaching is not for me.  I taught social studies and coached sports for a year and hated it.

  
My next job was at a call center doing ""technical support""(mostly just customer service and warranty reshipments for cell phones).  After doing that 4 years I got promoted to work force management.  For those not familiar with call centers, my job was basically to monitor the call volume, agent schedule adherence, adjust schedules, approve PTO days etc.  I did this job for about 3 years before they replaced us with a team from the Phillipines.  Next, I got another job working at home for a different company doing the same work force management stuff.  While this role is probably the most tolerable role I've had as far as work goes, I wouldnt say it's something I'm passionate about.  I was going through a depression and thought I needed some change.  So, I thought maybe moving out and finding another teaching job might suit me since I was older and more mature.  I was wrong.  I still hated it.  After teaching another year, I resigned.  Now, I found a job doing insurance for customer service at 20 dollars an hour working from home.  

  
The job is tolerable but very boring.  If you know anything about 3rd party call centers, you probably know that very few people make meaningful careers out of it.  Growing up I never developed or learned any other skills.   I am not sure what I even enjoy doing anymore and am not really passionate about anything. Tech does  interest me, but I never developed any real skills in it, other than being generally tech savvy.   I have very poor fine motor skills and have trouble doing basic chores/housekeeping tasks.

 About 4 years ago I got my CompTIA certification which has since expired.  I had a few tech interviews but never got hired likely due to no experience.  I am just curious what is a realistic good area I can focus on to improve myself, develop some skills and make something of myself rather than just have a meaningless job.

1ck3foy,Going back to banking (credit analyst) or staying as a writer?,"I feel like I'm going through a bit of a crisis (quarter/mid-life?) right now, and as the title shows, I'm not sure which line of work I should pursue. I'm not even sure if I want to prioritize making more money, or having work/life balance, so I'm seeking the wisdom of Reddit for things I might not be considering. 

  
**My current situation:** I have multiple years of experience as a credit analyst. It was good money, but long hours, and could be pretty stressful. A few years ago I transitioned to writing (W2 salaried full-time employee for a content/publishing company). Decent money, but tons of flexibility, great work/life balance, and super low stress. 

  
**Why I'm considering a change:** Survived some layoff scares at my current company as a writer, which made me realize that it would be hard to find a similar role. Thus, I'm considering going back to banking as a credit analyst primarily due to the prospect of more money, and because I feel that will give me more income stability if I should ever get laid off. 

  
**Bottom line:** Basically, if I got laid off now as a writer, I feel like it would be hard to find a similar job & be challenging to find a job in banking since I wouldn't have any recent experience. On the other hand, I feel like if I went back to banking full time, I could still write part-time which would give me more income stability due to the ability to look for work in 2 industries if I were to ever get laid off (i.e. I'd have recent experience in both banking and writing).

KPMG has offered me a manager role with a substantial increase in compensation compared to my current position.

Advancing to the level necessary to match KPMG's offer seems challenging, especially at my age of 27.

While KPMG presents a clear opportunity for career advancement and financial growth, I value loyalty and the relationships I've built in my current workplace. I want to ensure that my decision isn't solely driven by financial gain and aligns with my long-term career goals.

I'm torn between seizing this opportunity and staying loyal to my current company. Could you provide guidance on how best to approach this decision?

1ck24v6,"Can't get jobs here, or in my country - What to do?","TL;DR

  
Going to graduate with a Political Science Bachelor in EU, how to find job in policy analysis/development without returning to my country?



Hello people of r/careeradvice, hope you're doing well :)

  
I am soon to graduate with a degree in political science from a pretty great university in Europe, and have gathered a decent amount of experience from working on several projects with two different student organization that have gathered a lot of attention lately, also thanks to my work for them. 

However, it is now time to get a job, and well, yeah... 

Essentially I have come here asking for suggestions, because I don't like the idea of working in something not political related, as I have pretty much set my mind to working in Policy Analysis, which is something I love doing and have gotten great results at, however beacuse my country's political scene (I am an expat student) is god awful, and somehow, doesn't even recognize my degree as being enough to enter the exams for various positions in ministeries or the such (which is something that was just approved of, even though my University outranks my country's by at least 100 placements) I can't go back to work there. 

At the same time though, I can't really find a job doing what I want to do in the country I moved to, because despite everyone speaking English, and there being plenty of jobs I could hypothetically qualify for (Marketing, sales, etc etc) all the policy related jobs are rightfully in the local language, which I only know enough to get by, certainly not well enough to draft documents or policy proposals. 

Before you ask, my university doesn't have networking events that work, and I know this because the student organizations and the such don't allign themselves with businesses or professionals really, and because even if they did, those positions would not be available to me, a foreign speaking person. 

Given this background, what should I do? 

I would like to continue living in this country, and take a masters aswell, preferebly in either Political Economy, or in Global Security, but seeing the conditions of the job market (which I might simply be fully mis-understanding) I don't even know if it's worth it. 

I have applied for internship positions at International Organizations such as NATO, the UN and others, but I doubt I will be getting one of those, or at least cannot count on it. 

  
At this time I have only one course remaining before the official end of my bachelor, that is my thesis, which I plan on concluding in December of this year. From now to then I probably will be getting some sort of part time job, retail likely... but was wondering whether any of you have any suggestions for me to try out that could help me build a career towards policy development... 

  
Thank you in advance :)

1cjzrlj,"Feeling bummed out about my degree choice, can I still pivot into more specialized fields?
","I am 21, and I am currently pursuing a degree in BIT (business information technology) in a not so great university. I am in my 2nd year.

I graduated from an IB school with decent grades, and initially went to University of Amsterdam to do EBE (Economics and Business Economics). I am from the middle east so this was international. Without making this a sob story as the rules of the sub state, I fell very deep into depression (which I'd had since I was 13) and basically dropped out of UVA. I came back to my home country and started doing better mentally. I went to a tech uni (not great, maybe like top 500 on QS uni rankings), and I wanted to pursue something like data science or cybersecurity, but due to a technicality related to my IB education and how it translates to the government education system, I was forced to enter something non-scientific/non-technical. So I went for BIT (business information technology) as it seemed to be my best option.

I recently did an internship in PWC, where my role was ""business analyst"", I worked with fellow graduates of BIT, MIS, and adjacent fields. I absolutely HATED the work. I know that if I land a job like that I will be fucking miserable. So that awoke in me the idea that I NEED to pivot out of this path. I need to find something else. The way I'm looking to do this is by completing a master's degree in some tech niche I find interesting. The problem is that, almost every tech niche I research, it seems that things are out of my reach, and I lack the technical skills AND even if I did courses It'd be very unlikely that I could enter the industry. I looked into urban tech and smart cities, it's full of civil engineers, architectural engineers, and urban planners. Bioinformatics, full of bio and biotech majors. Quantum computing full of physics majors. Even something less specialized like data science, the amount of math and python I need to learn is INSANE, and the job market is super competitive. I know people always say that you can just develop the skills and go anywhere, but I'm starting to see that in reality, if you're being pragmatic and looking at the people who REALLY get hired in these industries, and the people who get into specialised master's programs, people coming in from outside are a VERY RARE exception.

So now I am feeling super demotivated. I don't know which path I should take. Starting to wish that I'd cared more about my career and focused more on it, did research when I was in high school. Now I feel like I am headed towards a path I don't want to go to and I don't know how or to where I want to head.

I think I will go back to Company A after I return (I have already spoken with management and they would be more than happy, as would I, as I loved working there and only left for better pay / a different experience, which they understood completely). 

The issue is, my current managers seem to expect me to stay for at least the next 5 years, they have recently placed me as the manager of several important projects which will take about 3 years. 

While I'm flattered, I feel they will not take the news that I am leaving very well. I have heard in the past that management has been bitter towards people leaving, for example saying that they were ""obviously not up to the task / hard work.""

This is obviously a toxic attitude, but I want to leave on a good note, and I feel that leaving after 1 year to travel will send a message that I don't like the company. This field is a small world, so reputation is important. 

What would you do in my situation to leave on a good note and keep the 4 week notice period the least awkward possible?",Roo1996,1,1.0,0,1714822172,2024-05-04 11:29:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cjy55g/how_to_leave_this_job_on_a_good_note_unusual/,5,2024

1cjx8am,Need Advice: Struggling at New Job ,"I recently started as a senior writer, putting a lot of effort into a project that never got off the ground. Despite trying hard and building relationships with higher-ups, it went nowhere. Now, I'm stuck with random tasks and admin work that don't make sense. When I brought this up, my boss didn't seem to care.

I'm also being blamed for not moving the original project forward, even though I didn't get the support I needed. Our team is kind of isolated and doesn't get much respect or meaningful work. Even when I do a good job, I don't get any feedback.

I've tried talking to my boss about it, but it feels like he's not listening. I have a meeting on Monday to discuss things, and I'm not sure how to handle it.

1cjwwrw,Would it be bad to let others know you're tired of your internship?,"I like the company and the people I work with, but i'm starting to get tired of internships altogether. This internship was for a year, but before the summer break I had another internship of half a year. This means I'm non stop interning for 1.5 years now.

At a certain point it just starts to overshoot the goals of an internship. I'm practically at the same level of skills of a normal worker right now and there isn't really anything more I can do or learn without practically taking over someone else's specialization. On top of that my bank account is looking like a mangled roadkill, my thesis is finished and I passed my internship assignments. I have 2 months left, but i'm basically sitting my time out. 

I was thinking about telling this to my supervisor and asking if I can stop a few weeks earlier. This isn't really ""allowed"" but my coach said they don't really mind if you do it. But I feel like this might make me look ungrateful or uninterested, even though I want to work in that field in the future. I'm just done with internships and I want to make money. I feel like this also starts to become reflected in my body language and attitude so perhaps being honest is the best.

1cjvzmz,Quitting without notice due to not being paid in full,"I have not been paid in full in my last two pay periods. The first, my employer discussed the issue with me and I was aware business has been slow lately. They asked if a certain portion of pay could be distributed half this pay period, half the following. I agreed, potentially my first mistake. Next pay period rolls around and not only was I now only paid 25% of the amount I was owed as opposed to the agreed upon 50%, this time it was done with absolutely no notice or communication with me, as well as I was accused of lying about my hours (this was proven to be false). At this point I would like to leave this job with no notice to the employer. I have temporary employment already line up as I search for a permanent position elsewhere, my only concern is will leaving my position with no notice affect future employment? I’ve heard mixed things, but I feel as if I have a very justifiable reason that nearly any potential future employer would understand. Also, should I mention this in any interviews in the future and get ahead of it in case they do contact my current (hopefully soon to be former) employer, or just not say anything and see if it comes up. I intend to be fully transparent if it does come up, just don’t know if I should mention it or wait.

1cjv8e0,Ex-schizophrenic Career Shifter,"Hi. I've been schizophrenic for about a decade now. It started when I was still in college. I graduated with a degree in BS Geology from UP Diliman, but I never really practiced my degree despite having a license. Part of the reason was having no desire to do so (I prefer working indoors apparently so it's the worst degree I could possibly have gotten, but ah well), and having not much prospects either. I did get jobs as a Business Analyst and a Strategy and Performance Specialist though. I was in two different companies for only 6 months for both capacities. My role as a Business Analyst wasn't the IT kind; a PMO Analyst probably better describes it. This was in 2022. As for the Strategy and Performance Specialist, I mostly just did KPI reporting and designing templates for some data management and reporting processes on Monday.com. This was in 2023. I exited both companies due to episodes of schizophrenia and paranoia.

Technically, I'm only diagnosed with schizophrenia, but I was actually very paranoid before. At least I've gotten over the paranoia now. As for the voices, they're not as loud as they used to be. Before, it was difficult to distinguish whether the neighbors/passerby were noisy or not. But now, the voices had been reduced to just audible thoughts, and I know they're just in my head.

I'm thinking of either shifting to becoming a programmer (probably front-end), or a UX Researcher, or even a Civil Engineer. Since my brother who's a programmer advised me to learn Python, I began learning a bit. I was a bit discouraged though because I wasn't sure if I would be good enough to survive in the workplace. I wasn't sure if I had enough logical ability to become a good programmer, especially as a back-end. I was worried that if I had difficulty solving problems like this: [https://codingbat.com/prob/p191363](https://codingbat.com/prob/p191363) that I might not have a future in the field. I can understand the solution, and probably even generate the syntax on my own  here: [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKdj4MBOYw](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKdj4MBOYw) but I struggled with the logic behind the solution on my own. The same was the case for this question: [https://codingbat.com/doc/practice/makebricks-solution-code.html](https://codingbat.com/doc/practice/makebricks-solution-code.html)  The other problems in codingbat were okay logic-wise though. Anyway, my question is, do you think I'm just making excuses or are my worries founded? Can I in time, as long as I do more problems, get better at logic? Or should I consider another career instead? If I pursue programming though, I'm considering learning through online courses first, then getting into a bootcamp which hopefully also introduces me to employers too, apart from applying directly to companies via job boards and company websites.

As for the UX Researcher, I think my main issue with this is that it seems to be a difficult career to get into. There are very few opportunities for starters (only 2 internships, one seasonal, found). And this is apart from the fact that I don't think I'm a very good writer, which might be an issue in the long-run.

Civil engineering somehow seems to be my last option in case the other two don't work out. I haven't fully explored the possibility yet, but it's a bit discouraging because I feel like this will take the most time to do as well since it'll probably take me at least 4 more years to complete the degree, on top of needing to do review on my physics, chem, and math, which I did not excel in back in college.

One of my major concerns either way is also my chances of even getting an interview. What do you think should I do about my resume and during the interviews considering my circumstances?

I'm 31 now by the way. And I've been depressed and exhausted from worrying over these things for a while, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

Since completing my undergraduate studies about 8 years ago, my focus has been primarily on network engineering. However, I've also pursued further education, obtaining a master's degree in Data Science and currently pursuing another master's in statistics.



The rapid evolution of the networking field constantly demands new skills, and I find myself contemplating the best path forward for my professional growth and satisfaction. On one hand, the data field, which I've studied extensively, offers promising opportunities and potentially higher financial rewards. Yet, transitioning to a data-related role may require starting from an entry-level position despite my education.



On the other hand, staying in network engineering necessitates ongoing certification and skill acquisition to remain relevant. While I'm intrigued by areas like AWS and Cybersecurity, which intersect with my current role, I wonder if further specialization in these areas is the right move.

1cjthux,I can't commit to a job.,"Hi all, 

Looking for a bit of advice. 

M 24, 
I've been diagnosed with ADHD from the age of 8 so I've always known I had it, 
However as of 2 weeks ago I've finally been on medication and it has completely changed my life. 

My impulsivity has evaporated and I've taken on new hobbys like reading and writing, things I could never do prior to medication. 

The issue comes however when I was 21 I worked in Finance and wanted to succeed but as a result of the ADHD I was unable to perform any of the tasks and went through 3 jobs. 

I was fired from my 3rd job and decided to transition in to teaching, being unmedicated I was drawn to the idea of teaching thinking it would be games and fun. 

I am currently a teachers aid and will in 3 months be qualified to teach, Im currently employed at a school with very clear behavioural issues so it may be clouding my judgement. 

However now that I am medicated I have very little interest in teaching. Now that I am medicated my attention and orgsnization are phenomenal and I've been drawn to returning to finance and giving it a shot now that I've been through so much and organized. 

However after studying teaching for a year I feel guilty leaving it behind as I've dedicated so much time to it, however this was a pre medicated decision so I question its validity. 

The truth is im incredibly anxious and worried as all I want is stability I.e a happy job and not to be stressed about jobs and what I'll do. But also being 24 going on 25 I am not contempt with pursuing junior jobs and never progressing a career. 

Sorry for the long winded message all advice welcomed and appreciated.

Hello, 
I work as a project coordinator for a dry utilities contractor. I work for a fairly new company, last year the revenue was $5,000,000. My responsibilities include: creating bluestakes, ordering materials, paying vendors, waivers, insurance, billing, communication with client PMs, pretty much anything office admin without doing any bidding or PM tasks. I also do assistant duties. I manage the office, as I’m the one who found it and spoke with the realtor about getting a lease. I write letters for employees and change orders. Odd tasks I’m capable of doing but require minimal experience tbh. They keep me very busy and sometimes it’s a big work load. CEO has me read through contracts and make sure nothing looks sketchy. The owner just sends me most the emails that come through to him and has me handle it. I’m extremely new to the industry (3 months) and it’s not a huge company by any means, but seeing as since I’ve started I’ve watched the owner go from being at the computer all day to being able to watch TikTok’s and focus more on networking, I believe I bring a bit of value. I am handling getting the employees health insurance as well right now. Last week, owner asked me to create P&Ls per project so that’s something I’m working on, categorizing transactions for the projects I haven’t gotten to. I’ve done three this week while doing my other duties.  They hopes want me to become the in house bookkeeper  as well once I get all the backlogging done. I just applied to be a notary as well per their request if that matters. I’m very lost as to what to ask for my upcoming raise. I started at $20 an hour during “training”, if you can even call it that. I’m a really quick learner and they were desperate for help and I was looking for a new job. A month in I asked for more pay and my sister (who’s been in the industry for 3 years) said $25 seems fair. Owner said we can do $22 and discuss again at the end of this most recent billing period. It’s time to negotiate again, and I want it to be worthwhile. In the last month my workload and duties have doubled. While I know I have minimal experience and it’s still a small company, I’ve busted my ass to learn and I haven’t had any issues in recent. I get my work done and have helped them save money with vendors. I feel like $22 isn’t much considering I could go serve tables and make double that, but I do like my job. When I showed up, the owners wife was doing my job and made a lot of big mistakes. I don’t make mistakes that impact the company. Only mistakes I really make now is forgetting what I was gonna say to someone unless it’s written down. (I write or type anything important to avoid forgetting) I’m very thorough and triple check my work. I don’t want to ask too much but also don’t want to sell myself short. I know this is really drawn out so thank you if you’re still reading. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

1cjs6jv,Is Working 2 Internships Simultaneously Realistic?,"I'm an undergraduate student, and I have found two internships, one of which is part time and a passion of mine (pro bono, labor rights, etc.), and the other being commercial law, and full-time. The second one is a very reputable firm, and has a moonlight clause, but the first doesn't; I talked about moving my working hours to fully online, so I can do it over weekends if necessary to which they agreed. Essentially, I think I can pass off the first internship as a volunteering position; Would this breach the clause below?

""This offer letter shall supersede any prior agreements, promises, representations or understandings of any kind, whether made orally in writing or otherwise with regard to the subject of your employment.""

If I could, I would move the second internship over to the next summer, but I'm scared that if I ask them, they'll simply say I can't come in. Reason why I want to do this second internship is 1: It would be more experience at a respected firm, and it's paid, which would really help out (first internship is an unpaid volunteer-internship).

Caveat is that from what the hiring officer told me, I'm going to be the only undergraduate intern in the cohort, so I'll probably receive a lot less work.

Should I go through with both? If so, the dates overlap completely. Can I maybe ""edit"" the date for one of them, so that it doesn't overlap on my resume?

To start off i’m 25 years old and moved to a high COL area for my undergrad. Out of college I received a job offer for a job that was double my salary working at Subway. Over the past couple years I have received a ton of raises and I currently make a 75k salary. We also have semi annual bonuses that can range anywhere from 10k-20k at my current denomination. The people at the top receive about 40k-100k in bonus checks semi annually. 

The work is stressful at times and i don’t particularly enjoy it. It’s also in an industry that im unsure of the future outlook in. 
The company i work for is small and has been in business for a little over 30 years with no real problems.  A negative would be the lack of benefits. No retirement, shitty medical, No dental or Eye. we have the standard 40 sick hrs. Vacation accrues at a 3 days a year paced At 5 years 5 days at 10 years 10 days. I spend about 1.5 hrs to get home after work and about an hour to get to work. This is with a fast pass which i spend about $300 on a month. I do this because I rent a room for $500 a month. 1 bed apartments near my job are $2600 a month at the cheapest. 

Now to get to where my dilemma is. My Cousin offered me one of his houses to live in rent free just paying utilities in another part of the state that is really low cost of living. I would work towards getting a Masters in my degree (healthcare) as I really miss working in it. I worked as a medical assistant for 3 years during undergrad. I would also be near my family and friends again which i really miss being able to do. Whenever I visit back home the 2-3 times i feel like i should have never left as I find the time i spend with them more valuable than what i did when i was 17. Here i. my current city I really have no friends as they all moved to their hometowns after college or i just lost contact with them. My GF is down to move and thinks it’s a good opportunity to move. I just want to know if leaving a job with high earning potential is dumb.

TLDR; Can’t decide if leaving a high paying job that i don’t like is worth moving back near family and friends to go back to school and work a career I actually want",Terrible-Mud6515,1,1.0,0,1714795928,2024-05-04 04:12:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cjrn8s/looking_for_guidance/,5,2024
1cjr3nc,How do you work at an intern?,"Hi, I'm currently working at a paid intern and I've been having trouble managing the students in the internship. 

My internship revolves around going on field trips with students and looking after them, nothing too complicated like planning the field trips and talking to the bus companies.

  
An issue I've been dealing with is just being myself with the students around me. The kids here are kind, but sometimes I just feel really threatened and have my boundaries broken.

So, for a brief run-down, our organization works in bringing together local communities and learning how to garden and the such.

There are two main group of kids I want to learn how to communicate better.

1) There's a few kids that talk about skibidi toilet and I'm just really not sure how to react to that, especially when they come up to me. I'm not sure what Skibidi Toilet is and just kinda laugh with the mood they're in, but it keeps especially awkward for me. 

2) The second one I take care of is a kid around my age, who isn't an intern, but a student at our organization. He's a bit of a troublesome student to deal with because he's not someone I want to hang out with, but I'm really the only person in the internship that he treats with respect. I think I said he's around my age, he wears a mask everytime, a beanie to cover his hair, and is just super masked up every time our program starts. He doesn't talk much and seems very passive-aggressive. There was a time when he noticed me looking at him and he came up to me, close up to my face, and asked ""what are you looking at, why do you keep looking at me, i'm gonna get my brothers and take you out."" The staff saw this and asked if I was ok. He now compliments me a lot and I can tell this is flattery. He's typically a quiet kid, but when we got plastic knives for an event in dissecting a plant and learning more about it on a field trip, he said ""oh, we need a knife"" and acted like something was up. I'm going to say his skin color, so trigger warning for being racist here, but I'm going to say he's a black person. I'm including this because I believe there may be a correlation with his skin color and how he's acting to not just me, but everyone else. We're told that he came from a place where it isn't the best environment and our organization strongly believes in giving kids grace because the interns were informed of how childhood trauma lasts into adult life and crime rate, so we want to offer students grace to understand the situation and do implement punishments like infractions to their stipend, very rarely. But, there was a time where I told him that he was a cool person and I wanted to eat my lunch with another intern I hung out with and felt comfortable around. He was cool and just walked away, didn't say much. He's not a bad kid, I just don't know how to interact with him. We're pretty chill with one another, but last time, we ended off with him spitting something from his throat close to me and said ""glad i didn't spray that on you?"" 

  
All of them are good kids. I'm just not really sure how to interact with them and often get swept up in the mood, not acting like myself and becoming very uncomfortable and making many regrets. I'm a bit confused on how to act. If anyone has work experience, internship, or just life advice in general, I'm open to all responses and would appreciate any advice.

So I got 2 interviews for a job I’m super excited for (one with the assistant director and then one with the director) they seemed to really like me and said they would be calling references and doing a background check and then reaching out to me on Monday. I didn’t hear back so I called in on Tuesday to follow up and she said she was happy to hear from me and apologized that she didn’t call but said she was waiting on her assistant director (I’m assuming to discuss candidates and make a decision) and that she would call me Wednesday. 
I got No call for the rest of the week and I’m feeling quite discouraged. I’d assume they would call even if I didn’t get it… or I’d hope they would. 
Should I follow up in an email or call again if I don’t hear back by next week? Or should I wait to hear from them?

1cjpyb7,Possibility of leaving temp job for permanent one after three months. ,"So I applied for this job I really wanted a few months back and just had not heard anything so I assumed that they passed on me, but they called me out of the blue and left a message at the end of the day today and offered me the job, but I can't really respond until Monday. In the mean time I already got a job through a recruiter that purports to be ""temp to hire"" after 6 months and I have been there for 3 months so far. 

This job that was offered out of the blue on the surface is better in almost every way. It pays better, offers the option of working hybrid remote, offers full time benefits very quickly, and seems very safe and secure. I'm in my mid 20s living with my parents and am working my way through a college degree, so it's not as if I am super desperate, but it's still better. At my current temp position, I've gotten no firm answer on if I will ever be permanently hired, the job isn't what was described, and all they do is shove the tedious tasks they don't want to do onto me and I am basically just doing those tasks or doing nothing at all with no valuable skills being learned. Only upside is they've been amicable and very flexible with when I need to call out sick or something, which I am grateful for.

I know the obvious answer is to leave the temp job and take the offered one, but I am on my 4th job in 2 years due to no fault of my own. I mean the last 2 companies I worked for, I was mistreated at one and the other one literally went bankrupt. I just want some stability with work, and I am ultra hesitant to just roll the dice on another job. At least at this temp job I know what I am dealing with. I'm just tired of hopping between jobs and I'm uncertain about what to do. Do I just stick with this temp job and just cross my fingers and hope it works out or do I roll the dice again and hope that the next job will just ""be the one.""

1cjowap,Is this job hopping? ,"I’ve worked at the same company for nearly a decade.

I had a short stint 8 years ago where I left for a short stint and came back.

I’ve had a few different roles within the company over the years. Accountant for nearly five, and then switched to a Business Unit Budget Manager and then a year to the central Budget team. In those four years in finance I had the same title and worked in the same subsidiary; I would argue it was the same job just a different team.                                  I just accepted a people manager in another department of the company but I’m worried I’ve backed myself into a niche finance component of the company after working on this team for a few months. What sounded really neat has turned out to be very dry and not what I was hoping.

My issue was I was getting great performance reviews but had nowhere to go. 

If this doesn’t work out, I may have to consider leaving the company. My issue has been that our org chart is messy and there aren’t clear paths to moving up the chain. 


I assume if I have to update my resume externally I can show my four year stint in finance as one position because the title and the subsidiary I was on were congruent between the two teams? 

I’ve been told internal transfers are not job hopping but wanted to get others thoughts?

To start off i’m 24 years old and moved to a high COL area for my undergrad. Out of college I received a job offer for a job that was double my salary working at Subway. Over the past couple years I have received a ton of raises and I currently make a 75k salary. We also have semi annual bonuses that can range anywhere from 10k-20k at my current denomination. The people at the top receive about 40k-100k in bonus checks semi annually. The work is stressful at times and i don’t particularly enjoy it. It’s also in an industry that im unsure of the future outlook in. The company i work for is small and has been in business for a little over 30 years with no real problems.  A negative would be the lack of benefits. No retiremen, shitty medical, No dental or Eye. we have the standard 40 sick hrs. Vacation accrues at a 3 days a year paced At 5 years 5 days at 10 years 10 days. I spend about 1.5 hrs to get home after work and about an hour to get to work. This is with a fast pass which i spend about $300 on a month. I do this because I rent a room for $500 a month. 1 bed apartments near my job are $2600 a month at the cheapest.

1cjkc5m,Salary Negotiation Gone Flat? Looking for advice!,"TLDR: Looking for insight from anyone who's been in a similar situation, small company-side of salary negotiations, and ways to continue moving forward with a positive attitude and appetite to stay with the company a long time if the vibe is right. 

DETAILS:

I've been courting a full time position with a company I've freelanced with for about a year. This position did not exist, but rather a role they had created so that I could join the company. When they recently introduced the salary offer, the person I was working with directly, who I get excellent energy from, had reiterated a couple of times that they were willing to discuss compensation and package.

When I countered, looking for about $20,000 more (the offer was $120k and I had said I was looking for $130k-150k, and would be very happy if it was possible to land at $140k – and for context, my past salary in a pretty different industry was $165k which I did not disclose to them), they came back to me and firmly said $120,000 was the best they could do. The level of the position also felt like it had shrunk a little based on minor comments. I was friendly and firm throughout our email and conversations, but can't help but feel like there was a shift that happened on their side that I don't fully understand. 

I feel neutral-excited to begin the job and may look for freelance work on the side to bolster my income, where I feel like I would have been more thrilled about the situation if they would have worked with me a bit, or if they would have been honest up front that the salary was the best they could do. I really like the people, the company, and I'm looking forward to the experience so, again, I'm happy to start the job, but can't help can't help feel like I was slightly misled?

1cjk5ig,Jobs for clinicians moving to a country where they don’t speak the local language (yet),"Hi all, 

My (27) girlfriend (27) and I are thinking about moving to Europe from the UK next year, places of interest are Barcelona, Paris and Munich, but open to other locations.

I work in sales within clinical research and my role is remote so the move would not necessitate a career change for me. My girlfriend on the other hand is a practising dietician in the NHS and loves her role. Because of differences in the healthcare systems and because she doesn’t speak a second language (yet), working in a hospital environment isn’t an option. 

She has never considered a non-clinical role and isn’t sure what she would do, but she is super bright, a good communicator, very diligent and motivated. 

I am sure I could get her a role at my company, or a competitor, working in clinical operations or something similar as the work is global (so done in English) and she has a science degree/clinical background.

At this stage, there are a lot of options so I’m trying to help her narrow them down so that she can look into a few things and evaluate whether she would enjoy them properly. 

The main things she enjoys about her current role are that it’s mentally challenging, she gets to solve problems, she works with the public and gets to help people.

1cjgwc7,What should I do?,"Hello all! 

Some context: I used to work as a mechanic making just under 80k. Got hurt at work and no longer able to continue my career. I transitioned to Cybersecurity and my salary dropped to about 50k. Workers comp pays the difference to the 80k. 

  
Now that i have been in this role for almost a year, my review is coming up and i know I will get a raise. My issue is that I am not actually going to make more money until I pass the 80k mark and workers comp stops paying me. I have a great boss and really do not want to leave to try and jump to a higher salary than 80k (my role is very specialized and very in demand) and i doubt they would give me a 30k raise. What could I ask for to feel like I'm getting a raise without raising the hourly rate. 

It is a new department and it is just me and 1 other guy, there is no management position with such a small department at this time. I'm not sure what I should ask for or should i just take the ""raise"" and next year hope to pass the 80k mark ?

Autor Mel Robbins talks about the 5 second rule and counting down from 5 and acting on something with those 5 seconds. That’s what makes all the difference in ultimately breaking procrastination and getting stuff done.

1cjepji,Feeling confident while feeling unsure. Need Advice if possible (Engineering / IT) Possibly?,"Hi Community,

I don't know how to explain this as it may sound crazy. I'm feeling **confident** while also very proud of myself. I'm currently studying Engineering which is something I'm very passionate about. However, I'm also selfaware as I know that just focusing on studying Engineering is not going to be viable in terms of a stable income. That's why I'm wanting to get into the IT Field in terms of work. However, I've read multiple posts about how difficult it can be to get into this field. Although, I've also seen some success stories through using other methods such as: Learning Programming / Coding & creating your own Portfolio. - Working with others for free on projects & then adding those projects to your Portfolio. I've even seen **12 Week Coding Boot Camps** be mentioned. Which now makes me believe that perhaps I'm looking at this in a different perspective.

Firstly, am I right for still sticking with the University studying Engineering? Am I right for wanting to gain experience in IT while getting into an entry level job for IT? - I just feel like I'm really confident while also feeling slightly lost or misdirected. Either way, I need to know from those who are more experienced on what I could do from this point on to reach the goals I'm wanting to reach.

What can you advise in terms of getting into a work position that pays decently? & what roles should I be applying for in terms of IT?

Thank you for your time,

I'm not sure whether I'll have many responses to this post. I just appreciate any kind soul that wishes to help another soul that's misdirected & misguided in life.

I hope you all have a great day & I wish you all success in everything you wish to do & do already!

1cjd3i9,"Co-worker problems, advice appreciated ","I am still fairly new in my job, I have been here for 7 months. When I originally interviewed it was for a different (higher paid) role however the role was given to another woman who started at the same time as me. A bespoke role was created for me so I could do duties I am already trained in but also so I could eventually work into becoming part of the management team as that is what they saw as the next step for me and I was very vocal about wanting to progress into management.

Since starting I have had no structure or guidance in my job, it almost felt like I had been forgotten about without any place I truly fit in, I work in my own office alone and I was ready to throw the towel in as I’ve been pretty miserable however we have had a change of directors and one of the managers is retiring, during my appraisal with the new director earlier this week she made it clear the next steps are ready to start the process of me becoming part of the management team which was great news and I finally felt like all my years effort working in this role were going to have meaning.
Last week I flagged up a few issues with a certain aspect in work and overheard 3 of my colleagues talking about me for mentioning this (I was not being malicious just pointing out part of the job which could be made easier however they got their backs up about it) but saying some quite nasty things. I’m not a confrontational person and I want to remain professional so I didn’t say anything but they realised I heard as my office door was open and I was in the room next door which I don’t usually work from.
One of the women who was bitching about me was the same one who got the job I interviewed for, she came in to see me today to apologise as she was aware I must have heard, I told her I did and I accept her apology but it wasn’t a nice feeling to have three grown women talking about me and it felt like bullying. She told me it’s came from a place of jealousy because she heard about me going into management and that’s what she wants to do and she told me she is going to speak to the director as she wants to be considered.

Now I’m left feeling really flat, like I’ve wasted 7 months here because there will now have to be an interview process since she has expressed interest and I feel that she will be offered the job over me since she must have interviewed better than me originally to get the role she is already in. I know she has every right to go for what she wants but I guess I just want another opinion on the situation and some advice.

1cjbm71,I'm at a crossroad and could really use some advice,"Hey guys. So I'm a 26 years old male from Greece and quite the overthinker. I have been changing degrees and jobs for a while now as I don't know what I want to do and am quite indecisive. Last year I did a 7 months software engineering bootcamp and was probably the only think I really enjoyed studying all these years. But after finishing I started applying for jobs but was finding the interview process hard and realised there was still work that needed to be done and things to study to have a chance at the very competitive programming job market. So I decided to first do my mandatory military service in Greece and I am now finishing in August. So I have some options but not sure what to do. So any advice would be greatly appreciated. Plan a: Try to find a part-time job cause I need to be working cause and I dont know how much time the job search is gonna need. And while working keep applying for coding jobs and try to self study and or do some seminars. Also as I haven't been learning to code for some months now cause of the military service and I know I'm gonna need some much needed revision which I'm not sure if I am disciplined enough to study on my own.
Plan b: I have a bachelor's degree in Game art and animation which is not completely related to computer science but could still do a master's in computer science in some mostly private universities. Also If I was to go this route I would mostly prefer doing a masters abroad and not in Greece while doing a part time job. But I'm not surfing masters is worth it when I have an unrelated bachelor. Plan c: Try to get a desk job with my father's help in the company he works at probably unrelated to programming and see where that goes maybe studying some coding on the side as well. Plan d: Do a bachelor's in computer science abroad while trying to work. This would be one of the harder routes as I will be finishing at the earliest when I'm 29 and don't know if I'll have time to work while doing a bachelor. If I'm lucky I could get a job earlier while applying and won't pursue further education as I think job experience in software development/engineering would be more valuable for me now. 
In August I'm finishing my service and I need to decide what to do with my life. I know this is a lot but any help/advice would be much appreciated.",imStylo,1,1.0,0,1714750452,2024-05-03 15:34:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cjbm71/im_at_a_crossroad_and_could_really_use_some_advice/,5,2024
1cjbcun,Feeling stuck once again,"Making this post because I genuinely feel like there isn't a good job out there for me. Or if there is the barrier to entry is too high.

Since graduating college in 2018 I have taken 2 customer service type roles because it is all that was willing to interview and hire me. 

One role was working in the fraud dept at a major bank. Job wasn't too bad when it was in office but once covid hit it was bascially just being yelled at all day working from home. I knew it probably wouldn't be a good idea to take the job but I had no other options. the plan was to move up in the company after a year. Unfortunately someone was screaming at me over the phone and I messed up a quality procedure because I couldn't think straight and quality pulled that call which made me not eligible for a promotion.

Was out of work for a year after that and took the next job I was able to get which was a customer service adjacent type role at a logistics company. I figured it had to be better then getting yelled at all day on the phones. Wrong. No matter what I did I was always expected to do more for no pay raise. I took over the duties of the person who trained me and had to learn all by myself because nobody else knew how to help. Then when their replacement joined I was expected to train them  while i keep doing the extra work. Got passed up for a promotion because they claimed i wasn't doing enough after all of that. 

Left that job almost a year ago and once again cant find a job. I dont know what I'm supposed to do to break this cycle of horrible job after horrible job. I worry that because I have autism and a learning disability I rub upper management the wrong way and this will stunt any future career growth. 

I dont even care about climbing the corporate ladder I just want to be able to support myself and not think about jumping off a bridge at my job.

1cjaxuh,Tips for negotiating for a higher raise at my one year review? Nervous that whatever my raise is will be disappointing.,"So I work in a team of about 14 people in a big office (company has hundreds of employees, but my team is about 14 people).

The environment is pretty corporate. The pay seems to be entry level for my particular team and they often hire people with not much experience, myself included. One year ago, I accepted a low pay because I was just grateful to be given the opportunity with little experience in the field and not many office/computer skills.

For reference, the starting pay for my team is between $21-$25 an hour. We get full benefits (medical/dental/vision fully paid, 15 days PTO, paid holidays, etc. Benefits are good).

The offer I accepted was $22/hour. I attempted to negotiate for $24 an hour, but they declined, citing I didn't have experience and that I didn't score super high on my Excel placement test. I thought, okay, it is what it is.

Fast forward one year later. My managers have been saying all year long that I've been doing a great job. I got a really good 3 month review. I get along with pretty much everyone on my team. I feel comfortable on Excel now. I'm dependable and dedicated. I've never called out, haven't used up much of my PTO (I currently have over 100 hours racked up). I definitely think I have leverage to get a good raise. I recently just hit one one year work anniversary and I heard they were ""working on"" my one year review.

Here's the thing. Right before I started working for this company (a month or two before), my team lost several members. They were dropping like flies and getting new jobs because they weren't satisfied with their pay. I guess HR started panicking and started handing out raises like candy to the remaining team members. Some members on the team who had only worked there for a couple months suddenly jumped from $21/hour to $24/hr. Now guess what? Those team members have just hit their one year and got raises again, so they're all making $25+ an hour. Then the team members that have worked there several years are making $30+ an hour.

So I joined the team as the lowest paid member by several dollars. I knew this but I thought it was fine. I was brand new, had zero experience, and was just grateful they were training me on everything from scratch.

About 6 months ago, we got a new person on the team. He was disgruntled because HR only offered them $21/hr. He begrudgingly accepted, but since day 1, he has been complaining non-stop about the pay. He sits next to me and literally every. single. DAY. I never heard the end of it! He was rejecting extra work, he online shops all day, spins around in his chair bored out of his mind, never volunteers, etc. Just extremely entitled and lazy. And like me, he had no experience, except he came across as very ungrateful for the opportunity.

He started harassing HR about pay almost every single week, and he managed to get a salary boost from $21 an hour to $24 an hour about a month ago. I don't understand what he did to warrant this. I was pissed. I do so much more and work so much harder, and yet his laziness is rewarded. I came home and cried after I found out and could barely sleep, I was so furious.

So now that I've hit my one year, I really want to buckle down and fight for myself during this review, whenever it happens. I feel like I've proven myself as a valuable member of the team and have been given verbal confirmation of this SEVERAL times by my supervisors. Yet I'm the lowest paid member on the team by several dollars. I just want to be on the same level as my work colleagues in terms of pay. I don't think this is fair at all.

Besides citing all the examples of my achievements over the years, what else can I do in order to fight for myself? I think annual raises are capped and from what I've gathered, at my company, they tend to be around 5-6% if they like you. I noticed the team members who got several dollar raises - they got them outside of their one year reviews. Is there a way I can somehow go around this hurdle if raises are capped?

Also, how can I fight for a bigger raise without bringing up other team member's pay? I think that's unprofessional but it makes me so angry that there's this big pay gap between me and them. I'll be even angrier if I get a raise that only brings me up to like, $23 an hour, when everyone else is making 25/26 an hour at their one year mark. What's a good roundabout way of calling this out??

I don't know what I'm doing wrong or how to properly advocate for myself. This is my first corporate job and I just don't understand all the rules and politics. Can anybody help me out and give me some tips?",BluebirdMaximum8210,1,0.6700000166893005,5,1714748738,2024-05-03 15:05:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cjaxuh/tips_for_negotiating_for_a_higher_raise_at_my_one/,5,2024

It would be in a product management role for a very big MFG.  It's in a completely different department than I am in currently.  I make $27.03 per hour (roughly 56k a year as base pay) right now plus commission/bonus and since I do not know what the average base pay for this department is, I stupidly told him I would like $60k a year.  I realized after I hung up that is only about $3500 more per year base pay, BUT here is the issue.  I get a guaranteed bonus of $700 the first 2 months of each quarter right now, that is not part of my base pay.  I feel like what I asked for is less than what I now get.  I feel really stupid and don't know what I was thinking.  I am not good at negotiating.  Please don't knock me for this, just looking for advice on how to tell him I would actually like a base pay of 68k a year without jeopardizing my chances being hired for it.

1cjal8t,Career switch from electrical engineering to civil/transport advice,"
Hi lovely people,

I’m an electrical engineer (23yo) just graduated with my bachelors degree last year (in Canada), and have been working in electronics at a semiconductor company since. Since the last year or so of my degree, I kind of realized that this field is not for me long term and that was only consolidated once I started working. I want to work in something with a larger scope and impacting more people than work on tiny electronics for a company’s profit.

I’m really considering a switch to urban planning (or transportation engineering) with a masters. I love the potential political aspects of the field where you can be involved in important decision making that impact people, and take on bigger projects. And the field seems very interesting and sustainable to me with populations and cities growing all the time.

Would it be achievable for me to do a masters in urban planning/transport engineering without much background?
Would it even be a good idea? What is the job market like for it in Canada? Are you happy with your job and feel like you are making an impact?

Thank you so much in advance:)",Individual_Tailor278,1,1.0,0,1714747865,2024-05-03 14:51:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cjal8t/career_switch_from_electrical_engineering_to/,5,2024

So I've been trying to find myself lately and take my passions more seriously in search for better work life balance and happiness. 

 I was just offered a job as a videographer and video editor at a local digital marketing firm. However, it's for less pay and less hours. I did the math and the difference, about 25-30% less, would still be able to cover our bills. I just wouldn't have as much left over for savings. 

I talked with my wife about this dilemma I'm in. She has a good WFH job and is happy with where she's at. She told me that she doesn't care what I do as long as we can pay our bills and that I'm happy.

1cj7g9x,Stay for Promotion or Accept Higher Paying Government Job?,"I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice.

I understand that this isn't guaranteed and this promotion could be affected by other external factors like budget or recession. 

I've received a couple of job offers. 

State Government Job: This is a 6-month fixed term position in Brisbane offering $110k + 12.75%. Taking this job would require me to relocate.

Federal Government Job: This is a 12-month fixed term in Canberra, offering $106k + 15.4% super.

I'm in my mid-20s with about 2.5 years of experience in the accounting/finance. I should finish my CA at the end of this year.

I understand that staying in government roles might pay less in the long run compared to private sector roles. However, I feel that each year I delay buying a home, I'm losing out on rent payments and potential potential equity increase. 

Given these factors, should I pursue the higher salary now with the government job or stay with my current employer in hopes of the promotion? Which option would be wiser for my career and financial goals?

1cj79qn,"I took a misleading job, and I don't know if I should stay or leave. What should I do?","I was hired by a startup marketing agency four months ago. The agreement was to train me part-time as their Operations Support Intern for six months, followed by full-time employment as the company’s Growth Operations Manager upon finishing my training. During the training period, I’d be compensated $1K a month. Afterward, I’d transition to a salary range from $80K to $90K per year. 

However, I’m having some issues: 

• I was told I’d be supporting the agency’s operational processes and project execution internally to grow the business, eventually running the department myself as the Growth Operations Manager as the agency grew. Instead, I am the Project Manager for all of our clients, and when I'm hired full-time, we'll get get more clients for me to project manage.

• I was not briefed on who the clients are or our relationship with them. After a couple of months, I learned that we just sold these clients a $2K service (our unique “Growth Operations System”) for me to run Agile project management for them. I had two weeks of observing my boss run these meetings with them (Sprint Reviews, Planning, etc.) before I took over the Scrum cycle with no other training.

• I did not know I was the “Scrum Master” (and all other roles within the agile framework) until a consultant on the team referred to me as that in passing; this was well after I was running with the accounts.

• No training has been provided other than the first two weeks of watching my boss lead Scrum meetings. I’m told to figure it out on my own. 

• Performance reviews were supposed to be conducted at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32-week intervals; none of them have happened yet.

• We agreed the hours of the internship would be flexible, with the understanding I would be available for any required meetings. The required meetings start at 7:30am and end at 3:00pm, which turns my “24 hours per week” into a full-time job. 

• After onboarding, I learned my boss's business model is employing virtual assistants from the Philippines and never paying full-price for an employee; why would he bring me for $80-90K a year if he could hire someone overseas for a fraction of the cost?

• He pays my invoices 4-6 weeks late. 

• The business model in its entirety is unstable. He’s still figuring out how to scale the business. He told me that he has systems for everything and is already scaling operations, which was true, but now that I’m involved in operations, it’s falling apart. 

I’ve addressed all of these points with him and regularly voice my concerns. Generally speaking, he does try to improve, but the company is mostly in a state of constant hustle and disorganization. 

I could always wait it out until my “internship” ends in July, then see if I get offered the salaried position. It wasn’t the job I expected to do, and I’m not in a season of learning that I thought I’d be in, but it would be $80-$90K going directly to savings for an easy job. I also already spent four months here, so it’s the sunken cost that’s getting me.

1cj5kzi,Post ADHD career advice,"Hi all, 

Looking for a bit of advice. 

M 24, 
I've been diagnosed with ADHD from the age of 8 so I've always known I had it, 
However as of 2 weeks ago I've finally been on medication and it has completely changed my life. 

My impulsivity has evaporated and I've taken on new hobbys like reading and writing, things I could never do prior to medication. 

The issue comes however when I was 21 I worked in Finance and wanted to succeed but as a result of the ADHD I was unable to perform any of the tasks and went through 3 jobs. 

I was fired from my 3rd job and decided to transition in to teaching, being unmedicated I was drawn to the idea of teaching thinking it would be games and fun. 

I am currently a teachers aid and will in 3 months be qualified to teach, Im currently employed at a school with very clear behavioural issues so it may be clouding my judgement. 

However now that I am medicated I have very little interest in teaching. Now that I am medicated my attention and orgsnization are phenomenal and I've been drawn to returning to finance and giving it a shot now that I've been through so much and organized. 

However after studying teaching for a year I feel guilty leaving it behind as I've dedicated so much time to it, however this was a pre medicated decision so I question its validity. 

The truth is im incredibly anxious and worried as all I want is stability I.e a happy job and not to be stressed about jobs and what I'll do. But also being 24 going on 25 I am not contempt with pursuing junior jobs and never progressing a career. 

Sorry for the long winded message all advice welcomed and appreciated.

1cj5h98,Some advice for a young person in their first office job,"Hi,

I recently started my first office job in an entry level position in a travel company. 

A job has just opened up within my company in a field I’m much more interested in. (I’m in operations and the job opening is in products)

Our hr sent out and email regarding the job and the deadline for interested parties is tomorrow, is there a way I can mention my interest without offending my manager or coming across as ungrateful? I’m still in my probationary period so I think it’s too early to formally apply but to express interest in the position could be a good idea??

We have a ‘day in the life’ scheme at work so I was thinking of emailing HR and saying that I was interested in Products and while it’s too early for me to apply perhaps I could look into doing a day in the life with them in the near-ish future. I’d also let my manager know that I was interested in doing a day in the life with products and I wouldn’t want it to seem like I was going behind her back.


Perhaps it’s too early for any of this and I should just hold out for now? I’m by far the youngest in the office and I want to express ambition but perhaps just sticking it out in operations for a while longer is a good idea.


Anyway, apologies for the long message, any advice is appreciated.

1cj4ihy,What can I do with a business degree and 2 years of experience?,"I got laid off 3 months ago and I am still looking for a new job. I would like to hear some thoughts on what I should do.

I graduated in June 2022 with a bachelors degree in Business. I started working as a sales development representative at a small tech company. Including internships i have a little over 3 years of experience in sales / business development. Now, I don't love sales: it was simply the only job that would hire me straight out of college and I needed to pay rent. Now that I am looking for a new job I am realizing that I don't like sales at all. Cold-calling, emailing, linkedin messages... i just really don't like it all.

Initially, my plan was to study a (part time) master's degree next to my fulltime job and advance from there. Suddenly getting laid off messed with those plans. 


I'd love to hear some suggestions, where do I go from here? I have been applying for 3 months straight and I get rejected everywhere because I don't have at least 3 years of fulltime experience. I just feel lost. Thanks for your suggestions.

1cj43nv,Seeking Career Advice: Transitioning from Academia to Industry,"As a fellow researcher in the field of Computer Science, specializing in Machine Learning security and data breach detection, I find myself at a crossroads in my career path, and I would greatly appreciate your insights and advice.

After completing my PhD, I am confronted with the challenge of deciding between pursuing a career in academia or transitioning to the industry. While academia offers the allure of conducting cutting-edge research and contributing to the academic community, the reality of securing a stable, well-paying position in my home country's public universities seems increasingly daunting.

Many of my peers have pursued postdoctoral positions abroad with hopes of eventually securing tenure-track positions in prestigious universities. However, the uncertainty and competitiveness of academia, coupled with the experiences of friends who have struggled to secure permanent positions, have given me pause.

Conversely, I have friends in the industry, some with only master's degrees, who speak highly of their job satisfaction and lucrative compensation packages. They suggest that transitioning to industry could provide stability and financial security without sacrificing the opportunity to apply my research skills in practical, real-world settings.

While I am passionate about research and enjoy the intellectual challenges it presents, I worry about the long-term sustainability of an academic career. It feels like a perpetual cycle of job searching and uncertainty, with no guarantee of achieving financial stability or significant compensation.

Given this dilemma, I am seeking advice from professionals like yourself who have navigated similar career decisions. I would greatly appreciate any insights or perspectives you can offer regarding the pros and cons of pursuing a career in academia versus transitioning to industry, particularly in the context of my expertise in Machine Learning security and data breach detection.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my situation, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.",dionisole,1,1.0,0,1714727183,2024-05-03 09:06:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cj43nv/seeking_career_advice_transitioning_from_academia/,5,2024
1cj3ddh,Does anyone have managing tips? I'm super overwhelmed and try way too hard,"Okay basically Im a fast food manager. Lots of shit workers, very few good workers, constant no shows, and constant bullshit customer rushes. Im a closer so I have to make sure everything's done correctly while also helping while also doing paper work on the side.

In my head I just see this pile of stuff that needs to be done and I can never focus on one thing. Im hopping all over the place. I hate having to tell people to do things because they're either bad at it or I feel like a big ol mean grumpy manager guy that makes people work.

I cannot keep up with this tho. Im only one person and theres only so much attention and energy I have for the day. If I have to do a task thats longer than like 30 mins good fucking luck getting that done.

If normal people can give a constant 60-80% for an extended period of time, I can give 100% for like 20-30 mins and everything after that is a nice cruising 30%.

I feel like im a shit manager and the only reason I have good shifts is because I brute force through them. Im scared of telling people what to do, I hate having slow or bad workers do a shit job that I have to re do after them, but I also cant be the only one doing everything...

I also struggle with perfectionism so that makes it worse. Most people would take 80% good enough and leave, but I need to be that above and beyond loser that kills himself over some sandwiches.

Im bad with time management. I'll just watch the hours go by as no work gets done.

I also have really bad imposter syndrome. It seems like my coworkers like working with me and my boss likes the work I do, but I keep trying to prove to myself thats its all fake or lies and I always have to be better than my last shift even tho my shifts are already better than almost all the other managers.

She works overnight 12 hour shifts one week on one week off watching one person so is able to rest, and in the day time watches different clients throughout the day. It ends up being like 80 hour weeks but she's still not getting enough to pay her bills.

I'm not sure what her bills are but with rent going up and minimum wage fast approaching her hourly rate (we live in cananda), there isn't much point for her to stay in her current role, plus she's just sick of it. It's too unstable. Clients die or go into homes all the time and she's going to lose her night job when the place closes down once they lose one more client.

She doesn't have any skills, doesn't have the time or money to go to school, and is very overweight making it difficult for her to be on her feet for long periods of time

I got a promotion today and I have all sorts of duties and responsibilities. I went from receptionist/office admin to operations support specialist and in training to become operations manager. Another duty I took on myself because i was so bored and like to keep busy, I took over administering health and safety compliance training due to boredom. Well, I got noticed. VP and national HR director want to make me representative for all of Saskatchewan. I was a cook for 15 years, first office job. This is nice.

1cj2562,Should I move back home for higher pay and 2 hour commute or no commute but rent and lower pay?,"I might be jumping the gun here because I don’t actually have an offer yet and I won’t be hell bent if I don’t because I don’t necessarily need a new job but want a new job.

Currently 21M been working at a big SaaS company (30k employees) for about a year in Channel Alliances. I fell into it on accident through an internship and I really like the channel partners I work with, but I generally feel like I do nothing and I feel like it’s stunting my growth.

My manager is nice, but she’s not that helpful in regards to knowledge, leadership, and guidance. I’ve basically had to figure out everything from Day 1 on boarding with little help, which makes sense because I’m also the first early in career person they hired on this team, but I guess I was a little disillusioned coming from a startup in college.

Current Comp: 65k Base 107k OTE

Also it’s not intellectually challenging for me so I’m looking to get into Sales Engineering. Trying to upskill myself on our platform so I can hopefully switch internally.

In fact, even though I feel like I do nothing I’ve received awards and kudos and exceeded quota, it truly makes no sense. My mind is always telling me they’re going to fire me as soon as they figure it out.

That said, I’ve been applying to jobs for fun on the side just to evaluate the market. I’ve applied to both Sales Engineering and Channel roles. 

So far only luck with the channel roles which makes sense.

I’m far in the process with a company currently (5k employees) where I would be making 90k base. Only problem is I would have to relocate. Which is fine, but it’s 2 hours from my hometown. So I figure I would just live at home and commute to the office twice a week and save a lot of money.


On the other hand, my partner of a year is moving to NYC for a job. Before all of this, we talked about moving in together in NYC or SoCal where we live now. We would split rent in a room together with other suite mates, so it would be a cheaper situation + no commute. My current team would be supportive of the move and I feel like I might be giving up an opportunity for more career trajectory and getting into Sales Engineering, I just feel stuck. 

I graduated college early last year so I could get ahead in my career, now I feel regretful because of how easy my job is.",jailbreakjock,1,1.0,1,1714718777,2024-05-03 06:46:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cj2562/should_i_move_back_home_for_higher_pay_and_2_hour/,5,2024

• To be surrounded by people who are more successful than me so I can keep learning.   
  
• Have some money going to savings since the business is break-even.   
  
I started looking for a job where I’d be heavily involved in operations. I was hired by a startup marketing agency four months ago. The agreement was to train me part-time as their Operations Support Intern for six months, followed by full-time employment as the company’s Growth Operations Manager upon finishing my training. During the training period, I’d be compensated $1K a month. Afterward, I’d transition to a salary range from $80K to $90K per year.   
  
This setup was perfect for me because it was a startup where I could be closely involved in the company’s success, grow with them, learn a ton, and earn a decent income—all while they understood that I'm still a business owner and need a flexible schedule.  
  
However, I’m having some issues:   
  
• I was told I’d be supporting the agency’s operational processes and project execution internally to grow the business, eventually running the department myself as the Growth Operations Manager as the agency grew. Instead, I am the Project Manager for all of our clients.  
  
• I was not briefed on who the clients are or our relationship with them. After a couple of months, I learned that we just sold these clients a $2K service (our unique “Growth Operations System”) for me to run Agile project management for them. I had two weeks of observing my boss run these meetings with them (Sprint Reviews, Planning, etc.) before I took over the Scrum cycle with no other training.  
  
• I did not know I was the “Scrum Master” (and all other roles within the agile framework) until a consultant on the team referred to me as that in passing; this was well after I was running with the accounts.  
  
• No training has been provided other than the first two weeks of watching my boss lead Scrum meetings. I’m told to figure it out on my own.   
  
• Performance reviews were supposed to be conducted at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32-week intervals; none of them have happened yet.  
  
• We agreed the hours of the internship would be flexible as I am still a business owner and needed a flexible, remote position, with the understanding I would be available for any required meetings. The required meetings start at 7:30am and end at 3:00pm, which turns my “24 hours per week” into a full-time job.   
  
• After onboarding, I learned my boss's business model is employing virtual assistants from the Philippines and never paying full-price for an employee; why would he bring me for $80-90K a year if he could hire someone overseas for a fraction of the cost?  
  
• He pays my invoices 4-6 weeks late.   
  
• The business model in its entirety is unstable. He’s still figuring out how to scale the business. He told me that he has systems for everything and is already scaling operations, which was true, but now that I’m involved in operations, it’s falling apart.   
  
I’ve addressed all of these points with him and regularly voice my concerns. Generally speaking, he does try to improve, but the company is mostly in a state of constant hustle and disorganization.   
  
I could always wait it out until my “internship” ends in July, then see if I get offered the salaried position. It wasn’t the job I expected to do, and I’m not in a season of learning that I thought I’d be in, but it would be $80-$90K going directly to savings for an easy job. I also already spent four months here, so it’s the sunken cost that’s getting me.   
  
I just need some outside perspectives and advice on what I should do. A sounding board would be great; thank you.",WisdomWhiffer,2,1.0,0,1714700482,2024-05-03 01:41:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ciwsxl/i_took_a_misleading_job_and_i_dont_know_if_i/,5,2024

- I have an admissions offer from Duke University Masters in Management, a one year program. Also looks good on a resume and could more comfortably lead into IB or consulting. However, this costs 50k and while money isn’t an issue here, I want to be efficient. The endgame here is probably going to be partner track at B4 or something.

1ciw1if,My current companies work/life balance is not great? ,"I work in IT for a very small consulting business. There’s only 5 of us, including the owner. The owner regularly logs on at 3AM and sends messages and everyone on the team actively responds to his Teams messages late at night, 9 or 10PM if he starts messaging then. I have at times also done so because it will be a group chat and if I don’t reply, I’m the only one not responding. He was also at a conference abroad last week but was online working every single day until 1-3AM his time. I don’t think that’s a healthy precedent to set for our workplace. 

This is not some Silicon Valley startup relying on venture capital, we’re just a small consulting business. So I don’t think we absolutely need to be burning the midnight oil here. 

I’m also a part timer, which was intentional. I only applied to part time jobs because I wanted a break from full time. 

I have a set schedule and my supervisor is constantly telling me I’ll be coming in the next day, on my day off, when I never agreed to that. Not asking, telling. 

If there’s a fire to put out when I’m off, he’ll message me to resolve it when we don’t have an official agreement for me to be on call. And obviously I would expect some compensation for being on call, even if an emergency doesn’t happen and I don’t think that’s in the cards or that he’s even aware that should be the case. 

Plus, his clients flip their lids when I sign off for the day because it’s usually before 5. They’ll reach out with an issue after I’ve clocked out and I don’t always see it and they get pissed that I didn’t immediately reply. 

I actually like this job overall believe it or not and I have set some boundaries with my supervisor when necessary. But I’m being hard on myself about it like I’m not being enough of a “go getter” and also worrying I’m going to seem uncommitted or lazy. But I’m 31 and I’m tired. I’ve been in industry for a while and need a break. I didn’t sign on for full time so it bothers me that that’s slowly becoming the expectation.

I am going through the background check for a new position at another bank. The background check had a portion asking ""Have you ever been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor"". In my experience, most background checks that I've been through throw some sort of date range on it (e.g. in the past 15 years). This one didn't. 

Obviously i played it safe, answered the question apportiately, and disclosed two misdemeanors I've had a long time ago.

Reckless Driving: 2009
Marijuana Possession: 2004

Obviously I've been through many a background check and haven't been denied. I dont believe these charges would be considered ""moral turpitude"".

This was scheduled a week ago. Now for reference, I am not in a technical role and have a dedicated team of product experts behind me.

The situation: It is now 6PM in my timezone and I see on my phone they send an email with their questions for tomorrows 9AM meeting and they are so technical I might need to actually do some research- which they gave me 0 time to do unless I want to work late into tonight after everyone else goes to sleep. On top of that, it's not with my weekly client- they specially scheduled time with their IT team to meet with me to talk about ""settings"". That's all she initially gave me last week for insight.

I let it slide twice but this is just too much. I don't deserve to stress about this after hours because of them but I am!

Due to this being recurring- I REALLY want to politely/ sickly sweetly but backhandedly (if that makes ANY sense) say thanks so much , we can totally cover these topics broadly but it looks like I may need time to research facets of these questions and get some insight from my technical experts on my team and heavily imply I dont have ANY TIME to do it!! This is too direct I know this client to be extremely overly sensitive to wording in emails in the past. I can just tell the attitude I might get in the morning for not just KNOWING the answers without any time to prep. Is there a way to say it that is so rooted in positivity that even if they did feel some type of way there would be nothing to say since my response is so polite or just like conveying it in a roundabout way?

Once I have the signed offer, I honestly don’t want to spend another second at my current job. I hate it with every fiber of my being and am screaming internally every day. Of course going to wait until I sign on the dotted line, but once I have that done, are there any legal repercussions for not giving notice? Current role is a contract that is not in the field I typically work in, in a state I’m leaving forever in the summer so do not care about burning bridges. It was till mid summer but they have said they definitely want to renew for a year.

The only reason I ask is because the staffing company I signed with just got acquired last week and they want me to sign a new agreement. My client contract states both parties are ‘at will’ so I was not worried before. But there is a new one-pager (not for the client, but for me and the staffing company) that includes the following two bullet points:

• Please have open communication with your <staffing company> manager with regard to issues like not being happy on your assignment, if other firms are trying to recruit you, or if you want a change. <staffing company> will work with you to try and accommodate your needs.
• We request a two-week notice if you leave <staffing company>, let your <staffing company> manager know BEFORE you tell your client.

1cirlbb,What route to follow - graduating,"I'm a lawyer who immigrated to another country to study Computer Programming. I'm almost done with my major and don't know what career path to follow. 
I have four years of experience in Law. Adding internships, I'd have approximately seven years.
In the middle of my program, I realized that I don’t really like coding and therefore applied only for web designing co-ops. I got a volunteering and a coop as a web designer. In both cases, I managed the company’s WordPress website content. I did everything from designing to copywriting, UX, information architecture and SEO. 
In the meantime, I also got a project management certificate from Google because I thought PM could also be a good route. 
Now that I'm graduating, I have about one year of experience managing WordPress websites and know a bit about Canva and Figma.
I don't know what to do with my experience since I don't seem qualified to apply for web designing roles (I don't know Figma and Adobe well) and also project management roles (I only have one certificate, even though I lead the redesign project of my company's website - very small company).
As my experience in law is from another country, it also doesn't seem relevant.
I've seen some job roles, such as web specialist, that I seem to fit.

1cir21f,Should I leave the job earlier than expected or will it ruin my reputation?,"I finished my masters recently and have 3 years of experience (not including part time or internships) I got offered an apprentice role at a company (good reputation) with the purpose of someone who is a recent graduate. The manager convinced me it was a learning experience and I’ll learn a lot. The pay is in the mid 90s in a HCOL area. In my head, I felt the role will be a walk in a park and a break for the hecticness I experienced in my masters program. It was advertised as an apprenticeship… remember. I thought I’ll be doing shadowing a lot and networking chats which was described to me…

I was wrong. I wasn’t notified until my first day that our team is going through major restructuring and we were understaffed. I have been everything but an apprentice/trainee and have been thrown in the deep end. I’ve been managing several projects with little oversight. Most of my coworkers are nice but I get called an intern when I’m far from it. I’ve done quite well and have received praise from preceptors.  I had a performance check in and received high reviews but not indication of being kept on as a full time permanent by my boss. There has been no discussions of a raise or title change either. My mentor at my job has been helping me stand out and position myself well but they can’t guarantee anything. Since I’m under a contract, the company offers me TERRIBLE benefits (I’m a W2 fyi not 1099). Im also scared to advocate for myself since the contract offers limited protections. They can easily fire me. In my field, the average salary at this point of my career is lower than what I make but at least you get benefits and a chiller workload. I feel like they are daggling a carrot in my face. I’m basically a project manager without the respect. 

I know the apprenticeship was competitive and im grateful to have gotten a great salary for my sector (social sciences), but is it even worth it? Im reaching the halfway point. Would it look bad if I left this early? Many of my contacts are happy I got this role but I’m embarrassed if I leave. What if they judge me? I’ve done some market research and people make 100k + (base) AND benefits with the responsibilities I have. I’m worried if I apply to those jobs companies might think I’m a job hopper and not take me seriously? Help.

1ciqr4k,Approaching Experience in Dental Office,"Hi,

I am 24 looking for a job in a dental office because I am in school to become a dental hygienist. I am having trouble getting into the industry because I have only worked in a grocery this whole time while I was obtaining my bachelors (a story of its own). I am at the same job right now but saved some time so I can get experience in a dental office Tues-Thurs. During those three days, I'd like to work for free or try to shadow. How do I go about asking dental offices for that chance/opportunity. I am new to asking about this kind of stuff and don't know what kind of questions I should be asking. 

This is brief and general. Please ask me questions that I need so I can elaborate or think about what I need to do personally.

1cipxnb,Need some perspective (switching careers),"Hi all, so here’s the breakdown. I’m 29, graduated in 2017 with a BA. My initial plan was to pursue music (I realize that’s going to get me a lot of hate/sarcasm already), having studied jazz at a top school near New York and gotten pretty decent (if I do say so myself). 
Lost a close family member sophomore year, coupled with some shoulder issues that made finishing tough, but I managed. 
My initial hurdle was being able to move into NYC. Safe to say, that goal has gotten farther and farther out of my reach since graduation.
I figured I’d have to get other jobs and everything while establishing myself, but with the cost of living rising and rising (especially post pandemic) it’s starting to seem like a pipe dream. 
I’ve worked retail and taught lessons the last few years, and I’m exhausted. I’m just so tired of not being able to devote enough energy to music because of economic stress. 
I realize I’ll still be able to do what I want to do (except be a sideman for my favorite artists or be a respected instrumentalist, but hey 🤷🏼‍♂️) if I find another career, but I’ve struggled to figure out what I’d like to do that could still afford a decent work/life balance while keeping the bills paid. 
This is where the issue for me is- it seems like working in almost any industry is a nightmare these days, at least from what I hear from friends and read on here. I was thinking of going into teaching (both of my parents taught and made careers out of it) but the lack of accountability and consequences for students seem to be making education a sure fire path to burnout. 
I’ve also considered library sciences for a master since it’s an environment I could seee myself working in- but there doesn’t seem to be a lot of growth in that sector. 
Friends have noted that a lot of music skills transfer over to coding/tech, but between AI and how saturated the market seems to be with people hoping to get IT jobs, I worry about my prospects there as well. 
The only thing that’s starting to seem appealing is getting a masters and teaching at the college level- though even there, I fear budget cuts and a lack of appreciation for the arts might threaten my job security as well. 
That’s about it really. I’d love to find a nice 40 hour a week job that can pay the bills and allow me to hustle on the side. If anyone’s got any advice I’d like to hear it. Thanks in advance",Overall-Balance1307,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1714681687,2024-05-02 20:28:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cipxnb/need_some_perspective_switching_careers/,5,2024

i had a interview on april 18th after passing a test 3 weeks earlier. it's a state agency, so their process is long. they said one great asset to have for them is patience as everything tends to be slow.

so, i asked when i could expect to hear from them and they said ""1 or 2 weeks"". the 2 weeks mark is today, so i thought i'd follow up tomorrow morning and hopefully have an answer before the week-end. i'm aware that if i have not been contacted yet, it doesn't sound good.

would you follow up tomorrow, or give them the weekend and follow up next monday ?

1ciospd,How to bring title more in alignment with my job duties? ,"I started a new job about 3 months ago and my responsibilities are huge — overseeing more than 100 volunteers and interns, doing all the program development, etc. However, my title is below a manager title despite my doing managerial or even senior manager level work (based on similar roles at equivalent organizations). When I applied for this job I figured the title was simply a part of how this organization classified things. However, I leaned that my predecessor had a manager title, and others at my same job title have far less responsibility. I did bring it up already to HR who said they “determined” it wasn’t a manager level role before posting the job. I simply don’t agree… is there any way I can advocate for a title raise?

I am in my early thirties and was fired for misconduct. I was provided a termination letter that essentially read: ""you're lucky if we don't sue you for tortious interference/disparagement"". I was permitted to resign. It was unfortunate, I was very good at my job and well liked by management until the end. 

I've been fired before. Once for insubordination on a political campaign where the grand strategy was destined to fail and I was vocally oppositional, and once for poor performance. For what it's worth, I had misdiagnosed/mistreated mental health issues that have since been corrected. In between these roles, I completed a graduate degree. 

I have worked at top companies and have a relatively strong resume, but these circumstances are a real blow.

1ciky32,52 year old cubicle dwelling stooge looking for next steps....,"Hi there.  (Kind) advice is appreciated.  

I am 52...I got my first job at 14 and have been continually employed since then, going into the Army at 18, getting off active duty at 22 and starting college where I worked 3/4 time while completing a degree in education.  I taught 5 years in public schools before moving into the cubicle farm where I've bounced around in different roles and currently manage a data/analytics team for a large health insurance carrier. I stayed in the Army Reserve for 26 years and can expect a small pension as well as Tricare when I turn 60, so I have set age 60 as my retirement year.  So...more or less 7.5 years to go.  My 401k is on track to allow me to retire at 60 and live modestly, but not extravagantly.  I likely will ex-pat myself to a lower cost of living country once all living parents are gone, but that's in the future. 

I know that the next 7.5 years will fly by...but I am just not sure if my sanity will make it.  

What are some career options I could consider exploring for the next 7.5 years to make me a decent salary, pay my health insurance and (hopefully) continue to contribute at least some $ toward my savings?  Unfortunately, I am not handy nor mechanical, so I don't see myself in the trades.  While I'm generally healthy, at age 52, my body is starting to show some wear and tear as well. 

Here's some ideas I've kicked around:

#1 - starting a home cleaning business with me as the only employee.  I am not sure physically I could do that for the next 7.5 years, but I did clean more than my share of toilets in the Army and am pretty good at it.  The guy I pay to clean my house really seems to enjoy the work and is keeping afloat from everything I can see. 

#2 - open a food cart...we have a big food cart culture where I live, but the market is pretty saturated and while I'm a decent cook, I really have no food service experience, so I'd have to do a lot of learning on the fly...plus, I don't really like people all that much so I'm not sure how I'd do in a public-facing role. :)  

#3 - Using my veteran's preference to try and get a government job...but not sure what I'd want to do...probably too much like my current work.

Anyway, I'm a little lost and would appreciate any career advice from someone who has broken the shackles of corporate life to find something more fulfilling.  I have enough liquidity that I could likely start a small business with no need to finance anything. 

My biggest goal is to make sure that I retire at 60.  My family isn't traditionally very long-lived and I'd like to enjoy at least some retirement before taking the ultimate dirt nap.  

Thanks. ",Pdx_Obviously,3,1.0,7,1714669555,2024-05-02 17:05:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ciky32/52_year_old_cubicle_dwelling_stooge_looking_for/,5,2024
1cikcgt,"Really need some advice. There have been very blunt rumors that my department will not exist in the next year. I have a WFH job offer with better pay and benefits, but the schedule sucks ass for my lifestyle. I need to respond to this offer. What would you do? ","Some context: I work in the healthcare industry. The healthcare industry does not give a fuck about its employees. There will be no such thing as severance pay for me if my department is given the axe. I actually really like my current job and I have the best boss in the world with pretty great coworkers. My schedule is really nice as I get to work 3 days/week, 12.5 hour shifts and I have a ton of flexibility. For example, I can take up to 8 days off without using any PTO and I am able to schedule myself off with my husband frequently. We have no turnover in my department because it’s a coveted, “cushy” job and people are happy. 

I genuinely think if my boss knew anything, she would tell us, but I think she will find out with us if something happens to our department. I have addressed the issue with her directly and she flat out told me she knows of no plans for our department to be eliminated, and that we have the numbers and metrics to back ourselves up. But over the last couple of months, we have had multiple people call in to our department for their usual business and say things like “oh you guys are still up and running?” or “when are you guys closing down?” or “I heard we weren’t going to be able to call in to your department for much longer.” This all started because last year we were bought out and the corporation who bought us out has been making *a lot* of negative changes. Every month we are having a benefit taken away from us to align with our new corporation’s policies. My department and many others at my hospital either don’t exist or exist in one singular location for all of the hospitals within the system under this new corporation. 

When these rumors really started flying a couple months ago, I started applying for jobs that are in the same vein of what I already do. My job is not very common in healthcare, and because it’s relatively easy, people don’t tend to leave their positions, which makes job hunting competitive. I applied to 15 different jobs from all of the listing I could find, and only one has got back to me. They offered me the job this morning, but the schedule is not flexible at all. It is completely set and I would be working 2/3 days my husband has off in the evenings. If it were dayshift it wouldn’t be an issue because my husband is a night owl and doesn’t usually get out of bed until 12 pm - 2 pm on his days off anyway. The pay is better, the benefits are better, and it’s WFH which is a huge bonus, but my husband and I will only have one day off together for the foreseeable future. I was told in my interview that the only reason there’s an opening right now is because someone retired, and most people don’t get to move their schedules for years. They have another schedule option that would be perfect for me, but it isn’t available. 

Not really sure what to do and I would appreciate some outside perspective.

1cikacu,Stay or Go? Vent/ career advice,"5th year teaching, 1st year in a new school and state. The district I’m in won’t allow me to transfer to another school for 2 more years. I was lied to about what this school would be like, and I absolutely hate it here. 

I’m worried I won’t be able to make as much outside of education, even with my 5 years as a teacher and 4 years working as staff at a university. I have an English Literature degree. (For reference, I’m currently making $60k a year and my pay is about to go up to $66k). I feel like I’m qualified for some stuff but haven’t had luck in my applications so far (been applying to go back to university staff jobs for about a month). 

I’d be alright with a pay cut, it’s just I need to start saving for a wedding and my fiancé and I already kind of planned our budget for the year. 

Any advice on this? Im also worried about when to let my school know (im telling them I’ll come back next year bc I don’t have anything else secured, but it just feels a bit scummy to do that). Im also just absolutely heartbroken that this horrible year has made me so jaded and angry towards the entire teaching profession. I don’t think I have faith I’d be happier if I transferred to another district, and also don’t want a long commute.

1cik8ik,Summer to learn something new... what to learn.,"I'm a network / desktop IT guy. I can motor around in R and Python, I'm pretty good with command line stuff, etc. I also write well (manuals, user guides, etc.).

I am being furloughed from work for the summer. So I have three months of nothing to do but still being paid.

What would you learn in three months that would help you start a second career? Or something I can do part-time (on-site or remote)? Three months seems like a good runway to learn something useable.

I have a strong background in statistics, but not entirely hot on the idea of data analysis (too many people chasing too few jobs, it seems).

I just trying to brainstorm all the ideas of what I might do. Maybe something different.

1cij9ww,Accepted a misleading “internship” for career potential. Do I leave or wait it out?,"New account because I got myself in a predicament. Some backstory is required.

I’m 22 years old with an entrepreneurial mindset. The best way to learn is through experience, so I opened a brick-and-mortar business at 18. I also pursued a Bachelor of Science in Advertising as a backup plan, graduating in three years (August ‘23). Alongside college and running my business, I completed three 6-month digital marketing internships for extra hands-on industry experience.

I own a dance studio. Our annual revenue is $135K, with $60K covering operating expenses and $75K for our administration and a full teaching team. Although I could pay myself $75K a year and teach everything, my dream is not to be a dance teacher. Instead, I have a full team running our services, which allows me the time and headspace to work “on” the business—not “in” it.

Now that we have a full team, established systems, and consistent lead generation, the studio doesn't require much of my attention, and it’s growing quickly! I need the studio to grow at this level before scaling. In the meantime, I need two things:

1. To be surrounded by people who are more successful than me so I can keep learning. 
2. Have some money going to savings since the business is break-even. 

I started looking for a job where I’d be heavily involved in operations. I was hired by a startup marketing agency four months ago. The agreement was to train me part-time as their Operations Support Intern for six months, followed by full-time employment as the company’s Growth Operations Manager upon finishing my training. During the training period, I’d be compensated $1K a month. Afterward, I’d transition to a salary range from $80K to $90K per year. 

This setup was perfect for me because it was a startup where I could be closely involved in the company’s success, grow with them, learn a ton, and earn a decent income—all while they understood that I'm still a business owner and need a flexible schedule.

However, I’m having some issues: 

1. I was told I’d be supporting the agency’s operational processes and project execution internally to grow the business, eventually running the department myself as the Growth Operations Manager as the agency grew. Instead, I am the Project Manager for all of our clients.
2. I was not briefed on who the clients are or our relationship with them. After a couple of months, I learned that we just sold these clients a $2K service (our unique “Growth Operations System”) for me to run Agile project management for them. I had two weeks of observing my boss run these meetings with them (Sprint Reviews, Planning, etc.) before I took over the Scrum cycle with no other training.
3. I did not know I was the “Scrum Master” (and all other roles within the agile framework) until a consultant on the team referred to me as that in passing; this was well after I was running with the accounts.
4. No training has been provided other than the first two weeks of watching my boss lead Scrum meetings. I’m told to figure it out on my own. 
5. Performance reviews were supposed to be conducted at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32-week intervals; none of them have happened yet.
6. We agreed the hours of the internship would be flexible as I am still a business owner and needed a flexible, remote position, with the understanding I would be available for any required meetings. The required meetings start at 7:30am and end at 3:00pm, which turns my “24 hours per week” into a full-time job. 
7. After onboarding, I learned my boss's business model is employing virtual assistants from the Philippines and never paying full-price for an employee; why would he bring me for $80-90K a year if he could hire someone overseas for a fraction of the cost?
8. He pays my invoices 4-6 weeks late. 
9. The business model in its entirety is unstable. He’s still figuring out how to scale the business. He told me that he has systems for everything and is already scaling operations, which was true, but now that I’m involved in operations, it’s falling apart. 

I’ve addressed all of these points with him and regularly voice my concerns. Generally speaking, he does try to improve, but the company is mostly in a state of constant hustle and disorganization. 

I could always wait it out until my “internship” ends in July, then see if I get offered the salaried position. It wasn’t the job I expected to do, and I’m not in a season of learning that I thought I’d be in, but it would be $80-$90K going directly to savings for an easy job. I also already spent four months here, so it’s the sunken cost that’s getting me. 

I just need some outside perspectives and advice on what I should do. A sounding board would be great; thank you.",WisdomWhiffer,1,1.0,0,1714665521,2024-05-02 15:58:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cij9ww/accepted_a_misleading_internship_for_career/,5,2024
1cij7c1,Is it bad to give less than 2 weeks notice to a toxic job because I haven’t signed a new contract yet?,"I work in the corporate world, remote work etc. Not a small industry, and I’m not even planning to stay in the industry. I’m a mid-level employee. Been at this company for 7 months. It’s a complete dumpster fire—restructuring and things. My boss threw me under the bus multiple times so I got the blame for many things that weren’t my fault. Luckily, he left about a month ago. But I’m dealing with the fallout from all the damage he did to my reputation here and making it a wildly toxic work environment. 

I finally secured a new job. Here’s the problem. I always always always want to not leave companies in the lurch if I can help it. However, there’s no way in hell I’m giving my notice before signing a contract with the new company. 

So, timeline. It is currently 5/2. My start date at the new company was originally 5/20. But I pushed them back a week to 5/28 so I could get a week of vacation between the two jobs because I haven’t had a vacation in forever. My last day at my current job is going to be 5/17. However, the new company just informed me that they probably can’t get the contract to me until next week (5/6 - 5/10). 

If that is the case, I obviously can’t give a full 2-week notice and I feel weird about it. Especially since I think a lot of the issues stemmed from a boss that is no longer with the company. 

What do I do? I’m not pushing my start date back, nor am I willing to give up my one vacation week. Is it okay to give 1.5 weeks notice? Or is that really really bad?",caywriter,1,1.0,2,1714665343,2024-05-02 15:55:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cij7c1/is_it_bad_to_give_less_than_2_weeks_notice_to_a/,5,2024

1cifzhs,Boss wants me to share tool I created with peers ,"I took it upon myself to create a tool at work that helps me aggregate data and allows me to quickly answer very detailed questions. I made the mistake of sending this tool to my boss and she loved it so much she asked me to make it user friendly so I can train my peers to apply to their businesses. I feel that if I share this tool I’ll no longer have an edge. I also have over 10 years more experience than my peers and feel like I’d be handing it to them on a silver platter. 

On top of that, I have been passed up for a promotion twice to people less technically qualified.  Previous times I’ve created tools and implemented processes to other areas (saving other teams hours per month) the executives didn’t acknowledge my contribution and there was no payoff. Salary increases over the years have been denied as well. 

I told my boss that everyone has their own way of pulling this data and my tool is a bit complex to teach others but she knows I have the skills to simplify it to make user friendly. It is messy right now and I would have to spend some time cleaning it up. I don’t think she would be able to do that herself. This is not something that is required of my role, I have outside skills that I applied to create it. 

The tool was created on company time but I feel that the time and expertise I have put into it is being taken for granted and will only hurt me if others have such easy access to the data. 

How can I fix my mistake of sharing this with my boss?

* insufficient workload (I can spend weeks with like barely 5 hours of work per week)
* no learning opportunity (since no collab then no learning and I do not get assigned other tasks outside of my skill set as advertised in the job opening, and 0 external training opportunity)
* noticing that the work that I am delivering should be positioned and compensated at a higher level.

1cift5t,What to do if HR rejects my resignation on the last day?,"42 days ago I submitted my resignation on an in-house software. I had a call with my manager and HR on the same day.

I'm obligated by policy to submit a 60 days notice. However, upon meeting certain conditions it can be reduced. I met those conditions and talked to my manager and he said it was all good.

I have had multiple exit interviews. And multiple conversations about me leaving on the day I want (May 7). I've explicitly told them about my intention to have a reduced notice period. My manager was okay with it. HR said they're okay with it if my manager is.

Today I asked HR about my off boarding responsibilities and they said my last day wasn't approved yet. My stupid ass never bothered to check if my application was marked ""approved"".

I told my manager. My manager asked me if I could extend my resignation period. I said no and they approved the resignation.

There's also a section about the HR's approval. I'm afraid she'll do something petty. Most of my conversations have been on calls so I can't produce any evidence.

1cifn0t,If someone says they're never going to work extra for free do you think that's lazy at all or completely understandable?,"Basically, I feel like where I work it's impossible for people to complete all of their work unless they do work a little extra for free sometimes.

I have a coworker who completely refuses to work any extra time for free. Like, if there's a very high priority issue that takes an extra hour to resolve, she'll leave as soon as all her time is even. Unless she gets overtime for every minute of the extra time she's working.

I was curious if this is how people should be at work?

1cieopz,Accepted a misleading “internship” for career potential. Do I leave or wait it out?,"New account because I got myself in a predicament. Some backstory is required.

I’m 22 years old with an entrepreneurial mindset. The best way to learn is through experience, so I opened a brick-and-mortar business at 18. I also pursued a Bachelor of Science in Advertising as a backup plan, graduating in three years (August ‘23). Alongside college and running my business, I completed three 6-month digital marketing internships for extra hands-on industry experience.

I own a dance studio. Our annual revenue is $135K, with $60K covering operating expenses and $75K for our administration and a full teaching team. Although I could pay myself $75K a year and teach everything, my dream is not to be a dance teacher. Instead, I have a full team running our services, which allows me the time and headspace to work “on” the business—not “in” it.

After three years of iterating and finding the perfect product-market fit, we’re growing rapidly. We’re expecting a minimum of $200K in secured revenue this upcoming dance season with room for another $100k. We currently have just one studio room, and our next move is to build a second room at our current location; this means our operating expenses will remain the same, but our revenue potential will double.

Now that we have a full team, established systems, and consistent lead generation, the studio doesn't require much of my attention. I need the studio to grow at this level before scaling to either franchising, launching a dance/similar biz model media company, acquisition opportunities, etc. The studio has taught me a lot, but to be blunt, I’m not surrounded by people who are more successful than me or challenge my beliefs. I want to keep learning and compounding knowledge as quickly as possible. Because the studio doesn’t need much of my time, I started looking for job opportunities with startups that need hands-on team members to provide me with that environment. 

I was hired by a marketing agency four months ago. The agreement was to train me as their Operations Support Intern for six months, followed by full-time employment as the company’s Growth Operations Manager upon finishing my training. During the training period, I’d be compensated $1K a month for 24 hours per week. Afterward, I’d transition to a salary range from $80K to $90K per year. 

These are some of the issues I’m having: 

1. I was told I’d be supporting the agency’s operational processes and project execution internally to grow the business, eventually running the department myself as the Growth Operations Manager as the agency grew. Instead, I am the Project Manager for all of our clients.
2. I was not briefed on who the clients are or our relationship with them, at all. After a couple of months, I learned that these clients were just sold a $2K service (our unique “Growth Operations System”) for me to run Agile project management for them. I had one, maybe two, weeks of observing my boss run these meetings with them (Sprint Reviews, Planning, etc.) before I took over the Scrum cycle with no training.
3. I did not know I was the “Scrum Master” (and all other roles within the agile framework) until a consultant on the team referred to me as that in passing; this was well after I was running with the accounts.
4. No training has been provided other than the first week or two of watching my boss lead Scrum meetings. I’m supposed to pick up on everything by my boss giving me projects and telling me to figure it out.
5. Performance reviews were supposed to be conducted at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32-week intervals; none of them have happened yet.
6. We agreed the hours of the internship would be flexible as I am still a business owner and needed a flexible, remote position, with the understanding I would be available for any required meetings. I have at least 12 hours of meetings per week, starting at 7:30 AM and ending at 1:30 PM, Monday through Friday; sometimes until 3:00 PM. I’m supposed to work only 24 hours per week, but it ends up being 30 on average.
7. I was fine making $10+/- an hour for the training and opportunity, but I learned my boss's business model is employing virtual assistants from the Philippines and rarely paying full-price for an employee. He has made comments about not wanting to lose me and needing to get me on full-time in July. We continue to discuss it, but I’m skeptical. 
8. My boss’s business model was entirely uprooted this week, and he’s having to change how we’re working with clients and going to scale the business. Lots of instability.
9. Because my workload is so busy, my boss had me to hire my own Executive Assistant (what “intern” needs an EA). Anyway, he was pushing me to hire the EA fast. I went through the interview/onboarding process with someone I was mediocre about due to this urgency. I wanted to provide her training and resources to start, but his advice was to throw her in, tell her what you need from her, and see what she picks up. Needless to say, that didn’t work; I knew she wasn’t a good fit, so I had to let her go. I expressed my concerns to my boss and said if this is our hiring/onboarding approach, we need to at least tell them there’s a 90-day probationary period. No response.
10. He very much believes everyone is replaceable and will drop anyone whenever they’re not delivering the way he wants. No training, no performance reviews.

My boss just left on a 13-day vacation, leaving me to run everything alongside his EA until he returns. It would put him in a bad spot if I resign anytime before May 13th. 

I also don’t know if two weeks' notice is appropriate in this situation or if I should just gracefully bow out. I feel discouraged leaving a job so early having anticipated growing with the company for at least 2-3 years. I could always wait it out until my “internship” ends in July, then see if I get offered the salaried position. Regardless, it wasn’t the job I expected to do.

I just need some outside perspectives and advice on what I should do. A sounding board would be great; thank you.",WisdomWhiffer,1,1.0,0,1714653704,2024-05-02 12:41:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cieopz/accepted_a_misleading_internship_for_career/,5,2024

1cidjra,Job advertised again,"So a few months back I had a job interview and I got a call if I could wait for a few months as some changes were going on and the role was no longer available at that time. They said that I made it to the last stage after reviewing all the candidates and they would contact me as soon as the position became available. They asked if I could wait so I said yes.  There weren't any agreements made just a chat on the phone call.

A few days ago I saw the job posted again on the job board and I haven't had any contact from them.  It seems like a no-go, but they could be delaying the contact as they are in a sector where they must advertise job openings and if they contact me before all procedures they could be at risk of being exposed.

So the second thought is what I am hoping for as I would like that job haha...

I've re-applied for the job already but I am not going to make any direct contact to figure out what going on, I know this is going to make me look very desperate and stalky. Reapplying already made me look desperate I guess...

This current job is somewhere south of England, where cost of living is cheaper than London. 

However, me and my girlfriend are deciding whether buying a house just Zone 5 outskirts of London makes sense(we have enough deposit). As she lives in London and works in Central London too. We’ve been long distance for 3 years now.

I am needing advise whether it makes sense for me to move to London as an Accountant- probably get £60k,more money, less responsibility I guess. However this might have an impact on my career (I.e. more difficult to get promotions etc.)

If I stay in South of England, I will be a manager and I can develop my managerial skills and lleverage my CV. And negotiate for a higher salary end of 2025.

What does everyone think is a smart move for me at this crucial time?

1cibbch,Contract not renewed and bonus not paid after 12 months of hell. How far should I fight this?,"My contract was not renewed because my new boss and I do not get along at all and he’s struggling to operate a large department as he’s only ever run one 20% of the size previously. It’s not even about my performance, it’s based on his dislike for someone arguing stupid decisions that are detrimental to workflow. 

Last year I had a huge staffing issues which caused extremely excessive working hours (18 hour days) and a lot of stress and sickness to keep my part of the dept going. My senior team took 18 months to build due to skills/staff shortages (like a lot of industries). I pushed really hard and kept it from sinking, but not without some inevitable problems. 
New boss focused on this heavily and used it to justify cancelling my contract. We also clashed as at the busiest time of year he increased his ridiculous micromanagement demands late on a Friday to be on his desk on a Monday morning and didn’t like my response when told my workload of 4 people and the finance team not working weekends is not conducive to efficient results. 
I still hit my targets, increased revenue, reduced expenses. Not as much as others, but enough to be profitable. 

For context, I work abroad. The guy has flexed his power while smiling at me and completely turned my life into a sheet show that is costing me a lot of money and I’m being forced to relocate due to non compete clause in my contract. 

On top of this, he is absolving himself of any responsibility of me not receiving my bonus and telling me the COO (about 3 levels up from boss) has made the call as “I’m leaving” and I would need to pursue this with him. 

I am losing a significant amount of money and the COO is notorious for voting against bonuses being paid to employees. It’s the owner who votes for it. 

Am I wasting my time and energy on trying to get what I worked so hard for or should I let it go? I’ve got two weeks left. 
The feeling of being used and humiliated is something I’ve never felt before and I don’t know how to move forward without losing my cool at someone and potentially causing myself issues.

1ci8ayz,My boss said I'm better working alone than on their team,"I started at a new job as a Marketing Executive at the beginning of February this year, after my first week the person I reported to put in her two weeks notice. She didn't talk badly about the company or anything but everyone could obviously tell that there was tensions between her and the person above her who I was told that I now was reporting to, he seemed like a nice guy but a bit immature, it seemed like everyone at the company loved him. A few weeks after that things seemed to be going smoothly and I was given some job duties that I enjoyed they fired the person that I reported to, the CEO came into the building introduced himself and then introduced me to another person that they just hired and said that she would be managing the department until they figured out a replacement for the person they had just fired. 

Even though she was older than me she didn't have much experience and told me honestly that she really had no idea what she was doing, we talked about the roles we both previously had and I said that I fully support her and will help in anyway that I can. She seemed to always talk down about herself and said she's failing and isn't very good and I felt like I would always talk her up and tell her that she doing great, and she told me how appreciative she was, and that she'd have my back and we would stick together and get through all of this. She told me that she aspired to take the job that they were trying to find a replacement for, and she didn't want them to hire someone else. 

Honestly she seemed really bad at her job and pretty bad at leading or having any kind of business strategy but she was a very sweet and kind person, but it really seemed like she was over her head and because of that she couldn't really do her job and I didn't have any support from her as a manager. I would ask for work and she didn't have anything so I sort of did what I could to help as needed and otherwise did some research and tired to look into older files and see what the team was doing before with some things to get a frame of reference of what the people who had left were working on before. 

One day she told me that she had thousands of emails and she is so stressed to the point of tears and asked me if I could help her, I told her absolutely and she asked if I could sit and read the emails to her and that would make it easier, so I sort of play as an executive assistant and honestly it was pretty eye opening to how bad she was at this job.. she wanted to read every single spam and junk mail that came in and respond, and she would take forever to think of responses and then have me type and retype simple answers. It was weeks of emails and some were really important that she completely missed, and often she didn't understand what the emails were saying and we had to like ""figure it out"" together. 

I supported her throughout this, she kept saying she was an idiot and never had her shit together and I said that she is handling things with grace and hopefully things will get easier soon for her and that everything will be okay we just have to hope for the best. Then randomly I got an alert from a recruiter that shared the job with me that my boss was hoping to get. It popped up on my phone, I thought about it and told her about it, and honestly she was really upset because she wanted that position. So now they were going to hire someone above her to be her manager.

I felt like she was deeply embarrassed and upset that I was the one who told her, maybe I shouldn't have said anything, but she was shocked, I think we both were and I just thought that it would be better I talked to her instead of her finding out online. I said it very gently and I said it's okay I have your back and we will get through it together. I tried to be there for her like I thought that she was for me, but after that things changed. She said that it'll be okay and she will just have to have faith in upper management. She told me that she felt betrayed because they told her that they were going to give her 6 months to try to prove herself (it had only been 2) and that they would keep her in the loop with everything but obviously they didn't.   
  
I don't know if she just withdrew and stopped caring or if she was upset with me or something but she started being more withdrawn, it seemed like she was depressed maybe? but then she taking away some job tasks, told me not to bother doing certain things and well it seemed like the writing was on the wall for me and I felt worried, I confided that I didn't understand why my job tasks were being taken away and if I did anything wrong, she reassured me and said everything was great.  After a few weeks all of my job tasks were divided up and I had nothing else to do. I told her that I was struggling with understanding my role and confused by tasks being taken away and asked if I did anything wrong or if I could improve or what was happening. 

She said absolutely not- I am doing a great job and she is here to support me and help define me my role, she said she's been really busy but this week we will sit down together and that should help get some clarity. I thanked her and told her that I am just going to trust in her and hope for the best and I am appreciate of any work or tasks she has to give me but otherwise I will try to fill in any gaps and stay busy. Some other people in the department beside me had told me that it was her birthday coming up and we should pool together to buy her cake. I ordered one with her name on it, and was going to pick it up tomorrow.

Today the day before her birthday the HR director came in, she pulled me aside with my manager and they fired me. She said that they were letting me go because she didn't see me as a team player and that I wasn't supportive. I said it was really a shock to me and I asked what made her think that or if she had any examples or feedback. She said no, she didn't have anything but it would be best if I just worked alone going forward in a silo and not within a team and the decision is final. 

I am dumbfounded and heartbroken, they made me pack up all of my things and leave. The guy who helped me pack gave me a hug goodbye. 

I forgot about the cake and awkwardly emailed her saying thank you for the opportunity and to have someone go and pick it up for her tomorrow, I already ordered and paid for it so just enjoy and don't let this dampen it or anything. 

I have never been let go before, I am questioning everything and anything I did wrong, some outside perspective would be helpful and to where to go from here.

1ci808f,To leave or not to leave ,"40m making $200k, stable company, high stress. No layoffs. Been working there 16 years. Wife, two kids (10, 5). 1.5 hour commute round trip, five days a week. 

Promoted into another division 6 years ago. Different management. Different culture. Higher expectations, still staffed lean to the bone.

After an incident at work I was given what I consider pretty scathing feedback from my manager’s manager. Not bullying, and not all of it was unfair. 

However it was largely based on  the perspective of my supervisor who is trusted by the president, but widely untrusted by the rest of the organization. My supervisor is prone to knee-jerk reactions and not developing full context for his opinions of others. 

Fast forward two weeks and supervisor calls me in and delivers a PIP. Vague and/or misinformed feedback, but it was delivered in a sugary sweet, constructive manner. It even had the implied statement that it was given with some misgivings because org hadn’t provided me enough resources to achieve expectations. Organization then turns around and posts for a manager that would cover one of the two distinctively different functions that rolls up to me, presumably taking pressure off…but for how long as we grow?

So obviously I started job hunting. Had to protect myself in case the PIP went as most of them do. 

Got a job offer for $150k. Well funded startup who really needs my expertise to build their programs. 16 minute round trip commute. Less taking mental baggage home from work most likely. 

However, since the PIP was delivered, my supervisor has been night and day different. Constructive. Asks my opinion. Generally just nicer.

I don’t know what to do I’ve tried everything from recruitment sites, personal referrals (still didn’t even work granted it was NASA and Boeing) changing my resume, different cover letters, hell I’m open to straight up lying at this point, you name it I’ve tried everything I can find to try to get a one up in this process and I’m running out of ideas.

1ci7bgt,How to get out of sharing/training peers to use a tool I developed ,"I took it upon myself to create a tool at work that helps me aggregate data and allows me to quickly answer very detailed questions. I made the mistake of sending this tool with my boss and she asked me to make it user friendly so I can train my peers to use for their businesses. I feel that if I share this tool I’ll no longer have an edge on my business. I also have over 10 years more experience than my peers and feel like I’d be handing it to them on a silver platter. 

On top of that, I have been passed up for a promotion twice.  Previous times I’ve created tools and implemented processes to other areas (saving other teams hours per month) the executives didn’t acknowledge my contribution and there was no payoff. Salary increases over the years have been denied as well. 

I told my boss that everyone has their own way of pulling this data and my tool is a bit complex to teach others but she knows I can simplify it to make user friendly. It is messy right now and I would have to spend some time cleaning it up. I don’t think she would be able to do that herself. 

The tool was created on company time but I feel that the time and expertise I have put into it is being taken for granted and will only hurt me if others have such easy access to the data. 

How can I fix my mistake of sharing this with my boss?

1ci6vmd,help! I guess !,"
hi 

to start, I don’t know if this is the right Reddit thread I should be discussing this on so bare with me.. 

I am graduating high school this year and planning on taking 2 gap years. One to re do some of my classes to get higher grades, and one to work more. I am planning on applying to universities in my local area which are pretty good schools. 

What my question is, is if being a lawyer is possible for me. Firstly, I am a woman. I have heard a lot of negative stories about women working in law firms. Secondly, I come from a low income family meaning I will have to get student loans to pay for everything myself. 

But, my mom works in one of the best law firms in my country ( not as a lawyer ) but she has very great connections with lawyers. I also am very hardworking and believe I could do it. I just had a couple rough years in high school that set me back. 

With that being said, I just want to hear your opinions nons on being a lawyer and maybe some advice. This thread might be stupid so forgive me lol.

1ci6rir,"What should I expect from my first ""real job"" "," I'm graduating from Texas State University with a bachelor's in Marketing with a sales concentration. My school has the number one sales degree program in the world. I was in DECA in highschool I also am graduating 2.5 years early. I literally just turned 20. I'm in honors society and I also have 6 years worth of work experience in banking, retail, restaurant, and delivery. I've worked at least 2 jobs at a time ever since I was 14. Basically I'm coming on here to ask what should I expect coming out of college when I enter the job market and get my first 9-5? I would like to first ask what should I be expecting for compensation. I'm definitely looking for a sales position. I have an internship lined up with Grainger industrial for this Summer and I've been told that as long as I don't crap the bed I'll be offered a full time offer after I graduate. I honestly just have no idea what I'm supposed to expect for salary, commission and bonuses and things of that nature. I know that ever since I was 14 I've been chronically underpaid and overworked due to the jobs that I've worked but I know that I won't complain about any work I do because I've honestly worked some very hard jobs for very little pay. 

I apologize if this is coming off as a rant I'm just kinda lost and my parents aren't helpful and there's not exactly pay transparency anymore. I know I'll do well at my job I excel within my sales program and I'm a very accomplished person within my group but will any of that even matter one I'm working? I'm kinda worried about being the new kid and dealing with everything that comes with that. I'm honestly just worried about being taken advantage of and not being compensated the way that I should be.

I have a quick question for y’all. 

About a month before I left my old job (getting let go due to reduction in force), the company rebranded and changed their name (about a year ago; I’ve been off for a year). 

I forgot to change it to the new name on my resume as it was known by the old name for over 30+ years and for almost the entire time I was there. 

I had an interview the other day, and now I’m realizing that I forgot to change the company name to the new name on my resume and cover letter. 

Me and the hiring manager referred to the old name in my interview. Now I’m going to the second round. 

How do I fix this? Is this a huge issue? They’ll have to verify references at some point, so they’ll have to call the company by the new name. 

The old name can be Googled, and it’ll bring up the new name easily. 

I don’t want to lose out on this job because I didn’t mention the new name.

1ci4xc2,75k at 20 years old. Should I turn it down?,"*I will do my very best to explain my situation without giving enough information for my potential employer and friends to be able to identify me by. For this reason I am using a new account:)*

Hello, as the title states I was offered a position making 95k USD. I am a 22 year old in the United States and am very very fortunate to have earned this position. Now please, allow me to explain my situation. 

For the past few election cycles I have worked in political campaigns. The money is very good and I have learned extremely valuable life lessons. However, since the last elections, my passion for the candidate and party I have supported have faded. I often found myself struggling to support these candidates and ideas as they shifted from my values. My only jobs I have had are working these campaigns. Everytime I make around 10-15 thousand dollars and it is enough to cover school and expenses when scholarships are included. Due to my inner struggles of campaigning for these people and parties, I stepped away and worked in the food industry just making enough to get by after paying for school. 

My family is amazing and extremely supportive of me, but very politically charged. Unfortunately, we are not very well off so earning money and paying for things like college or any other pursuits are self funded. So, when opportunity came for a job I sat down for an interview because my friend who still campaigned just asked me to hear her out. That interview lead to another discussion wherein I was offered a job making 75k. That may seem like over kill however I was extremely skilled at my job and worked like a dog for her before. 

The reason I brought up my family is because we have never made that much money before in our lives. My father made that, but that was after years of having to work for it. To just be thrown into that kind of money is a huge temptation.  I just don’t know if I can truly support the people who want me to work for them. 

My issue is my entire work history and skill set is state political campaigning. There is no way I can make that kind of money anywhere else with my experience. I have great skills and leadership experience, I just am having a hard time knowing I can start over and go back to the bottom of the ladder in a different industry when I graduate soon, or I can start a lucrative career with a lot of experience now. 

Please don’t make this politcal, I need help. I’m lost and other people I can counsel with are politically and financially blinded.

I am just scared. I don’t want to become trapped campaigning for the rest of my life because I am too political for other work environments. I really need this money and I know I have unique skills for somebody my age but I don’t know how to transition those to another career. I also could desperately use the money.

Maybe it’s not that hard, but I just need work.",ConfusedPolitician18,0,0.4699999988079071,7,1714618178,2024-05-02 02:49:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ci4xc2/75k_at_20_years_old_should_i_turn_it_down/,5,2024
1ci4vmn,some help choosing an engineering major?,"I hope you´re doing well,

I'm a freshman software engineering student at University of Santiago, Chile. I was pretty excited the time I got enrolled, now I feel disappointed with myself because I'm not sure of what I want to pursue as an Engineer. I'm not liking the college and also I don't think I could fulfill my goals if I stay in SE.

I've always been more interested in the Electronics discipline; I get hooked watching content about Biomedical electronics (especially prosthesis), Mechatronics and Telecommunications. Those contents really motivate me to be an engineer, making me daydream that someday I can be part of projects like that. It's not that I don't like SE, but I think that I'm far more interested in the intersection between the software and the electrical sides (I'd like to work applying both of them, someday, even if we don't have a Comp Eng major in the country).

So while I'm trying to do my best at my current study plan, I want to do all my research in order to do the career switch that could let me achieve my goals. My city has only 2 college programs that are related to electronics: Electrical engineering and Telematics engineering, so I'm particularly interested in both of them and I'm currently considering applying to the Federico Santa María Technical university (UTFSM), the college that offers those programs.

However, I'm aware that there are differences between the two fields. I'm hoping to gain more understanding of the distinctions and identify which one aligns better with my interests.

You may like to check out how both programs are structured in that institution, as I can't post links I invite you to check the college websites on those two careers (it's english translated)

I would be totally grateful if someone with experience on engineering shares his thoughts on this matter. Your insights would mean a lot to me, helping me make an informed decision on future.

1ci4h0x,I think I pissed off a coworker who had previously been friendly to me. Should I address it with him directly or get my manager's input first?,"I work in a job where we do *a lot* of customer-facing writing. Part of the job is that every piece of writing goes through several rounds of review conducted by other writers in the department. I was given a project that my coworker has been working on and asked to do one of these rounds of review on the documents he had written. According to our own internal standards and according to basic principles and best practices for writing in our industry, our writing should be simple, straightforward, concise, and should use plain language (basically, we write at an 8th grade level *on purpose* for clarity and translation purposes).

However, when I started reading my coworker's project, I noticed that what he was writing was not straightforward, concise, or plain language. We had used lots of $10 words and very complicated sentence structures that, while technically accurate, made his documents very hard to follow and not at all scannable (another key tenant of writing in our industry). So I checked with my manager about how to handle the review. My manager told me that editing the documents or clarity, concision, and simplicity was absolutely within the scope of the review she was asking me to do. So I went through all of these documents and spent hours reviewing thousands of words of writing and gave suggestions in track changes for simplifying and clarifying.

The process is that the writer makes the reviewer's suggested edits, sends it back for a second review, and then usually it gets approved and moved on to the next phase. However, when I got these documents back, he had rejected most of my suggestions and had left several condescending comments in which he gave me long-winded explanations of very basic grammatical concepts. Myself holding a graduate degree in English and being a former college professor, I'm quite familiar with these things and don't need to be ""taught,"" and I've never had anyone else respond this way to my suggested edits before.

Since this interaction, he took several days off work. Since returning, he has been very cold to me at work when he had previously been very friendly, and he has been making lots of passive aggressive comments directed at me in verbal conversation and in our Teams chat.

I'm fairly sure he's upset about my feedback. The hitch is that he's the self-appointed grammar guru for our department, so I'm wondering if he thinks my feedback was meant to say he was *wrong*. Nothing about his writing was wrong or inaccurate. My feedback was exclusively focused on simplifying sentence structure and word choice, as my manager advised me to do. I even left a global comment telling him that everything I was suggesting was for clarity and simplicity.

Is this a situation where I should address his recent behavior with him directly? Should I discuss it with my manager first? This guy was been there a lot longer than I have, so my manager may have more insight into his normal patterns of behavior. For example, maybe he always reacts this way when getting feedback? Maybe he already complained to my manager about it? Should I just ignore him entirely and do my best to minimize interacting with his work in the future?",Generated_Name919,4,0.7099999785423279,4,1714616778,2024-05-02 02:26:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ci4h0x/i_think_i_pissed_off_a_coworker_who_had/,5,2024
1ci452p,"Employer sent signed offer letter, weeks later retracted the offer for a lower pay due to a mistake. How to proceed?","Hello,
  
I am an American residing in the United States. I was offered a job in Scotland under a skilled workers visa. Here is the issue: I was offered a salary. They sent a document that acknowledged the agreed upon salary, and I signed it and sent it back. A few weeks later, they came back and told me that the salary would be increased, so they re-sent the offer with a higher salary which I signed and sent back. A few weeks after that, they told me that the increased salary was a mistake and then they sent me the original offer again. Here is the timeline of events to further clarify:
  
- I was sent an original offer (£57,000.00). The offer was signed by the company, and I signed it and sent it back. (Offer 1)  

- Several weeks after signing Offer 1, the hiring manager called me and told me that the company was undergoing some internal restructuring and they would be paying me a higher salary (£60,000.00). They sent an updated offer letter which was signed by the regional director (Offer 2). I signed it and sent it back.

- Several weeks after Offer 2, they called me and told me that Offer 2 was a mistake and asked if it would be okay with the original salary (Offer 1 - £57,500.00). They told me that they'd cover the cost of the Immigration Health Surcharge as an exchange. They have resent the offer which also now includes that they will cover the health insurance fee (Offer 3). I have not signed this.
  
I went and reviewed the documents to remind myself of the details. I noticed that each time they send an offer, they send two PDF documents (the Offer Letter which stipulates the pay, which is signed by the regional director but is not signed by myself), and then another PDF that is titled ""Ad Hoc ROC Terms of Employment"" (which describes job title/duties/vacation time/also re-describes the pay).

I'm wondering if their signed Offer Letter is legally binding, despite the fact that the Ad Hoc ROC terms of Employment was not signed?

Whenever i ask a question on maybe a move in im told to just put it to the side and the other receptionist will handle it. But i would also like to know what to do with it as well, i feel left out of not being able to also do the same thing. If there’s a process to know about something im always the last to find out about it. It’s really frustrating and i dont know what to do. My colleague also comes in on days to help out with things but ive never been called to help out.

1ci3363,Is an aircraft maintenance management degree enough?,"Hi, I wanted some advice on what I should I do next. A little context, I just turned 24 yrs. old and I graduated from college last May. I have an Associates Of Occupational Studies in Aircraft & Powerplant Maintenance. I currently work as a Locomotive maintenance advisor for a class 1 railroad. I want to eventually move into a maintenance management/supervisory role, so I've been really interested in a construction management degree. The issue is, due to the nature of my degree, none of the credits will transfer and getting a bachelor's degree will mean I have to start from the beginning (4 years). However, I CAN get a bachelors in aircraft maintenance management and that will accept my previous credits (so only 2 years). So, my question is, Do you think I would be able to leverage an aircraft maintenance management degree to get a maintenance management/supervisory role in any field? I don't want to get this degree if it locks me only to the aviation industry.

Just to answer a question in advance:
Q) Why dont you just work in the aviation industry?
  A) Im completely fine with working in the aviation industry, I just really like having options and being able to enter any field (Kinda the whole reason studying aircraft maintenace was great to begin with). At the moment this railroad stuff is looking promising so I want to keep my options open.

TL;DR: is an aircraft maintenance management degree a suitable replacement for a construction management degree so I can work in various fields?

1ci0t2u,Lawyer at Crossroads,"Hey guys, 

I'm at a crossroads in my legal career and looking for advice.

For background, I'm approaching my sixth year of practice. I spent roughly two years in criminal prosecution, then I transitioned to insurance defense for about four years. When I was in ID, I practiced work comp exclusively. 

I have gone on a few interviews. As between the following three options, I'm struggling to decide which would be the best for my career as a lawyer. I'm open to any area of practice so long as it helps my career overall. I enjoy being a litgator. For this reason, I've enjoyed past successes even if I haven't particularly cared for the area of law. The things I care about most in my work are salary and work-life balance. I believe all three would offer me the sort of flexibility of schedule I need (to varying degrees):

1. Local midsized firm specializing in labor and employment exclusively. Salary range is in $120k w/ 1900hr annual billable minimum. Pros here would be making professional connections locally as well as the ability to specialize in a particular area of law while having the diversity of forum (state, federal, appellate, arb., etc). Also, w/ bonus structure paid at a flat hourly rate, could close the gap between this salary and next option w/ enough billable hours by year's end. I was also assured that there was ample flexibility even though it's on site. I have the impression it was conveyed earnestly. 

2. Fully remote ID firm position starting in premises liability paying in the $140ks with a 2040hr annual billable minimum. The pros are the ability to be fully remote, as well as the ability to explore various areas of defense after a few months in PL. Salary will exceed base with bonuses, but bonus here is discretionary. I also worry about how it will feel to essentially be an island apart from the main office. The main office is 2.5 hours away which may create a barrier when developing professional relationships. There is no office in my town to stop in and say hi to the partners. As they say, it's much harder to fire a friend. 

3. Government gig prosecuting white collar crime for the state (for which my comp experience is particularly relevant) at only $90k but with fully covered meds, a pension, PSLF in about 5 years (if i can get my previous employers to certify), and likely offering the best work-life balance. Total comp package about $135k when it's all said and done. The problem is that, as with government jobs, this is the most 9-5 of the lot. I need flexibility for family reasons. That being said, work is really only from 9-5. No more late nights.

I loved my government gig in the past, but I've also grown super fond of my golden handcuffs! It's a tough decision for me. 

Please help me evaluate which option is best for my legal career, reddit. Happy to answer clarifying questions, and thanks in advance !",Illustrious_Sir_291,1,1.0,2,1714606337,2024-05-01 23:32:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ci0t2u/lawyer_at_crossroads/,5,2024

1chzzfo,Director might block a promotion?,"I’ve worked a corporate marketing position for two years. The first 5 quarterly reviews I received were Exceeding Expectations, I’ve taken on several new responsibilities as coworkers have left, and continuously bring new ideas to the table.

From what I’ve gathered, they don’t have ‘Associate’ roles, and even those with more years under their belt than me are in Analyst positions. However, I believe they should focus on the quality of experience, not just the length. After all, a resume filled with relevant, standout experiences should weigh more than one with years of unrelated work.

Do you think it’s possible to sway them? Any tips on how to broach this with the director? What should I highlight?",blindnessinwhiteness,0,0.28999999165534973,14,1714601689,2024-05-01 22:14:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1chyz3h/convincing_the_director_to_give_me_a_title_one/,5,2024
1chyx1r,Lapse in judgement,"Hi all,

I made an error in judgement at work and am scared of upcoming consequences for this. I am keeping it brief to remain anonymous.

I forgot to inform everyone that a little piece of machinery had been disposed of. This piece of machinery was rarely used and faulty. Now someone needs this for an upcoming piece of work. I disposed of it because it was faulty but should have informed them in case they ever needed it again. There are alternative pieces of machinery that can be used in its place, but may need to be troubleshooted. 

I am up for promotion so now am worried that this will be taken away due to my actions.

Any advice on this would be appreciated. I have offered to help with the optimisation needed and will be talking to my manager tomorrow. ",VeganSkyward,1,1.0,0,1714601544,2024-05-01 22:12:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1chyx1r/lapse_in_judgement/,5,2024
1chyg9v,Looking for advice: Staffing agencies for entry-level marketing job placement,"TL;DR: graduated from college in 2021; interned at an ad agency in 2022; received unrestricted US work authorization in 2024; looking for suggestions on working with staffing agencies to land an entry-level job in marketing.

Hello everyone, I received my US employment authorization a couple of months ago, and I’m trying to secure a job in marketing, preferably in market research, activation, or programmatic. I finished my Bachelor’s in 2021 and interned at a large ad agency in analytics the summer after (I did other internships during college as well). At the time, I needed visa sponsorship, and the agency was not willing to sponsor for entry-level roles. Later I got married but my work authorization took until February 2024 to arrive. I’ve applied online to 100+ jobs since then. I know that’s not the most effective route and the job market’s tough right now. I’m trying to network to get my foot in the door, but I’m getting desperate now to get my (professional) life back on track ASAP. I am worried the gap in my resume is a major hurdle. So, I’m wondering if working with a staffing agency would be the better option to get a job right now. 

Does anyone have experience with getting placed in entry-level roles through staffing agencies? What is the process like? Any recommended staffing agencies? ",bluepotato_12,1,1.0,0,1714600450,2024-05-01 21:54:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1chyg9v/looking_for_advice_staffing_agencies_for/,5,2024

I know that dentists here make a lot of money, but the process of transferring my diploma here costs around $250,000 (I would have to study for an additional two years). My mindset also changed during college, and I'm not sure if I see myself working in a dental office every day. I would like to work in something more dynamic or that would allow me geographic freedom (such as a remote job). I like finance and financial organization, so I thought about pursuing a Master's in Finance, an MBA, or another course in the health field where I could use the credits from my diploma.

I am a graduating senior at Northeastern University. I will be looking for a full time software engineering role for when I move back home to New York this fall (this summer I am just going to work a service job and pay my rent until my lease is up, will probably practice Leetcode in my free time). Throughout my coursework here I have completed multiple projects in different languages and taken a rigorous coursework. However, my only internship experience was for an IT position (titled ""Desktop Engineer Intern"") at a biotech, where I did a little bit of coding but nothing substantial. I also was a TA for a fundamentals course recently which should look good in my resume. My GPA was a 3.43 which isn't anything super impressive. I am feeling like it will be difficult for me to land a full time SWE position, which is what I really want to do, especially considering the current job market.

I quit my job in November 23 because I had a full on breakdown. I have a looonnnng history with mental illness and I needed a break. Anyways now that I am looking for work again, I want that entry level job in the market research industry.

The trouble is I keep getting emails in response to my job applications saying that I am over qualified.  

At this stage in my life I don’t want a managerial position, I want to do the easier tasks for mid pay and go home at 5 every night. 

Should I just lie on my resume and knock off some experience? I was hoping a pro of me having that experience would be that these firms wouldn’t have to train me, and I could just jump right in.

1chxtrq,My boss joked about firing me today during a meeting in front of a client... then he did it again in front of all of my co-workers. ,"I'm a designer who is working under contract at a marketing firm and my boss told me in December he wanted to make me full time, which I was ecstatic for because of the stability, and I really enjoyed my work. That, and he told me he really wanted me to start building out my role to be my own, and play to my strengths in my design interests, which I was super excited to do. Then in late March he gets on a call with me and says that he can't make me full time any time soon because the company is in a bit of a slump, which wasn't great to hear, since I've been looking to move in with my fiancé while anticipating getting more hours and getting a full-time stable job... and he called me after I announced my engagement and told me that news. I'm just trying to work on what I can and do my best and just hope eventually it will happen. But it felt pretty crappy to anticipate that and to be told it can't happen.

I've been really stressed about the unstable nature of my job right now, so I started taking on some freelance work on the side to help build some extra income, and to get a bit of practice since I've been interested in freelance, but there's been this new development and my boss has been doing this behavior where he'll rank the design team members on my team, and it makes us somewhat uncomfortable that he jokes about it. He did it first a few weeks ago when he started ""ranking"" how many projects each of us have done. And today we were all on a call with a client, and he makes the jokes about ranking the brand designs we made again. The client kind of laughs it off, and they were like ""well, there's no suggestions that ranking employees benefits the workplace, ect."" and then they picked another co-worker's brand, and they ranked mine last because ""it's well done, it just didn't speak to them."" Ok, no big deal. Then my boss goes, ""(Co-worker's name) is getting promoted, (other co-worker's name) is on probation, and we're letting go of (my name)"". Obviously a joke, but it was uncomfortable and no one really laughed. Immediately after the call, he turns around and tells everyone else at my job the exact same joke about how he's going to let me go, and how my co-worker quote, ""stuffed me in a locker"" today during the presentation. I get it, it's all jokes. Maybe I'm taking this hard, but these jokes are making me really uncomfortable considering that he took away the possibility of my full-time employment during a very expensive and stressful time. I was also given an adobe account several months ago, was told to stop paying for my personal one, then I had to pay a fee of almost $300 to cancel it, and then they told me I wasn't getting one anymore because I'm contract so I had to buy a subscription again. I don't know, it just feel unprofessional that they make all of these promises like an adobe account and a promotion, and they immediately took it back. Stuff happens in business; I get it. I'm trying to be flexible and roll with it. But it's been affecting me a lot financially and emotionally.

All of these jokes are just getting me really frustrated and I don't know if I can keep dealing with a work environment like this. I wish I could quit and get another job, but with the way the job market being this bad... I feel really stuck with no way out. I know people in my field who have applied to 100s of jobs with no luck. Is it normal for a boss to joke like this about ranking employees and joke so openly about firing me? It makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. I really try my best, and I keep holding onto hope maybe I'll eventually get full time, but my moral is in the ground at this point.",Shy_Pancake,5,1.0,7,1714598961,2024-05-01 21:29:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1chxtrq/my_boss_joked_about_firing_me_today_during_a/,5,2024
1chxgn6,The Development and Expansion of Commercialized Gambling,"Hello all,

The reason for this post (and idk if I am the right sub) is that I want to hear some opinions on the idea/reality of gambling being commercialized and it's expansion across the country as states begin to change their legislation.

I live in the DFW area and it seems to me that Texas is going to have legalized gambling in the next 5 years or so. It may not seem this way as Texas and other more conservative states a more resistant to the idea (same thing with weed), but even if the politicians align with conservative ideals, at least publicly, will do what their donors tell them to do.  

I believe that gambling will be legalized in all 50 states (obviously including TX) sooner or later. There is too much money to be made for that not to happen.

Here is the reason that I think it will happen in TX soon: 

Jerry Jones and other elites have been building a resort in Arlington around TX live. Right now it is seemingly just hotels and bars, but the whole place is under construction and expanding rapidly. They do have a lot of events across the street at AT&T Stadium and at the Globe Life's (PARK/FIELD). This means people come in from all over the country/world so it makes sense that they are building this stuff. But I think Jerry has plans to add gambling to the mix. I believe that he is building a giant casino/sports book in Arlington.

I know that there are people lobbying against this, but there is a push for it amongst the wealthy in TX. Obviously, the native Americans reservations in Oklahoma (Winstar is an hour away on the TX,OK border.) are against it as it would steal a large percentage of their business. Apparently they have teams up with an unlikely ally in the Baptists. That is something that I've heard idk if it's true. But, in the spirit of gambling I've got my money on Jerry and the fellas winning that one.

Anyway, the reason for me presenting all of that is to ask this:

Is there any way to take advantage of anticipating the legalization of gambling in TX or in other states that have not yet?

I recently parted ways with my previous job and am more wondering about career opportunities... I am sure there is all sorts of ways to take advantage of this (investments).

1chwxro,Worried in regards to an email o sent to my boss regarding training and my colleagues wellbeing (Scotland),"TL/DR: I got put into a situation in which I did not feel adequately trained for and my collegaue has been under extreme pressure and has started having breakdowns in work because none of the managers are listening to her or offering help. I emailed my boss raising my concerns and he replied very defensively and told me I have no right to message about my colleague or the training, I told him I was simply voicing my concerns and it is unprofessional to say I have no right as I was worried for her health and i had her permission to send the email. Now scared of what will happen now and don't know what to do.

So basically the situation I am in just now is:

I am fairly new to my job role and I recently got put under a lot of pressure I wasn't ready for. I managed to get everything sorted out just fine but it was a very difficult period.

At the same time a colleague of mine has been under very very intense pressure and she handles over double of the client meetings and arrangements any other staffer does. She does this because she really wants to progress through the company as she loves her job and has been there since she was 18. Recently her dream job opened up in the company so she applied for if, after hearing nothing back about it she emailed her managed. He never responded so next time he was in her branch she asked him in person and was told they need her in the role she is in now so basically they aren't considering her for the job.

I have now been placed in her branch to try and help and she had a breakdown the other day and the workload for 1 person is insane.

I decided to send an email to our regional manager to bring some of my concerns to his attention. I said:
 I believe we should have more training in preparing new starters for the extremely busy branches before someone is put in by themselves and while I did get all of the work done it could lead to issues in the future. It could be something to consider for the next set of new starters and it would be beneficial to staff and the company.

I also said: I am worried about (colleague) as she has more workload than other staff members and I can see the stress and pressure is getting to her. She puts a lot into the company and it hurts to see how she is struggling. I ask you to consider getting more support up to this branch as I think it could really help her out.

The email I got back was disheartening
he had said: The personal development after initial training is on the staff member and the only issues are with me if I can't handle the volume of work it's my fault. ( I had only said it was something to try and implement for the next set of new starts)
In regards to the comments about my colleague he said: The issue is none of my concern and I shouldn't be emailing him with any of this and I have no right to try and speak for her
 ( note. I had asked her before if she was okay with me sending the initial email and she was and thanked me for trying to stand up for her)

I replied today and pointed out I was only raising the issue on training as a concern. I suggested what could be done to help with this in the future and said I think there may have been some confusion on the purpose of my message. I didn't want to complain to him I wanted to let him know of my concerns of the matter and bring it to his attention.
I said I believe i have every right to speak about my colleague as I am very worried about her health and wellbeing because of this stress and i was hoping he could do something to assist her. I told him I thought his reply was unprofessional in regard to my colleague because I should be able to bring this to a managers attention and I was only trying to help her out.

A bunch of my colleagues have now been making jokes about me going to get sacked and "" it was nice knowing you""
The manager hasn't replied yet but I am now worried and not sure what I should do. 

I love my job I just wanted to try and help my colleague and raise an issue with my manager.
Have I done anything wrong or have I done the right thing, I'm really not sure at this point.

1chwwuv,"High pay mediocre learning(FAANG) Vs Mediocre pay good learning for first job
","Hi, I am a CS undergrad senior at a Tier 1 university in India. I am in a dilemna regarding my first job. I currently have the following 2 job offers:



1. Walmart Global Tech India - Team not known yet, first year compensation 18-20 Lakhs INR, 16-18 Lakhs INR per annum thereafter.
2. FAANG Company - Typical FAANG pay with base pay 20% higher than Walmart and heavy stock options.



Here is the dilemna that I am in: I don't know what team I would be a part at Walmart, so I don't know what work I would be doing. It could be great and pedagogic, or it could be bad and make me wonder why I didn't take the other offer everyday. At FAANG, the team that I will be a part of does not work on the core product(s) of the company, but is rather a tech team within a business unit. So the work would mainly revolve around backend development and building REST APIs using Springboot, MySQL, etc. with no fancy stuff. I've talked with some of the engineers there and they say that they plan on becoming more tech savy but that is a big 'IF'.



What should I do here? Take a big brand and pay cut and gamble for a role that might come with great learning, or stick with the other offer, continue with the mediocre learning for a while before(and if) the team changes direction in a more tech-ier direction?

Should I switch fields and try to get a masters in something else?

1chva0a,I am finishing college and about to start my career but im struggling. What should I do?,"I (21/F) am looking for advice or to just listen to your similar experiences, what choices you made and if you regreted any of them. 

I am about to finish college. I studied in a college far from my hometown. A lot of my friends were also from different cities. But now as we're finishing college everyone is going back to their hometown. 

My plan was always to stay in the city, because I am from a small town and there are not much career opportunities in my field. But now that i will be completely alone, no friends, no family, no partner, I am reluctant to stay. Because for the past months my friends gone back to their hometowns to complete college mandatory internships while i stayed here. I already feel just how alone I am. I have really surface level friendships with some colleagues, but thats it. Because most of them are way older than me so I cant find much to talk about with them. 

I am on the process of looking for a new job after my internship, but because of my lack of experience i get rejected or if I do get an offer, the pay is just enough to survive. Including the rent, bills and other needs, i would be living paycheck to paycheck (at the moment im living in a really cheap  dorm, but i have to move out as soon as i finish my studies) . But i do have to mention that i have some savings. But they are not gonna last for long. But if i go back to my hometown i wont be able to find a job at all. Remote work opportunities where i live are not that popular or accessible. But there is some. Atleast an internship that would be more in my field i could find ,but definetily not a full time long term position, not with my experience at this point.

So im asking what should I do, should i risk living alone in a finansially risky position but with more job opportunities or should i getback to my hometown live with my parents and try to get opportunitiea remotely with no finansial strain ? Then only when i have accumulated a lot of experience and am in a good finansial position move to the city maybe more closer to my hometown, so that i would be able to visit more oftenly family and friends.

1chv419,Accepted a misleading “internship” for career potential. Do I leave or wait it out?,"New account because I got myself in a predicament. Some backstory is required.

I’m 22 years old with an entrepreneurial mindset. The best way to learn is through experience, so I opened a brick-and-mortar business at 18. I also pursued a Bachelor of Science in Advertising as a backup plan, graduating in three years (August ‘23). Alongside college and running my business, I completed three 6-month digital marketing internships for extra hands-on industry experience.

I own a dance studio. Our annual revenue is $135K, with $60K covering operating expenses and $75K for our administration and a full teaching team. Although I could pay myself $75K a year and teach everything, my dream is not to be a dance teacher. Instead, I have a full team running our services, which allows me the time and headspace to work “on” the business—not “in” it.

After three years of iterating and finding the perfect product-market fit, we’re growing rapidly. We’re expecting a minimum of $200K in secured revenue this upcoming dance season with room for another $100k. We currently have just one studio room, and our next move is to build a second room at our current location; this means our operating expenses will remain the same, but our revenue potential will double.

Now that we have a full team, established systems, and consistent lead generation, the studio doesn't require much of my attention. I need the studio to grow at this level before scaling to either franchising, launching a dance/similar biz model media company, acquisition opportunities, etc. The studio has taught me a lot, but to be blunt, I’m not surrounded by people who are more successful than me or challenge my beliefs. I want to keep learning and compounding knowledge as quickly as possible. Because the studio doesn’t need much of my time, I started looking for job opportunities with startups that need hands-on team members to provide me with that environment. 

I was hired by a marketing agency four months ago. The agreement was to train me as their Operations Support Intern for six months, followed by full-time employment as the company’s Growth Operations Manager upon finishing my training. During the training period, I’d be compensated $1K a month for 24 hours per week. Afterward, I’d transition to a salary range from $80K to $90K per year. 

These are some of the issues I’m having: 

1. I was told I’d be supporting the agency’s operational processes and project execution internally to grow the business, eventually running the department myself as the Growth Operations Manager as the agency grew. Instead, I am the Project Manager for all of our clients.
2. I was not briefed on who the clients are or our relationship with them, at all. After a couple of months, I learned that these clients were just sold a $2K service (our unique “Growth Operations System”) for me to run Agile project management for them. I had one, maybe two, weeks of observing my boss run these meetings with them (Sprint Reviews, Planning, etc.) before I took over the Scrum cycle with no training.
3. I did not know I was the “Scrum Master” (and all other roles within the agile framework) until a consultant on the team referred to me as that in passing; this was well after I was running with the accounts.
4. No training has been provided other than the first week or two of watching my boss lead Scrum meetings. I’m supposed to pick up on everything by my boss giving me projects and telling me to figure it out.
5. Performance reviews were supposed to be conducted at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32-week intervals; none of them have happened yet.
6. We agreed the hours of the internship would be flexible as I am still a business owner and needed a flexible, remote position, with the understanding I would be available for any required meetings. I have at least 12 hours of meetings per week, starting at 7:30 AM and ending at 1:30 PM, Monday through Friday; sometimes until 3:00 PM. I’m supposed to work only 24 hours per week, but it ends up being 30 on average.
7. I was fine making $10+/- an hour for the training and opportunity, but I learned my boss's business model is employing virtual assistants from the Philippines and rarely paying full-price for an employee. He has made comments about not wanting to lose me and needing to get me on full-time in July. We continue to discuss it, but I’m skeptical. 
8. My boss’s business model was entirely uprooted this week, and he’s having to change how we’re working with clients and going to scale the business. Lots of instability.
9. Because my workload is so busy, my boss had me to hire my own Executive Assistant (what “intern” needs an EA). Anyway, he was pushing me to hire the EA fast. I went through the interview/onboarding process with someone I was mediocre about due to this urgency. I wanted to provide her training and resources to start, but his advice was to throw her in, tell her what you need from her, and see what she picks up. Needless to say, that didn’t work; I knew she wasn’t a good fit, so I had to let her go. I expressed my concerns to my boss and said if this is our hiring/onboarding approach, we need to at least tell them there’s a 90-day probationary period. No response.
10. He very much believes everyone is replaceable and will drop anyone whenever they’re not delivering the way he wants. No training, no performance reviews.

My boss just left on a 13-day vacation, leaving me to run everything alongside his EA until he returns. It would put him in a bad spot if I resign anytime before May 13th. 

I also don’t know if two weeks' notice is appropriate in this situation or if I should just gracefully bow out. I feel discouraged leaving a job so early having anticipated growing with the company for at least 2-3 years. I could always wait it out until my “internship” ends in July, then see if I get offered the salaried position. Regardless, it wasn’t the job I expected to do.

I just need some outside perspectives and advice on what I should do. A sounding board would be great; thank you.",WisdomWhiffer,2,1.0,1,1714592252,2024-05-01 19:37:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1chv419/accepted_a_misleading_internship_for_career/,5,2024
1chv0gs,Do I apply to same position in my current city (where I have experience) or preferred city (where I want to live)?,"
Hi all - could use some advice on this.

I am shifting careers from journalism to comms. Just mentioning to note my experience is very local to my city & the industry I covered for 10+ years. I have been out of work for a little over 2 years now dealing with personal and family work issues, and I am getting pretty antsy to find a position.

I would ultimately like to move from city A (current city) to city B, but can comfortably live here in city A for as long as I need to. Right now my priority is getting *any job available fast,* not the move, though that would be ideal.

I’m looking at a couple of postings for major national companies that have the same role (same qualifications and experience) in both city A and city B. I am qualified for these roles.

Do I have a better shot at getting the role if I apply in city A (where I currently live)? For context, I have actually lived in both cities and have family in city B, so I have a resume with their address I’ve been using to apply for jobs in city B.

But at this point I just want to apply where I’m most likely to get hired. All my experience is in city A. Any advice?",hellowur1d,2,1.0,2,1714591998,2024-05-01 19:33:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1chv0gs/do_i_apply_to_same_position_in_my_current_city/,5,2024
1chuyo8,Accepted a misleading “internship” for career potential—I need your advice.,"New account because I got myself in a predicament. Some backstory is required.

I’m 22 years old with an entrepreneurial mindset. The best way to learn is through experience, so I opened a brick-and-mortar business at 18. I also pursued a Bachelor of Science in Advertising as a backup plan, graduating in three years (August ‘23). Alongside college and running my business, I completed three 6-month digital marketing internships for extra hands-on industry experience.

I own a dance studio. Our annual revenue is $135K, with $60K covering operating expenses and $75K for our administration and a full teaching team. Although I could pay myself $75K a year and teach everything, my dream is not to be a dance teacher. Instead, I have a full team running our services, which allows me the time and headspace to work “on” the business—not “in” it.

After three years of iterating and finding the perfect product-market fit, we’re growing rapidly. We’re expecting a minimum of $200K in secured revenue this upcoming dance season with room for another $100k. We currently have just one studio room, and our next move is to build a second room at our current location; this means our operating expenses will remain the same, but our revenue potential will double.

Now that we have a full team, established systems, and consistent lead generation, the studio doesn't require much of my attention. I need the studio to grow at this level before scaling to either franchising, launching a dance/similar biz model media company, acquisition opportunities, etc. The studio has taught me a lot, but to be blunt, I’m not surrounded by people who are more successful than me or challenge my beliefs. I want to keep learning and compounding knowledge as quickly as possible. Because the studio doesn’t need much of my time, I started looking for job opportunities with startups that need hands-on team members to provide me with that environment. 

I was hired by a marketing agency four months ago. The agreement was to train me as their Operations Support Intern for six months, followed by full-time employment as the company’s Growth Operations Manager upon finishing my training. During the training period, I’d be compensated $1K a month for 24 hours per week. Afterward, I’d transition to a salary range from $80K to $90K per year. 

These are some of the issues I’m having: 

1. I was told I’d be supporting the agency’s operational processes and project execution internally to grow the business, eventually running the department myself as the Growth Operations Manager as the agency grew. Instead, I am the Project Manager for all of our clients.

1chtaqc,Three career path lay before me. What would you do? ,"Hey all, M27 who owns his own house. Bills total in about 2000 monthly. I currently have three career options and am wondering what Reddit would do in my situation. 

Option 1:
Stay exactly where I’m at right now. Currently i work a job in manufacturing. Not glamorous, but it’s good work, has good benefits and it pays the bills. I make about 3200 a month before overtime (pretty rare not to get overtime). It’s du pont scheduling so the rotations are a little tough, but the week off is a beauty. The work itself is damn boring i won’t lie, but all the guys that have been there 9-10 years are all making close to 100k. Plus management is pretty chill. Overall a rock solid gig, just never saw myself in a factory my whole life. 

Option 2: 
Hear me out on this one. Joining the local police department. I’ve applied to three in big cities close to me and have been accepted by all three to take the testing to begin to qualify for the academy. They all have various signing bonuses and from what I’ve gathered cops directly out of the academy make about 62k in my area. I’m a teacher by trade, and i left the profession because of the lack of pay. The reason i wanted to become a teacher is to build the next generation. I think it’s the most honorable thing a person can do. And the police to me is a way i can do that while also, you know, not having to choose between food and gas. Of course, the risk of being shot at looms large, not going into this blind. 

Option 3: 
My dad works with a guy who’s a counselor for a local community college. There is a two year program that would allow me to get work in the electrical workers union. They make 40 dollars an hour, starting. I really don’t want to go back to school, but they say they can work with my work schedule no problem. Actually going to meet with the guy tomorrow. My dad is even willing to pay for it as he’s a soon to be retired member of the union as well. Great money, but back working in a plant, and two years of additional schooling on top of work and other responsibilities i have now. 

Help me out Reddit, which one of these options would you take? ",itsalrightman56,1,1.0,0,1714587870,2024-05-01 18:24:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1chtaqc/three_career_path_lay_before_me_what_would_you_do/,5,2024

1chsldt,Second Degree Nursing OR Dual MBA/MS? ,"To provide some background, I began working at the age of 14. My lifelong aspiration has always been to become a dental hygienist. I never considered exploring any other career paths while growing up.






At the age of 15, my mother left, leaving my dad to raise three children on his own. As the middle child and eldest daughter, I had to mature quickly.







Despite gaining admission to university, I had to drop out due to financial constraints. I juggled two jobs simultaneously until I obtained my dental assistant certification. After working as a RDA for a period, I realized I desired more. Pursuing my goal of becoming an RDH, I discovered limited opportunities for advancement in the field. At 21, I knew I couldn't commit to this career for the rest of my life, which was disheartening. 









At 21, I found myself caring for my mentally ill brother, supporting myself financially, and needing to start over in school. My family consists mainly of educated professionals, predominantly doctors and medical experts. I felt lost, out of place, and left behind. I returned to school independently, funding my education. Although I considered various majors, I ultimately chose MIS. With a passion for technology and healthcare, I earned my associate's in business administration and will soon graduate with a BA in management information systems. Currently, I hold two remote analyst positions at major hospitals.









Seeking job security, I aim to pursue a career in nursing post graduation instead of going to grad school. So I’ll do second degree nursing - like my mother, I’ll specialize in health informatics, clinician informatics, or stick fully patient facing side of nursing, with dermatology or plastic surgery nurse and eventually becoming an NP. This path offers flexibility and aligns with my future goals without requiring a complete restart, unlike the tech industry.   










Nevertheless, I have an alternative option to consider. Instead of solely focusing on my current field, I can embark on a dual graduate degree program, combining an MBA with an MS. This integrated approach will not only complement my existing work but also enhance efficiency in my professional endeavors. By pursuing this path, I am paving the way towards becoming a professor and opening up opportunities for career growth as a director or VP.










It has been quite a journey observing my peers, little sister, and cousins all become medical doctors, or other medical professionals, lawyers etc. 







 I can't help but feel like the odd one out. Left behind, overlooked, forgotten about and abandoned. I to struggle with comparison but I have to remind myself all I’ve been through and how far I’ve come. I have to remember life is a journey not race and everyone’s path looks different. And no matter the obstacles or when you get there, what’s important is that you do!  While I never truly aspired to become a doctor, I find it frustrating that despite having more education, I am starting to feel confused about the various career paths I could pursue with the degree I’ve chosen. I can do systems administration, database management/engineering/science. I can business intelligence, project/program/product management, ERP/CRM management, network administration the world is my oyster. 






TDLR
After finishing my studies, I want advice on whether to go into nursing or get a dual MBA/MS. I would definitely appreciate any motivational words or ideas from those with the necessary degree and expertise in each respective profession. I appreciate your opinions being shared in advance.

1chs4hw,I’ve been offered two jobs. Both completely different opportunities but struggling to decide? ,"Job 1: 2 year fixed graduate scheme in Software Development, where the company also funds towards a masters for which you study whilst you work. It’s the 5th cohort of graduates and it’s been successful in the past in developing people with no experience in programming into competent developers. It’s £28k for 2 years but I’m well aware that it’s a lucrative career path for which I can earn much more in the next 5-10 years as I develop (in spite on not being paid much now)

Job 2: A Training Specialist role for a renowned health software company. It’s paying me £57k, with a 10% bonus each year. The office is very close to home (tho it’s 100% remote) and it involves the prospect of travelling abroad as part of the job. Apart from a promotion into a senior role, this role doesn’t develop any further, unless a new management role were to be created and employees tend to either do that or move into another role within the company. From what I see on Glassdoor and friends knowledge of the company, it sounds like a great place to work for. 

The two job opportunities have me conflicted. I’m 27 now and have never earned more than 30k since graduating. I started recently learning software development as a way to boost my career prospects but then this other job opportunity appeared. I’ve never had the opportunity to work for such money and it would change my life a lot for the better for my short to medium life goals and lifestyle. 

Can anyone give me some insight on my situation? I’m considering accepting both opportunities since the grad scheme starts in September and the other role is an immediate start. It would give me the opportunity to give the role a go and if I don’t like it then I can move into the grad scheme but if I do enjoy it then I can stay. Is doing something like this ok?

1chquel,I had a work incident in which a driver had some issues with a load and their hours of service and didn't think they would have enough time to run the second load so I eventually switched that load and he was going to reach out to day team and my boss wants to meet tonight. What should I say ,"I am currently a transportation manager at my company and work the night shift for my account. Last night/this morning one of our drivers who likes to start driving the night before was assigned a store load which took much longer than it should've. It started off with a construction delay that caused a 1hr delay but after calling the store and explaining that we have override over the construction truck he was able to proceed with unloading and proceed with his load (I'd like to mention that I tried calling corporate as another driver suggested that to help proceed but no one answered). This load had 3 stops and when he arrived at his final stop at around 1:45am. the store told him that they would not allow him to unload until 4:30am (it's a curfew store hence why this was the case) and I reached out to the store to see about persuading them to allow him to unload early this one time but the store would not budge. The driver complained that one of the managers from day shift purposefully assigned him this load as a way to screw him over basically as the driver was then concerned that he would not be able to complete his second load due to heavy traffic and concerns about stress and such (had things gone as originally planned he could've made around $400 today but made a lot less). After speaking to him and the other driver that he and I spoke to we decided to have him bring the trailer back to our yard and let him proceed with a different dc load that wouldn't take nearly as long to complete and be able to make some money since he still completed the first 2 stops (had an on-call driver complete the final stop). It's important that I note that while talking to the drivers I mentioned that I'm not sure why the day team assigned the driver this load knowing their typical schedule (wouldn't surprise me if this makes me look bad as a manager) and night team does not make the schedules nor assign drivers to loads or anything.

He said that he was going to speak to day team as all of the managers that work that shift are working today. In addition, my boss (the operations manager of the account) messaged me earlier wanting to meet with me tonight and ask what happened. He later messaged me stating that he wants to meet in person at the beginning of my shift (6pm) for a review. I think it's important to add that this is a hybrid position and all of the managers are allowed to remote to an extent (I always start at home and the other managers have done the same and usually stay home for no more than 3 to 4 hours (12hr shift) before leaving for the office due to online meeting at 9:30 (lasts 5 minutes at most majority of the time) and last night unfortunately due to being really tired and struggling to stay awake I didn't leave for the office until around 11ish and arrived after midnight to proceed with work from there. I mention this because I have a feeling that my boss will ask me why I didn't arrive until late as some drivers will arrive the night before and I wouldn't be surprised if this driver told him that I was not in the office when he first arrived. I will add that I'm currently applying for other positions and while I'll admit that I kind of screwed up and probably could've handled this a little better I'm going in thinking of how I should explain everything to avoid being potentially fired (driver wants to be compensated and has beef with the day manager that I assigned him the load as do some of the other drivers). I'm going into this review thinking that the main topic will be what happened this morning and then later review my work performance which is concerning. 

  
Any advice on how to best prepare for this interview would be greatly appreciated. ",Robthechamp22,1,1.0,1,1714581929,2024-05-01 16:45:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1chquel/i_had_a_work_incident_in_which_a_driver_had_some/,5,2024

1chpwd2,Got a new job offer with better salary after being at my current company for ~10 months. Would it be reasonable to ask current company for a raise or to match?,"I'm in a dilemma right now, I love my current company and the people that I work with. I have great managers, amazing job flexibility, reasonable work hours, it's work from home with no obligations to work in-office. The 2 downsides of my current company IMO are 1. the salary (65K/year), and 2. because of the company culture and work itself, I'm sort of limiting my personal growth and it's not challenging in any way.  
I recently interviewed with Company B who's offered me a position for 80K/year. They are a very reputable and strong company, the work is in the lines of what I want to do and grow my career into, however, it definitely seems more demanding and requires 3 full days in office per week which will be around 1hr of commute each way.  
I know the most obvious answer probably sounds to stay at my current job and I do want to stay for all the aforementioned reasons about having a good team and job flexibility, but the salary is something that is a growing concern for me. I've learned that coworkers who got hired a couple months after me got hired at 75K/year and that my current company offers no annual raises, no performance bonus, nothing at all. I've heard of people who only got a raise after 3+ years in the company and because they finally asked for it.  
I'm conflicted because I'm at a point in my life where my partner and I recently purchased a home and are planning to start a family soon, so having flexibility and understanding in my job would helps loads but at the same time, a stagnant salary with a house purchase and growing family isn't going to not help.  
My manager is a great person and really understanding. I want to have a conversation to let them know that I've received an offer with a higher salary and also express my appreciation for our current team, let them know that I would prefer to stay and but also share my growing concern for salary raises especially in the position that I'm in and ask if there's anything that they could do for me, or where I can see myself in terms of growth if I stay. That being said, I've only been here for almost 10 months, and I don't want to make to make it seem like I'm being unreasonable or greedy. I would think that I am well liked within the team and do a good job, but I want to make sure that I won't be offending my manager or leaving a bitter taste in their mouth.  
Any thoughts on how I should proceed with this? TIA!  
TLDR; Love my current job with great team and flexibility, only issue is salary is fairly low and stagnant with little to no room for salary growth. Got another job offer with good salary, but way more demanding in all areas. Want to bring new offer to my manager and ask if there's anything they can do without overstepping or sounding too greedy.",lateuralligateur,1,1.0,1,1714579607,2024-05-01 16:06:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1chpwd2/got_a_new_job_offer_with_better_salary_after/,5,2024
1chpume,Should I apply for the promotion?,"Here’s the backstory:

I have been at my current job for 6 months. There is a managerial level job opening in a different department that I would LOVE and have a strong enough resume to at least get an interview. I also have a good relationship with the director of the department but do not know the assistant director I would directly report to yet. In my current role we just finished up a large scale project, and are transitioning into a more “quiet” time of the year. 

I personally am 3 years into a career change, working in finance after 5 years of higher Ed admin (I got an MBA in that time facilitating the career). This new job is not a direct vertical move but more diagonal. It has aspects of finance, some similar work to what I was doing in my admin role, and some entirely new things that I would have to master. However, I would not yet consider myself a “master” of my current role, but I am completely competent and am able to do my job with little to no oversight. I would rather be able to say I understand my current job down to the minuscule detail before moving on, but don’t think that will be a deterrent since it’s not a direct vertical move. 

My plan was to talk to my boss about how they feel I am performing at our 6 month review coming up, and gauge the conversation. If they have nothing but good things to say I could mention the prospect of moving up, and mention this position. I am also wondering if I should read out to the hiring manager I do not yet know, and maybe the director I do beforehand, but I don’t want it to appear as though I am going behind my managers back.

Any and all advice is much appreciated!",Aggressive-Mark-4065,1,1.0,0,1714579489,2024-05-01 16:04:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1chpume/should_i_apply_for_the_promotion/,5,2024

I'm not sure how to inquire about this new position without seeming ungrateful or like I don't like what I do now. It's a small company, so word would get around if I applied.

Pros of applying for the new position: Work that's more in line with my experience and that I'd likely enjoy more, higher pay scale. 

Cons of applying for the new position: This position has a new manager that I don't know much about, whereas my current manager is amazing. Also, my manager has invested 9 months of training to help me in my role, so I feel obligated to stay where I'm at.

Here’s the full situation - It’s a small business, there’s really nobody else in my field to learn from here, I’m not paid great, under $50k, and I don’t have health. However, the boss is amazing. This is quite literally the most chill job in the world. I’m not managed, I just give myself stuff that I want to do, I’m able to work hybrid, they don’t care about time off, it’s just really chill and I’m genuinely happy. Very laid back environment and no stress, but I feel as though I’ve capped out on the things I can learn here and the amount I can grow here.

I have really big dreams, and I can only teach and manage myself so much here, I feel like I need a team and bosses to learn from. I got an internship offer at one of the biggest agencies around, it’s only 10 weeks long though. I think this would be a good experience where I’d learn a lot, and the client account I’d be on is a fortune 30 company that everybody knows, so would be great for my resume. However I’d be leaving this job after only 10 months. 

I already signed the offer letter a month ago, it’s set to start in June, so now the options are either quitting a stable job and risking unemployment after the internship and making a big mistake that way, and having the short time at this job being a red flag on my resume, or badly burning a bridge with an amazing company in my industry. The parent company of this agency owns allll of the big name agencies too so I really do not want to be blacklisted

1chnrck,Experience vs University Degree,"Hey all,

I have been a full stack developer for nearly 6 years. I started as an apprentice and never went into further formal education. I never went to uni or pushed for anything higher than my apprenticeship qualification. I learnt everything on the job, from my seniors and by myself.

I would consider myself a pretty good developer, and have no issue finding agency roles, or typical full-stack developer roles. However, when I am looking at larger companies (FAANG) and most in-house roles, I see that the majority of them require at least some form of university degree.

What worries me is that without qualifications I might be limiting myself.

Have I made a mistake? Would it be worthwhile applying to go to university? I have avoided this for a while because I always assumed that experience is king.

1chn05a,Should I stick it out or apply to another job,"So I’m coming up on 2 years at my current job. I’ve had a change in management about a year back where the new manager seemed very promising. She acknowledged that I do well and gave me a pay bump within 2 months of her starting. Last review that I had with her in December, I inquired about a promotion and she did say she wants me to advance and that we would discuss over the mid year reviews.

Fast forward to the present. Our department is now made up of 2 analysts (1 is me), a manger and the director (who I report to). They just fired the other manager (who mine took me away from), and the VP for our whole department. Didn’t reopen any of the vacancies. My manager hasn’t had any 1on1s with me since December so I have no idea if what she said still holds true. Meanwhile I keep getting more and more responsibilities dumped on me that are definitely at the management level. At this point I’m very frustrated and disappointed, I also need to be making more for all I do. They also just promoted someone in a different department so I don’t think the waiting til mid year reviews is actually required.

Hi everyone,

I recently joined a startup about a week ago, but I'm already feeling like it might not be the right fit for me. I'm considering quitting but I'm struggling with feelings of guilt over leaving so soon, especially since it's a small team and they might be counting on me.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Should I feel guilty about wanting to leave, or is it better to quit now rather than sticking it out and potentially causing more issues down the line?

Thanks for any advice ",askarovpro,1,1.0,6,1714572120,2024-05-01 14:02:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1chmxyz/should_i_feel_guilty_about_wanting_to_quit_a/,5,2024
1chmh1a,Spend 8k for another year in undergrad or 24k in masters program?,"I’m currently a senior at UNC, about to graduate in a week. I only have another day to decide this. I have a BA in Economics and Minor in Data Science and Creative Writing. I don’t have a job lined up and feel super unprepared. Since I feel lost on what to pursue, I’ve decided I just want a career that can get to six figures as fast as possible, without heavy socializing or heavy math. I have pretty bad social anxiety so I can’t do sales or anything super client facing in finance. I also don’t have any technical skills or certificates, which I really need to supplement my social skills. 

I was thinking of doing an Information Science BS. Admission into the program isn’t guaranteed but it’s not competitive. If I don’t get in I could still get an Econ BS which might make me more applicable to IT or data science jobs. I'm interested in project management and technical writing and this seems like a good degree for that.  My family would be understandably be pissed with me if I decided I wasn’t going to graduate a week in advance. It'll feel like I'm just procrastinating on choosing a career which it kind of is. Ideally, I could get into a MIS program, but I would need to take community math classes and have more work experience, and it’s been impossible to get hired for entry level roles. 

My original plan was to get a masters in accounting which costs 24k but I’ve heard so many terrible things about working in accounting so I’m kind of scared to sink 24k in a career I'm unsure about. I’ve heard that you have to be very sociable to get promoted. My two internships have been very accounting heavy. They're the only roles I've even getting interviews for. This seems like the most stable path and it can lead to many other careers down the line.

As you can tell, I’m kind of a mess right now. Any advice is appreciated!",thepoipoi,1,0.6700000166893005,9,1714570874,2024-05-01 13:41:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1chmh1a/spend_8k_for_another_year_in_undergrad_or_24k_in/,5,2024

1chj3be,How often do you make mistakes and how does your manager react to it?,"Hi, I’m a 23 year old who graduated from postgrad(master) last july, I’ve been at my first job for about 8 months now and I make little mistakes sometimes out of lack of concentration or when I do a task for the 1st time where I never noticed before how it’s done. I do apologize for them and own up to them but my boss is someone who is very miticulous about small details and she is the type to write a whole mail and explain if I forget a 0 and write 800 instead of 0800.
From one side it is humbling me and I feel like I lose my confidence sometimes, but when my boss keeps lingering on small mistakes it just feels kinda toxic and suffocating. My boss is the daughter of the CEO and she bought her PHD to hold such a position at the company, a typical nepotism child. I wonder if I’m being a little bit of a snowflake but things are starting to get to me and they affect my mood and emotions. I would love some guidance from you guys.

Long story short, it's not so much what I do (pretty basic marketing and warehouse stuff), or the short commute but it's run by a POS boomer type that gets on my nerves a lot. Started as a marketing assistant before being shoved to a service coordinator due to nepotism, and the only way I wrangled my way into the warehouse was because guys kept leaving.

For a whopping $60k (that's Aussie dollarydoos) for 1.5 jobs, how the hell do I get out of this? I never thought about a real career, but trying to explain my situation to potential new jobs is confusing as best.

1chffsr,"Love my work, but hate my boss.","I moved states for a job within my company to their headquarters as a lateral position into a new department I found exciting(management level). Everything started out great, but then I started to see the culture from my boss and this new department. 

My new boss rarely takes ownership, got upset that she had a busy week when I was on bereavement leave, tells me I do not get an annual raise when I know the company policies as it was more of a priority to know in my previous department that I was running a team of 60+ people in. 

I absolutely enjoy the work though when I get to take ownership. My boss goes out on two week vacations and it’s the greatest time of my life. I run our workload better than her and have been complimented by our VP. So I initially had the goal to get to my boss’ position. However I sit next to upper management and have heard them shit talk about the people who are also in my boss’ position. So it’s a bit discouraging through out. I brought a lot of efficiencies to the department, and was told I shouldn’t work on these things as it’s not in my job description. Then I go back to hearing them complain about being three months behind on emails and can’t find anything. 

SO. An opportunity has opened up where I would take a lateral to another department, but I know the majority of the people there from prior networking. I’m acquainted at the very least, and have had mentorships with executives. But I don’t think the position has as much visibility as my current one. It’s the same pay, if not 10k more. 

I’ve heard the saying you quit your boss, but I wanted a second perspective on if you think I should make the move for my mental state of mind? Long term I expect it would take me 6 years to promote currently to my boss’ position based on them having a time requirement to even be considered. Not sure about this other position.

1chf82j,How bad is it to withdraw an application/quit after accepting a job offer if you may be applying at the same agency again in the future?,"So my conundrum is this. My spouse is in the military and we are overseas, just arrived in Europe after two years in South Korea. I put in a bunch of applications before we left, one of them for a job at the childcare center, which is where I used to work in Korea but then quit due to burn out 6 months ago and wishing I had an office job. I can start at the childcare center here in two weeks. 

However, my husband has been telling me to apply for everything I might qualify for, so I did, thinking not much would come of it, and now I have two interviews for GS positions. One would be a GS-4 at the elementary school my kids are going to (where I think I might have relatively good chances). The other would be a GS-5/7 position at an office. The automated email from found me tentatively eligible for the GS-5 level but the interview invitation is for GS-7 now. I’m thrilled to be given a chance to interview, especially since I do not have a 4-year degree. Even at the GS-5 level, that would mean a pay increase compared to the childcare job.And I could improve my language skills as the other people in the office are mainly local nationals. 

If I were to get one of the GS jobs, how bad would my chances be to get a job at the childcare place in the future at another duty location if I turn down the job offer now? Do applicants get blacklisted for something like that? Would I burn all bridges?

The background is that my husband is trying to stay overseas and eventually wants to retire in Germany in ~9 years. I’m German but have US citizenship as well, but if he would get assigned to Germany in the future or when he retires there, I would not be able not work in a GS job there due to having German-US citizenship. So the childcare job would be a safe bet as it does not have the same restrictions. I’m trying to think ahead and have some kind of continuity in my resume, which isn’t easy when you move to a completely different place every 2-3 years. But a GS job would be nice as well 😅 am I overthinking this?",beeronika,1,1.0,1,1714544909,2024-05-01 06:28:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1chf82j/how_bad_is_it_to_withdraw_an_applicationquit/,5,2024

1chevsy,Resigning while boss is on vacation or wait?,"Due to number of reasons (dislike of organization & specific job, among other frustrations), I’ve finally decided to quit my current job (after ~3 months of debating!). I am planning on becoming self employed, doing contract work in a bit of a niche field. I don’t have anything specific lined up, but have a lot of contacts & potential opportunities and feel like I can’t focus on them or build more opportunities until I am not working and have the time. I have the support of my partner and savings to get by for a while. 

My manager is currently on vacation for two weeks. While I’d like to quit asap, I am debating on the best timing. My gut is that I don’t want to burn bridges and do it while she’s away, or even the first day or so that she is back, but also don’t want to delay the inevitable for much longer. What would you do? Go above her to her manager and get it done so I can focus on moving forward?

1chbwat,Fired for breaking compliance rules. Desperately need help and advice.,"I worked as a data analyst at a bank but ended up getting fired because I didn't report some big transactions between my personal bank account and an online payment account, which was told against company rules. I explained to HR and an investigator during the investigation meeting that my husband was managing my account and probably making transfers for mileage points without me knowing. I was not able to give the clear explanation and I told them I can confirm with my husband when I go back home. It's true, but maybe I shouldn't have said that because it made it seem like I didn't have control over my own account. I was walked out the office after the meeting and lost all access. 

I  provided documents the next day to prove that the money was coming from a legitimate source and not money laundering. I called my manager right after the meeting to explain, but he said he was sorry but couldn't do anything about it at that time. I understood, thinking he'd help if he could. My performance was good, and he had positive feedback, so I thought we had a good relationship.

3 days later, my manager and HR called to tell me I was terminated over the phone. I messed up, even though it was a negligence, but what really hurt was feeling embarrassed and my self-esteem took a big hit. I can't stand having something negative on my record and I could not even ask for network referrals as I do not know how to bring this up to my connections. 

I messaged my manager later to thank him for the opportunity despite everything, but he didn't respond a word. No one from my team reached out either. Maybe I was too hopeful, but it feels like the trust and good relationship I thought we had in the past year was a joke. 

this was my first time in a financial industry and being fired. I'm frustrated about how to explain why I left my last job and I need this experience to be shown on my resume. I am a honest person and really don't want to lie, but telling the truth might hurt my chances of getting hired. What should I say? Layoff? Let go? What if they ask why I was let go and find out there was no layoff? How can I answer without them digging too deep? It's really getting to me. I guess the most difficult part is to convince myself and rebuild confidence. Any advice would be appreciated.

1chb0l5,Should I go back to my old job? ,"So I [23M] have moved from a maintenance tech position to the same position but more hourly pay in a different company that’s way bigger than my old one , this new company I work for have about 27 properties in the city I live in and the company I left only had 2 so the difference in how both companies run is big. The new company has more room to move up and to learn so many new things while at the other company I was stuck as maintenance tech doing the same thing every day but I was making more money on my paychecks due to the bonuses they would give me , meanwhile in the new company they don’t give such bonuses so even though  I get paid more hourly the paychecks are smaller . 


Now that I’ve explained that I’ve run into the issue of dealing with a coworker in the new company that is causing a hostile work environment, and has burned almost everyone in the maintenance team . Last week I moved into the property and there were a lot of issues with the apartment I moved into to the point that I had to make multiple service requests (if it were a couple issues I would’ve fixed them myself) since there were 12 issues with the apartment. It caused the said coworker to complain and call me lazy for not doing fixing them myself and made comments that were unprofessional in the workplace . 

I immediately talk to my higher up and tells me that he’s sorry and that he will speak to said coworker and that my issues with the apartment will get taken care of , this happened on a Monday , come Wednesday and nothing has been taken care of and a mountain of clothes have piled up , so I opt to fix my issues myself , which causes me to sprain my back fixing these issues and have to full out an incident report . 

My wife ends up getting upset and complains to corporate about the issues at home and about the coworker and his comments that included her,  and ended up burning my higher up and my manager for her not being aware of the situation and further getting my higher up in trouble .


Now I’m at the point that I’ve burned bridges with both my manager and higher up and no matter what they’ll see me differently .

1chaazm,2 weeks in and I’m already seeing red flags :( ,"Two weeks into a new role and the red flags are flying…now what? 

I recently started a new job that I’m already seeing red flags about. Long story short they brought me in to do straight sales and find new opportunities in a SUPER saturated market. 

I was adamantly against doing new business sales when I was searching for a new job. I have 15 years experience and my cold calling days have been long behind me. I was enticed by this being a “new team” they are building and growing, with “so much opportunity to grow and lead teams”.  They assured me that cold calling wasn’t all I’d be doing and would eventually transition to managing accounts (which is what I want to be doing).

I was hesitant going into it, and even told the CEO who found me “thanks but no thanks”, but needed to get a job, so put the concerns behind me. But now that I’m in it, I’m feeling SO uneasy about the potential here. Turns out there have been multiple people going in and out of this same role, all of which have failed. Because it’s so saturated. 

It’s travel nurse staffing and business development is all about timing- when hospitals need someone they can’t find themselves. Most major healthcare systems use an MSP- which is the “account” I’m referring to. Essentially the middle-org that manages the staffing for the healthcare facilities. 

That means all those that do not use an MSP and could, in theory, give us a direct contract, are verrrrrry few and far between. Finding one is like finding a needle in a haystack :( especially after the  pandemic. I’m accustomed to managing and “selling” to the MSPs. But apparently we “don’t want to work with them and only want direct contracts”, yet the leaders of the team are managing those, making commission from them, and failing to take advantage of the massive opportunity within those MSP accounts. I guess I just don’t fully see the vision and how my making 100 cold calls a day targeting unicorns falls into the big picture given how much industry experience I have and the value I could add doing something else.

Leadership has made it clear there won’t be any sharing of these existing accounts that utilize the aforementioned MSPs. And if I find a hospital we could staff at that does use an MSP, I’m outta luck and have to move onto the next one. Because we “don’t want MSP business “

I’m the sole provider for my family right now and feel like I need to navigate this right from the beginning. How would you work through something like this? Communicate concerns immediately? Wait it out for the inevitable (not going to be what I need it to) and then  address once I have more tenure? Look elsewhere and get out as soon as I can? 

The company is great, the people are great, but I’ve talked to three others on the team who are feeling the same frustrations and have six more months on me. So I know it’s a bigger jssue 😞 any advice would be much appreciated!",TipSlight4017,2,0.7599999904632568,1,1714528347,2024-05-01 01:52:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1chaazm/2_weeks_in_and_im_already_seeing_red_flags/,5,2024

1ch9roc,Seeking Guidance ,"I am really hoping to find some insight or advice from people with more experience than me! I'm facing a bit of a transitional period in the coming months, I will be moving to a new city and graduating with my associates degree. I will be transitioning into a new job and struggling to figure out what will work for me. 

For the past few years I've worked with kids, mainly as an RBT, but also as a nanny and daycare provider. I have a solid four years of experience as a Registered Behavior Technivian, working with kids on the autism spectrum. If it comes down to it, I will continue to do this job even though I would love to move on. 

I will have an associates degree in psychology, and will be continuing my education to finish my bachelor's. I know an associates degree doesn't mean much, but maybe as a technicality it will help in certain situations. I have been severely struggling to make ends meet for the past few years, putting myself through school. If at all possible, I would love to be making a decent amount of money so I don't need to be so stressed. I've been exploring several paths and I am really at a loss when planning what to do next. 

Eventually, I plan to go into counseling, and am planning on dually pursing both school counseling as well as an LPC license. Because of this I have looked into school positions, mainly liason and assistant type roles. I have also considered being a paraprofessional, which may be the best fit, it is very similar to my current position though. As of right now, I am not too worried about experience that will be relevant to this degree, as I have years of experience in my field already, and will continue pursuing jobs in that field upon completing of my bachelor's degree. 

I've also looked into county as well as federal jobs, but I am unsure if these would be a good fit. Basically my priorities right now mainly include making as much money as possible (unique, I know), as I've been struggling putting myself through school. I'm willing to consider a variety of jobs, I've thought about possibly pivoting into sales, other administrative roles, HR??? I am open to literally anything :) 

The positives:
Data acquisition and analysis
Interpersonal skills
Some administrative (receptionist) experience 
Work with the disabled population 

The negatives:
Lack of ""hard"" skills
Lack of full degree
Pivoting from childcare?

Any input is desired and appreciated 🙏

I’ve been working with this person for almost 5 years now and it’s disappointing to keep watching a dumb culture play out where his narcism and controlling behavior drives any interaction within the team.

It projects further than get togethers since this type of managing makes connecting with coworkers and having any ability to direct tasks at hand to completion almost impossible. Since he enables his favorites to essentially not work. Myself included, as he generally likes me, when projects come in and he feels I might think it’s boring without asking he just writes it off.

When I initially stated, it was great. We had great benefits and a great team. I took this job when I was young and I needed stability in my life after college. I have a degree in the social sciences area and I tried a few jobs that were part time with a non livable wage. I come from a family that has been constantly worried about finances. Having stability is super important to me and I still have a financial scarcity mindset because I'm not where I want to be finances wise.

I climbed the corporate ladder and I hate this job now, things have changed immensely. I am still in a customer service position, but in a ""better"" role, but they've now changed it into almost a call center like environment with incompetent bosses who provide wrong answers, took away some of the benefits, and hired workers who continue to provide wrong answers or incorrectly process things despite being here for several years. The quality went down immensely as the new boss implemented their call center ways since that's the background they come from.

i came to the conclusion that with a dead end job and some sort of 20-something adulting depression , that keeping skill share will pay off for me better in the long run. i have some college credits but i don’t have a degree or much direction. can anyone recommend a course i should take just so i can at least benefit from this bullwaste??",Scared_Waltz_586,0,0.33000001311302185,1,1714522526,2024-05-01 00:15:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ch895w/i_accidentally_bought_one_year_of_skill_share/,5,2024
1ch80vx,"For the first time in my career I've received a counter-offer from my current employer. Probably because, for the first time in my career I'm doing things the right way instead of just leaving a job. Can you guys help me in navigating this decision?","So I'm drastically stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

These aren't salary positions. These aren't grandiose positions in some corner office somewhere. I barely make over $40,000 right now as it is. 

Both companies are offering me $25/hr (one has potential commission). But I feel like whichever I choose I'm confirming the career path that I'll be following for the next 5-10 years.

My largest industry experience, and the one I really try to sell on my resume, is 5 years in a Quality Control position for an automotive manufacturer.

**JOB 1 (current)**

I've only been with my current employer for 2 months. I'm currently working in the parts department at a large Car Dealership in one of the larger metropolitan areas. We have the largest dealership specific warehouse in our region, so my current position is primarily typical inventory/warehouse work. Scanning in orders, picking parts for deliveries or shipping, putting up items in stock locations, inventory management and cycle counts.

The counter-offer from my current employer is they will match my offered hourly rate ($25/hr) and move me to a Front Counter position with potential to earn commission later on (""After I learn the system""), is what I was told, but after speaking to my co-workers I believe they will uphold that promise and sooner than later I will begin earning a small percentage commission. So this would mean no more warehouse work for me as well as extra income on top of my hourly rate, which is something that is incredibly enticing. 

I will have freedoms as an employee to spend my downtime during the days however I would like, just as long as I'm ready and available to help any potential customers who come in. This is not something I've ever experienced, **at any job**, as I've mostly worked production based manufacturing that require you to hit daily production goals. At these jobs you are working from the second you walk through the door until the second you clock-out to go home. 

I really enjoy my current employer, I work with great people and even though my current role is hard work, I never clock-out for the day upset or stressed and dreading the next day. Its actual a super positive place to work.

The potential for promotion is something that is probably years down the line, potentially moving to a sales team position within the parts department. Most employees there have been with the company for 10+ years, which is actually pretty wild considering the stories I've heard about other dealerships. 

I will be working \~45-50hrs per week and will have a not great schedule for my first year or so. Tuesday - Saturday (9am-7pm). 

They also have incredibly expensive benefits. Almost to the point it might not even be worth it to use theirs and instead purchase Health Insurance through marketplace. They do yearly 401k contributions, but they do not offer weekly percent matching. And if you know anything about dealerships, well....they are never closed. You are working the day before and the day after every major holiday. Although, PTO is earned on a monthly basis.



**JOB 2**

I am being brought in as a Quality Technician (Auditor) in a brand new facility who specialize in industrial manufacturing. Think **large** industrial piping, wiring kits, etc. This facility will be fabricating these parts and it will be my responsibility to inspect and approve them for shipping to industry leaders in their field. This entails taking measurements of the produced parts, ensuring they fit within the companies specific processes and procedures using top-of-the-line machines to verify build quality. It will also be my responsibility to **make those procedures**, I was informed of this during the interview. 

So on top of doing auditing, this means I will also be documenting how the assembly workers produce their parts and putting it in easy to understand documentation and instruction manuals for future training. 

I will be on-the-floor for Day 1 of production in this brand new facility. Its decently sized but there are probably only 3-4 supervisor/management positions for the whole facility, so its definitely not huge by any measure. The immediate boss I will report to is new to the company, having only been there for 6 months.

The potential job aligns incredibly well with my current Quality Auditing experience and I believe is a great opportunity to really solidify Quality Control as my career path. I believe I could eventually use that experience to find a Quality Supervisor position or to transfer those skills to a more lucrative industry, like aviation.

BUT, taking this job means I'm solidifying warehouse work as my profession, and if you know anything about warehouse labor, it can be incredibly taxing on your mind and your body. Incredibly little downtime as you are expected to hit daily production goals and ""downtime"" isn't something that even exists at a place like that. Not until you get into a management position, then your downtime opens wideeeeee open haha.

Potential for promotion is unknown. People close to me think that being on the floor for Day 1 of production is a great opportunity, but if they never expand our facility or increase our production there will never be need for more managers/supervisors. Which leaves me just stuck in the same role for however many years I end up being there. I mean it is totally unknown what this job could lead to other than solidifying Quality Control experience. They are a worldwide corporation so I guess there is potential to move to a new location, even overseas, and I find that pretty cool and something I would be open to. But I don't have a degree, so I feel I might be the last in line for an offer like that.

The benefits offered are industry leading, some of the best Health and Vision I've ever seen. They offer 5% matching 401k, PTO, and the schedule is very friendly. Monday - Friday (7am-4pm). I will also get more days off per year around major holidays. Nothing incredible but it will be more days off than the dealership for sure.

I have **NO IDEA** what my daily workload will be like. In my last Quality Control position I got my ass kicked daily due to shitty management and constantly being understaffed, so I have a little ptsd about that stuff.

\\------------------------------

What I'm mostly torn on is the benefits, **the future/promotion potential**, and the comfort of my daily work. Manufacturing can be incredibly stressful, but my experience is with pretty awful companies who took advantage of their employees and got every ounce of labor out of them as they could. This new manufacturing job could be different but you never know until you actually start. With the dealership, I know what I'm getting into as I see the people in that position everyday.

I'm equally passionate about both of these positions, but depending on your bosses, warehouse labor can quickly turn that passion into seething hate. And that's where I am really divided.

I hope I have provided enough information for anyone to chime in on this, I'm open to all suggestions and really just needed to get this out of my brain. I've been thinking about this nonstop since the counter-offer on Friday and I'm not any closer to a decision today than I was then. 

Thanks so much.",sloppyhogshop,1,1.0,0,1714521909,2024-05-01 00:05:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ch80vx/for_the_first_time_in_my_career_ive_received_a/,5,2024
