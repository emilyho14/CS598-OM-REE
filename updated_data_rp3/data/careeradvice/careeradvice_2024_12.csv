1hqqmpm,Biology Major Careers,"

1hqqdgg,Advice Needed: Should I Stay or Should I Go?,"I’m a contractor for a construction consulting firm. This isn’t a career I planned for—I got into it because a relative (yay, nepotism) recommended me to their company. After three rounds of interviews, I was hired for a single major project. The project is huge, involving multiple agencies, and it’s the only project I’ve worked on so far.

I’ve been in the industry for about six months and was recently approached by another company (let’s call it Company #2). My former supervisor at my current company (Company #1) recommended me to them. After speaking with the president of Company #2, I felt we connected well, and I was impressed they took the time to meet with me. Company #2 initially offered $80,000 (up from my current $74,880).

When I mentioned this to my relative, they helped get me a counteroffer approved quickly—$84,240 at Company #1. I was prepared to decline Company #2’s offer, but they raised it to $87,000.

Here’s my dilemma:

* Switching companies wouldn’t change my job duties or the project—I’d just be working under a different agency.
* Rumors suggest Company #1 might lose their contract for the only project I’ve ever worked on because the client is unhappy with how they do business. Several employees have already left for Company #2.
* I don’t want my decision to reflect poorly on my relative, who helped me get started at Company #1, but I also want to make the best career decision.
* Company #1 is owned by a venture capital group, so compensation packages require executive-level approval. In contrast, Company #2 is smaller and more agile—for example, the president counteroffered on the spot when I tried to decline their initial offer.
* Company #2 would assign me a mentor, which I don’t currently have at Company #1.

With all other factors being equal (benefits, bonuses, and certification reimbursement), should I stay at Company #1 or move to Company #2?",littlebellpepper,4,1.0,9,1735686594,2024-12-31 23:09:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hqqdgg/advice_needed_should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/,12,2024

1hqpfxi,Need advice on potential job change but would rather stay. ,"I’ve been working at my current employer for well over 10 years. I enjoy what I do and I really like the company I work for. 

Last year I was approached by someone from another company who was impressed with my skills. He told me what they start the position at which was about 25% more than my current base salary. With that said, with my current base salary I also get reimbursed for miles I put on my personal vehicle which narrows that salary gap to about 7%. The new position would actually have me traveling significantly more but would also cover all food expenses while I’m traveling, which my current employer does not. So if I add the food back into the current employer it’s about a 10%-15% difference. I ran into this person again recently and they got their hiring staff involved and I was basically told we’ll reconvene after the holidays but you have a job if you want it. 

I always felt my base salary at my current employer was much lower than it really should be. My company likes to lean on paying more money only if you wear several hats. I’m really good with my one hat and I enjoy what I do. I’m one of the leaders in my position, I could run the department if needed and if it was structured that way, and all new hires lean heavily on me for advice and guidance with management expecting so of me. Most of the new policies we have implemented have come from me as well. 

The advice here seems to be to NEVER accept the counter offer. With that said, I really don’t want to leave my company. I just want them to understand that what they pay for this position is well below market value. I really don’t want to travel more like will be required with the other company which is why I don’t think my current job is worth as much as the other but it’s worth way more than the base salary difference it’s currently at. 

I’d like to approach my current employee with an official offer from the other company with the explanation that I don’t want to leave but a 25% difference in base salary is too big of a difference to turn a blind eye to. I’d like to work something out that works for both of us but I don’t expect you to match, and I can list the few reasons why I don’t think that would be fair to them (current employer). In the past this would be more of a long shot because of how my position was structured (where the money came from) but that is changing soon so more money will be available for the entire department.
I’d like to ask for a 10%-15% bump in base pay with the opportunity to run the department in the future when that comes up during the restructure phase we’ve been going through. 

I know the percentage I’m asking essentially narrows the gap to 0% difference once gold is factored in but keep in mind that I’m reimbursed for mileage. That money isn’t guaranteed.

1hqlws1,should i stick it out or leave?,"i am an apprentice optician; i work helping people with everything regarding glasses and contacts.

i currently work at lenscrafters. not a big fan of my stores location, snooty coworkers, unsecured hours, etc.

i got a job interview at a private practice that will pay me the same, secured full time hours, and i would get to wear scrubs which is cool lol :)

my only problem is that once i complete my apprenticeship, my pay would go up an additional $10 hourly at lenscrafters (or any big box optical retailer for that matter). at the private practice, this is not the case. private practices in the state i live in do not require a license therefore they don’t pay more if you have one. 

i won’t be getting my license for another 6 months, but if i do take this new job, id only be there for 6 months, because i would want to leave to a job that pays a licensed optician salary. (costco, walmart optical, sam’s club optical, target optical etc.)

licensed opticians are very needed in the state i live, so upon getting my license i will have a lot more options as far as where i want to work.

1hqkh9c,"Paralegal with masters degree in management looking to get out of law firms, possibly to outdoors work","This is long, but it has paragraphs! Please bear with me. 

I’m 30F, single, no kids, and have only worked in civil litigation law firms. I’ve been a paralegal for nearly 7 years, and other legal support positions before that while I was in school. My undergrad degree is in a foreign language. My current job is fully remote, and I recently bought my first home in a small city in a rural area surrounded by national forests and BLM land. There’s a national park not too far away, and state and federal gov offices nearby (various agencies). I’m not willing to relocate because my family and home are here in California. I currently make about $110,000, and couldn’t afford to take a salary below $80,000 (and if I go that low I would need a clear path to fairly quickly increase that salary for my financial planning to be where I want it). My city does not pay salaries this high for early-mid career employees (more like $45,000-$70,000), so local in-office work is out of the question. 

I also recently got my masters degree in justice management (think of it like business management/leadership but specific to the courts and allied agencies). With this degree (but no actual management experience other than mentoring/overseeing the work product of more junior paralegals), I hope to pivot out of law firms and into a fully remote legal-adjacent management role in the public sector or at a corporation. Some roles I’m considering applying to in my state’s massive university system have titles like “labor relations grievance response manager,” “eDiscovery coordinator,” “title ix coordinator,” “project analyst iv in the student equity office,” etc. to give you an idea of what “legal adjacent” means. Grant writing, contracts, policy, etc. too. The university system has a handful of fully remote openings, but most other public agencies I’ve looked at require hybrid work, and they’re located 3-5 hours away from home so they are not an option.

I’m ALSO realizing that one of my biggest regrets with my career is not choosing something that allows me to be outside regularly. I hate sitting at a desk all day. I love hiking, kayaking, climbing, moving my body, and feeling strong. I’m super obese right now because I’m just sitting all day long. I allowed adults to talk me out of considering park ranger-type jobs when I was in high school, and then my academics and career just kind of went a legal direction. Part of me is toying with the idea of saying “eff it all” and training to become a firefighter, park ranger, forester, or similar. I’m not sure how much additional education that would entail (and whether I’m willing to do it), how marketable I’d be afterwards, given my entire background is as a paralegal, and how much of a salary cut I’d have to take (again, I need at least $80,000 to pay my mortgage and bills). Obviously a pivot to outdoors work would be my exception to wanting remote-only work. I’m wondering whether volunteering for search and rescue, as a firefighter, or something related would help to scratch that itch. Or even working for an outdoor non-profit in a desk-based role. I’ll start there, but wanted to get thoughts on a paralegal pivoting to outdoors/active work. Has anyone seen something like that before? 

The things that bother me most about being a paralegal are: having to track and enter billable time, and account for everything I do in 0.1’s; the adversarial nature of litigation down to the rude and insulting tone of emails I’m regularly copied on to and from opposing counsel; the industry standard poor benefits—2 weeks vacation each year with no increase with tenure, no dental, vision, or life insurance; no clear direction for career progression; profit-driven nature of private law firm work (you can’t just be efficient and finish work early—there’s always more work to create so more time can be billed to a client), and inherently being “under” attorneys and always told what to do and how to do it while receiving none of the credit because they sign the pleadings—I want to manage projects, programs, and/or people. I also really, really want to be classified as salaried exempt vs. hourly non exempt. 

So that’s the word vomit. Now, some specific questions I have:

(1) I *know* my skills as a paralegal are super transferable to these legal-adjacent roles I’ll be applying to. I just don’t know how to reframe them on my resume, since they’re so tailored to law firms. Any thoughts on constructive ways I can market my experience? Chat GPT has not been super helpful on this front (it produces vaguely worded gibberish that doesn’t really show anything). 

(2) How will employers view a candidate with a masters degree in management, but no formal management experience (pivoting to another field to boot)? Do I need to accept that I’m just not competitive for management or even coordinator roles yet, and try to get my foot in the door with analyst roles first? 

(3) Since I have no formal management experience, should I bulk out the education section of my resume to describe key concepts I learned from my coursework, like leadership styles, management frameworks, etc. and describe some of the assignments I did? Typically my education section just lists degree, major, university, and date awarded. 

(4) Are there other legal-adjacent job types I should consider applying to? I want to stay far away from executive assistant type roles because I think a lot of the stuff I dislike about being a paralegal would still be present there. 

(5) General thoughts on the possible pivot to outdoor work? Retraining for a new field, marketability, salary, working conditions, etc. How pie-in-the-sky is this idea? 

I’m a paralegal, so I have a thick skin. Feel free to be very blunt. ",cactusqro,2,0.75,0,1735668765,2024-12-31 18:12:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hqkh9c/paralegal_with_masters_degree_in_management/,12,2024

Three months ago, I started using an AI meeting app that creates summaries from recorded meetings. Now I basically do nothing all day.

Here's my ""workday"": I dial into Zoom calls, put them on speaker, and let the app record, transcribe and summarize. While everyone else is actively participating, I'm usually doing housework, running errands, or watching Netflix. The summaries come out better than when I used to type everything manually.

I know I should feel grateful. I'm making good money, my boss praises my work quality, and I have freedom most people dream of. But the guilt is killing me. My coworkers are grinding 8-10 hours while I'm practically retired at my desk.

Yesterday it finally caught up to me. Someone noticed I was muted with camera off during a major planning meeting. Now there's an HR discussion tomorrow about my ""engagement levels.""

I used to be good at my job. I wrote detailed notes, kept everything organized. Now AI does most of it better than I ever did, and I'm just... here. Getting paid $82k to essentially babysit an app and a bit of admin.

Do I confess? Start job hunting? Keep riding this until they figure it out? I know this can't last forever, but I also can't stop thinking about how I'm basically a fraud.

1hqhell,How do you “get into consulting”?,"I’ve been having a career crisis for the last 2 and a half years. 

I had my dream job, got laid off (this was such a cute and fun experience changing the trajectory of my life). This job was marketing within a large medical device company, more specifically the data side which I enjoyed vs the creative part of marketing. 

I pivoted into a VERY niche industry within real estate that I won’t go further into because it wouldn’t be hard to figure out where I work. I do project management, marketing, PR, and somewhat legal stuff (contracts, due diligence, etc) within this role. I wear A LOT of hats, too many really. This role however has caused me emotional and mental distress I have never felt before due to the way I am treated by one individual within upper management.

There was a contracting specialist role I was very interested in within the healthcare industry, but ultimately did not get after the final round interview. I enjoy contracts, data, compliance, due diligence, and all that fun stuff a lot. I also LOVE managing projects and timelines bc I can be a control freak. 

I keep being told that I need to get into consulting. My brother does it, his wife does it. They are helping me explore roles within their companies, but if that doesn’t work… how does one even get into consulting? 

I have roughly 3 years of experience (5 years of you count some of my college endeavors).

In my 3rd and 4th years i had alot of struggles and when i passed about 80% of my degree duties i broke down mentaly and just couldnt carry on, I decided to enter the my service without a full degree and try to finish it while serving. well, it didnt worked out... i kept hiding my struggles from everyone and eventually moved to focus just on my work and neglecting the degree (while no one knows about it)

now i getting to the end of my contract, i got about 6 years of expirience at managing big IT infrastructure projects and got good at it, my colleagues and commanders are viewing me as a prospect and strated to suggest me some promotioans. The main problem for me is that without a degree i would keep getting very low salary about 3k dollars a month.

so i see two options for myself and would love to hear your thoughts about it

1. Continuing my path in the military, it will force me to expose the fact that i dont got a bachlor degree, and I would have to start one from scratch. Meanwhile for 3 years get a 3K sallary, the degree will give me a raise of 2K and 4 years after that another 1.5k.
2. End my contract, my initial direction is starting an AWS solution architect certificate (i will finish it before my end of contract) and trying my luck finding a workplace without a B.sc.

1hqgbjm,Mechanical Engineer to Custom Woodworking,"I am 26M and a mechanical engineer. I have come to realize I would rather make less money working with my hands (While still utilizing some engineering skills) than go into an office. I am in the aerospace world and really can't complain too much about my current job. Some of the work is incredibly boring but they are paying for grad school (1/3 of the way done now), there are opportunities for research, sometimes there are interesting problems, and the people are ok. I am sure a lot of people can relate, but every day I go into an office I feel like it takes a little piece of me.

I love working with my hands. I have professional experience using CAD software to create 3D models, creating engineering drawings, and working with machinists to bring those drawings to life.

One of my biggest issues with my current job is there is no way to apply my skills to help my community or give back to the people around me. If I am going to work in a field for 40+ years, I want it to be useful to the word. I have a ton of respect for science and engineering and appreciate the work I have been able to do, but I don't see what I do as particularly useful to anybody. 

I see custom woodworking as something that checks all the boxes for me. Make money with my hands, work for myself, learn how to complete interesting projects, still do 3d modeling and engineering drawings, and put myself in a position to give my time/efforts back to my community or people who need it. Even if I make less money, if I have a family one day I see it as a skill or hobby I can pass on.

In a perfect world - my current vision is to start making furniture/custom projects and selling on facebook marketplace and maybe other social media sources. Then as my capabilities/workspace grow transition out of my current job and take on custom woodworking full time.

Does this sound like a terrible idea? Am I grasping at straws trying to find some more autonomy over my life?

No more extra from me - if an opportunity for a conference proposal comes and she doesn't mention it at the weekly meeting, neither do I. If she has a ""good idea fairy"" moment of something she's really like to see happen I just...don't. 

My boss's boss knows my boss is a piece of work and after I confided in a colleague that I was thinking about leaving, I was rewarded with a raise. 

So now we're at the year-end and I put together the end-of-quarter metrics. To do so, I pulled from last year's annual report, and holy hell while we've hit our metrics most of the ""extra"" stuff has fallen away. 

It will be time soon for my annual review and next year's goal-setting. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for the discussion. I'm thinking that no good comes of telling her that I'm done doing more than what's required, but I have to think it will be fairly obvious. Anyone have any good advice?

FWIW we are a team of three, and we replaced the other team member last year, had someone for a little over a month who didn't work out, so I think I can play it off like some of my time was spent mentoring? I also want to stay in this job at least 5 more years because of some specific benefits and the hopes that my retirement-aged boss will quit in the next two years.

1hqelwb,I think my career is over and I am absolutely uncertain of how to proceed.,"My industry took a massive hit in 2022 and has yet to bounce back. I managed to stay employed until mid 2023, but could not find work no matter how hard I’ve tried ever since then.

My income went from six digits to no digits. My entire life collapsed. I have absolutely nothing left and have been living in my car for a while now.

Before I started my decade-long career (software) had no idea what I would do. Nothing seemed viable. I identified this one thing, learned the fuck out of it, and made a life for myself. Now that I’m 10 years older, I feel like I am back where I started but with much less youth, much less time, etc.

As it stands, if I could find a common, minimum wage position near me (because I can’t afford gas to go anywhere), it would not be enough money to even get me out of my car. All it would do would increase my food security.

I’ve been out here mostly silent in my struggle for so long now. I’ve not wanted to burden anybody with my own struggles in capitalism, but god damn I need help.

I need a lifeline like I’ve never needed one, guidance, literally anything I can get. I’ve been spending so much energy just trying to come up with the money to eat whatever cheap, crap food I can acquire.

1hqek0p,A blended career ? Advice please ,"Hey guys, 

This may be a bit of a long post, so please bear with me. 

1. I began my education journey with a BSc in Food and Nutrition Science. During my final study year, I discovered my passion for all things food-technology. Think hydroponics, precision agriculture, etc. 

2. After my Bachelors, I worked for a year in a hydroponics company. I also interned at a saline agricultural research facility in that same year, which solidified my food-tech passion. I simply loved it. 

3. Now, Masters. Majority of my classmates chose to become dietitians or pursue a Masters in Food Science (the typical pathways). By sheer chance, I got the opportunity to complete a Masters in Computer Science (wherein I learned Data Science, AI, computers, and so on). Despite the glut of graduates in tech, I loved my time and enjoyed the knowledge. 

4. Currently, I’m working as a remote data analyst and I like what I’m doing. Hopefully, I aim to master AI, as that’s a tech-domain I’m very passionate about. 

My future career plan: Although I like tech, I don’t want to spend the rest of my life working in tech. That’s not my intention at all. I want to work in the tech sector for some years, to gain experience and knowledge. After that, I want to transition to the food-security field through a PhD. It would be awesome and life-changing to conduct research in a food-tech area I’m interested in, and devote my life to food-tech in any capacity I’m allowed (research or industry). 

My query: Am I correct in my way of thinking ? What would you do if you were in my situation ? 

Any advice, insights, and solutions are greatly welcomed by me. Thank you very much for your patience, in advance.

1hqdmvg,Two cancelled relocations due to mental health issues,"I am looking for advice on my situation. I work for a large company with multiple offices around Europe. I applied for a relocation (exact same job, different office) in early 2024. The company processed my relocation, paid for my visa application to be filed with an external immigration company (standard procedure in my company), but then I had to cancel it due to my mental health situation at the time.

I felt in a much better position in September 2024, and requested the transfer again. The same process happened again and I have the visa and am due to move in January. Unfortunately, my situation has deteriorated over November and December -- I am in very poor mental health once again (stress, depression, and can have my psychiatrist officially certify this) and it would be a horrible idea for me to make the move now. I would like to request to cancel the move again and offer to pay back any immigration fees (potentially in the thousands) that the company have spent on me. 

What is the best way to approach this? I understand that this is a huge waste of company resources, however at the same time I am really not well and the move will make things much worse for me (I will lose the medical resources/ medication I am currently accessing in my home country, be away from friends and family, etc.). I would also be foregoing a relocation bonus, and losing a few months of rent that I am paying on an apartment I already took in my new town. There is a large financial impact of cancelling, but I am convinced it is the right thing to do. 

How can I ask whether my move can be cancelled in the right way, to avoid escalating the situation further and opening myself up to any disciplinary action? I want to cancel the move, but only if it does not put my position at risk, and only with the company's understanding and blessing. My manager is generally supportive that I do what is best for me (even if I have messed her around by withdrawing, asking again, and then withdrawing again).

1hqc5rb,Need advice; job change or masters application,"Looking for a change, masters application/job switch?

Hello everyone,
I am 27, with 3.5-4 years of experience as an engineer with a mechanical engineering bachelors degree. I am right now working at one of the top automotive companies in industry, and have a well-ish paying job with an open future in the company with potential promotions upcoming in the next years.

However, what i am certain of is that i am not satisfied with my current life. Mainly because i am not satisfied with the city i live in and how anti social i became with how my life is going, also with the stressful worklife no social life takes a toll on ones mental health.

I am not a careerist. I dont care that much for promotions and titles, however i am well aware that money is the most important factor, a middle paying job could very well satisfy me moneywise.

Three paths seem to be on my horizon and i need advice;
A) The most unlikely; somehow try to love the city and try to socialize. It didnt happen in 4 years and i dont see it changing.

B) Move to another country for masters degree (France, a better country than where i am at now, i know French). However i dont see myself studying an engineering masters as i dont see it as useful and dont have any intention. I want to study what i truly love (Philosophy of Science or Physics, but mainly philosophy). I want to study the subjects i love and familiar with, with looking at the possiblity for a phd for academics (however i am not so keen for academics right now, but my opinion can change during masters). After the masters, i can look for a job where i left for engineering jobs. The main question here is;
Do you think a 2 year master gap in a “non related” field might look bad for jobs? Will it hinder my job search after master (29 year old with 4 yoe)?

C) Look for another job in another city/country
As my master application is on the way, i didnt focus that much on this one. This might be a possibility as well.

Tl;dr: do you think is it okay for me to quit a good life on paper to study a non related masters degree for 2 years, with keeping in mind not only “do what you want” but also what i will be doing in ages 30+

1hqazll,My self confidence has vanished,"I started a new role exactly 12 months ago. It was essentially a highly competitive promotion to another department and I was over the moon when I got it.
In my previous roles within the company I had been a star. I received numerous awards and always got good feedback. 
In this new role I tanked. My husband and I were relocating this year and he also suffered some health concerns which left me fully responsible for most household work (i.e, cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping) for about 4 months, along with finding an apartmen (we were staying in temp accommodations in the meantime).
I did my best to focus on work, but I admit my energy and focus were divided. My manager's feedback every month was that I wasn't pulling my weight.
At the same time another team member who joined at the same time as me, shined. His role expanded and my manager compared me to him in our feedback sessions as well.
Over the past year this has taken a toll on me, I feel worthless and dumb like I can't do anything and my confidence has taken a hit.
I feel ashamed of myself.
Another factor is that since I was relocating to another country my manager knew from the beginning that I would only be staying in this role for 1.5 years max.
I don't know what I'm looking for by writing this post, maybe just some unbiased advice on how to cope with this.

1hq5ckw,How do I parlay my news career into something with a better outlook?,"The writing’s on the wall… probably. 

With Netflix, Amazon and Apple now firmly entrenched in the business of feature films, TV and now live sports, cash is drying up at the old-school media companies that have funded a robust (and expensive) TV News business for the better part of a century. I see 50 ways it could all come crashing down rather quickly, and I’m looking for the escape hatch.

After various jobs in TV news, I landed a job at a major outlet 11 years ago that you have heard of, and worked as a journalist for 10 years, traveling everywhere, seeing everything — shooting, writing producing, and doing on-camera stuff. A year ago, even though I LOVED this work, I decided to take a management position. I’m now essentially managing assignments and production day-to-day in North America, hoping to build my resume up for the “next” thing. But I’m still trying to figure out what the next thing is.

The obvious advice for someone in my field would be PR, but I’m wholly against working in the whole corporate “earned media space.” Not for me. I can’t peek into the live sports business because I have zero interest in or in-depth knowledge of sports. Sorry.

My ideal career would be to leverage my video storytelling expertise and my management experience into a growing industry. I am really good at the editorial and technical sides of video storytelling, and getting the most out of those who do it. 

I really like the idea of getting into tech at a time when traditional broadcasters in the news space are ripe to be gobbled up. But when I go on LinkedIn and look at major tech companies in the video space, the closest postings are in the marketing and project management space. Sounds appealing… but I have no relevant experience in this industry. 

I’m making about $120,000 right now with bonus, which is on the low end for my industry, and my goal is to double that before 2030. I live in New York City, and I really really do not want to leave, but for some sort of dream salary, I could be persuaded to move to California.

Thanks for getting to the end of this drivel. Any suggestions of where to look, or how someone in my position should decipher the job postings at these tech
companies? Do I need to go back to school? Hard truths encouraged!

The field is the same, business structure is completely different than what I’m used to so it’s new and scary. Corporate but not huge so lots of growth to be made. The company in general has grown and changed quite a bit in the last year even. 

I just have my whole family depending on me. Husband stays at home so any career decision I make is a huge decision. Everyone’s depending on me for a few more years until husband can get back to full-time work which will likely be 3 more years. 

What would you do? Or if you did this, how did it work out??

I’m really at a crossroads right now and could use some help. My OPT is expiring in just two months, and I urgently need a job to qualify for a STEM extension. I’m currently volunteering to stay active, but I need a paid role ASAP to keep my work authorization.

Here’s a quick overview of my background:

I have **3.5+ years of experience** working in tech and project management roles. I’ve led full project lifecycles, worked with cross-functional teams, and managed client relationships. Some highlights:

* As a **Project Associate**, I improved delivery timelines by 25% using real-time tracking integrations and ran 15+ client meetings to streamline communication.
* At **MicroParcel**, I developed a delivery app for local logistics, reducing turnaround times by 30% and increasing client conversion rates by 60%.
* As a **Strategic Advisor**, I helped startups implement digital solutions, standardized processes, and delivered projects 25% faster.
* I even worked on an automated system during my internship, collaborating across teams to build something impactful.

My skills are in **project management**, **data analysis**, **cybersecurity**, and **business intelligence**, and I’m familiar with tools like **JIRA**, **Confluence**, and **Firebase**.

I’m looking for opportunities in IT, data analysis, project management, or related roles. If you know of anything, or even if you just have advice, I’d be so grateful.

I’ve been trying everything I can, but it’s crunch time, and I could really use a break. If you can help in any way, please reach out.

1hq2k2f,I am completely overwhelmed.,"

Hey Reddit, 

I’m an ISO27001 security officer with 5 years of experience, and I could really use some advice. If it matters I have a bachelors in Business Analytics & IT. 

A while back, I was asked by a small company to implement the ISO standard, even though their processes were basically nonexistent and the company’s maturity was… let’s just say, far from ideal. 

I dove into the task, working tirelessly to raise the company’s maturity. I got things in motion, introducing minutes, staff meetings, and pushing the company to establish written processes. After a while, my efforts paid off and they actually promoted me to top-level management. Suddenly, I found myself managing HR, handling job applications, coaching management, and juggling four different projects—all on a four-day workweek. 

However, the promotion has taken a huge toll on me. I’m constantly stressed, can’t sleep, and every weekend I’m filled with dread about heading back to work. I’m terrified of losing my job and it feels like I’m risking my career by taking on too much. 

To make matters worse, my significant other recently went through a burnout and has been laid off from her job. We’ve planned and have been talking about getting married, having a honeymoon, and starting a family this year, but with her job search and the uncertainty about her ability to work more than a couple of days a week, things feel up in the air. 

Despite making more money than I ever have, I’ve never felt more pressure. I’m overwhelmed with the responsibility of providing and trying to fix everything. I feel like I’m drowning, and it’s all I can do to stay afloat. I’m constantly afraid I’ll be fired, and it’s causing me to procrastinate, avoiding my tasks because I’m scared of failing. 

I’m not happy, and I really don’t know what to do. I’m worried that someone will find out I’m struggling, and I don’t even know how I’d handle that at this point. I’m hoping to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar situation or has advice on how to deal with burnout, career stress, and just managing everything that feels out of control.

Thanks for listening.",Morlakhan,3,0.800000011920929,0,1735606344,2024-12-31 00:52:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hq2k2f/i_am_completely_overwhelmed/,12,2024

1hq1qg8,Is this a toxic workplace? What should I do?,"Is this a toxic workplace? And is there anything more that I can do to better the situation?

It’s been just about a month since I started at my new company (I’m in my mid 30s and have 9 years of experience in this industry/field). The team consists of my boss and a teammate (early 20s and has 2 years of experience). 

Ever since I joined, my teammate has been condescending towards me and undermines any ideas or suggestions I bring to the team. 
For example, while I was completing various online trainings for onboarding for my first week, they made a comment to my boss that I am taking too long and that I am not taking my work seriously. 

Now I have more tasks and projects specifically assigned to myself, but my teammate constantly barges in and asks for the progress of the project and even comments in the project’s group chat if others think I can complete the tasks. 

In terms of feedback, they would act like they already know everything and shuts down constructive feedback and even tells me that they are able to list 10 reasons that they are right, and their idea is the only best approach. All of their feedback towards my work is vague and critical, and even when I ask for clarification, it all comes down to, I don’t agree with you because I know I am right and you are wrong. 

I have raised these concerns to my boss multiple times (and HR). 
They told me that they have talked with my teammate and have asked to only communicate with me unless I reach out for help (which I don’t think is a healthy resolution).
Since then, they haven’t barged into my projects, but their general attitude towards me and the feedback/comments they provide has not changed. 

I don’t have much respect and trust for my boss either, who once told me (jokingly) to send a middle finger emoji to a member in another department when the response was not what we had hoped for (at the end it was a simple miscommunication which I immediately cleared up). 

On the other hand, everyone outside of my team (in the crossfunctional projects) is very supportive of my work and ideas. 

At this point, I am reluctant to share any of my projects/work or collaborate with my own team since they only lead to more confusion and frustration and becomes a roadblock in terms of timeline. 

I have tried talking with my teammate 1on1 but their attitude remained the same. 
I’ve talked to my boss and HR but they basically said they took care of it and to wait it out.
I wonder if there is anything else that I can do to better the situation or is it better for me to just leave?

1hpzr8p,Steve Jobs said it best - call people for what you want (even getting a job),"Video from a young Steve Jobs:  [https://youtu.be/ulnIMNeKQvs?si=efZX0h94wWofg5G9](https://youtu.be/ulnIMNeKQvs?si=efZX0h94wWofg5G9)

Instead of emailing or LI-messaging a recruiter... just send an email and then call the hiring manager. I know it sounds scary, but as someone who started in sales and then went on into executive (hiring manager) roles for the next 15 years... this absolutely works. I've gotten multiple tech, strategy, and sales roles throughout my career, by just calling up the Director or VP in charge of whatever group I want to work in. In fact, for one role, the Director even created a role for me bec ""I can't even get my own people to be this proactive"". 

  
If you are a lineman or have no unique value to offer an employer, then skip this advice. You are wasting the person's time. But if you have a specific skill set or experience that would be extremely valuable to the right employer, and you are friendly / direct with the person in charge of the group, you are actually doing that person a favor by introducing yourself! Expect to be on the phone for no more than 90 seconds, have your elevator pitch prepared, and **see if there's anything that you can do to help them** (not asking for a job). 

BTW - half the people on this sub are recruiters, who will tell you to never do this - bec you are cutting them out of the process. Take that for what it's worth. 

In order to do this, you'll have to -

* Find companies that you want to target (there are websites and sources that you can usually get access to through the library)
* Find hiring managers & contact information (websites such as Zoominfo will have this info, and usually allow free access if under a certain threshold)
* Get cell phone and other info - from the same websites
* Write a script and PRACTICE!

After that, just set aside 45 minutes a day and make some calls. It's expected for you to be nervous. But you don't need to be great at this, because no one else is doing it, so the bar is very low.

Just to be clear, you aren’t asking for a job… you are opening up a conversation about ways that you can help them. AKA a “networking call”

This details how this can work, including a script to use when calling the hiring manager:

1hpyo2o,What would you do? Start Up vs Corp. ,"So I am a 26 yr old, and have had one job since graduating college. It was labeled as a Graphic Designer, but turned into a Content/Marketing Strategist position with a lot of hats. I learned a lot and met a ton of people and realized I wanted to lean out of the graphic design aspect and focus more on the account management side.

I was unhappy and left my job after getting and accepting an offer for a corporate Content Operations Associate, 70k salary, hybrid, and the normal benefits (401k, Health, Etc). Based around Elderly Care.

Well before getting this job offer I had interviewed with a company back in April for a Strategist position; I didn't receive the job however he reached out to me about a position and felt I'd be great for it and it was a 2 month long interview process due to production and scheduling conflicts. Well he extended the offer today for a Brand Partnership Manager (Account Manager), 85k, full remote, and Health benefits, unsure about 401k as it is a start up and there's only 13 employees. Based around content creators and tech. 

I don't mind telling the one that I received a better offer but I'm also just concerned about the stability. I've always played on the safe side. The corporate job seems stable, the start up seems fun and exciting. 

I'm not sure which would look better on a resume as they are polar opposites. I am trying to tell myself that having big tech names on your resume is better than safe right now. Should I just take the higher paying option and roll with it?

1hpykm7,Counter offer not being honored ,"Back in late 2023, I received a new job offer & put my notice in. Upon doing so, I received a counter offer in writing from the head of our HR team with comparable compensation and a promise of a certain bonus percentage in 2023 as well as 2024. Come to the end of the year and they have reneged on the 2024 bonus amount, bumping me down to a lower percentage tier. 

For additional context, the new company offered me $115k annually. My current employer offered to match this but bumped my salary up in increments over 6 months. I agreed to the counter offer given that, with the bonus, I would theoretically make a similar amount to the new job at the end of the year but because they have changed their minds, I am effectively out about $10-15k of what I could have made taking the higher paying job in Sept, instead of waiting for the salary increases to take effect.

They also promised me 1:1 coaching for this new role, leadership opportunities & more. Despite me reaching out to ask how to achieve this multiple times, my bosses have declined to show up to meetings I’ve set or forgotten to follow up on their promises.  It’s been a frustrating year to say the least.

To add to this, I was promised to be increased in level by 2 levels. I signed a contract agreeing to this but 4 months later they reneged and claimed a mistake was made, moving me down a level and forcing me to sign another new contract.

I’ve brought this up to leadership countless times. I don’t understand why they’d fight so hard to keep me and just fully stop supporting me immediately after. I’m a solid employee but certainly have room to grow. I’ve asked for feedback countless times but was told all year I was doing an amazing job; in my performance review I was just told there were things I should have done differently without examples.

Obviously I need to get a new position but is there any recourse here? Or am I SOL from an untrustworthy leadership team?

1hpxez1,"Question regarding ATS, master’s degree w/o a bachelor’s","
I have been in the programming industry about five+ years on only an Associate’s degree. I am losing enjoyment in my work, and am looking at either changing positions internally in my company, externally, or finding something outside of tech. 

I notice my biggest barrier is my ‘lack of a bachelor’s degree.’ I’ve been pricing out the degree and the time it would take to finish… I’m looking at like 3.5 years and $65k. That’s a lot. 

While I was doing this, I ended up coming across an opportunity to complete a Master’s Degree in CS  (it is a performance based admissions which accepts applicants w/o a bachelor’s) at a reputable, accredited school for 1/2 the time and a fraction of the cost. 

My concerns in pursuing this are as follows:
- Would having a Master’s degree w/o a bachelor’s keep my applications from getting through ATS systems when applying to jobs, or would just listing the Master’s degree only on the resume negate this?
- Would having a Master’s degree w/o a bachelor’s be a detriment to me in applying/changing jobs in any way that I cannot think of at the moment? I would explain in the interview that I work at [insert big name company here] with the Associate's and entered in a MS program with performance based admissions due to my prior work experience and experience gained in insert big name company here], and successfully completed the program. I figured this is an OK strategy, but I don’t want to shoot myself in the foot…maybe someone can see a risk that I cannot.

1hpxcts,Lacking confidence.,"Anyone ever been there, you find a job that suits you, you manage to tick the majority of their requirements which is probably a wishlist to begin with, but there's still that stupid little voice telling you that you're under qualified/out of your lane.

Found a job that sounds incredible, based around a skill that is has been a lifelong strength of mine just because I've taken the time to develop it outside of work really well. I don't have as much professional experience in it as others might. It's an instructor role, I have the skill that I'd be teaching down but I don't have much formal teaching experience besides working as a support worker in a school for two years between degrees which was more drop-in counselling/impromptu lessons than traditional teaching with PowerPoints and a curriculum. 

I am in the process of writing all the documents but keep thinking why pick me over an established educator which might show in my application. I am assuming that a traditional profession like teaching is rigid and needs certain prerequisites, they don't ask for an education degree and they seem to give an opportunity to leverage things like a philosophy statement for mentorship which I can definitely speak about. I have excellent references but I need to get shortlisted first.

Has this been you at some point and what helped you overcome the doubt and feeling confident to apply.

1hpwxnk,Psychology or political science?,"Hiii, I am puzzled as to which major should I choose. I studied political science however took a year off because I became unsure whether that was something I wanted to pursue. I started attending psychology courses casually and saw myself passionate about them. However, whenever I talk about politics, my passion for politics also arises. I’m puzzled cause I would like to do something that I like and which can get me by financially. I researched and the main route after psychology is basically psychotherapy however, in the countries I researched (Netherlands and UK), it seems difficult to become a psychotherapist or a psychologist. I saw it’s often very expensive and long process before it actually becomes a job. However political science looks like a bit more broad degree with more options worldwide.

1hpwx6d,Job advice for a recent graduate that hasn't worked in a year?,"Hi guys. Was hoping to get some advice on here with my job search. So I recently graduated a 2-year college, and have been looking for jobs with my associates degree but have been having bad luck and I think I may know why. At my last job, I worked October to December 2024, and I quit without notice (which was a bad decision on my part) and I worry that it is affecting my ability to get a new job.
The reason I did this was due to a very toxic workplace and bullying, and genuinely could not take it anymore. I also needed to focus on school for a while as my classes were getting quite hard, so that's the reason l've been giving employers because I don't want to seem like I'm talking crap about my old job. I've recently been ghosted by 1 place and denied by another. I also had realized I made a mistake on my Indeed resume, and put January '24 instead of December '23, but recently corrected this and let an employer I interviewed for know so it doesn't come off as a lie when it was an honest mistake. I did stop working around the end of December though so I feel like it wasn't that big of a difference. Anyways, I digress.

1hpw5hi,should i proceed to med school after earning my nursing degree?,"hi, I’m currently a first-year nursing student, and this thought has been lingering in my mind for quite some time now. before anything else, dentistry was actually my first choice because I thought it would be beneficial for me. it’s a flexible career, doesn’t take long to become a doctor, and I wouldn’t necessarily have to interact with a lot of people all at once. however, I opted to take nursing instead after weighing my options (though I basically had no choice).

as soon as I entered the course, I realized how difficult it would be for me because I have to communicate and socialize with people constantly, which is literally my weakest point since I’m an introvert. that’s why I decided to give up on the idea of becoming a doctor, as I know it would take years, and I’m not that patient you see.

don’t get me wrong—I can handle the course, and I know I’m capable of achieving much more. that’s why I feel it would be a waste if I didn’t use my skills and abilities to do more for myself and for others. 

I just wish to take a path that I will not regret after earning my nursing degree. like do I have to study next? work? do volunteer works? 

what do you suggest I do?

1hpvpz4,I’m 22 should I go back to school and change my degree?,"I am a 22 year old female. I am married. We have a house but are hoping to eventually build. We also want kids eventually. I just graduated with an accounting degree, and have been working as an accountant for almost 2 years. I just got my raise for the year and I am making 50,000. I was expecting more of a raise since I know I could start with a higher salary somewhere else. When I started college I wanted to be an ultrasound tech, but during the process I missed one class so I couldn’t start the program for another year and ended up switching majors. I would love to be a stay at home mom one day, but if I work I want to do something I like and can make good money at. I always thought I would like to be an ultrasound tech and I don’t enjoy being an accountant. I know it’s just a job and I probably won’t love whatever I do, but I don’t know if I will regret not going back and doing something that I could love. I know I can make better money in accounting but you can in ultrasounds too. 

Would you recommend going back and trying to do what you think you could love or sticking it out in accounting since you’ve come this far? Should I look for another accounting job instead of switching completely?

I also haven’t taken an anatomy class in a long time and I’m afraid it will be a lot harder than last time.

1hpuz9v,"Looking to make ""stupid"" money while maintaining a life, could use some guidance.","Hey,

I have a very simple goal for my career. I would like to make as much money as I possibly can while not losing myself to my career like I see so many of the executives/higher up ICs I work with do. I enjoy my health, free time, and lack of messy divorces and would like to keep it that way. 

For background, I'm 28 and I currently make about $125k. Right now I work in data/business analytics (senior level IC, 1\~ year from management) in the financial services industry. I have an associates degree and no formal certificates, and frankly very little interest in pursuing either much further. What I do have though is the ability to sell myself and open up opportunities for myself. I mostly do this through mirroring the people above me and figuring out what they need/want. (I also have hard technical skills in data analytics, data engineering, and programming)

I've climbed up to here from being a teller as recently as 2020 and I'm finally coming to a fork in the road. Actually a few forks. And I want to know either which one is the best, or which one(s) am I missing. Here's what I've got:

* Continue in BI/BA path, get to management in 6 months to 1.5 years ($150k), get to director after 3-4 years ($225k), then CDO/CIO after 5-7 years ($275k+). Super boring, this is essentially the ""default"" path I'm pursuing, it's not bad but I'm not particularly excited by it. I also wonder if there's more money to be made sooner elsewhere. This would be all within financial services btw.
* Move into sales, I work for a company where this could potentially work, unsure of long-term details though I always hear sales guys can absolutely rake it in. A bit of a scary jump, though the flexibility of these types of roles seems fun. Hours and stress load may be a bit much though.
* Move into product, I have experience managing products, doing marketing, etc. and the field excites me. The company I work for could also likely accommodate this. The goal here would be to move into a CPO role, then eventually a COO role if I feel I can balance it. This would also be all within financial services.

I'm open to jumping into a different field or career path entirely too, again, the goal is to make ""stupid"" money while still having a life. Any recommendations or advice you guys have is much appreciated. 

What do you guys think?

Oh, and by the way, I know how fortunate I am and how grateful I should be for being in such a position. I didn't think I'd ever make it this far in life so I'm just running this thing out as far as I can take it.",iPodModder,0,0.4000000059604645,0,1735586260,2024-12-30 19:17:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hpuz9v/looking_to_make_stupid_money_while_maintaining_a/,12,2024
1hpuy7i,"Struggling with mental health in space industry, considering dropping out of industry or another big change, open to advice","I'm a mechanical engineer in the space industry and I have been working in this industry my entire full time career for 10 years now. I'm currently working at Blue Origin. I'm seriously struggling with mental health concerns and I don't know what is best for me to do. I'll provide some context on my situation (good and bad), what I've done to help myself, and what options I've considered.


First of all, the pros. My work is incredibly interesting, I work on the next lunar lander. I have some really interesting challenges to conquer in my role from an engineering standpoint. I started my career in design and now have responsibilities to delegate to others and make interdisciplinary decisions. I get to fly out to Seattle 3-4 times a years, sometimes to do walkthrough assessments with a lunar lander mockup. My manager is incredibly responsible with understanding mental health concerns. My team is hard working and respectful. I'm trusted to figure out my entire work schedule on my own and I have a lot of autonomy. The pay is amazing. My company (thanks to the BRG's) now also has extended coverage for IVF which I am now considering for myself because of issues with egg production (see below). I am now at the age threshold where getting pregnant becomes harder (I would like to have 1 kid via pregnancy for context).

The cons. Our leadership has been making incredibly stressful choices and it looks like it is trending worse. About a month or so ago our CEO put out a required work from work policy and also said all contractors will be dropped at the end of the year. I'm losing 3 core engineering functions. I haven't been given replacements for those roles and there are even other engineers roles that I haven't had supporting me yet the entire time I've been working in this role. Our team is perpetually understaffed and there is what sounds like confirmed rumors of layoffs coming in the next year. My team literally has no bad contributors, we're all so good at our jobs and kind and respectful, and there is no fat to trim. There are also rumors that schedule will be further tightened to impress the upcoming administration (given that Musk is holding hands with Trump rn it already puts Bezos's panties in a bind). There are many reasons that overworking to meet impossible deadlines are not something I support but doing so to impress Trump is probably at the bottom of my list.

My personal experience. I have experienced a lot of setbacks in my career, first with extreme sexism at my first company (an old boys club vibe) as well as other isms, and being held back in my career. I worked at the same level for the first 7 years of my career, during all of my first job and part of my second (asking for a promotion at both, getting laughed out the office at my first company, getting it at the second). I have been ""put in my place"" for stepping up as a leader and told to take a back seat. My last job (2nd company) had more a start up vibe and experienced layoffs while I was there. I went from happy to miserable basically overnight, losing all my close friends as coworkers slowly (from layoffs or leaving), even bringing my closest friend to the hospital after attempting suicide after being laid off. When I started in my current role, I struggled with extreme burnout from continuing in that role until I found another job (it took 6 months to find a job after the layoffs). My burnout from my depression was so bad that I couldn't form full sentences. I feared that I was going to be fired constantly. I worked incredibly hard on myself, it took almost a year while working full time for me to feel actually like myself. Efforts include: personal therapy, couple therapy with my partner, getting ADHD and depression meds, getting an ADHD coach, journaling a fuck ton, talking with loved ones regularly, working at being kinder to myself, reading and listening to podcasts on psychology and trauma, taking more breaks and started napping mid day, getting acupuncture, and working on moving more. I feel like it took so long to get to some kind of normal again, but the recent discouraging situations (in cons above) are kicking my ass mentally and I feel like I'm going back to the same struggles. Another thing I want to mention, I stopped getting my period because of stress starting at my last job, and I didn't have it for 6 months. I went to the OBGYN, was given progesterone, got it back once, and didn't have it again for another 6 months. Part of the longness is due to struggling company stripping back benefits and I stopped having access to my ADHD medication. I was eventually sent by my OBGYN to an endocrinologist and then fertility center. I had 4 ultrasounds and had bubbles blown through my ovaries. My organs were all healthy. The results were inconclusive which basically means that it is almost definitely stress related. Good that my organs are all healthy, but in a panicked state my uterus doesn't build a wall and my egg count was low because my body thinks it's not a safe time to reproduce.

I honestly am struggling with what to do. I can continue to work at my job and accept the difficulties that come with it (expecting it to improve doesn't feel smart to me). Or I can consider other options. I can quit and just have time to myself for a while. I have an emergency fund, but then I lose access to healthcare and all the medical support systems I have built. I have considerer leaving the industry all together, just thinking that I am personally unable to handle the level of stress within this industry any longer. For this option I'm considering management roles within industries outside of space. I have looked into other options too, from working for non-profits to going to trade school. It sounds crazy but in my brain right now a lot of those sound like much better options than what I'm currently handling.

1hpumhl,"Career advice - Burnout, University, a bit of ranting and other adventures","Hi Everyone,

I'm writing this post because I need some suggestions. I'm dealing with an unpleasant situation, and I'm unsure of what to do.

I'm 27, I live in Italy, and I currently work in Facility Management for one of the biggest companies in the field. I'm in a decent spot career-wise. I manage two sites with a team of three people who directly report to me; I received two prizes for the performance I had this year, I have a pretty good salary compared to the Italian average for people my age, and a company car.

So things are going great, except they aren't.

For a couple of months, I've been going through something that I would say it's burnout. I find myself more and more unmotivated to keep on going.

This is due to multiple reasons:

* I do not like the field I'm working in. I have no interest in FM. I've accepted this role just because of the economic conditions that were offered to me and because I thought it would be a great opportunity for growth. Before, I was working for the same company but not in the core operation work-stream.
* Organization: there is no structure in my account. I'm a ""junior"" in a ""senior"" position, with no one I can refer to for help and suggestions on how to do some of the activities where I might naturally struggle. I really love to work in dynamic and ambiguous environments because I think they create great learning opportunities, which are fundamental at my age. But dynamic and ambiguous shouldn't be excuses to be unstructured.
* I work a lot of hours. I work even when I'm on vacation, and I don't do it with pleasure. I honestly wouldn't even mind doing it for a job in a field I'm interested in, but check the first bullet point. And I don't work for the prizes. I do it because otherwise, I would never be able to complete all the activities I **have to** complete. When I say ""have to"", I mean statutory activities which must, by definition, be completed.
* I'm studying towards completing my degree. I studied Electronic Engineering for two years, but due to an unfortunate life/family situation, I had to drop it. I'm now studying towards my BSc in Artificial Intelligence, and I love it. But this work situation doesn't allow me to study as much as I would love to. There is no time for deliberate practice and depth, which are essential.

Meanwhile, I'm trying to switch careers. I'm trying to transition towards program or project management, but I'm finding it hard to find a position that doesn't require a degree or 5+ years of experience. I feel like I have the core skill set required to be a good candidate for this new career path, but clearly, I would also need some training, being a new position for me. However, companies naturally tend to prefer candidates with previous experience. And just to further explain my situation, I'm applying for roles throughout all of Europe since I'm not necessarily tied to my country.

Just one last thing. I can't stop working and concentrate on my studies. Otherwise, I would love to do it. And at the same time, I also think I can't push through with my current job till the end of my degree.

What would you do?

To everyone who has managed to read this far, I really appreciate it.

I welcome any suggestions or criticism, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.",__Uncertainty__,1,1.0,0,1735585350,2024-12-30 19:02:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hpumhl/career_advice_burnout_university_a_bit_of_ranting/,12,2024
1hpuck1,CS Master’s vs. Law School: Which Path for Financial Stability and Work-Life Balance?,"Hi,
I’m a junior studying Computer Science and Human Rights at a T30 LAC. I have a good gpa (3.85), but I’m struggling to land a decent software engineering internship. I’ve applied to over 100 positions, and while I only got interviews at Amazon and Two Sigma, I wasn’t well-prepared and have been rejected/ haven’t  back from other companies.

My school has a partnership with an Ivy League school for a 4+1 master’s in CS, and I’m considering pursuing it to make myself more competitive in the job market + hopefully find an internship for next summer since I’m struggling this year. The program is T15, and I am hoping it could help bridge the gap between where I am and where I need to be for FAANG-level roles.

At the same time, I’ve also been thinking about law school. I’ve always valued advocacy and justice, but to be honest, financial stability and long-term wealth potential are my biggest priorities. I grew up in a financially unstable household, so a career that offers both security and good work-life balance is incredibly important to me.

Here’s how I’m thinking about my options:
	•	Software Engineering:
Faster path to financial independence, but I’m worried about there not being enough SWE jobs or not breaking into big tech because I haven’t already (I’ve had a lot of struggles during undergrad so I feel like I wasted my time too)
	•	Law School: I’d likely specialize in tech law or intellectual property law, which seems like a good fit. I love arguing and law. Big law salaries are attractive, but the, long hours, and 3 more years of school scare me.

One important thing: I’m incredibly grateful that my family is willing to pay for either the 4+1 CS master’s or law school. This means I won’t graduate with any debt, which gives me some flexibility but also makes me want to make the most of this opportunity.

For context: I have some solid programming skills and projects under my belt, but I need to improve my interview prep. I’m worried that if I don’t land an SE internship before senior year, it’ll be tough to start my career. On the other hand, I don’t want to commit to law school unless I’m sure it’s the right path.

What do you think? Should I double down on software engineering, pursue the 4+1 master’s, and give it my all to land a good internship/job? Or does law school sound like a better long-term option given my goals?

Any advice, personal experiences, or insights would be greatly appreciated!

1hpu7zb,Should I quit? ,"I (19f) have worked as a server at a popular restaurant chain for about a year. It’s my first job, so when conflicts have occurred, I’ve overlooked them. On Saturday (12/28) I was working a double, and during my afternoon shift I felt very sluggish, had trouble breathing and felt super sick. I got another server, let’s call her Mia, to pick up my shift for Sunday and Monday (12/29, 12/30). My manager Greg wouldn’t approve of my shift change at first because he said Mia wasn’t as good of a server as I was, but ended up approving it for Sunday anyway. 

On sunday I contacted other coworkers to cover my shift since Greg had said Mia wasn’t a good server to cover my shift. However, no one else was willing to fill my shift, and I let him know that. 

This morning, (Monday) I noticed he approved Mia to pick up another servers shift today instead of mine, so I called my restaurant and once again let him know I was sick and couldn’t go in. I have a fever, I’m coughing, I’m aching, I’m not going in. He said since I don’t have coverage, I would have to get a dr note to miss my  shift or I would get written up. (Mia had said before she’d cover for me bc I was sick) 

I’m upset because I did have my shift picked up by Mia, and he just wouldn’t approve it bc he doesn’t want her to work my usual section because she’s “not good enough.” And he approved it for another server, who isn’t sick. I know it’s standard procedure to have to get a dr note if you didn’t have coverage but I would have to get one if he had initially approved Mia to pick up my shift. I feel that he’d rather me come in and work sick than Mia work my section healthy. None of the clinics in my area take my insurance either, so this is expensive. Is my anger justified? Should I quit?

First option is to join in energy engineering bachelor then go to Germany and make a masters in renewables then work there in Germany for like 5 to 10 years for some international experience then come back to Saudi Arabia its problem is although the demand will be extremely high, because of the future projects in Ksa, the salaries might be lower than CS or Med
Second option is computer science then masters in AI OR ML From the UK and then come back to Saudi Arabia the problem in this one is the high risk of oversaturation
Third option is try my luck for med school next year and if it doesn’t work, I will change next year to either energy engineering or computer science

1hpt5d0,Outdoor Instructor Or Marketing?,"Hey! First post ever here. I'm 25 and work as an outdoor instructor. I love my job. But I'm going to turn 26 soon and will need health insurance. I have a good degree from a good college and when I graduated worked at marketing startups. After getting laid off, I struggled to get back into the industry, so took an outdoor job again - I've been working there for a year now.

I can either stay living in the city where all my friends are and take a marketing job, or move up to a small mountain town where the money and work is more consistent.

Cons that I know from living in a mountain for a year is the high turnover can make it hard to make a strong community (which is so so so important to me) and honestly the alcoholism and drug use up there can be insane, and I think it's foolish to think anyone is immune to that, as well as never being home for holidays and the eventual toll it takes on the body. Possible burnout on the sports I love as well. Cons for marketing is that I have anxiety - being inside staring at a computer all day makes me a hell of a lot more anxious than rock climbing or skiing does. Something about the fresh air. 

  
I know that there might be a middle ground, a job where I can do some marketing and some outdoors things, but I feel that at this point, I probably need to take any marketing job and try and work my way toward that. I would need to build marketing skills rather than outdoor ones. 

  
I've been tossing this around for three years now. I've tried applied to thousands of jobs that feel like a middle ground to me - they all want more marketing experience. I've leveraged every connection I have - super small things seem to keep blocking me from these jobs. Basically, anyone who's been at an impasse like this before - the job you love vs the one that will support you better long term and possibly lead to a better long term position that I love even more, let me know what you think. I just want to be happy with what I do, you know. Time to buckle down and make moves for it, but I don't know what direction to move.

1hpsm54,Stay in Sales or get back into Cybersecurity: What would you do in my position?,"Hey everyone,

As the title states, I’ve been in Sales for 4.5 years now and work for a well known property and casualty insurance agency. I’m on track for about $70k this year and the only upward mobility I can expect in this company is attempting to open my own agency. This comes with its own set of risks as I’d have to take our considerable loans to potentially fail or succeed. So, I’ve been contemplating another option.

I did cybersecurity in the military for 6 years and got out about 4 years ago. I know the civilian side is lucrative but, frankly, I wanted a break from it. There’s a program through an online college that will be me my basic certs for free and I’m considering the move. Commission-based income has become tiring and I’d like to remove the stressors of not knowing how much I’ll make each month.

Do you believe it’s worth the move to cybersecurity or should I take my chances opening an agency?

Thanks!

1hpskpi,"useless undergrad, considering finance or healthcare, which would provide a better life?","Hi - posting this as I’m lost on I want to pursue in life. I received a “useless” bachelors degree a year and a half ago with the plan of going to grad school in the healthcare field. After working in the field since graduation, I’ve become more & more uninterested in healthcare and despise the idea of going terribly into debt for a poor return on investment (the degree I was originally hoping to pursue averages $130k/yr with schooling costing over that). 

I’ve been wracking my brain on what to do next. I’ve entertained going to nursing school for an accelerated bachelors with the eventual goal of going to CRNA school. Knowing this would be an extremely competitive and long route I’m hesitant as I don’t think I would be happy as an RN. I’ve also entertained the idea of a masters of science in Finance as I’m quite analytical and good with problem solving. The idea of less schooling overall with potential for growth (with hard work of course) is attractive. I’m just scared of possible job volatility in comparison to healthcare which has set  salaries. I love helping people but I’ve found the general public to make me very angry lol. Working with people in healthcare has been draining for me so far but the stability is hard to beat.

I don’t need to be “rich” but I want a comfortable life where I can afford the occasional vacation, never be tight on money, and set up a good life for my children. 

Any advice from those in either field on what route could potentially provide a better lifestyle? I know this is an individualized question but I need to make a decision soon and want to weigh my options thoroughly.

1hps1yl,Chewed out over granted day off,"I work for a small company that has been growing and making a lot of changes for the last year. Some of them are good and necessary and totally understandable but other changes are really making me feel negative about my job. 

The motto used to be that there were no office hours as long as the work gets done. Now we have office hours and official paid holidays. Normal, not a big deal. We are supposedly growing and hiring new employees so we needed a bigger office. The new office is a lot further away for most of us but it is directly across the street from the owner's neighborhood where the HR person also lives. It's in a renovated house which is still under construction and my desk has been placed smack dab in the middle of the living room with my back to the door and no other way to arrange it. They keep saying they are going to knock down a wall so they can move my desk and not have my back to the door but it hasn't happened yet. I honestly think they chose this location so that the HR lady can easily drive by and see if we are here and so that the owner is closer to the office. 

By the way, most of our employees work from home and do not live in the city where our office is. In the office is myself and two other people who are here Monday- Friday. The owner and 2 other people who work in the office do not keep office hours, they come and go as they please.

The HR department is also new- never had that before. The ""HR lady"" is the boss's kid's former math tutor. She has no HR experience and no real job experience. She is a wealthy SAHM and comes from a wealthy family. She's super out of touch and constantly talks about her husband's job and how \*they\* do things. Her running joke is that she doesn't actually work for us and that we don't actually have an HR department. And it's true- every time I need to call her, she will answer and tell me she's playing golf, about to lay down for her massage, walking into the gym, etc. 

So, now for the issue bothering me so much- HR sent out an email reminding us of the company holiday hours. We were off on the 24th and the 25th, to return on the 26th. The boss/owner of the company told us on Monday the 23rd that we could take off an extra day and didn't have to come back until the 27th. He did tell us not to tell HR, that he would handle it. 

Then, on the 26th, he sent us a long and SCATHING email with HR and the other owner CC'd about how he made it very clear that we were to return to the office on the 26th, that everyone else in the company is working, and ends by saying that from now on, the 3 of us are to clock in and out by emailing him every day when we arrive and when we leave. The 3 of us responded by reminding him that he told us we could take off on the 26th. He responded by saying he didn't remember saying that but that he must have- and he did not CC HR or the other owner on that email.  

He also said that he was IN the office and that's how he knew we weren't there- which I do not believe is true. He is very messy and tends to leave lights on and dishes in the sink (I'm constantly cleaning up after him) but when I returned that Friday, everything was exactly as I had left it, pristine. His calendar shows him being out of the state from the 23rd to the 6th. He wasn't here on Friday and he's not here today, Monday. I believe what happened is that the HR lady drove by to check to see if we were here, saw we weren't, messaged him and let him know, and expected him to do something about it. He didn't want to tell her that he gave us the extra day off, so he made up a story to save face and pretend he ""forgot"".

This is not the first time something like this has happened, either. Our system of ""requesting off"" is a form we leave on HR's desk, then putting our days off on the shared team calendar. He is constantly ""forgetting"" to check the calendar, will see someone is not here, and sends them a text or an email chewing them out for not being here.

And the kicker is, I am pretty sure I am being underpaid and raises have been less and less frequent. When I landed this job, I did not have a ton of experience in this field. I was made assurances that they would help me get more licensures/certifications. That hasn't happened. And without them, I am not sure if I have a lot of options to stay in this field and go somewhere else, even though I am very knowledgeable and skilled at what I do. I'm also 42 years old and just kind of scared to change jobs at this point. Plus, I keep hearing about how bad that job market is. The grass is always greener on the other side and I'm just not sure what to do.",OrdinarySubstance491,9,1.0,9,1735578831,2024-12-30 17:13:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hps1yl/chewed_out_over_granted_day_off/,12,2024

1hprovq,Software developer to Director role? Is it worth it? ,"I’m looking for advice from those who transitioned from an individual contributor (IC) role to a managerial position.

I’ve been an IC for 5 years at a small company (<100 people), which has since grown to around 200 employees. We started with 3 developers, and now we have 6 developers, 3 QAs, and a DBA. I love my job (remote, low stress, flexible), but the company is disorganized. The project manager lacks dev experience, and the CTO agrees with my assessment.

I recently discussed transitioning to a W2 position with the CTO, primarily for stability as I start a family. He was enthusiastic and asked me what I wanted to do. After thinking it over, I’m considering proposing myself for Director of Software Development. Currently, there’s no middle management between the devs and the CTO, and every other division has a director.

My question: Am I in over my head? Would a management role add too much work/stress? I think I could fix the communication issues that are impacting developer efficiency, but I’d be stepping away from coding. The company is expanding and merging, so things are likely to get more chaotic without someone organizing them, and I feel confident I have the skills to handle it.

I have a good relationship with everyone at the company and know the politics, but I’m not sure if it’s worth the shift.

1hprg6o,Hating Life Behind a Desk,"Hello! I have been struggling with my job choice recently, and wanted to solicit advice from you fine people. I am 22 years old, and currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Advertising with only a year left to go. I currently live with my partner, and work a 9-5 desk job as a procurement specialist. I found myself beginning desk work a couple of years ago, as at the time I was desperate for any full-time job I could find. 
I make very good money for my age, and live very comfortably. However, my job has taken a huge toll on my mental and physical health, and I wonder if the money is worth it. I have come to the realization that sitting behind a desk all day under fluorescent lights is something that I cannot do long term, as my depression is the worst it’s ever been. 
I recently got promoted to my current position, but due to a lack of staffing the organization I work for is having me do both my old job and my new job at the same time, with no promises of hiring any time soon. This has made me feel a little bit disrespected and very burnt out. I am also the youngest person in the company by a margin of 10 years, and do not feel connected to any of my coworkers. 
I am emotional, and so I do not always trust my own judgement. I also do not know how to navigate to a different career path from this one. I have also decided I do not want to go into advertising, but I am completing my degree to at least have a bachelors for my resumes. I feel stuck, and afraid that I won’t be able to escape the type of job that I am working. Is it irresponsible to think of leaving a position that pays so well? Is it normal that my organization is having me essentially work two jobs? If you have experience with career shifts, how difficult is it to break into a new industry?

1hpraqc,"Planned a holiday/leave, now i receive an official warning for not working during my leave/holiday.","So im working for one of the top 3 banks in my country. I scheduled a holiday/leave for the christmas/new year. 

Right after the request my teamlead told me orally that there is a list of case files which need to be reviewed before the end of the year and my leave/holiday was dependend on finishing these reviews. Some of the reviews however are partially done by another department and pending their (partial) review i cant work on it/finish it. 
The issue was raised by me and several other collegues that we foresee the other department finishing their part very late, giving us/me no time to review and finish the case and thus can't go on holiday, which doesnt seem fair. We were told not to worry about that, as long as it is out of our/my control it doesnt affect me. 

My leave started thursday and i received 3 cases on my very last day at approximately 12.00, 14.30 and 16.45 back from other departements. My teamlead informed me, you must finish them. 

I did make a review in regards to 2 of the 3 last minute cases and told my teamleider i would try what i could over the weekend in regards to the last (fridays are also weekend). I checked in late in the afternoon, because I had already some personal appointments in the morning 

My teamlead send an email on friday saying the 2 reviews i handed over needed some rework. The email had all kinds of factually incorrect things, with her manager CC'ed. The email had a very bad tone of voice and a threat that if i did not work the oncoming tuesday they will cancel the remainder of my scheduled holiday.

 I contacted the manager ánd HR about this email.  

HR informed me, if your leave/holiday is approved in our hr system (which it is) then you can't be forced to work (this is also a national law). HR adviced if other still present colleagues could finish these reviews, that I should tell my Teamlead to hand the cases over.

The manager (boss of my teamlead) asked me politely to finish what I can, and because I feel obliged to work, feel a bit threatened and I try to prevent any conflict i did log in mondays (amd a lil bit in the weekend) 

On monday, my teamlead has to approve the cases, and she herself was not there on monday, but was on leave/holiday for that day. I left her a chat in teams saying i put 1 case back to her, the adjustments she required on the other i wasnt able to do in the timeframe she required. The day after she disapproved the reviews (again) saying they contained small grammatical/spelling mistakes. 

I received an email about this 24th at 16.58, in that same email my TL informed me she expected me to work the 27th to finish my reviews, and correct the grammar/spelling mistakes, after I told her I'm on leave and that i could not finish them in the time given due to personal circumstances. I also suggested to ask another collegae who isnt on leave/holoday. 

My teamlead told me she was not going to hand over the cases and that she expects me to finish the reviews by 27th at 17.00. 

It was a bit radio silence after that and to be honest i did not want to work anymore, also considering i did not get any written reassurance i would get my leave days/holidays back. Furthermore colleagues from other teams but in the same position did not have to work while on leave(and did not receive an official reprimand).

Today my TL informed me I would be getting an official warning for declining to work (while on leave). 

Furthermore colleagues from other teams but in the same function/ position did not have to work while on leave/did not receive an official reprimand.

I do plan to fight this reprimand with HR to cancel the reprimand and I've also send out applications to other jobs. Because this feels a bit like a toxic work environment. But im not thrilled about the situation and am looking to hear what your opinion is and what you would have done/if i am in the wrong.

Tl;DR: boss asked me to work in my planned and approved leave, I worked (unlike others) but still get a reprimand.

1hpqmw0,Should I take the risk of quitting my job ?,"To start off, I am a recent graduate (23M) from India. I graduated from one of the top engineering schools in India, IIT Madras. I did my bachelors in Chemistry, and have an average GPA, I would genuinely consider it poor. I was never interested in Chemistry, and never really felt good through my degree. I was not even motivated to look for a masters degree back then during my last semesters.

I anyhow, tried to learn some coding, and got my job offer in an Airlines in India. I genuinely worked hard to learn some coding, and I enjoy my job very much now. My workplace is very friendly, I have very good people who work around me, I honestly enjoy going to the office daily. I also get very good travel benefits, and my salary is currently good enough, thanks to my degree from IITs. But my company gives very less hikes, and I think I can land a better job if I try hard. Also I am not very much interested to stay in India. I have lived outside for quite some time, and always wanted to move out. I work mostly with data and cloud in my department.

Now I am not very sure of what I should be doing, I would love to move out to one of the more developed asian countries, like HK or Singapore, I am mainly interested in asian countries but am considering options from western countries as well. I am not very rich, and cannot afford a 100k USD masters programme, and this makes me think twice.

The options I have are:

1. Stay in the same company for another few years ( I have just been in this company for 6 months, I am a 2024 grad.). The only two problems I have is my desire to move out and the lesser hikes and economic growth.
2. Move out for masters - I cannot afford most of the masters programmes as they are expensive for me and my family. Also, I would have to risk my job for this, it is considered to be a very good one by the society here.
3. Try to find a job outside - Genuinely, I find it very hard to find visa sponsorships, I am searching actively for good options but I think I have very less experience and the market condition is not the best right now for me to find good options. But anyhow, I am looking for government programmes and all that attracts young engineers from India to other countries.
4. To pursue an online masters in CSE while staying in the job - Do you all think this well help, for landing a better job later ? The advantage is that I have very less risk in doing this, I wont lose my job and could help my family economically. Eventually look for a better job and move out.

People have been warning me about the risk of losing my current job. But I think these are the years for me to explore options and take risks before settling down. 

What could be the options other than this which yall think are worth taking a try ? Also can anyone provide me any sort of leads to any of these ? As experienced individuals, I think all of your opinions would be helpful. I think many would hate me for trying to migrate to another country and all, but I just genuinely want to help my parents economically and retire them soon. 

Thanks for reading this post, I genuinely appreciate all of your efforts and wish you a great day, and a great year ahead. You all motivate me to become a better human. Happy new year !!

1hpq54i,Please correct my way of thinking? ,"Hey guys,

This may be a bit of a long post, so please bear with me. 

1. I began my education journey with a BSc in Food and Nutrition Science. During my final study year, I discovered my passion for all things food-technology. Think hydroponics, precision agriculture, etc. 

2. After my Bachelors, I worked for a year in a hydroponics company. I also interned at a saline agricultural research facility in that same year, which further solidified my food-tech passion. I simply loved it. 

3. Now, Masters. Majority of my classmates chose to become dietitians or pursue a Masters in Food Science (the typical pathways). By pure chance, I got the opportunity to complete a Masters in Computer Science (wherein I learned Data Science, AI, computers and so on). Despite the glut of graduates in tech, I loved my time and enjoyed the knowledge. 

4. Currently, I’m working as a remote data analyst, and I like what I’m doing. Hopefully, I aim to master AI, as that’s a tech-domain I’m very passionate about. 

My future career plan: Although I like tech, I don’t want to spend the rest of my life working in tech. That’s not my intention at all. I want to work in the tech sector for some years, to gain experience and knowledge. After that, I want to transition to the food-security field through a PhD. It would be awesome and life-changing to conduct research in a food-tech area I’m interested in, and devote my life to food-tech in any capacity I’m allowed (research or industry). 

My query: Am I correct in my way of thinking ? What would you do if you were in my situation? 

Any advice, insights, and solutions are greatly welcomed by me. Thank you very much for your patience, in advance. ",Sudden-Confection934,2,1.0,2,1735573915,2024-12-30 15:51:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hpq54i/please_correct_my_way_of_thinking/,12,2024

1hpmdef,Got my dream job and rejected it to prioritise stability <\3,"Almost 2 years ago I left my home country   (non EU) and a great career as I got a job offer in Germany and I had always wanted to experience. After 6 months of being in Germany I got laid off and I felt my world was crashing… but managed to get a 1 year contract super fast in a well known company with great salary. Let’s call it company Z.

During this year I felt disappointed as the company and role was not as exciting as I thought, and not many jobs opening for me to apply (I can’t speak German good enough to work so this limits opportunities).

I started applying to jobs and found one in company Z as a colleague quit because she was bored and although she had good salary she preferred to travel the world. I was hesitant to apply as I was feeling bored already and her experience was similar, but I had nothing else and benefits were better. I got the role as permanent and I was happy. 

In parallel I had applied to company X which is in a sector I really love as i worked before on it and that’s my passion. Overall benefits were similar as company Z but they require me to move to another EU country, I thought I didn’t have to leave Germany when I applied… job was in English and multiple opportunities in English as well in comparison to company Z.

I was analysing and getting so anxious and stressed about what to do. Scared of restarting in a new country after struggling 2 years in Germany and finally got into the stable moment I wanted: permanent role and good benefits. I believe I deserve to enjoy this… going to company X would have meant to restart, although very close to where I leave in Germany (2 hours train away) it still meant a new country, having to hand over all my German docs and rejecting the chance of applying for permanent residence in Germany in 1 year. I didn’t come for residency of citizenship but at this point I started to question myself if I should continue investing my time in Germany for that… in the other country it would have taken longer to get the permanent residency and worse citizenship. My end goal is to move to Spain in ~5 years. 

So with a lot of fear of the unknown and leaving the comfort I had just earned in Germany I rejected company X. I spent days crying and not sleeping before making this choice, but I know I made it out of fear of failure… being laid off I believe it really scared me and my partner was supportive on my decision but also clear that he preferred not to leave Germany (we would have had to split life between countries, he in Germany and me in the other) I felt I needed his encouragement to make the move, he telling me: “come on, you can do it, take it! Don’t be scared!” But it didn’t happen. We both were just worried on how to work things out but saying that we will see how to get back to be in same city.

Was I wrong? Was I right? I believe both were good offers, I’m just afraid of how long it’ll take me to get a job like the one of company X in Germany :( I’m sad but trying to focus on the stability I prioritised but still mixed feelings remain on me…I know that a more confident version of myself would’ve taken the job, I was just afraid to restart and fail especially after not having enjoyed stability since I left my home country.

Thanks for reading and happy new year! ",rsasanch,3,0.6700000166893005,3,1735562305,2024-12-30 12:38:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hpmdef/got_my_dream_job_and_rejected_it_to_prioritise/,12,2024

I am currently working at a product-based company(Mumbai, India), handling QA, sales, and support operations. I want to move on as things are quite messy here for me. I am uncertain whether to prepare for SDE or Solutions Engineer (definitely not QA).

To share a bit about myself so you can gain insight into my background and advise me better:

1. I have 3 years of QA experience, and for the past year, I have been handling the Pre-sales & Support team as well.
2. Programming Languages - I know JS, Python, and Go. I would rate myself 5-6 out of 10 since I haven't worked much in my roles; I mostly keep my skills sharp by doing some projects.
3. I am also entering the world of networking by following Hussein Nasser's [Network Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQUBSgBXilKhRMJ1ACqr7pTr) playlist.

1hpk53m,What should I do next,"
I (17M) recently received a medical discharge from the United States Army. This left me feeling disheartened, as anyone would after experiencing failure.
I returned home to the support of my wonderful family and a loving relationship. Despite graduating high school early, I never obtained a driver's license, as it requires driver's education in my state.

I've been struggling to adjust to civilian life after only six months away and though I've only been home one week. To make matters worse, my family unexpectedly announced their plans to move across the country.

I'm actively seeking solutions. I've already began looking into driver's education classes and applied to local technical colleges. My goal is to attend college in my area once I've achieved financial stability. My family supports my desire for independence, as I've been self-sufficient for nearly a year.

A relative suggested I explore electrician work through the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW).
Since returning home, I've been overwhelmed by conflicting advice. I understand the need to make my own decisions, but the constant pressure is exhausting. I'm unsure of my next steps.
My primary goal is to find employment and secure housing within the next two months. I'm determined to be independent and refuse to rely on others for transportation. 

Essentially, I'm seeking guidance on what to prioritize. My family is incredibly supportive and willing to house me during my studies, but I'm hesitant to burden them.
While many advise me to relax and enjoy my youth, I'm driven by a fear of becoming stagnant like some of my older coworkers who lack goals and live with their parents. I believe this fear is valid.
I'm eager to hear your thoughts and any advice you may have.

Would greatly appreciate some advice here. 24(M)

i’m 2.5 years into my career post college. I left my graduate programme last june for a higher paying job. 57k base 6k car allowance. No pension, commute 1hr 15 each way 5 days a week. I’m almost 6 months into the job, and my probation is finished on the 15th of janruary. the commute is taking a toll on me and the job has a strict no WFH Policy. 

I spend €400 a month on diesel and do 1000km per week. Which is putting quite high mileage on my car and increasing cost to run it.

I have been offered a job in dublin , 1 day a week in the office. 1.5 hour drive. with 4 days working from home. It really is a better job overall in terms of career prospects. Working as a consultant which involves implementing SAP with AI

I have been offered 46.8k base, 5.2k bonus, health insurance for myself and partner. and if i contribute 4% into my pension, they will put in 10%.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated

1hphpo7,"While I try to build a solo music career (online), should I stay in college, or leave and get a dayjob?","I'm 18.

My goal is to be a solo artist/musician who has enough of a following to do shows and sell merch.
(Eventually, I would really love to move to New York City or somewhere in California bc of the network and people.)

I'm  a freshman in college who just finished the first semester. I'm getting a degree for psychology. I also have been creating original music (I sing and produce) for 4 years. I've created about 60 songs. I haven't published any of the music or marketed myself anywhere, except YouTube, where I've gotten encouragement to keep going and have gotten 465 subscribers from posting 4 songs. I've also gotten good feedback on my music when I shared it before, which is why I'm motivated and confident that it is a possibility for me to start to work towards the goal.

One option is to stay where I am now, going to classes in my psych major, while having a dayjob. I am also required to be doing about 5 classes per semester (which is a LOT for me) to keep a scholarship.  I have already been doing this for a semester and I haven't been able to work as much on music and my own ""brand"" as I'd like.

Another option is to change to a music major or to switch to a music school. But I'm hesitant because I know that a music degree is not required or needed for my goal. But, if I went to a school in New York or California, it would help me get a network of people.

A third option is to leave college and just have a dayjob. Or, to take some sort of gap from school. This would help me have more mental energy to work on art. And save money. But the reason I am in school is for having a backup option. My backup career is ""something i dont know yet in psych"", which is why im in the psych major right now. I'm not excited about the school at ALL. I rly hate my school bc of the location and people. But I do like the idea of being a counselor or a educator of psych, it's really meaningful to me. 

I just am naturally an artist and i love it. I already make music and art (visual art). I already have enough work to create an extensive portfolio of work. I already have a lot of experience in various types of media- video,  film, digital artwork, animation, painting, pastels, drawing, music production, piano, singing. I already have experience in creating my own STYLE, which I noticed it's kind of like an artist's brand. 


Any advice on what option is the best way to achieve my goal? Thanks!",n0oM0oN,2,1.0,2,1735542812,2024-12-30 07:13:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hphpo7/while_i_try_to_build_a_solo_music_career_online/,12,2024

1hpbket,Asking For A Raise Tomorrow - Is My Request Reasonable + Any Advice?,"Hi all,

I have my year-end review tomorrow and I plan on asking for a raise, for multiple reasons. I would like to add some context and get some advice, so thank you in advance for reading. I am going to leave out some specifics to my job because I have a deep paranoia one of my co-workers uses career advice reddit LOL.

For starters, we all usually get end of the year raises of around 2.5k. Last year, my salary was 68.5k, and it was increase to 71k. So I am expecting my salary to raise to 73k at the end of the year.

However, in the past six months, I have had a much heavier workload. We have had several people leave our office, all of whom are higher up than me, and I have been given a lot of their responsibilities. This even includes some accounting work that I have never done before, nor does anyone in my job position at other companies does. (I honestly think it's ludicrous I'm doing accounting work now because I have no experience in this and often times feel like I am going to screw up badly because finance is not my thing). I have been having massive anxiety doing this accounting work because I'm terrible at math and the process of making sure our clients get paid feels like a really heavy burden. There are softwares that obviously help with a lot of this, but it still requires some financial thinking skills that often times leaves me in a panic. I have tried to express to my superiors that I don't think I am really the right person to be doing some of this, and I don't think they care. They even sometimes get frustrated with me because they can see me struggling, but I have not had this task taken away from me. Other new responsibilities that I have been given are pretty ""manageable"" and I'm doing well with them. I just feel like I am crazy busy and like I am doing several different jobs at once. In addition to all the task related stress, my job is very far from where I live and I am spending a crazy amount of money transporting there every day, which my job knows. I have multiple loans I am paying off and money is tight for me because of it. 

I would like to ask for a raise of 76k, which is 5k more than my current salary, and 3k more than my expected end-of-year raise. I feel like this raise is fair based on my current job responsibilities that I have taken on in the absence of former senior staff. 

Is this salary increase reasonable, and does anyone have any advice on how to present this?",Weird_Lifeform_000,2,1.0,6,1735522190,2024-12-30 01:29:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hpbket/asking_for_a_raise_tomorrow_is_my_request/,12,2024
1hpajie,What steps should I take towards a successful career?,"I (27,F) graduated last fall with a Professional Communications degree. Right before graduating, I found out that I was pregnant. I had a very complicated pregnancy, and I quit my job due to it being physically demanding.
The job was not my dream, and I honestly only stayed with it because it worked well with my classes. I don’t miss it one bit. 

Recently, I’ve been feeling the urge to get back to work. I worked hard for my degree, and I want to put it to use. I dabbled in social media marketing for a small start up company, but I discovered that it wasn’t for me. I didn’t feel confident in the position as most of my courses were revolved around workplace communication and not social media. I keep hearing that communications degrees are “useless”. It’s obviously not the best thing to hear, but I understand that networking and added on experience is what I need to get after.

I’m lost on what I need to do next. My previous job experience is all over the place due to being a military spouse and taking whatever job I could get in a competitive environment. 

What steps should I take to enhance my resume? Do employers take volunteering as valuable experience? How does someone successfully network? Will a gap in between jobs affect anything? Next month will mark a year of me being unemployed.

I don’t necessarily need a high paying position to be happy. Success in my eyes is being glad to go to work everyday. I’m just lost on where I should go from here.

1hp7jfv,How can one keep their sanity while looking for jobs?,"I got laidoff in the month of Sep 2024 from a company I joined last year on Oct 2023. My last job before this was overly toxic, so I guess after joining this 2023 job I couldn't give my 100%. This new job was in new city, new role (Developer to Tech Lead), new Domain. I got overwhelmed by the changes and there's seem nothing which I liked about all these changes. So, anyway I was planning to move out from this job as soon as I completed the 1 year,  as I didn't like the culture and the work. Hence the laidoff didn't bother me much.

I thought I will take some time off. Chill, travel, do nothing for a while and then start my job hunting. Couldn't do the same though. Just after the week of the laidoff I started giving the interviews. Because I always follow the strategy of giving as many interviews as you can, before giving the interviews for your desired roles and companies. Have always worked for me this way in the past.

It's been 3 months now, and I have given 60+ interviews, but no interview process has turned into an offer. 
Things have started worrying me now. The savings are reducing, hence the pressure is increasing.
I am utilising this time to brush up the skills. Focussing on my thesis for the master.

But somehow nothing seems to make me feel better. I feel I am trapped in a cycle of not able to relax because not able to be productive and vice versa. I am not able to do anything fun because I feel that way I am cheating to the job hunting process. No matter how much efforts I put into the day to be productive (code, study, read papers). It feels like nothing by the night. I am not able to appreciate myself for anything. Whenever there's an interview, and they ask something which I don't know, immediately my mind goes into the self defeat mode.

1hp54p1,"help me choose a major - finance, data analytics, sth else?","hi everyone,

i’m in my final year of high school in poland, and i’m at a crossroads about what to study. i'm planning to apply to the warsaw school of economics (SGH)—it’s the best business/economics university in poland, with no tuition fees, which is a big plus for me. i'd only need to work part-time to cover living expenses, with some help from my parents.

SGH also has a great reputation: many professors are influential figures in business, economics, and finance—think politicians, presidents of the national bank of poland, and board members of major institutions. big companies in poland actively recruit students from SGH for internships and placements, which makes it seem like the perfect choice.

the majors available are: **economics; global business, finance and governance; management; finance and accountancy; quantitative methods in economics and information systems.**

i’m leaning toward finance because i’m interested in the finance industry (maybe investment banking?) and feel it’s a more straightforward choice. however, my sister, who works in big4 consulting, keeps pushing me to consider quantitative methods in economics and information systems because of the growing importance of data analytics.

here’s my dilemma: i have zero programming skills and worry i'm not good enough at math to survive quantitative methods. is it really that much better than finance in terms of career prospects? i’m pretty good at math (not a genius, but decent) and think i could learn programming if needed, but it would take a lot of time and effort, and i need to work part-time while studying.

i believe i can handle a high-paced environment with opportunities to grow, network, and travel, but I don’t want to burn out completely.

i want to hit the ground running at uni - what’s the best way to start networking and building a strong career foundation? i want to arrive with a clear goal and make my time (and my parents’ money) worth it

are there specific student organizations, certifications, or side projects i should focus on while studying?

if i'm completely delusional in my thinking, i'd love a reality check. any advice on which major to choose, how to balance work and studies, or how to plan for the future would mean the world to me.

i really appreciate any help because im in panic mode right now! :)",frankoceansgf1,1,1.0,0,1735504491,2024-12-29 20:34:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hp54p1/help_me_choose_a_major_finance_data_analytics_sth/,12,2024

1hp4msp,Should I start looking for a new job?,"My role is pretty unique to my organization My company hired me knowing that they needed help but they didn't exactly know what they needed help with. I knew that coming in and didn't worry too much about it, because I've been doing my job for years and knew exactly what I could do to help the organization. 

At first, I loved this job, but then a few months after I started, my company posted a new job listing. Little did they know that I was already doing half the work listed on that job description. 

  
As soon as I found out I contacted the hiring manager and my manager immediately. They thanked me for raising my concerns with them, but said they were already 3 rounds into the interviews and were planning on making an offer within the next 3 days. I asked them what this meant with my job, and they gave me some BS answer about me being the subject matter expert. It pretty much showed me they have absolutely no idea what I do. I knew once this new position started, my job would change completely. 

The day before this happened, my former employer contacted me another position. I originally said no because the pay and benefits weren't as great as this current position, but after I talked to my manager I contacted my old company immediately and told them I was interested. They said interviews would start in 2-3 months.

A lot happened the next few days. I warned my boss that I'm looking into starting a new position at my former company, they thanked me for letting them know. The hiring manager got fired and the new position at my current company was put onto hold. My manager took that opportunity to get me a promotion and a 20% raise. A month later, I found out that my former employer's job was no longer avaliable due to budget cuts.  

It's been almost a year and while I love the promotion, I feel like my manager just gave it to me so they didn't have to address the real issue, which is how did this even happen in the first place? I lost complete trust in my manager. Especially since months after the incident, I learned they updated my job description without my knowledge and submitted it HR. Obviously, it was missing a lot since they have no idea what I do. I also learned they helped write that job description for that new job. 

To prevent this from happening again, I've tried to set some time with them to go over my job with my manager, but they've shown no interest. Everything is a joke to them. Every time I try to explain what I'm working on, they laugh and say it has nothing to do with their work so they don't care. 

  
Now the company has removed the hiring freeze. I've asked my manager if I could be involved in the job search for this new person, but it doesn't seem like that's an option, since this is above my pay-grade. I'm terrified the same thing will happen again.

  
While I like my actual job and coworkers, I'm leaning towards searching for a new position. I feel like I can't trust my manager at all, but I don't know if I'm being too sensitive.

1hp4j33,What roles should I Apply for in my first job switch?,"What Roles Should I Apply for in My First Job Switch?

Hey everyone,

A little background about me: I’m 23M and started working at my current company as an intern while I was in college pursuing a Bachelor’s in Tech.

The company I work for provides billing solutions to large corporations. My initial role was in Product Management, where I worked under the QA team to understand the product. After 6 months (once I graduated), I was moved to the implementation team as a **Functional Analyst**.

Since then, I’ve gained hands-on experience with Salesforce and Oracle ERP systems and taken on a lot of responsibilities—managing customers directly, gathering new requirements, and handling tasks that even my senior counterparts don’t manage.

Now, coming to why I’m considering a switch:

1. Pay: I’m making less than half of what my colleagues earn. I get that I started as a fresher, but the workload and responsibilities I handle far exceed what I’m being compensated for.
2. Work-Life Balance: This is the bigger issue. The workload here is intense. I’ve clocked 14–15-hour days regularly, and when things go wrong, I’m expected to do even more. It’s becoming too much to handle.

This will be my first job switch, so I’m looking for some guidance. Based on my experience so far, what kind of roles should I apply for? Any advice would be appreciated!",Necessary_Permit2167,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1735502857,2024-12-29 20:07:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hp4j33/what_roles_should_i_apply_for_in_my_first_job/,12,2024
1hp4aj8,Which Job Should I take,"**Disclaimer:** I know this might make people mad, I'm not ungrateful to be employed and I know that my underlying issue is personal lack of direction. I would be very grateful to anyone that can offer some advice.

**TLDR specifics:**

**Current Job, AL:** Business Analyst at a financial clearinghouse, 5 Billion market cap 5,000 employees. $62,000 salary with a $10,000 ""performance"" bonus each year (basically guaranteed). 4% annual raise each year for the next 5 years. Current income utilization: 78%

**D.C. Opportunity:** Business Development Representative (SaaS sales) at a data consulting firm, 1 Billion valuation in 2021, 500 employees. $73,300 base salary paid hourly with $25,000 in potential commission and a $14,700 new hire equity grant with a 4 year vest. Projected income utilization: 67%

**Background:** I am 23 years old. In May, I graduated from a large, non-target, party-ish school in Alabama majoring in Finance. I've been at my current company for a little over 8 months. I do not like what I do and I'm worried that it is making me lazy and apathetic towards my career. I do very little actual ""work"" in this role and still outperform 60% of my team. I stayed in Alabama to be close to family. Since then, my 3 brothers have all moved, NYC, London, and Vancouver. I have a good group of friends that I love in my current city, but only 1 is not moving to different states in May, 2025. I feel stuck in my current situation and think that this feeling will only be exaggerated after my friends move. I landed this BDR position in DC after 5 rounds of interviews, but I've only been applying for about a month. I met a guy on Facebook that I would live with in DC who I think would be really compatible. I also have friends in DC and feel good about the prospect of making more.

**Work Experience:**

* Co-Founder of a subcontract labor firm (with brother), AL, 3 years (sold in 2020).
* Analytics Intern at a Real Estate development firm, AL, 3 months.
* Sales Intern at an Insurance brokerage, NC, 3 months.
* Real Estate Agent, AL, 2 years (off and on, moderate success).
* Policy Intern at a large lobbying firm, DC, 9 months.

**Concerns:** I'm concerned that I have a dedication issue, and it is manifesting itself in my longing for a career change after only 8 months in my current role. I also am very certain that this current position is not challenging enough to help foster the personal growth that I see as necessary at this stage of my life. I fear that I am creating bad habits and do not have the fire I once had to accomplish things. I feel like this new role being a sales role would help me regain the drive to be independently successful. I am worried however about the industry outlook for this new position. My eldest brother is in a high leadership position at an industry leading software company and is convinced that AI will make SaaS obsolete and that BDR positions will cease to exist in 5+ years. I am also worried about this new company's direction. This is a new team, with a new-ish product. The Glassdoor for this company is a bloodbath. 2 restructurings in the past 5 years. My hiring contact and potential new manager have been able to dissuade my fears somewhat on this issue, but I fear this might be because I am naive about the industry.

**Questions**: Is it absolutely stupid of me to leave my current **stable** position for this new somewhat unstable role? Is it stupid of me to transition into sales on the brink of AI innovation in this specific space? Should I stay at my current position and look for a job in a city that I like closer to May when my fiends are leaving?

**I really appreciate any perspective and I know how annoying I sound in this thread. The new position's start date is January 9th so this was a plea of desperation because I genuinely do not know what the correct decision is.**",Top_Background_4491,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1735502249,2024-12-29 19:57:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hp4aj8/which_job_should_i_take/,12,2024

1hp34z1,Positions like executive assistant (after recovering from sexual harassment)?,"

I think it’s relevant to mention that I’m in Europe. I’m a 32F.

A while ago, I was fired as a result of me rejecting the CEO’s sexual advances. It almost ended my life and took a lot therapy to overcome this dark period in my life. Now I’m finally in a better place mentally and I’m actively looking for a job, but I’m struggling a lot. 

My previous experiences are working as an executive assistant, doing a bit of project management and working in marketing in the luxury goods industry. Im fluent in English and my German is decent as well. And yet, I’ve sent over 100 CV and they get either ignored or rejected. I’ve talked to a few career counselors and ironically, they were very impressed by my CV (I’d rather they wouldn’t and straight up told me what I can fix and improve). 

This is the first time I’m going through the “proper” process in looking for a job. All of my previous jobs were always offered to me based on connections and that the people were somehow “charmed” by me and it would lead to a fruitful cooperation (I like working, am a hard worker and unlike many people, I enjoy being around people and always strive to make the office environment a more positive place).

I know if I was at least invited for an interview, my chances of getting hired would be higher because I present myself well. But it never comes to that due to my CV getting tossed. It’s now really starting to affect my self worth (which was already non existent after what happened to me).

I’m using LinkedIn, app loading CVs on companies’ career sites, but I still feel like I’m doing something wrong, like maybe I haven’t found the right personal agency or recruiter.

1hp2ddo,Jobs that still require face to face meetings & events.,"Over the last 5+ years I've been freelancing as a copywriter (and various sales roles) within the B2B tech advertising industry. I've been able to travel the world and make good money, but I'm now looking for a change.

In June, my partner and I are moving back to London and returning to the normal workforce.

I've worked in sales for the past 10 years (30M) and would probably stay in that line of work. But I'm looking for something different. I'd like a sales role that requires actual client face to face interaction, as well as travel (internationally) and events etc.

As I said, most of my experience is in B2B tech. Which is fine, but it doesn't interest me much and most of the work is remote and you rarely meet with clients. I want to get out and shake some hands and network. I'm not looking for another WFH job.

1hp2201,Changing Careers at a Difficult Time In life..IT or Graphic Design?,"So, long story short, I’ve always been creative/artistly gifted. So I went into Graphic Design. I was a Graphic Designer for 3 years at a Digital Marketing Company and enjoyed it half of the time. I started to hate the morals of Digital Marketing, always trying to get people to click to spend their hard earned money. Marketing is  basically brain wash and I felt that my work was meaningless. So I wanted to look else where that I felt better in what I do, and for the people I’m serving. I was let go from my job about 5 months ago


So I saw Cybersecurity as that answer. Through trial and error, I’ve realized I really need to gain experience in IT before going head first into Cybersecurity. I’m going to school now for both and also gaining certifications to help me get jobs (comptia/ Google IT Support) 

My concern here is I need a job soon. My unemployment is going to run out in late January. Should I look for a Job in Graphic Design (my job efforts have all been to Tech) or continue to look for jobs in tech?

The job market in both are very saturated. I need something soon and I’m so split on where I should go. Do I get leverage with my 3 years of experience in GD or continue to start from scratch for a more promising career?  Any suggestions would be very appreciated!

1hozuly,"3 years of ""maryjane"" experience not going over well when job hunting","I posted this in r/resume but I figured I'd expand to other similar subs. 

So I have a dilemma. Florida is a medical marijuana state, and I've been involved in this industry since January 2022. I've worked at a grow facility for 2 years, a dispensary, and now I'm at a very corporate doctor office that, you guessed it, sells marijuana scripts to people in need of medical cannabis. 

My issue is this: I've been in this industry for far too long, long enough to break these rose colored glasses and see the industry for what it really is. Since I've started in 2022, I haven't been able to work for a livable wage, and I've noticed that every job I've been to, especially the grow facility, there was almost never any room to advance in the company. I'm not sure if this is common for other states with medical, but Florida is terrible for this. My grow site in particular only grew in my time working there and as a result, made more money. I only received a 53 cent raise after working there for 2 years. From 15.25 to 15.78.

Needless to say, I'm tired of this industry. For awhile now, I've been interested in going back to the medical field. I worked at a hospital for 4 years (2017-2021) doing clerical things mostly, but the raises and benefits were really quite good! I had an interview with a pediatrics center doing much of the same clerical tasks, and the interview was going well at first until they asked what I'm currently doing. I explained that I'm in the cannabis industry but no longer enjoy it, and I also let them know that I'm not an active cannabis user. It didn't matter to them however, the 2 interviewers exchanged glances and gave me a weird pity smile and said they'd ""let me know.""

I of course did not get that job lol.

I interviewed for this marijuana doctor's office shortly after and got that job pretty fast. I've only been here for literally 2 weeks as a front desk person, and I'm already contemplating walking out. The doctor is a racist, homophobic, sexist old guy who makes the patients feel guilty for needing cannabis. Except if you're a good ol country white boy/ man. Then he'll offer more cannabis on your script and have a laugh with you. I've already complained to the hire ups about this man, but nothing is being done about it. He treats me like garbage and acts like I'm his little butler to belittle and waves his finger at me like im a child. The turnover rate is so bad here that even the patients will tell me that they always see new faces working when they come to this office. My own manager (lovely lady) just worked her last day yesterday because she couldn't stand the abuse she was putting up with from her higher ups, and now there won't be a manager in our office for the foreseeable future. All of this plus witnessing a patient trying to fist fight my coworker, I'm desperately trying to make my escape.

My question is, how the heck do I go about my resume? There's 3 years worth of cannabis industry experience in there, and while I'm working on my ultrasound degree, I definitely need a better paying job above 15/hr. There are clinics and hospitals everywhere in nearby towns, but after that one interview, I fear that I might waste my time attending any more interviews if I mention my previous experience. Do I lie on my resume and put that I was doing something else for 3 years? And even if I lie, what do I say? Was I helping out a sick, elderly family member or something for 3 years and out of work? Or do I just stay honest and keep trekking through and hope to God that I'm accepted anyway?

Hi everyone,  

I’m a fourth-year Hospitality Business and Management student, set to graduate soon. Over the past few years, I’ve had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience through internships:  

- **5 months** in F&B service at a luxury hotel in Morocco, where I developed strong communication and customer service skills.  
- **6 months** in the contracting and product development department at a leading tour operator, focusing on business development and negotiation.  

While I’ve enjoyed my experiences, I’ve realized that I’m passionate about pursuing a career in Human Resources. My goal is to work internationally, gain diverse experience, and build a career that combines my management background with HR practices.  

What I’m Looking For:  
1. Advice on Entry-Level Roles:
   - What types of entry-level jobs or internships should I target to transition into HR?  
   - Any specific industries or companies that are known for hiring fresh graduates into HR roles?  

2. Best Countries for International Experience:
   - Which countries would you recommend for someone in my position, considering visa/work opportunities and demand for HR professionals?  
   - Are there countries or regions where hospitality and HR intersect strongly?  

3. Tips for Landing Internships/Jobs:
   - How can I make my application stand out when applying for international opportunities?  
   - Any certifications or skills I should work on to boost my profile for HR roles?  

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s transitioned into HR, worked internationally, or has experience in similar fields. Any insights, tips, or resources would mean a lot to me!  

Thank you so much in advance!

Without giving too much detail, I’ve had a target on my back since I started. I am a salary employee and my bosses constantly have me working 2-3 hours over my scheduled shift. They try to make me work during my lunches without pay, and have spread lies about me to my team and now they have turned against me. I have no autonomy to make decisions. I’ve been micromanaged to such a degree that whenever I send a message to my team, I get an immediate call from management about why my choice was incorrect. They change the rules associated with my position everyday. They consistently give me direction, then will present with negative feedback after I follow their direction. I’m respect constructive criticism, but this feels more like bullying. I’d like to think I’m a strong person, but I’m getting pretty tired. I am interested in a new career path but I don’t have the time to search.

1hoyrt7,CSR: Until when should I stay at a company who I feel doesn't value my performance? Is it time to leave? ,"Hi! I'm posting this to get some insights regarding my situation.

I have been working as a Customer Service Representative (CSR) at a well-known BPO company for two years. I’m grateful to be part of this company and fortunate to have a great team leader. As the breadwinner of my family, everyone knows that this motivates me to meet my quota and earn incentives consistently. I exceeded performance expectations and was recognized as the best agent, ranking TOP 1 in the entire Line of Business (LOB).

However, I feel there is no opportunity for career growth. I have not been considered for a promotion and have been placed in what I refer to as a ""silent promotion,"" where I handle calls more frequently than other agents (though I'm not the only one in this situation). There was even a moment when the Operations Manager (OM) suggested I take on another ""silent promotion"" by being a shadow trainer for the training team. I responded, ""I'll think about it,"" even though I had applied for a trainer position months earlier.

It got me thinking, maybe I am not worthy of any other positions. There are also feelings of being needed so they use me more often because I perform better than others. (Not bragging tho.)

I have been thinking of resigning for five months now. The only thing keeping me here is my team leader. She has been really helpful and supportive towards me. I'm concerned that if I leave, it could negatively impact her performance and attrition was a big deal I just found apparent.

I'm hoping you can provide me with some of your advice. Thank you!",jxspxr02,0,0.5,4,1735487590,2024-12-29 15:53:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hoyrt7/csr_until_when_should_i_stay_at_a_company_who_i/,12,2024

I have been at my current job since March 2023. (Manager Level job to manage 1 location)

I asked for a raise in Nov. 2023, and never heard anything back from my boss. I kept working.

I received a 3% cost of living raise in May of 2024.

Last week, a counterpart was termed, and I have been taking on their duties, that are business critical $$. Thus, I now manage double the number of locations which means travel (4 hour drive apart). Typically this would mean a “district manager” promotion, with associated ~10-15% raise or more. Of course, I asked for the associated promotion. 

Fast forward 2 weeks, and I received a 4% raise (because I was doing a good job haha), and no formal promotion at all. 

Should I now focus on my location I was hired for, and leave that extra location for my boss to deal with? I just don’t want to be doing double work without a promotion, because that 4% bump in salary did nothing for me - compared with the work of multiple roles. 

Complain or not complain? And I know I can switch employers, that’s always a Trump card…..

Am I being reasonable?

I didn’t like the idea of a 9-5 for the rest of my life and working to make someone else rich. I acknowledge the pros and cons of an entrepreneur vs a 9-5. Entrepreneurship is no joke and a big risk, but would be way more rewarding in the end in my opinion. I do realize that I would have to work basically 24/7 to get the life I want. I could possibly make more than I ever would at a 9-5 and more flexibility with my life and time. On the other hand, going back to school then getting a 9-5 job has a lot more stability in terms of finances and benefits.

1hosa0u,Companies want you to commit years of your life to minimum pay and empty promises. DON'T.,"Companies are not your friends. They're not your family, and you owe them nothing.

Lie to your boss on your resume and in your interview, because obviously, you don't want to get caught. But tell them what they want to hear to get you hired. Being authentic when you need a job will likely make you look like a bad fit. Fuck their feelings, they don't care about you, so lie, you need a job, so get the job that you need and then get the fuck outta there when a role with the big bucks come along. Times are hard, survival of the fittest, right?

They would much rather hire someone from the outside than promote from within. It can be for any number of reasons. There actually aren't many ""good"" Companies that genuinely care about the growth of their people. There are also few employees doing what they actually what they want to do in terms of their career path. If there's a tuition benefit, take advantage of it, get that degree on the company's dime, apply to the role that you actually want with a competitor and FUCK'EM. You arent being paid enough to be loyal.

Managers will ask you in the interview and on the application ""how long do you intend on staying with us?"". To me, that is a sure sign that it's a shitty company with shitty pay and definitely a high turnover. They're too stubborn to change, so hiring someone desperate (and convincing) is easier. So, lie to them, tell'em you wanna be their ""rOcKsTaR"". Its what they want you to do anyway. 

Tell them you plan on giving them 5 years, keep applying to better roles that are more in line with your values where you have a better chance of being happy, and when you finally get that call back, FUCK'EM! Leave and don't look back, they are not your friends and you don't owe them shit!

Screw the corporate politics, be smart about your moves and always go for a bigger paycheck or a better culture whenever you have the opportunity. Network outside your org and make the system work for you.

1hoqrqr, LinkedIn Interaction Tips,"Once, I found myself overwhelmed by the vastness of LinkedIn. I wanted to build connections and share my ideas, but each time I logged in, I felt like a small fish in a big pond. Despite my efforts, my posts barely garnered attention, and I struggled to find the right words to express my thoughts.

While searching for solutions, I came across this [Linkfluence Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/linkfluence/fgjdhahclmpkpghalimkmiahdpgpbnjj?pli=1). Intrigued by its promise to enhance my LinkedIn experience through AI-driven insights, I decided to give it a try. After a quick installation, I was excited to see how it could help me.

Linkfluence Chrome Extension Link offered tailored comment suggestions on posts that resonated with my interests, helping me engage with industry leaders and peers. The AI analyzed my network, suggesting the best times to connect, which made it much easier to break the ice.

What stood out to me was its ability to capture my unique voice. With its voice matching feature, I could optimize my comments while maintaining my authenticity. This gave me the confidence to express my thoughts without worrying about sounding robotic or out of character.

As I started using the Linkfluence extension, I noticed a transformation. I felt empowered to share my insights and participate in discussions. Engagement on LinkedIn became enjoyable rather than daunting, and I soon found myself connecting with a diverse group of professionals.

Now, I feel like an active participant in the community, not just a bystander. My LinkedIn experience has truly evolved, and I'm grateful for the tools that made it possible.

She does it to others as well but it’s a little harsher on me since we work close to each other. Complains about micromanaging but nitpicks everything in front of customers. Doesn’t give very clear directions until they’re not perfectly met and then scolds me in front of people.

Wants everything to be in it’s perfect place, even though before she said we could keep our work area how we wanted it to. Literally moved something 3 inches to the left and then complained about how I set it up and she always has to move it.

1hon6w9,Job with more money or job with more enjoyable work?,"I am graduating from college this upcoming spring and currently have two offers available. One offers a much higher salary, while the other is a dream job with a lower salary.

**Job 1:** A large Fortune 50 corporation with plenty of opportunities for upward growth. It requires five days in the office with not much work after hours, limited travel, but it is far from my family, girlfriend, and friends. The salary is $100k (excluding bonuses), with tons of benefits like PTO, healthcare, retirement, etc. However, the work is pretty monotonous, and I’d feel useless sitting in the office not doing much.

**Job 2:** A federal job with opportunities to travel a lot and is a job I’ve always wanted since childhood. It involves very stressful yet important work. The salary is $80k, with potential for overtime, night shift, and weekend pay. The location is closer to home but may require working on projects abroad or being deployed for months/years at a time. Benefits are fairly good, but not as comprehensive as Job 1 (e.g., PTO, ""no work"" on weekends, 401k/retirement). There is no sign-on bonus and limited relocation reimbursement. While there are opportunities to move around, upward growth is more limited.

I’ve been considering this decision in the long run. As I am about to graduate college, I want to be financially stable enough to have a family in my late twenties and avoid the lifestyle of constantly moving for work, which could be a possibility with Job 2. I know accepting either job won’t necessarily define my entire career, but choosing Job 2 might cause difficulties in relationships with my family or a potential partner.

The main debate for me is whether the $20-40k difference in annual salary over a few years would significantly impact savings for a family and retirement. Would the higher salary put me in a much better financial position?

Which job would you choose? Has anyone been in a similar situation and can share advice on what you did or whether you regret your decision?",Big_Literature9883,3,0.6700000166893005,10,1735443476,2024-12-29 03:37:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hon6w9/job_with_more_money_or_job_with_more_enjoyable/,12,2024

1hoihtp,How To Get to the Corporate World,"So, this may be an odd question, I'm almost certain that people have asked this before, but for anyone that did work in food service/retail/customer service and is now in a corporate/office space-- HOW did you get to the corporate/office world??

  
I've steadily worked from food service to an office-based front desk role, and I've got a bunch of really solid experience that, based on my conversations with family members and from seeing people talk about the corporate space (and on LinkedIn), would be easily transferable to a more traditional office space; and I want to get out of the rut I'm in. But, after months of searching and applying I've gotten one interview that was a startup and ghosted right after, and I've just gotten either auto-generated rejections/generic rejections or no response.

  
I know this is a ridiculously tough job market, so I'm trying to not take any of this personally or get discouraged. I'm tailoring my resume/cover letter to the job I'm applying for, and I'm applying to multiple jobs daily, and I guess I'm a bit lost, and would really appreciate some advice.

  
Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to look over/answer my question. I'm open to any and all advice/help!",Firm-Loss1583,7,0.7799999713897705,3,1735428956,2024-12-28 23:35:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hoihtp/how_to_get_to_the_corporate_world/,12,2024

1hogksp,"18M, Just Graduated High School, Barbering the route to go?","I just turned 18 in November and just Graduated recently, But I was wondering if Barbering is the route/pathway to go. Before I graduated, I would cut hair and still do but not as much as I do. I would cut Family Members, Friends, and so on. But recently since I graduated, I been looking at barbering school and college. I'm located In Georgia and Yesterday, I went to a barber school of a neighbor that recommended me to them. So i went to take a look and the barber school has a special where a full license or tuition cost $3500 if you pay upfront. But anyways besides the point the barber school is like 22 miles from my house and my father said that's an issue since it'll be 44 miles total back and forth to my house. The thing about this school also is if i wanted to I can do 12 hours a day morning to night to get my license within shorter time as if doing less time. But when I first came into the barber idea, I always thought long term never being in the shop cutting hair for the rest of my life, such as opening my own barber shop and running a website that sales barber supply and where clientele can book appointments, so like a startup business that will transform into a barber shop something like that, just a idea I always had when it came to the business or barbering. I always liked the barber shop environment that's one reason why, I wanted to become a barber laid back job, no boss, music, just the job being chill. At the end of the day I never know those are just assumptions due to me never being a legit barber in the shop. But the Problem I think or face is not being able to work since I don't have a car, I have enough for a car but not enough for insurance, which is a reason due to my parents are going to need the car for future events or any other things. Another is the Competition in this field. But my father also wants me to go to college as well so it'll be harder to get everything done, depends if I go to college in person or do some online. For college I'm not that worried since I can start in August. In Georgia you need 1500 hours to get your license, But if I grind my hours out I can get this done within 6-8 months.

1hoggs4,Work is not challenging,"Hi all. 

I started working in 2023 in a telecommunications company as an IT Executive aka system admin. 

It's a Apac company, so there's few countries the company is in, therefore there's there's a huge centralised support system for the IT department. 

Often I do administrative work for my branch only for about 1-3 hours and rest I study for a cert. 

I feel like I'm getting paid to do nothing, I mean I do solve occasional user issues but that's about it. 

I feel so stagnate in my role, since I'm not learning anything new. 

I can't go abroad either, because seems like no company is hiring for my role. 

I have an hnd in computing and software development. But software doesn't seem like something I want to do/switch over too. I like it as a hobby but not as a job. I have planned to pick up my bsc next year but do you think it's worth at all.

1hofu77,Should I quit my job?,"I’m a high school student who is currently working a part time job. The job I’m currently at is really stressful, mainly because of the number of hours and days I work. I get home around 9pm and I don’t get enough sleep because my school starts early. (I get around 6-7 hrs at most) my job is also interfering with my clubs, sports, and even my workout routine, which is affecting my fitness goals. There is another job that has a much more flexible schedule that I was actually hired on the spot for (which I didn’t realize until I left). However, the pay is lower and if I made the switch, I would be getting a couple hundred dollars less per paycheck, and I want to save up as much as I can for college next year. I’m supposed to be starting on the 18th (I thought that was the date for the interview) which would give me about 3 weeks to formally leave my current job. But by April, my schedule will be pretty flexible and since I’ve already been working at my job for 6 months, I want to try and make it to a year and transfer to a different department within that job when I turn 18. We are also expected to get 4 new hires next month, which would reduce my hours a bit. My schedule for this upcoming week also gives me more free time than my previous ones, but I’m not sure if it’s going to stay like that. If I switch to the new job, I plan on quitting around April-June to either go back to my current job, or find a higher paying one.

1hoe7rj,Need Serious Career Advice: Feeling Stuck and Full of Regret,"

I’m at a crossroads in life, and I need some honest advice. Here's my story:  

I was an average student until class 8, but a reputed JEE coaching institute changed my life. I worked hard and cracked the IIT JEE, securing a spot at IIT Delhi. Back then, I was just chasing exams with no real goals. My uncle, a sub-collector, inspired me to aim for competitive exams, but I hadn’t made up my mind.  

In my second year, I interned at a senior’s startup and got bitten by the entrepreneurship bug. Coming from a family of government employees, this was a whole new world for me. I gave my all to the startup, but when I asked for a key role or stake, I was let go. It stung. Later, I partnered with an XLRI alum on an app idea, thinking we’d make it big. But it failed—he couldn’t sell, and I couldn’t make it work alone.  

After that, I faced three choices:  
1. Go abroad and settle.  
2. Pursue an MBA.  
3. Prepare for UPSC.  

I chose IIM Bangalore, though I never saw myself as “management material.” I hoped an MBA would help me return to entrepreneurship. Post-MBA, I joined an IT company, starting with nothing as a mechanical engineer. I fought hard to get meaningful projects and eventually transitioned to product management, which I loved.  

Feeling confident, I joined a reputed startup as a full-time PM. It was an incredible experience, but my entrepreneurial dreams kept pulling at me. I tried several startup ideas with co-founders, only to realize they weren’t as committed. They just wanted an escape from their jobs. After several failed attempts, I started questioning if I’m even cut out for entrepreneurship. Maybe I’m not.  

Frustrated, I decided to prepare for UPSC. For two months, I gave it my all. I’m not terrified of UPSC; I know I have the grit to prepare. But the tech boom lured me back, and I switched companies for a salary hike. That turned out to be a huge mistake—the company was toxic, and I barely lasted six months. I joined another company, got married, and soon found myself in another toxic environment. A layoff during restructuring shattered my confidence, and I ended up back at my old IT company with a 30% pay cut.  

Now I have a baby, and I’ve started performing well again. I’ve earned appreciation in my current role, but deep down, I feel unfulfilled. I know I have the potential to do something meaningful for society, but I’m stuck.  

Entrepreneurship feels out of reach—I’ve lost hope and don’t have a solid idea. Going abroad seems pointless; it won’t fulfill me. And then there’s UPSC. The regret of not pursuing it eats away at me every day. I have one last attempt left. Whenever I see people clearing UPSC, the regret becomes unbearable.  

I feel I could do so much more, make a real impact, but I don’t know where to start. Am I chasing something that isn’t meant for me? How do I find my path again? What do you think I should do?",Zealousideal_Two9218,0,0.5,0,1735416938,2024-12-28 20:15:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hoe7rj/need_serious_career_advice_feeling_stuck_and_full/,12,2024
1hoe49k,Slight existential crisis,"To preface, I'm in a great situation- technically have a job lined up (I really don't stand behind the company but it's something + didn't enjoy the internship with them enough for me to be fully excited to jump back in), have grad school decisions coming in, financial support from my parents, and one stressful semester of undergrad college left at a really great school.

That all being said,
Does anyone find it like impossible to think about entering the real world where absolutely everything feels fake or scammy or morally corrupt? 

Maybe it's my media consumption but every way to make and hold wealth right now feels so based on fraud, loopholes, and taking people's money behind their backs. Between big tech, finance, healthcare, defense, real estate, even academia (supposedly the always sheltered side), everything feels designed to take advantage of people and the world.

Asking the people around me with careers, they just tell me you just cannot think so much about it, but isn't it just so awful that we have to sit and NOT think about the consequences of our actions because it will always lead to some type of horrid company or scheme? 

I always felt the most drawn to public policy, and I'm sure this is very evident from this post. When I was picking my major though, I was persuaded to not go that route, but now that I'm job hunting- I can't help but feel so hopeless.

Anyone have similar thoughts or any advice?",strawberrychiffon27,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1735416671,2024-12-28 20:11:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hoe49k/slight_existential_crisis/,12,2024

1hoczh5,How do I proceed with an indecisive potential employer?,"This year has had quite a few confusing moments with potential employers.  It's left me wondering if my gut is just off in how I've been handling communication. 

Earlier this year I'd been talking with a studio on a role that felt like a perfect fit all around.  Though I'd had mostly culture fit/vibe interviews over a month period and received an offer for another role, which I used to pressure a directional decision on their part.  The company closed the role since they didn't know what they wanted, spoke highly of the skills I could bring and lasted said - 

""...we'd like to keep the door open for future opps and maintain our connection. If the timing aligns, we’d be happy to revisit the possibility, even if it means presenting a more competitive offer later on.""

It seems clear cut enough.  Wait for them to get back to me.  Though that other role I mentioned receiving an offer for was rescinded.  A part of me wants to jump start the conversations early 2025 to check-in, let them know my status, and see if I can forge the opportunity before they open another job req again.

1ho9nai,I moved across the country for work only to be in a really toxic environment (rant),"I graduated last year with an engineering degree and struggled to find work. Part of that time I was trying to find what path I wanted to do. I got desperate and took a job across the country, leaving my family. It’s a very niche technical role limited to certain parts of the country, and I wish I really considered that before moving.

I regret moving. I found myself in a very tiny company in a small remote area, which makes me feel like a big outsider. I am in my early 20s and everybody else is 50s/60s/70s. It’s one thing not to have anybody close to my age to bond with, but it’s another thing to be bullied everyday.

There is one guy who constantly berates me and yells. Like actually yells. If I’m not doing something right, he screams at me and insults me. This can happen for hours on end, not just single occurrences. This is nearly every day, unavoidable. Like I know I’m doing something wrong, I just started. I know I can make mistakes sometimes. Or I don’t know my way around the software program. 

Other times when he isn’t yelling or talking about other stuff, he’ll just insult me and not be nice. This guy is my parents’ age.

Nobody here is nice or encouraging, only the non engineering roles maybe. I was hoping for some sort of mentor figure but never got it, without a lack of trying. I can’t really mingle with anybody. I gotta go back to work at my desk and keep working. My only saving grace was headphones, but I’m not allowed that. I have to work overtime (with no extra pay because I’m salaried). So I’m working 60+ hours a week with little time to get myself accustomed to the place and make friends.

I am at my wits end. I know I can’t quit now, I just started. But I want to be happy. Also, I hate this kind of work. I thought I would like it, but no. I hate it, I hate coming to work everyday, I hate dealing with the negativity, I hate being overworked, and I hate that I have nobody to talk to.

I just want to know if there is a way out. I want to get out of here and switch careers to software/programming. I figure that has a lot more young ambitious, motivated people. I’m more interested in coding anyway.

1ho8rks,Did you ever get interested in your  career choice out of spite? ," Even as an old starter in my mid-20s looking for a new career, my oppositional defiant disorder (which I say ironically, it’s not a disorder) from my angsty teen years seems to follow me everywhere. 

Like I expressed a mild interest in learning to code after doing a few html tutorials. And I keep getting gatekeepers on various forums telling me “There’s no jobs left, it’s all getting outsourced to India” or explaining to me that Ai is gonna take my job and I should learn a trade instead. 

And I mean they’re right on some level. But on some other level I think it’s a partial gate keep. And my immature brain is like “That butthead just told you, you can’t do something, now you have to do the exact thing he doesn’t want you to do.”

It’s really stupid but something just triggers in my brain that says “You should totally swim up this stream even though there’s an easier way to make a living.” Like my brain just works in constant reverse where encouragement makes me lazy and discouragement makes me want to work harder. 

Does anybody have this? I feel like it clouds my judgement in a way that it stops me from making fully objective decisions on the net reward vs cost of achieving certain tasks or getting into certain careers.

1ho83s2,Help Me Figure Out What Career is Right For Me ,"Hello, 

I have been trying to do some career searching as of recently, with job demand in mind and of course pay and benefits. I need some suggestions, I will tell you a bit about myself, and maybe you guys can make some suggestions. I am a dynamic and adaptable professional with a diverse background that spans Education, Sales, and Customer Service. With strong communication and interpersonal skills, I excel in building meaningful relationships and thrive in competitive environments. Driven by a passion for making a positive social impact, I am keen to explore entrepreneurship, seeking financial independence and a balanced lifestyle. My attention to detail, innovative thinking, and organizational prowess are complemented by a commitment to personal growth through further education and training. I do not currently hold a degree, just a HS diploma, but I am willing to obtain some kind of certificate, depending on the career path I choose to take. 

I currently work at a school with behaviorally challenged/mentally challenged children as a Student Support Specialist. I do love my job, but it definitely has it's ups and downs. No paid holidays, it's a full time position but I am only able to work 35 hours a week, max. I make $21.26 an hour. I am seeking to make more, and switch up my career. As I said I love my job, but these newer generations of kids are just a different breed, honestly. None of them have an ounce of respect or realistically care at all about getting/receiving an education, which of course makes it less meaningful work for us educators. I have some possibilities that I would be willing to go into, but I am really not looking to go back to college, but as I stated I would be willing to do some online courses for something. I was thinking something in the healthcare/ medical field or the tech field, since AI is taking over the world so much, and has great career advancement opportunities. I am very detail oriented, I am quick at most things I do, and I like a challenge. Prefer something that has first shift hours, and possible hybrid remote opportunities. Any suggestions are very appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read. :) ",Future_Philosophy_23,3,0.8100000023841858,2,1735400278,2024-12-28 15:37:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ho83s2/help_me_figure_out_what_career_is_right_for_me/,12,2024

1ho7ipm,"Seeking new career, or any decent job","35 year old male trying to carve a new path and livelihood blending my work history, education and life experiences. Staying with family where I grew up which is exhaustive being back here. West coast HCOL city. I’m unemployed, have about 35-40k in savings. No debt, working car, reasonably healthy. Need to grow the retirement and investment portfolio.

I spent two years taking an unplanned sabbatical. The unplanned two year break was amazing and while I would have made some adjustments, I wouldn't have changed a thing I did. It was also a productive time for personal growth and mental health but I did not earn wages in this time. It was a time of recuperation that frankly if I hadn’t taken, might not be alive today. 

What a hard landing so far since returning to the US, not with just culture shock but how awful the job market is. Worst since 2009 in my memory and back then I just started university and had a great paying PT job. I have 7 years retail, half of that in upper management. I have additional experiences scattered through various industries but all brief stints. 

I get stuck in cycles of doubt and indecision. I debate going back for a Masters (MBA or Finance/Accounting, or therapy certification). Or a 2 year certificate in the medical field. Though, my B.A. is a terrible liberal arts degree and I barely graduated with a 2.1 GPA. Getting into an ultra competitive STEM vocation is very difficult with my educational background. Also these can be cost prohibitive. And I am concerned these degrees will be obsolete and over saturated in the coming years.

I know the trades are in high demand but my body is already fragile and will not hold up long term to the physical rigours. I come into this debate with getting a CDL job as well. I have done logistics transit, but not in a CDL capacity. Sometimes I think about contract duration jobs in distant places but those present some challenges or are limited in options. Shoot, I even explored working for the US Border Patrol and that is somewhat against my ethics, but not trying to start political discourse here. 

After 3 consecutive months (way longer with intermittent searches the past 2 years) it seems like I’m finally getting some interviews for entry level state human service and retail bank jobs. Really trying to find something in a new industry that is going to pay at least $25 an hour, which is sustainable as long as I’m paying little to no rent. Sorry for the lengthy post, I’m appreciative for your insights. Time to start drafting gear specific versions of my CV resume and cover letters.

I am a tax professional with thirteen years of experience and I am very good at what I do and that’s been my record all through. I was getting a new role in company X but there was a company Y with a newer profile. So I joined company Y into estate planning in May 2024 after turning down company X. I joined this company because of my CIO (who is acquainted to me) insisted to join his team and that he had assured would take care of my career. But my reporting boss would be different not the CIO. From day 1 he had been biased and has made my life hell with threats to remove me and ruin my appraisal. On being confronted by HR he apologised to me that I was wrong I had a bias but he said he will try and improve. He in fact lies to me that I told you to do this and that when he never told me anything and points mistakes about not including something in deliverables where there was nothing discussed. In fact every time I budged down thinking that maybe I am wrong but this time I did not budge and he admitted Oh sorry it’s my mistake i didn’t tell you I thought I did. Cut to today our organisation is going through mid-year review and he gave the following review:

What is strange is that my CIO whenever I asked him he said your boss thinks highly of you and says you just need a bit of polishing. But his behaviour was otherwise. Infact, what’s more shocking is my CIO gave me a work recognition award for the quality of work that I did.

1ho3dsj,Should I Accept a Government Funded Research Institute Role or Wait for an Industry Job?,"Hi everyone,

I hold a bachelor's degree in computer science engineering and am currently submitting my PhD thesis in computational chemistry. My PhD was industrial, allowing me to work full-time during my tenure. During this time, I discovered that I enjoyed building workflows and software rather than doing research itself. As part of my PhD work, I designed a few Python packages and Streamlit apps as a part of my PhD work, and with the company, I contributed to four release cycles.

After completing my contract, I was jobless for about a month while finishing my thesis. I applied to a few positions and received an offer from a government-funded research institute. The role is full-stack engineer, and I'll be responsible for setting up the group's software infrastructure. The group primarily focuses on machine-learning models for computational chemistry.

The catch is that this isn't a post-doc or staff scientist role—it's more of a technical position in a research setting. While I am 100% sure I don't want to return to academia (I pursued an industrial PhD to remove the ""student"" tag from my CV and be taken seriously in the industry), I'm unsure how this role would impact my future prospects.

My long-term goal is to work in pure for-profit organizations, ideally as an associate or senior-level engineer—not an entry-level one. However, my visa will run out in 6 months, and this role offers visa support, which is a big plus.

Should I accept this research-adjacent position for now and transition to industry later, or hold out for a more industry-oriented job right away? Would this role help or hinder my chances of moving into senior engineering roles in the industry in the future?

Long time lurker here.

I am a male, aged 34. I reside in Washington State in the greater Seattle area. I have a Bachelors Degree in Business Managment and I have over a decade of managerial experience, mostly in retail management. At the end of January, my rental is not being renewed and I feel completely stuck.

I've been out of work since March of 2024, and I have been relying on unemployment since then, which is barely covering basic necessities such as food. Every position  I have applied for has either been ghosted or not responded to and I have applied to over 500+ positions. I have no criminal history or anything that should prevent me passing a background or a drug test. I am open to essentially every potential position. I honestly don't know what to do. At the end of January, my unemployment also ends and I have no where to go. My mother is the only family I have left and she lives in a 5th wheel and relies on social security disability issurance. She struggles enough. 

I am not resistant to any potential positions. I am fully physically capable. My savings have dried up and my unemployment is ending in 3 weeks and I would really not like to be homeless. 

This post is a last ditch effort to help me figure out what I need to do. I am projecting into the void of the internet/Reddit to assist me. I understand that this may be fruitless and futile,  but I am at wits ends. 

I am not asking for a handout, though I would not object to any form of assistance. I am merely just asking for suggestions or ideas for an individual in my predicament.

1ho2e0i,How to extend PIP?,"(Throwaway account for obvious reasons)

**Background**  
In my current role at a tech startup, I have been put on a manager's training plan (company policy) which ends in 2 weeks. If there isn't enough progress, they will put me on PIP which will last for 4 weeks. The thing is, this 6 (4+2) week mark puts me one month short of my 1 year anniversary. So, if I get fired at the end of PIP, I will not be able to get any stocks. Completing a year will help me get atleast some stocks as per the contract. 

**Questions**  
(1) Is there a way to push out the PIP end date by a month?  
(2) What happens if I take a personal leave or a family leave before or during PIP, does it pause the PIP clock (and does the stock vesting clock continue)?

State job/higher ed: steady, benefits, aligns w career trajectory, no supervising duties, work is predictable but busy. Really super nice director. 830-500, telework is up in the air and ""one late night"" a week. $55-60k range. 

Contracting job: 1yr contract, options for 2027. Pentagon, much much higher pay, serious demotion(exec admin) critically fear the SES I would work under being an asshole. The last Pentagon job I had was a total nightmare. Also, potential political appointee may or may not align w my political views, which wouldn't get in the way of my work but would definitely make me feel sour after hours. Also, a parking spot at the Pentagon, m&f telework, hours are 1130-800pm. $95-100k 

Since I haven't worked for a while, making more money than I've ever been offered before sounds sooo tempting. 
Both of the jobs are mine if I want them, but I'm not sure which to pursue. One thing about being a human I cannot handle is the various depths of hell in which one's brain can sink to over mere assumptions.

1hnzps4,Questions regarding Staffing/Temp Firms,"I just stumbled upon a clerical position on an undisclosed staffing/temp agency’s website. Originally, I received a quantitative degree from undergrad and I had wanted to go into tech (specifically data analytics) but it didn’t work out for me. I was COMPLETELY naive about employer’s expectations from job candidates and I have been experiencing the Catch-22.

 I am pivoting toward other industries and I encountered this clerk role. However, like tech or any other industry/field, I don't have any work experience in the clerical field so I don’t know how to create a resume for this position.  I am considering reaching out to Goodwill (because it was recommended to me) to help me with job assistance such as creating resume(s) and practicing for interviews. I have a few questions regarding staffing agencies.

1. If I see an interesting role on a staffing agency’s website but I don’t have a resume at hand, will the staffing agency be able to help me form a resume and prepare for the interview?
2. I saw the clerical role on the agency’s website but not on their linkedin page. I am planning on calling on Monday to know if the role is still open.

1hnze5u,Confused and Seeking Career Advice: Should I Pursue an MBA or Take Another Path?,"Hi, I’m a 32-year-old male, married, and currently working as a legal counsel at an international bank. Unfortunately, I’ve been placed on a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan) by my manager, who is by far the worst I’ve worked with. While this isn’t meant to be a rant against him, I’m reflecting on my career choices, which seem to haunt me every time I switch jobs.

Over the past decade, I’ve worked in multiple roles, but after one or two years in most places, I’ve either been asked to leave or voluntarily moved on. A major regret is that during my initial years in law firms, I struggled with the toxic work culture and couldn’t focus on building a solid foundation. This has impacted my growth, and I now see peers and juniors surpassing me in their careers.

Though I’m actively looking for a new job, I fear that the same cycle will repeat unless I undergo significant professional development. I’ve always wished for good mentors but haven’t been fortunate enough to find any.

Adding to my concerns is the rapid advancement of AI and ML. I wonder if my current skill set will even be relevant in the next 10 years. I’m considering taking a career break to pursue a one-year MBA, possibly from Singapore or Australia, to switch career tracks or broaden my prospects.

1hnyxgr,This is what my boss said to my coworker about sick house use ,"No mistake. Everyone got 10 hours for Tuesday and 6 hours for Wednesday, even those who don't work those days. You did not receive the 10 hours of sick leave because you were not sick. Those hours cannot be paid out or used to supplement weekly hours per Colorado law and what's written in the handbook. Including them also would've put you over 80 hours and I would've had to pay overtime. That's ridiculous, especially when the office is closed. 

The 20 hours were changed because those were dates you requested for PTO and I granted. Then I noticed you had incorrectly marked them as sick time. They're not equivalent, so I changed them to what they should be.",momslittlebro,0,0.3100000023841858,2,1735363951,2024-12-28 05:32:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hnyxgr/this_is_what_my_boss_said_to_my_coworker_about/,12,2024

1hny0z2,26 y/o Social Media to general marketer trajectory advice,"Hi there- I am a 26 yr/old social media manager for a small company but I also handle graphic creations & coordinating between teams to maintain brand compliance. My title is Brand Manager and Media Coordinator and I work alone in a team of one while coordinating with various different small teams across our global company. 

At my previous job I was a social media coordinator at a PR/ social media agency and handled a TON of client communication and collaboration on activations with our PR counterparts. And before that I had various internships in Marketing and Social Media. However those internships were before the pandemic. I have background in graphic design but have not worked professionally as solely a graphic designer and I do not have an up to date portfolio. 

I want to move AWAY from social media marketing specifically (meaning I want to go beyond having to only focus on getting posts out everyday and there is more to my success than a like count) and towards Brand Management, Brand Marketing Strategy (possibly at a branding agency), or Creative Strategy in Marketing. Pretty much I want to work with a team to create the marketing ideas for brands/ companies. 

  
Here is where I need your advice: 

1. Do you think this is a doable switch? And how much of a pay cut do you think I will have to take if switching focuses.?

2. What are job titles I should search for in LinkedIn/ Indeed that I would be qualified for as someone who has been working full time in social media marketing for 4 years and matches what I've described?

3. Do you have any classes/ courses in generalized I should take to feel more confident applying for a role in generalized marketing/ brand management/ brand marketing?

4. Do you think I should reach out to recruiters since I've feeling VERY overwhelmed on where to start? Do you have an recruiters you recommend for creative fields?

5. Lastly is there anything specific you think I should highlight when it comes to Social Media in my resume while still making sure it shows I understand Brand Management?

1hnxlfx,What job to pick?,"Okay, so after being laid off from what I thought was a great job in corporate HR- I now have two offers. I did a dental office admin course this year as a back up and am lucky enough to be offered two positions. 

Here's my situation: 

Job 1: its where I did my practicum. They have a high turn over amongst clinical staff and the dentist has a reputation of being hard to deal with. I never had any issues working there- but I was definitely caught in the cross fires of internal drama. This job pays more and has decent benefits. I feel if I can withstand the drama, I can actually move up here and get into a lead role- eventually management. It's also closer to home/shorter commute. Sundays/Mondays off. Rotating Saturdays off. 

Job 2: The dentist just seems like such a cool guy. They have solid retention with staff. Everyone seems really cool. But ofcourse there is drama everywhere and just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not there. Benefits are great- free dental care for me and my family. Slower promotion rate as there's so much older staff in line. Less pay. Sundays and 1 weekday off with rotating Saturdays off. Longer commute. 

I have no idea what to pick. I want to also say hoe truly blessed I feel to have these options in this economy.

* Going to hackathons and meetups (though mostly meeting other jobseekers or out-of-towners)
* Applying to roles like ""data science"" and ""AI engineer""
* Reaching out to my LinkedIn network and sometimes cold messaging after applying

1. Go back to school (would take 4 years)
2. Keep grinding and applying
3. Stay put at my current job

I graduated 2 weeks ago with a B.S. in Interdisciplinary Studies with concentrations in Natural & Physical Science. I have no idea where to go from here. I was pre-medical and then pre-dental, however now I’ve realized that I don’t want to work anywhere where I’d experience death (no hospitals/nursing homes). Here are some options (and their pros/cons):

Option 1: speech language pathology. The only issue is that the master’s programs range at over $100k and I’d have to take out loans. Since i’m not dying to do this work, I’m not sure if the debt will be worth it.

Option 2: dental hygienist. The starting pay near me is over $100k, which would be wonderful, however I’m worried that I’d get bored of the job. Also, I was previously working for a dental office for a few years, and unfortunately it was super toxic and has tainted my perception of the field. 

Option 3: some sort of engineer. I have a very analytical mind and feel like this would be the most mentally stimulating for me, but since I don’t have a bachelors degree in this field, I’m worried it would be a very long and expensive educational path for me to pursue.

Hello,

I apologize if my post is in the wrong subreddit. 

Got a message today regarding a job offer from Adecco. They redirected me to a person from ——. 
The job consists of me

- Submitting posts on a website (which kinda looks suspicious). It’s a bunch of products being put on list for advertisement and a small percentage is gained as commission. 

- Getting USDC bitcoin as commission 

- Transferring it to Crypto.com account 

- Transferring it back to website account to ‘reset’ it 

- Doing it a few times and then I get some bitcoin in my crypto account. 

- Selling that bitcoin gives me hard US dollar which I can transfer to my bank account. 


Is this….legal?

Am I committing any kind of fraud or crime by doing this? 

When I file taxes what should I list this under? Freelance work?

1hnqr6m,Need advice for career pivot,"Hello, as the title said, I don't know what to do. I want to be a app developer (web/mobile/desktop), but I don't know where to start.

For some context, I am currently a Unity game developer, focusing on mobile games (Android to be more specific). I learned C# first in college, but didn't get the chance to build any app in it since my course was ""specialization in game development"". We built some basic games in XNA, but that was it. We did not tackle different frameworks or anything. In short, I have no idea what to do or where to start in building an application. 

Now, I want to pivot to be an application developer since in where I live, there is a lot more opportunities for this career path. From what I read so far, ASP.NET Core is a must learn for this. I am now watching the freecodecamp video about this, I would just like to ask for advice here, if this is the only option for me, or there are some skills that I need to learn first (databases, html/css, etc), or anything that you can give me as an advice. 

You can also condemn me for focusing on Unity, I am also condemning myself as of this moment. ",raknaitu01,1,1.0,0,1735338396,2024-12-27 22:26:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hnqr6m/need_advice_for_career_pivot/,12,2024
1hnpzcj, Career change? Any suggestions? ,"So I'm kind of wondering whether I made a mistake regarding my career and that I may not be able (continue) work(ing) in it. I don't like Machiavellianism and I don’t like narcissistic personality disorder and if I had understood previously what those were, I would have immediately grasped that my line of work is full of those. I also know now that I will be unfortunately be able to work less years overall than I thought previously (so from that angle – had I known decades ago, I would have tried to get into air traffic control or the military :p Partially kidding cause the latter attracts the same). Previously, I used to always think “as long as I can afford rent and food and coffeeshops, I’m good”, but I was definitely born in the wrong generation for that… too late, with the housing crisis, no partner and inflation. If I had been born 20 years earlier: all good.

I realized recently that because I was so focused for many years on something else (I love the tasks! Love love love, but completely impossible with the folks that it draws), that there are so many different options that I never even knew about – for some of which I am too old now/it’s too late. So that’s my question to the hive mind: what would you suggest?

About me and my interests: I have a PhD in something that exists either in a very mathematical/engineering STEM-y configuration or in a policy one and I have the policy one and before that did history and business. I’ve published various stuff. I love reading everything there is about a subject. I love diving in and knowledge. I dislike fundraising. I hate anything to do with customer service, mainly because I hate being a customer so much myself. I have some media experience. I wouldn’t want to work for an oil or coal company. I love data and coming up with theories. I used to love people, but now I’m not sure anymore. I love music and stages (and have worked as a side gig in various things to do with music and drama), but then again: too old to start there, plus too many narcs as well, it’s just that in my roles I wasn’t in contact with that part.

I love pondering how something could be improved.

If I know what to do, I massively prefer fast-paced environments with lots of change and tons of partners, but I have worked a job in which I had only been hired to basically insult/reassert power over someone else and was given close to no instruction – hated that. It was fastpaced, but I constantly had no clue what was going on. I’m used to working with many different other actors in many different countries in different time zones in five languages and also love traveling for work (but can’t be trucker or cabby cause I never got my driver’s license ;).

*I think I'd really like to not constantly have to play 3D chess all the time to understand just how self-serving people are. I can understand most of it now in hindsight (as in: understand the motivations and why someone did something that I consider immoral, but I just don't want to constantly have to face it).* ",No-Advantage-579,1,0.6000000238418579,1,1735336324,2024-12-27 21:52:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hnpzcj/career_change_any_suggestions/,12,2024
1hnpvkp,How do I recover from my self-inflicted downward spiral?,"I’m in my early 20’s and have been at my job (my first ever career) for 4 years. I love my job, my boss is fantastic, I have great performance reviews, and up until recently I’ve had no bad feelings.

Now the parts where I’ve fucked up… I’m a chronic oversharer. I don’t know what is wrong with my brain, but I say things and then wonder why on earth anybody would care to hear it. Afterwards I feel so much shame and embarrassment… I’ve talked about my eating disorder, postpartum struggles, anxiety. I don’t know why I do this and have come to learn how unprofessional it is. 

I also have a fairly gossipy workplace. There are three leads in particular who are extremely gossipy and who many outside of my workgroup have classified as bullies. I have obviously, stupidly given my coworkers a lot of content to gossip about and when I hear gossip, it puts me into such a bad mental state because I can’t stop thinking what they must be saying behind my back. It’s gotten to the point where I bought a whole new wardrobe feeling like I’d be made fun of for what I had been wearing prior. At the same time, sometimes I find myself sucked into gossiping about others, whether it be venting or what-not which is also terrible…

I’m in the running to be considered for a lead role. A few days ago I saw a document a lead had written about me that was not intended for my eyes. It was harsh, included partially untrue statements, expectations for me that were impossible for me to achieve having never been trained to do the task before, and had speculations about my feelings towards another individual which confirmed my suspicions that I am being gossiped about. I felt crushed, lost, and like I will never be able to grow in my current workgroup. 

Feeling totally worthless, I talked to my boss about some of what I saw and that I’d like a break from our current workgroup (it’s common for people to rotate to other workgroups for shadowing for a few months then come back to the current workgroup). I also mentioned the gossiping issue that has been affecting me terribly for months now. He said I shouldn’t read into what I saw too much and plans to address the gossiping both individually and as a group.


I can’t stop thinking about what a stupid unprofessional idiot I am. Why I can’t keep my mouth shut and make private matters public. Why I let gossip get to me and why I participate it when I hate it so much. Why I care what someone wrote about me in their private notes to the point that I blabbed about it to my boss… I don’t know what to do. I feel like I need to run away from my current job because I can’t recover from my unprofessionalism I’ve shown everyone here. How do I move forward from this? Do I need to quit and try again having learned from my mistakes? I feel like I’m in a constant state of panic and anxiety as a result of my past actions and like I’m digging myself a deeper and deeper hole until I’ve self sabotaged to the point of never getting promoted to the leadership roles I so strongly desire ",socialanxietyx8,2,0.6299999952316284,3,1735336056,2024-12-27 21:47:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hnpvkp/how_do_i_recover_from_my_selfinflicted_downward/,12,2024

1hno1m3,Accountant to HVAC?,"I’ve been working in public accounting for the past 6 years and I’m hitting my breaking point. I’ve worked for 3 companies all in their audit practice. The work has never been enjoyable to me and I definitely hoped for something more exciting when I was completing my bachelors degree. Audit is sold as the more social and outgoing side of accounting so I decided to move in that direction since it suits my personality. The empty feeling of sitting behind a computer all day, not socializing, has led me to explore what else is out there.

A little background. 29M. I grew up on my grandparent’s raisin farm and I miss the feeling of physical labor. I love to workout and run. Meet new people. Play basketball. Work on my truck. To me, nothing beats getting home after a long day of getting my ass kicked. And the results are concrete and dependent upon my effort.

I’ve been flirting with the idea of learning the HVAC trade. It seems challenging and physical, and especially in demand here in Las Vegas. It will also throw me into the community and get me out of the house meeting new people. Would it be crazy for me to start a new career as an HVAC tech? This seems like the perfect opportunity to have a meaningful job that’s physical, mechanical, and presents new challenges everyday.

1hnnd46,Should I Leave My Job?,"Hey guys, 

I'm 27, been working at my current company for not quite 5 years now. I moved up quickly, started at entry level and now I've been salary for about a year. The place has been good to me personally since the start, minus a few gripes here and there that are fairly minor. The thing is, almost everyone else at the supervisor level and below hates it here. It's to the point that when a similar company started hiring in a city a couple of hours away around a quarter of our 400 employees applied. Our top leadership did something to put a freeze on the other company hiring from our talent pool, but a few people that I really respected ended up going before that, all but one taking a pay cut. I keep hearing how much better it is over there from people who left, and I've heard from several people about shady things our leadership has done to other managers here. The whole place seems like it's going through a rough patch, and they do things like canceling the Christmas bonus for they hourly guys which just makes everyone even more mad. It seems like they have a really hard time getting competent people in key positions, and they essentially do nothing to try and keep the people who have been here for 10+ years. This is good for me because the turn over above me makes room for me to move up, but once I get the next promotion I'll probably be capped out for growth here. In the mean time I'm comfortable enough, I like what I do and I like the people I do it with. 

My question is, should I be looking for greener pastures like my peers, or should I stick it out since the lack of eligible candidates for the next level of position would give me more negotiating power for things like pay?

1hnmjpe,Are all car sales jobs like this?,"A bit of background, I’ve always loved cars and wanted to work in cars. I have been in finance for the past 7 years (basically my entire career and recently got a job as a Sales Executive for a main car dealer. Minimum wage with on target earnings of £50k a year and I hate it.

- Firstly the hours suck, I work 50 hours 5 days a week. I almost never have time to take a lunch break and there is constant pressure to come in on my days off. None of my work if covered, so if I’m off customer cars are not getting prepped. If a customer wants to collect there car on a day I have off, I have no choice but to come in or loose my commission. So everyone comes in on there day off.

- Management is blunt and quite rude. I feel like I constantly have to justify myself and get told off for contracting things (spending too long with a customer, spending too little time with a customer) etc. Whenever I sell a car or come close to selling a car and inform my managers I feel like I’m just waiting to get told off for something mundane.

- There is constant pressure to sell, god forbid someone comes in and doesn’t buy a car. I have to call up people with a year old car and try and get them in to ‘value it’ and try and sell them another one.

- There is a general arrogance amongst management. They seem to think that nobody actually wants to buy a car but it is there brilliant skills that get people to buy a car. My managers never accept that they might be wrong, even if they are sometimes.

- There is also some questionable ethics like ‘refinancing’ by buying there car off them, doing a service and selling it back to them for £1,500 with a new finance package. But not actually telling them about the price difference unless they find out by reading the fine print.

Basically from Saudi Arabia I was accepted three months ago into medical school dental school engineering school and computer science and chose dentistry was happy about it for a few weeks then after some researche, I only realized how oversaturated it is, and it is getting, and it will be in 10 years when I graduate so after trying to cope for like a month or two I finally came up with a decision to change and leave dentistry 
Now I’m living in deep regret and extreme depression. I feel like I should’ve chosen medical school. I don’t have a certain passion by the way or interests, my own passion is for a happy life (money could help). I’m currently regretting not choosing medical school. 
Basically, I have three options in front of me and I want your help. First option is to join in energy engineering bachelor then go to Germany and make a masters in renewables then work there in Germany for like 5 to 10 years for some international experience then come back to Saudi Arabia its problem is although the demand will be extremely high, because of the future projects in Ksa, the salaries might be lower than CS or Med
Second option is computer science then masters in AI OR ML From the UK and then come back to Saudi Arabia the problem in this one is the high risk of oversaturation
Third option is try my luck for med school next year and if it doesn’t work, I will change next year to either energy engineering or computer science 
I’m feeling very depressed. I’m feeling like I’m a burden on my family and my parents were very supportive. They let me choose and me as an idiot. I chose dentistry without researching now that I did some research. I found out that it was the worst out for please tell me which one to choose .

1hnk94a,How to Handle a Co-worker Who Seems to Dislike Me?,"Hey everyone, I need some advice. I work remotely, and one of my coworkers is in charge of organizing team events, like weekly meetings and monthly social hangouts. The problem is, she seems to avoid engaging with me. For example, she skips over me when asking questions or involving people in games, and when I try to chat with her or ask about things she likes, she gives short, curt replies. With others, she’s much more friendly and outgoing.

We met once in person, and even then, she barely acknowledged me, but she was super warm with others. I can’t think of anything I’ve done to upset her, but it’s starting to bother me. Our manager seems to like her a lot and praises her often, so I’m worried her attitude toward me could impact how he sees me.

Should I bring this up to her, let it go, or focus on building a stronger relationship with my manager? Has anyone dealt with something like this? Any tips would be really helpful.

1hniz0d,American/Brit worried for future career...,"I am in currently quite the pickle and am curious as to see what professionals could possibly advise. I'm in my final year of a Russell (uk quasi-equivalent to Ivy League) university, studying Law; however, my issue is that I am a multinational American/Brit. I am aware that these seem like pretty good cards, but the problem arises in the sense that if go on to pursue being a solicitor in the UK, and in 10 years time decide to move to the states. Unless I go to NY or California, my potential UK experience/qualifications hold no value, as the USA legal system is so different, which would lead me essentially having to restart my career, along with wage :(

This leads me to the conundrum however as to whether or not I ought to pursue Law career wise, or if people might have advice regarding an industry that lends itself to being flexible to me being able to transfer country whilst still keeping my qualifications/career intact. 

I am specifically asking this now as I am currently in the midst of applying to as many trainee schemes as possible; am I wasting my time, and should I change who/what I am applying to?

1hnixsn,Am I making the right career decision?,"I got a federal job offer working for the FDIC as a regulator in bank auditing. I currently have only 4 years working in the private sector in a community sized bank. I'm a really late bloomer though, so I graduated college in my late 20s, and I am now in my mid-30s. I am hoping that going into the regulatory space will give me a leg up and raise my value when I eventually go back into the private sector within the next 5 years.

  
The kicker is that this job requires me to move to another state at my own expense. I am expecting the move to cost me around $8,000 total. I currently make $100k + 25% bonus every year in my current role and my new job at the FDIC isn't a raise but a match. The FDIC's annual raise is low at about 2% average per year based on what HR told me at the FDIC.

  
I am currently unmarried, and I have no kids, so I don't really have any obligations other than taking care of my parents, who will have to move with me. By the time I move back to the private sector, I will be age 40.

  
In my opinion, I think I am making a good investment for my career development. I know someone who had a similar path, but he was already a well-established VP at a bank before going into a federal role.

I worked in a small restaurant(as a porter) then i realized i didnt have experience with hotel (so i got housekeeping) //  with all this i knew I was happy in a restaurant sector, so when i had an opportunity to leave Canada and went for Brazil (was hard at first because of the language barrier) but i was thankful that i got a job in a restaurant(as a all round server/receptionist). 

And now im working as a Assistant Gelato Maker - i am making great money but my question is can i bring this experience back to Canada or if ever I go for another country. I do stay in my work for long time, the only reason i leave my job is because of the pay or at some point i get tired with the people's drama.

1hnifhs,I feel so trapped. Advice needed,"
I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I am in need of advice. 

I have four years of administrative, events and operations experience. I am working towards finishing my degree in Merchandising and Marketing with about two years left. (For reference I am 25f) 

I am currently working two jobs at a nice retail store and a fast food restaurant. The retail job is relatively enjoyable, but the hours aren’t great. I loathe the fast food job.

I just feel like I am not working towards anything concerning my career. I recently moved back in with my parents to graduate debt free— so I don’t have a lot of bills. 

I just don’t know what I should do to move forward and find a better job without a degree. Should I quit my fast food job to free up more time to find something full time? I am located in the Memphis, TN area, and the job market is mostly healthcare related. 

It’s so hard to not feel stuck and compare myself to others Please, I would love any advice on what to do! :-) ",Skybug__,2,0.6299999952316284,2,1735316448,2024-12-27 16:20:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hnifhs/i_feel_so_trapped_advice_needed/,12,2024
1hnhp6l,Offer incoming but my dream job is still in play — what should I do?,"I’m in a bit of a tricky spot and could use some advice on how to navigate this.

Here’s the situation:
	•	Last week, I wrapped up final interviews with Company A. A few days later, I had a screening call with Company B, which is my top choice. During the call, I mentioned that I had finished final interviews elsewhere, and the recruiter at Company B said they’d nudge the hiring manager since they believe I’m a strong candidate.
	•	I also networked with someone at Company B who forwarded my resume to the hiring manager. They came back saying they liked my profile, so it feels like things are moving in the right direction with Company B, but no formal next steps yet.
	•	This week (the week of Christmas), I received an email from Company A saying they’re working on putting together an offer, but with the holidays, it might take some time.

Here’s where I need advice:
	1.	Should I tell Company B about the pending offer from Company A now, or wait until I have the official offer in hand?
	2.	If I do inform Company B, how do I do it in a way that doesn’t come across as applying too much pressure or potentially hurt my chances with them?
	3.	If I get the offer from Company A before hearing back from Company B, should I accept it while continuing to interview with Company B? Or would that be risky/unethical?

With New Year’s around the corner and holiday schedules slowing things down, I’m not sure how to proceed.

1hnh75m,New management driving employees away ,"So basically I’ve been at my job 5+ years along with the people I have on my team after years of promotions. There’s a total of 7 of us plus our new supervisor.


Two of the employees where brought in my the sup bc we had a mass firing and were short staffed but these two ppl have zero experience and neither does our new supervisor. It’s been 9 months. The new girls don’t listen take direction or notes. The same things have to be repeated over and over and it’s to the point me and two other people are ready to leave. The 3 of us have been there 6 years and already know the system the best. Our sup relies on me and my colleague for EVERYTHING bc she’s severely under qualified and has no idea what’s going on.

Myself and my colleague reached out to her  letting her know the new girls are not working at all and when they are provided step by step directions they just do whatever they wants or just don’t do it.

Supervisors constant excuse is she and the two new girls are having a hard time digesting the information. 

The real issue is my supervisor is under the new vice president who also knows absolutely nothing and apparently they are all friends outside of work. The VP of our dept, my supervisor and the two bad employees. 

What can I even do? I feel like telling my sup that I can’t work with these two individuals doing all their work anymore bc they don’t learn they just literally have me doing their work. I’ve told her this minus the leaving part but 3 of us are about to leave and the company will literally be in shambles bc they are depending on me and my colleague to run this dept even tho we aren’t even team leads!

1hngm93,Should I Give Up Engineering? ,"Ive been working for a small city government. I have been working on project plans for several months off and on and now the project needs to go out for bid.  It was extremely challenging to do— rehabbing a steep street and  sanitary system, putting in new storm lines.  

Now the amount of mistakes and time I have wasted on this project is unacceptable to me. Mostly involving the math, like with vertical curves not being drawn correctly (yes I do this manually on autocad ) I have reviewed other engineering plans which have a lot of mistakes, but mine goes above and beyond. I keep finding something new and have to spend half a day correcting it. I have done this over and over. The only person that knows how to do this stuff too doesn’t make sense half the time. He speaks too fast and doesn’t clearly show me the calculations he’s doing. I have in the past asked him to repeat himself but I still don’t get it. So I have given up asking him most of the time. Honestly in general, although he’s a nice guy and extremely smart and knowledgeable, he stresses me out to no end and I just about jump out of my seat every time he walks by. However I know this is a me problem. But I just have such a hard time working with him and now feel like a failure. Because I have failed pretty badly. 

Anyways I don’t know how many thousands of dollars have been spent on me screwing this up. And now I’m wondering if I should quit engineering altogether. I am naturally gifted in creative arts and am sad I poured so much time and energy into engineering when I could have poured the same time and energy into what I am already good at. I did well in school but for me at least it has almost no correlation to the real world. 


The only good thing is that someone in the more admin role will quit very soon so I won’t get fired because they’ll be too short staffed. But I also don’t think I’m cut out for this. And this is an ‘easy’ job for the government. I probably would have been long gone in the private sector. However I am wondering if I should resign because of how bad at this I am and how even after seeming to learn from the past mistakes I repeat them in trying to make corrections and am simply never going to get it.

1hngaqg,How to deal with toxic co workers and Boss? ,"So it all started when I was a student shadowing here. This girl call her Dina who people have literally said that she a bee word was quite rude to me one day. Wouldn’t let me shadow her despite her being the only who is certified. She wrote me a bad review to my school about me that even my school called me and called her a mean hearted person. ever since she is always very short with me even after I got hired and will be very friendly to like only 3 people there is a clear distinction. . I work in OR and sit in cases for a while and no one ever gives me breaks which is fine I take it as this is my case I will sit in it.  However this week this girl Laura was supposed to share a case with another girl. She also was assigned two small case that take 5 minutes later in the day. Instead of going to get her partner she waited 3 hours until her 5 minutes cases were going and then asked me to do them anyway which I thought was silly and used the excuse she needed to give her partner a break. I said to Dina  that’s silly that she didn’t go in to help her partner 3 hours ago and Bee got very defensive and said well she’s been sharing with another girl Amy which( she wasn’t). I spoke with Amy and she called my boss to let her know but my boss didn’t pick up so I said I would text my boss for her bc my boss doesn’t like her that much.  Anyway when I brought it up to Dina she then said “ laura doing work not just sitting around doing nothing” bc my case ended early so she said it as a jab. I texted my boss about Laura not helping and my boss read my text to the whole room and now everyone hates me and isn’t talking to me . The only reason I didn’t help anyone was because I have never been helped but now I’m the jerk bc I opened my big mouth.

1hnfkmz,Finally Passed the Network+ on My Second Try! 😅,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share a bit of my journey with you all. Honestly, failing the first time was tough... I felt pretty defeated. But I wasn’t ready to give up – I knew I had to face the exam again, and this time I promised myself I’d come prepared.

So, here’s what worked for me (and maybe it’ll help someone else too):

* First of all, I didn’t realize how tricky some of the questions would be on the first attempt. The Network+ is no joke 😩! The topics seemed straightforward, but then you get into the weeds of h\*ow \*they test you... yeah, didn’t see that coming.
* The second time around, I changed the way I studied. I found [Edusum](https://www.edusum.com/comptia) practice exams, and they seriously made a difference for me. The way they structure their questions felt so much like the real exam. It wasn’t just about knowing the material – I started to understand the test itself. The practice questions there kinda opened my eyes to how they frame things on the actual exam.
* Also, I *slowed down* a bit when studying. The first time I rushed through some topics thinking “I got this.” Nope. Second attempt, I focused more on the basics, especially subnetting and troubleshooting... seriously underestimated those on my first go 😬.
* One thing that kept me going was reminding myself why I’m doing this in the first place. There were days I was like “maybe I’m just not cut out for this,” but I knew I couldn’t give up. Every time I wanted to quit, I took a step back, remembered my goals, and kept going.
* Oh, and YouTube was my savior – found some great videos that broke down concepts in a way that made them stick. Thank you, random YouTubers!

In the end, it’s all about perseverance. For anyone who’s struggling or didn’t pass on the first try, trust me – I’ve been there. Just keep at it, keep practicing (seriously, Edusum exams were gold), and don’t lose hope. You *can* do this. 🙌

Good luck to everyone studying for their certs! If I can pass, so can you.",OneSignal5087,2,1.0,1,1735308353,2024-12-27 14:05:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hnfkmz/finally_passed_the_network_on_my_second_try/,12,2024

1hnddko,Delayed Start Date,"Hi, posting here as looking for any advice or suggestions on what to do after a very unexpected delay to a start date.

After many months of not enjoying my job/role for a variety of reasons, I looked elsewhere for other opportunities and was lucky to have been offered what appeared to be an ideal job in a sector I've always been interested in working in.
I accepted and signed an offer last month (final offer signed 2nd week of Nov) and popped in my months notice for my job and had enough holidays not worked to essentially not work in Dec at all except the first week (my former job was very strict on making sure all holidays were used in the year and refused to take them forward into the next year) so left at the start of the month with my final paycheck mainly being those not-worked holidays. All off-boarding for my old role has been completed and everything's been sorted onboarding wise for new role so essentially ready to go and had my start date for my new job at the beginning of January (as outlined in my contract and in the initial interview several months ago).

However, I received a phone call three days before Christmas stating that due to 3rd party funding issues, that my (and some other new starts in Jan) start dates would be pushed back to the first week of April.
I'm rather shocked by this news just before Christmas and reached out to my new manager after the call (who's been chatty over phone and I've met in person the week before receiving this news) to clarify what's going on and he got back the next day asking for a call to talk, but I asked if I could postpone this for a few days as I was completely blindsided by the news at the time but will be calling him later today or tomorrow.

I know a friend-of-a-friend who works for this company and have reached out to check what's going on and was told that he was shocked by the news as had no idea such delays were going on but couldn't give any more info than that.

I guess my main point in posting this is just to ask for advice?
Currently considering looking for new roles entirely as feel quite let down as nothing about funding or any issues or red flags have come up before, and worried that if I hang about waiting for this role they could delay further or cancel whenever they want and ultimately I can't not work for 3 months waiting for this proposed start date. 

Anyone else been in a similar situation? And if so, any advice or what worked best?",Hedgehogsnberries,5,0.8600000143051147,3,1735300649,2024-12-27 11:57:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hnddko/delayed_start_date/,12,2024
1hnd98e,Choosing between jobs,"I have a bit of a conundrum. I’m currently working in a company as a tech lead and my time is split between technical work and managerial work. The proportion between the two varies from week to week.

I recently interviewed for another job where they offer a purely technical role in a similar domain in the military space for approx. 2% paycut, which is quite good considering I won’t be a lead anymore. The bonus is quite small at the new place compared to 10% at my current place and is 1 hr drive away compared to my current job which is a 10 min walk.

I spoke to my manager and told them I would be leaving soon and I will hand in my resignation. I have since been offered a 10% raise and the promise that I can do purely technical work as I’m desperately needed within the company.

I am quite keen to work in this new place as the work is more challenging and more intense but at the same time I’m conflicted since I’m being made new assurances and being offered more money in a place I know and understand. In my current place I’m frustrated by the stakeholders I have to work with and the speed at which decisions are made as well as this constant bouncing around between technical and managerial work.

New company has 20 people and the current company is a big corporation for additional context.

What practical advice can people give me? I’m struggling to make a decision. Bear in mind, I only became the lead because at the time it was needed, and it wasn’t purely out of choice.

1hnd0km,Am I being reasonable for wanting to leave my job?,"I am 30 years old. Female.

My job currently pays $70k/year. Great benefits. 17% RRSP. And up to 30% bonus annually. There are progression stages where in 4 years I would be at my top salary at 95k/year. (Last year for example, top salary received about 120k including bonus) Plus there is cost of living raise of $2-4k/year. 

However, I have been dreading going to my job for months now. I have been here for a little over a year.

Reasons are:
-Coworkers are amazing except for one ever since I started. She has been with the company just a few more months than me. She bullies me, she has yelled at me twice before, has a very difficult personality to work with (supervisor knows this). She is supposed to be my trainer, but has been disinterested in training me ever since I started, so I feel I'm not caught up with knowing what I should know by now. My boss knows multiple occurances that showed her bad behavior, but since she's a hardworker, it makes it look like I'm just finding a way to complain.
-This is not a field of work I intend to form my career in. In addition, I am exposed to dangerous fumes and chemicals. I am afraid that this has affected my health in such a short period of time. I get sick more, my chest hurts every time I'm back to work, I recently had my period for about 2 months straight and that's never happened to me before. I am afraid that I might develop something serious in the future. Also, chemicals I work with could change my dna. I don't want this to affect me and kids I would have in the future.
-I have been desperately wanting to focus on me, school, and my YouTube channel. I want to improve myself mentally, academically, improve my communication skills, and I really want to continue a YouTube channel that I worked on for a couple of months two years ago. I am very passionate about this and it would make me happy. Only reason I stopped then is because of finances. I have about $80k of savings. I have no mortgage, car, or monthly payments. I would be able to get a grant for my studies, so most of my tuition fee would be paid for. Despite of all the savings that I have, I fear not having a deposited amount to my bank account bi-weekly. Though I am not enjoying my job currently, it is freeing to know that I am earning money and I am able to buy things I wouldn't buy if I didn't have a job.

Am I being reasonable? Are my reasons valid/good enough to leave my job? Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time.

1hnchwj,How do I get better at interviewing? Please help.,"I am sure that all my failed interview are my fault. I either end up showing that I'm over qualified or under qualified. I have experience in tech and I am going back to school to finish my degree. I have been applying to everything because I desperately need a job.

My depression and anxiety is also making this process worse for me.

1hn9y4k,Am I being underpaid (again?),"My background:

I have 4 degrees. One is an M.A. in linguistics and one is a language degree in Japan in Business Japanese. I also have an undergrad in electrical engineering at a school within the top 5 engineering schools in the US. The other degree isn’t really marketable.

I lived in Japan almost 10 years. I have 5 years experience in technical translation and conference interpreting for engineers. While working for a Japanese automotive company as an interpreter I could not get a raise for the life of me (nor could anyone else in my department). I found out most of us were making pennies more than the sophomore engineering interns, lol. So naturally I quit and studied electrical engineering to begin a new career.

Almost exactly a year ago I graduated and began a job as a “customer engineer” at a Japanese company in the semiconductor industry on the west coast.

I work on laser machines. I primarily (like 80% or more of my time) work on optical systems, so I suppose it would be more accurate to call myself an optical systems engineer now.

I’m being sent to Japan for a few months to interpret for fellow American engineers while simultaneously working on optical systems as an optical systems engineer. I feel like this boosts my resume a bit.

I think it’s important to note that Japanese companies tend to be very stingy about pay. It doesn’t really matter what your resume, experience, blah blah blah is, we’re all going to get paid pennies until we quit and someone else replaces us with less experience. They don’t care, they’ll just throw more incredibly dedicated engineers from Japan to oil things along until they find a replacement. 

My base pay is 60k. Apparently starting pay for optical is much much higher.

I’ve been told that starting next year I’ll be eligible for a 10k bonus but oh wait just kidding economy is bad apparently so I probably won’t get that now. At least I finally have health insurance for the first time in my life?

Forgive my bitterness.
Am I being entitled? I work 10-13 hours a day and have to come in on weekends 2 times a month. I do get overtime pay at least.

I tried getting into the semiconductor industry specifically because I heard the pay is much better, but honestly it’s so low at this company I think I could have gotten more if I just stayed in interpreting with my qualifications.

I’m willing to move away from Japanese companies if it means I’ll finally get what other engineers make. Apparently for optical engineers my base pay is so low that it doesn’t even register on the scale?

Please be kind in the comments. I already have enough self loathing for allowing myself to be taken advantage of for so long that I don’t need any more non helpful reasons to hate myself.",Narrackian_Wizard,0,0.4000000059604645,8,1735285548,2024-12-27 07:45:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hn9y4k/am_i_being_underpaid_again/,12,2024

1hn4t3g,Is my dream achievable? ,"Had a strong passion for art. Got scared to pursue it. Ended up taking an unrelated bachelor’s major in a shitty university in a country I hate to live in. I got depressed and lost all purpose to live life.

For almost 17 years of my life, I was so sure that I would go to an art school. I have done a lot of freelancing work, including creating invitations, posters, and logos for my school/ friends/ family and being one of the headset designers for my high school play. I love art, I love being involved in big projects, and utilizing creativity for problem-solving. However, it only took me one hesitation to destroy my dreams. 

Growing up with such high expectations enforced on me to perform and excel in art by my environment, I began to be very critical and harsh on myself. Soon enough, just looking at a blank piece of paper caused me so much anxiety that more than once, I had a panic attack due to it. It started to go downhill after this. I became very embarrassed and critical of my creations; I was a perfectionist, and I was stressed and frustrated that my performance was not up to par with my unrealistic standards. It doesn’t help that the people around me also kept on telling me how an art career would be financially unsustainable to me, whose family is undergoing financial issues as well. I started doubting my dreams and my future career.

That’s how I ended up here right now. I am currently taking a Bachelor of Environmental Science and Business in a shitty university in a country whose environment does not suit me. In short, I was miserable. I thought this major would provide me with a broader career aspect whereby its financial prospects would be more stable and sustainable than if I were to go to an art school— but I was wrong. I got severely depressed and unmotivated as if I lost all sense of control in my life. Sometimes, I thought about ending it all due to it and felt like I had no purpose in life.

Now, I’m one year away from finishing this bachelor's degree. Thankfully, after many unsuccessful career counseling sessions, career quizzes, and tears, I finally re-discover my life dream. Just like how I enjoyed being a set designer for a musical, I discovered that I enjoyed being part of a project's spatial planning/design process to maximize customer experience. Akin to being a concept artist or an art director for films or other entertainment projects, which is my initial dream career, I envision myself working on short-term projects like anime conventions, music festivals to long-term projects such as designing a zoo/ theme parks/ hotel layout to maximize customer experience and satisfaction.

In short, my interests fall under hospitality/ event planning/ interior designing/ crowd management/ experience design. Understanding the psychology and scientific reasoning behind how things work and then creating a solution or design to achieve better customer satisfaction is something I am very keen to do. Thus, I believe that a career in event management would help me achieve that dream ( though I’m still unsure if this is the only route to it ).

However, as I am planning to pursue my master's degree and potentially start working in other countries such as the Netherlands and New Zealand (countries that better fit me and have a good career prospect for international students), the more I tried searching for masters degree that fall under my interests in these countries, the more disappointed and discouraged I felt. The universities in those countries held little to no options for a master's degree in event management, hospitality management, etc. I was also looking at a Master's in Interior Architecture. However, I’m also unsure whether I could use that degree to achieve my dream.

If possible, I don’t want to force myself to commit to something I don't have a passion for. I have felt first-hand how destructive and depressive that pathway can be. Right now, I finally feel a glimmer of hope; I can finally envision myself living and thriving in the future. However, due to my current situation, I have no clue whether this dream is achievable and I am also unsure which masters degree I should get due to the little option.",SeaArea3680,1,1.0,2,1735266871,2024-12-27 02:34:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hn4t3g/is_my_dream_achievable/,12,2024

Now mind you I've never worked in law before. I barely know what 90% of the lingo they were using, so I did the best I could, asked a coworker and did my best. 

Well today boss lady was working from home and called me to tell me how I messed up the ""assignment"" and how two other cases didn't have a ""full and final"" signed and scanned into their ""matters"". Like I'm supposed to magically know this crap. Anyway those two full and finals were resolved and I passed on the catastrophe to my coworker since I clearly don't know what the frick I'm doing. 

Now I know I'm a bit sensitive right now, as I have horrible dental pain and since it happened on Christmas day no dentist can see me until new years, so I'm miserable, in pain, exhausted and starving since I can't eat anything either. So I'm a little sensitive today. I've always been the kind of person where if I mess something up I want to be told. I'll never learn otherwise, but I don't appreciate being given a vague assignment then a half hour lecture about how I screwed up. 

Should I just accept that I'm a bit touchy today and take the criticism as a learning experience, or accept that this is not the field for me.

1hn2uwh,Questioning if I should leave my job,"I’ve been in my current role for 4 years. I’ve always received great feedback and have mostly enjoyed the workplace culture, but recent events have made me question if I should quit. 

There is one aspect of my job that I excel at more than any other and my boss knows I am passionate about. I have done so much to improve this role over the years which is quite critical to our work. Recently a lead position opened up for this role and instead of promoting me into it, my boss placed another employee from a different group into the role who I trained to do the job and only has 4 months experience in it. I am a current GS13 employee and the role is a GS14. I have time in grade but the person who got placed into the role was already a 14. My boss said the work was too critical to have a “GS13 in the role”. This felt very demeaning and I feel like I have no growth potential in my group 

I’ve also not felt good lately in my work group due to all the workplace gossip. I always feel like if others are talking crap about each other and others we work with all the time, they are probably talking crap about me as well and it’s really affecting my mental health. I have a tendency to over share which is my own fault, and am now super self conscious of what others say about me. This all came to a head in a recent training week with leads in my group. I came across a document about my performance throughout the week which included unprofessional comments about me personally that had nothing to do with my performance. One note talked about perceptions that I resent the person who got placed in the GS14 role and another documented a misstep that was over exaggerated and included details that are not true. I was incredibly hurt by this. This document was clearly intended to send to my manager. 

I did report the gossip to my manager and noted some of what I saw in the document. I said I felt like I’m struggling to see a path to succeed in the group currently. My manager plans to address the gossip, but now I feel like I should have not said anything and I’ve dug myself into a hole. Partially because now in retrospect I’m questioning if I’ve been a major contributor to the gossip too recently - as it’s so engrained in our workplace culture. How do I get out of this feeling like I’ve got no path forward or have screwed myself in some way? If you were in my shoes would you be looking for a new job?",socialanxietyx8,1,1.0,1,1735260770,2024-12-27 00:52:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hn2uwh/questioning_if_i_should_leave_my_job/,12,2024
1hn2j7v,I have graduated college and I have no idea what I want to do as a career,"So, I graduated college with a degree in design. It was in the English department of my college so less design and more text analysis. I have learned nothing. Can’t get a job with it and I have given up on that degree.
I am about to become a medical assistant. I figured it could get me a job and get me by with okay pay till I figure out what I want to do. Here is the problem, I’ve been out of college for a year and have no direction. I’d like to mention I graduated college and high school early so I am young. But it sucks I don’t know what to do and I can’t go back to college, at least 4 year cause it’s too expensive and my college is far away so I can’t just go back. 
I am wanting to do the Disney college program next summer after I get licensed as a medical assistant so I can experience it since I won’t be qualified to do it after December of next year, so only 2 application cycles. I know it will set me back a bit but in medical assisting, there is always a job and most of them ask for a license which I will have prior to the program. I know it may seem like a waste of time, but it’s a reputable company and it gives me some time to think about some other career paths and just gives me and my parents a break. I’ve already asked the medical assistant subreddit and they said it was a good idea, but I’m wondering what y’all think. I’m pretty young so I have a decent amount of time to figure out a career and medical assisting is not permanent. At best id make 22-24 an hour and that’s with like 3-5 years experience.
I am leaning towards a career where I can work on computers and work more independently, so I’m looking at medical coding but the pay is not the best. Median pay being around 26 an hour which is good but not great. 
I am good with computers and I am good with learning new softwares and stuff, so there is that.

What do y’all think about this? Any insight y’all can give? Just any advice would be appreciated. ",Hungry_Move3673,4,1.0,3,1735259829,2024-12-27 00:37:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hn2j7v/i_have_graduated_college_and_i_have_no_idea_what/,12,2024

Pretty much everyone except my wife is disappointed in my life choices and where I’m at. I have 5 yrs experience in oil & gas as a laborer. Made good money but suffered mentally. And of course the odd job. (Always labor)

I would like to take this time to learn a new marketable skill so i can make more money or possibly freelance eventually if i get injured again. I’m so hesitant to pull the trigger because I’ve been flakey with computer courses before in my early 20s. Im very interested in pursuing something lucrative and stable but I’m afraid that sitting at a desk all day and not being outside will make me very unhappy (been looking into data analysis, coding, IT, etc.) . I have a passion for adventure sports but seriously doubt if I can make good money from that. I moved to the mountains to be outside. I’ve only recently become what I would consider “emotionally & logically mature” (I’m sure I would disagree with this in a few years).

1hn0hu1,Lower than expected performance review and peers paid more than me. How do I ask for a reevaluation/bigger raise?,"Hi folks, I have been working for my current employer for 2.5 years. I started out in a junior role but was promoted Jan of this year. My manager really likes me and says I have leadership potential. Both my manager and my director trust me a lot and assign me more complex work than others. I regularly work late to make up for our team being understaffed and my manager knows this.

For my yearly review I got an ""average/meets expectations"" which was a bit of a surprise. My manager seemed nervous when she told me. She explained that it's because it's my first year in this role that I can't be graded higher, and because she can only give out so many ""above averages"" - she implied she gave that to a colleague who is lower-level. 

A little while ago she also told me that she only has 15% in raise budget to split amongst our team of 8 for next year, so even those rated as ""above average"" may only get a \~2-3% raise at best.   
  
To top it off, last week I had to do an employee compensation report (due to my role I see confidential employee data often), and I saw I'm the lowest paid person on my team and another team (same roles but different projects). Even if I got a 3% increase I would still be \~10k behind most of my peers. I think I have the least amount of experience on my team in terms of time in this field, but given the kind of work I'm assigned and that I have ""leadership potential"", it kind of upset me.

I'm not sure if I should do anything about it. I don't have a ton of ""leverage"" in terms of an ultimatum (our field is niche, not a lot of openings, manager knows I'm not going anywhere). We have no formal job descriptions, so I have nothing to compare my accomplishments to, except for comparing against others. And I don't want to make it just about my peers... but I think I deserve to by paid close to the same amount. We're a billion dollar company and 10k should be chump change.

If you were in my position, what would you do, if anything?

In a way it has all sort of snowballed into one big mess.

I have now applied for a couple positions else where but haven't heard back and going to work is beginning to become unbearable and is affecting my life outside of work, at what point do I call it quits even though I don't have a job lined up and how bad would this affect my future when applying for new job roles?

So, I'm 24. I still don't have a degree (I'll have it next semester), and I'm currently working on a new job.
Well, ""working"" maybe isn't the right term. They hired us on the 23th, just a bit before Christmas, and I just went there on that day, and today (26). I haven't actually ""worked"" yet, these two days I've been just learning about the job.
I can't talk too much about the work itself, because of NDA. But I'll say that the place is nice, the people are nice, and the job is considerably nice too. The problem is me.
I work from 6 am to 3pm, Mondays to Fridays, but I do need to go on Saturdays, Sundays and holiday's if it's needed. The thing is, the workplace is kinda far from where I live, so I have to wake up at 4am to go. It's getting really tiring and it's just the second day.
And there's another problem... Ever since 2020, I was being a NEET, not leaving my house for anything (I live with my parents). Because of that, I ended up developing social anxiety, and it really affects me. These two days that I went to work, I threw up and cried when I was back home. It's complicated.
I know that I need to treat these mental issues, but I probably should have done that before I started working. Right now, I just don't think I can continue.
Do you guys think that I should really quit? Like, talk with my manager tomorrow and say that I won't be able to continue?

I know that my situation is complicated, and please don't pity me about these problems, I just want to know what you guys would do if you were in my shoes.

1hmuwc1,Advice?,"Hi,

So I currently work two jobs whilst studying but I’d like to leave my second job and get a remote role in administration. This is so I can stop feeling so exhausted and actually spend more time working on both my studies and my job at the same time. Which means less public transport yay.

The only issue is that I don’t have much experience (I’ve got just under 1 year of it). My solution is to offer any admin roles I can easily do (data entry, research, diary and email management) for free if anyone wants it. I just need to build up a portfolio and maybe start selling them on freelance websites like Fiverr/Upwork. Is this is a dumb idea?

1hmugd6,"Struggling on my next move - programming, gig work, or TEFL? ","I'm 28, living in the UK, and have been working at a government contractor for around 4 years since university (of which 1.5 years was unpaid time off that I used to travel the world, learn Spanish, volunteer etc). 

I started with programming using python, then moved onto a bit of SQL and Azure work. Now I've done a few months of Web development (React). I'm on the bench now at my job (which means they're looking for the next project to assign me to) and have been on it for a few months (normal, but boring af). Right now, I'm living at home with parents but want to move out at some point. 

With the year of traveling I did, I had so much fun and my eyes opened massively to what is out there, and my focus is now to get a remote job that lets me work from other countries (around 5-6 months a year so I'm still resident in the UK) and to travel more. I don't feel fussed in getting to the top of the career ladder, or getting a super expensive house here and mortgage. 

I feel like on paper, I have this experience in tech, but feel like I was never given super difficult work, and am nowhere near the level of skills I should be. The company has given me great benefits though like 3 months off a year which makes it harder to leave. 

I then looked into gig work like Data Annotation, and things like TEFL. I spent some time in Korea giving conversation practice and informal private English teaching to adults. This is something I enjoyed a lot, although I just did it for a couple of months, and it was way less stressful than programming. It wouldn't pay in the UK of course, but I'd be happy to move abroad for most of the year tbh (and just be in the UK a few months a year, where I'd stay with family)

This has been happening for a couple months now. Every time my boss is on vacation, she comes in 2 hours late, the worst was when she came in at 1pm so she could work on her halloween costume...

To stop this, I privated the sheet and am now tracking the comp time myself, which my boss approved of.

1hmt7ku,Possible career switch?,"I desperately need career advice! I have a bachelors in psychology and a minor in human services. For the past two years I have been working as an RBT with kids with autism. My original plan was to get a PhD in clinical psychology or a masters in social work (more likely the masters) and become a therapist, but I’m wondering if this is the right path for me or if I should consider something else. 

Here are the main reasons why I’m considering switching paths from becoming a therapist:

- High level of burnout/ emotional trauma. I worry that hearing emotionally heavy things day in and day out might be too much after a while. I also have depression and social anxiety myself so I don’t know if it would be triggering, put me in a down mood, or cause me to have a negative outlook on life if I’m constantly hearing/ talking about that stuff all day every day. 
- Potentially would feel like I’m not making a difference. The main reason I chose this path is because I wanted to be able to help people, but I worry that there wouldn’t be enough tangible evidence that I am making a difference. Therapy is a long process with lots of set backs and therapists and patients aren’t always the right match, so I feel like I’d constantly be worrying that I’m not helping them, which is the whole reason I wanted to pursue that path in the first place. 
- Pay as a therapist is good, but not amazing (average MSW therapist salary is 68k). I grew up with my parents always telling me pay doesn’t matter, which caused me to go this path solely because I’m interested in mental health/ psychology. However I’ve been wondering if there’s another career that would pay better, not be as emotionally taxing, and would provide more positive reinforcement of feeling like I’m doing my job well. 

If I were to switch career paths, here are some of the job qualities I’m thinking of. I know I’m not going to be able to find the perfect job that meets all of these idealistic requirements, but I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions of paths I should consider/ might enjoy. 

- Be able to make a salary of over 100k (eventually, I know I would have to work up to this from entry level positions) 
- A job that is relatively well respected (I know I shouldn’t place my worth on the opinions of others, but I know myself and know I’ll be happier if others respect what I do/ I don’t feel judged) 
- As stated before I have social anxiety, but it mainly comes from fear of judgement in new situations. I definitely crave positive social interaction though. So I like working with people, but in more positive, judgment free environments or even just in passing. Mostly just get anxious in situations where I feel like I don’t know what to do or might be judged. So something a little more routine might be good? 
- Going along the same lines of judgement, I feel like I don’t want a job where my work is judged too harshly. Obviously I want to do good work and welcome constructive criticism, but I kinda like the idea of a more ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ way of doing my work. While still being able to improve upon the ‘right’ way, if that makes any sense. 
- I also enjoy planning and thinking through the details of things (possibly due to my anxiety as well, but this is probably the least important aspect for me that I’ve listed) 

Also, I am perfectly happy going to grad school and know that I will likely have to get a higher degree whether I stay in the same field or in order to shift fields. 

Again I want to emphasize I know there is no perfect job that meets all this criteria, just wanted to think through all the qualities I’ve been considering/ value. Thank you so much in advance!

1hmr7fn,"Seeking Career Advice: Accept Local Offers, Look for Product Companies, or Move Abroad?","Hi everyone,

I'm a 26-year-old recent graduate with a master's degree in Computer Engineering from Florence, Italy. I'm eager to start working immediately and have been receiving several job offers, primarily from consulting companies in my area and nearby cities (Florence and surroundings). Some offers are from companies further away, like in Milan and Turin.

I've been hearing mixed advice about consulting companies—some say I should avoid them and focus on companies that directly develop products instead. My first question is: should I accept one of these offers (some of which are decent) or actively search for companies that align more with my interests?

Additionally, I’m torn about the idea of leaving everything behind and searching for work abroad. I have a good command of English, adapt easily to new environments, and the idea excites me. However, it’s also daunting to leave my friends, family, and girlfriend behind.

My current thought is to find a job near me for 1-2 years, gain some experience and build my résumé, with the goal of moving abroad after that. However, some people tell me that the longer I wait, the harder it will be to leave, and I might risk never going at all.

Is this true? Should I aim to move abroad as soon as possible, or is it okay to start locally and then transition abroad later?

I’d love to hear from anyone with similar experiences or advice about choosing between consulting vs. product companies and starting locally vs. going abroad right away.

1hmptgg,"If Luigi Mangione hadn’t shot the CEO, what would his future look like? ","

Suppose he decided against shooting the CEO. What would his life look like in the future?

He took a break from work and became alienated from his family. During this time, he went on vacation in Asia. 

It’s December, and he comes to the conclusion that the idea of assassinating the CEO is too much, so he abandons the thought. 

He returns to his life, rethinks everything, and, since it’s Christmas, goes back to his family’s house to spend the holidays with them.

Afterward, he begins looking for a job as a Data Scientist. 

What alternative life path could he have taken if he hadn’t committed the crime?

Returning from his break, he would likely have continued working in tech. In my opinion, the alternative for him would have been a boring corporate life, continuing to work in the tech industry.

Considering the poor state of the tech job market, he might feel frustrated, especially as an Ivy League graduate stuck in a monotonous job. He might feel like his work lacks impact, following his manager's orders, doing repetitive tasks, and earning around $120,000 a year.

Despite coming from a wealthy family, he wanted to be independent and build his own future. However, if he hadn’t become famous for the CEO shooting, his life might have felt wasted. 

Given the current economy, he could have ended up as a corporate employee, eventually climbing to a high-level position. In 10 years, he might have become a tech manager. Alternatively, he could have founded his own tech startup and become a CEO, though the competitiveness of the tech industry is enormous.

Luigi wasn’t particularly motivated by money. 

Had he pursued a typical, routine life, his potential might have felt wasted. His lack of internal drive for wealth raises questions about why he struggled so much to study at one of the best colleges, completing a bachelor’s and master’s in just four years.

Why did he do it? After graduation, he was highly skilled. If he truly hated corporate America and wanted independence, why didn’t he work on his own startup or company? Was it because he didn’t care about money?

Perhaps he viewed education as a way to improve his social status, to attract interest from others. It seems his philosophy of life revolved around being surrounded by valuable, non-NPC individuals—those who were deep thinkers. However, despite photos of him smiling with friends, these relationships might have felt too shallow for him to create deep connections. 

One person observed that he had trouble maintaining long-term relationships because people didn’t understand him and were too superficial. While he appeared social, in reality, he had many shallow friendships and no truly meaningful bonds with anyone who could understand him. 

This might explain why, when he went missing for six months, no one made a significant effort to search for him. Most of his ""friends"" were acquaintances rather than true companions. Maybe his missing was motivated by that he wanted to test his friends how much he mean for them. 

I also read that he started his own book club and invited people to join, but they didn’t enjoy participating because they weren’t interested in his book choices. This suggests that no one truly understood him and his values.

He mentioned that in the task involving drawing a dream house, he drew a house with a bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen, while his friend drew a big mansion with a pool and luxury cars.

People described him as kind, smiling, polite, and thoughtful. So why didn’t he form deep friendships? If he was so open, why did people distance themselves? Perhaps Luigi was the one trying to maintain relationships, while others didn’t bother to reciprocate or understand him, preferring to keep their distance. 

This might explain his disdain for social media, which he felt consumed people’s lives and turned them into NPCs who had lost control over their own paths.

It seems that no one truly understood him. He even reached out to a blog author who wrote about corporate America and the phenomenon of people becoming NPCs, hoping to form a friendship with someone like-minded. 

This shows how much he tried to find people who shared his perspective. 

Perhaps he became depressed because everyone around him seemed like NPCs—corporate slaves, unconscious and unreflective about their lives.

1hmp4eb,Former Teacher Now Training Coordinator ,"Hello everyone,

I’m reaching out to ask for some advice and guidance as I transition into a new role. I’ve recently transitioned from being a middle school teacher to working as a training coordinator in a manufacturing setting. While I’m excited about this new opportunity, I’m feeling a bit lost in terms of how to excel in this new role.

As a teacher, I was accustomed to managing classrooms, lesson planning/development, and student engagement. However, now I find myself in a position where I need to focus on training adult employees, developing technical training materials, and ensuring that people are effectively learning and growing within their roles.

Specifically:
	•	What skills are most important for a training coordinator that I should focus on developing?
	•	How do I effectively design and deliver training sessions for adults in a way that’s engaging and impactful?
	•	Are there any frameworks or methods you’ve found particularly useful in developing training programs?
	•	How do I balance my time when I have nothing to complete? I’ve never had a career where there was “nothing to do”.

I’d greatly appreciate any insights from those who have experience in training, learning and development, or those who have made a similar career transition. Any input would be valuable as I navigate this new chapter in my career!
Thank you so much in advance!

TLDR: I’m looking for any advice, resources, or strategies that could help me become a successful training coordinator.

1hmox0s,Has anyone turned from being an arts-person to a math-person?,"I have ADHD so I was never able to focus in school. It was always a struggle. Except for Art class. That was the only thing that felt relaxing. And English class (I liked writing).

So I just thought I was an arts person. And I thought when I grow up, I should just go to art school and I'll fully be in the zone then.

So I went to Animation uni and studied that for 3 years.

4 years after graduating from there, I studied programming. I immediately liked it, which came across as a giant shock. I thought it was a Math-person thing, but it turns out not. It's somewhere in between........like a hybrid.

After learning the basics of programming, I started exploring areas like 3D game engine development. Like building a 3D game engine from scratch.

So I dug deep into trigonometry and vector operations....and how to creatively use all that knowledge to create software that visualizes geomery and transforms it.

This was the first time in my life that anything math related had fascinated me. I felt like I unlocked a new area of my mind.....an area that I could have unlocked way back in school. I felt a desire to keep learning more math to see what more I can create.

As horrendous as it sounds, I tried to get a job as a programmer for about 3 years.....but couldn't.

Now I feel like I'm back in square 1. Completely lost. No motivation for programming. At least when I was in programming school, the motivation to keep studying was to graduate.

Now the only thing I feel like doing is......something artsy - like clay modelling or painting. Which is good on its own, but I feel dead inside.

Hi everyone!  I (23F) graduated college in May 2023 with a bachelors and license in elementary education. I did enjoy the program even tho I was originally gonna go for psychology. Anyway I started working as a teacher 2 days after graduating as a long term sub and enjoyed it. I next taught at summer school at the same district but there were no more openings at my district so I had to look elsewhere. I next become a special Ed teacher in a different district for 23-24 but starting in September I am getting sick every single morning before school and sometimes during school. I become extremely burnt out and basically wake up, work, go home and sleep. By November I am so burnt out that it is debilitating and I can no longer do my job well. I cry every day on my way to work and when my students are not in the room. No exceptions. My dad brings me to the ER for no longer functioning due to my mental health and I am told that I need to take a leave and attend a partial hospital program. I send it my note from the doctor to my school and I am fired that same day. In January of 2024 I begin working again as a building sub in a way better district and become a LTS again for the end of the year. I love the school, but I had been seriously considering a career in counseling because of my experience. Now I am still working at my same school while going to school to be a therapist (first semester just completed) and over the last couple weeks I’ve been feeling super conflicted as to whether I should continue being a therapist as I have learned some of the realities of the field, yet I am often still excited to be a therapist. It is important to note I have enjoyed my classes in my counseling masters and on paper I have many of the qualities of a traditional therapist. However, Currently I do enjoy working at my school and I am feeling sad about leaving that industry and leaving students. It feels like a 50/50 split that won’t go away. I’ve tried a pros and cons list and it’s not helping. I need to make a decision quick and literally cannot. How can I decide between 2 careers?  I really don’t want to make a decision that I will regret forever. A big issue for me is that I’m looking at bachelors level jobs in psych and do not like them. I do not want to work in peoples homes or in an inpatient setting.

My parents need my help, but sadly, I graduated from a useless liberal arts in a South American university (social science, at least it was a well ranked school lol). I recently asked about how to get into a general corporate type of job (Sales, HR, Marketing and stuff like that) but most replied that it would be impossible since not only do I have a useless degree and no job experience,  but I also graduated from a foreign overseas non-American University, which would mean employers wouldn't recognize it as valid and it wouldn't be considered or even tick the ""candidate has 4 year degree"" checkbox requirement. 

Going to grad school here in the US isn't really an option, I can't go back to my home country either. At least I'm a US citizen and know English tho.

Please offer me guidance, is it true my degree wouldn't be even recognized, like at all, by US employers? I want to break into some general corporate role, maybe sales? Seems impossible.

1hml9gq,I could use some advice/outside perspective,"So I am an individual that identifies as being in recovery. I've got about 2 years of sobriety now and it's been my dream since the beginning to get into the recovery field of work. When I got a year of sobriety I went through the process of getting credentialed as a PSS and CRM (Peer Support Specialist and Certified Recovery Mentor).

I spent about 6 months working at a very unfulfilling job in the food service industry while applying to every single job in the recovery field that I was qualified for (and some that I wasn't qualified for).

When I finally got some calls for interviews I was absolutely thrilled that one of the biggest companies in my area was one of the places that contacted me.

I originally interviewed for a Peer Support position at their outpatient facility but then got a call to come in interview a second time for a separate but similar position as a Peer Support at their inpatient and housing facilities since the original position I had interviewed for had been filled.

Long story short, they ended up offering me a (third) position as a Direct Care staff at their residential inpatient treatment facility on an overnight shift.

I wasn't too thrilled about the idea of working graveyard, but decided to take the offer since it was with the company that I wanted to work for and it had taken so long just to get into the recovery field in the first place and I definitely did not want to continue working food service anymore and figured I would adjust and adapt.

Shortly after starting the reality of the nature of my position hit me like a brick wall and I immediately wanted to quit.

The whole reason I wanted to get into the recovery field in the first place is because I want to help people, be a impact in their lives, have that moment 5 years down the road where a former client sees me on the street and comes up to tell me what a massive difference I made in their life in recovery.

Versus what I'm doing now, which is sitting at a computer for 8 hours between the hours of 10:30pm to 6:30am logging every little thing into the EMR (read: client got up to have a snack at 0326) and getting up every hour to go shine a flashlight in their rooms to make sure they haven't snuck off and having absolutely no interaction with any of the clients and having absolutely no impact in their lives or recovery.

I've thought plenty about getting a different job that is actually fulfilling and meaningful and impactful and doesn't drain my soul and heart to the point of depression, but the one and only thing that's keeping me hear at this company is that there is in fact a light at the end of the tunnel in the form of an internal hiring position advancement course that would allow me to become credentialed as a CDAC 1 (Certified Drug and Alcohol Counselor) which is really my ultimate goal as far as 'job I would happily retire on'.

The next course starts in April (I believe anyway...I'm having trouble getting information/in contact with the relevant people) so I just need to hold on until then, just push through this miserable job for a few more months and then I can start moving towards my desired career.

Now, with all that being said. Yes, there are other companies and ways to get that same credentialing, but those options would require me to pay for those classes and credentials, whereas with this internal program, the company pays for everything and I'm still getting a paycheck (granted it would be a significant pay decrease while in the program, but totally worth it in the long run).

So in your opinion, do I just stick it out and soldier through the next few months until I can get into this great program, or just cut my losses and look for a job that I actually want to be doing and save up to get my CDAC on my own dime at some point down the road.

I realize that there's likely some important context or something that I didn't mention in this post, so ask me any questions you have and I'll do my best to answer them.

TL;DR: Do I quit my current miserable job in favor of a more fulfilling job and lose out on an opportunity to advance my career for free or hold onto my miserable job for a few more months until I can join an awesome program that will allow me to advance my career for free.

1hmkssx,Only now learning that a career is meaningless in and of itself,"I had a rather traditional trajectory with high school, bachelors, masters and starting a career at 25.

5,5 years later I got objectively one of the best jobs I could have imagined for myself and I am even in talks with my manager to improve my contract in such a way that would objectively push it into 'dream territory'. 

Just trying to vent a little and maybe someone relates, but I wanted to share my experience and explain how I don't think any sort of career could ever fulfil me even though I got a personality that generally finds pleasure in work.

When I started my career at 25, I had a 100% completely fulfilling long-term relationship and flourishing relationships with family and friends. At that age, everything just fell into place for me. After that relationship fell apart and probably through a series of selfish decisions, my relationships to my family and friends have deteriorated as well. This coincided with the COVID pandemic, which has been the most potent catalyst in my life. It would not be an exaggeration to state that 100% of my relationships have irreversibly changed for the worse during that time.

I am 30 now and notice that for all my friends in functioning relationships, I am but a side character in their lives. And even if this wasn't the case, what would it matter anyway, if I am working 40 hours a week and spend a majority of my emotional and physical energy doing my employers bidding? Even if I had the most engaging friendships in the world, I only have very little space in my life to reciprocate. That's probably why I don't hold any grudges with the people in my life. Everybody is just trying their best and in no way, shape or form am I any different in that. I don't hold anybody other than myself accountable for my own happiness.

People that are less conventionally successful than me often seem to have more and even better relationships than me, which makes me feel resentful towards 'my career'. As I, and the people around me, age, maintaining strong social bonds becomes soul crushingly difficult, especially as people have less and less extra time at their disposal to invest in them. Oftentimes, I just want to stop or pause my career and live like a student again, just so that I could have the time and energy to find and maintain relationships with people similar to what I had when I was 25.

If I could slash my income in half and live like I did before the pandemic, I totally would. 

To me, at least, having a career but no fulfilling relationships, is as meaningless as skis on a beach.",VestaCeres2202,118,0.949999988079071,33,1735204541,2024-12-26 09:15:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hmkssx/only_now_learning_that_a_career_is_meaningless_in/,12,2024
1hmkbg6,Telling the Truth,"So, I saw a position on LinkedIn that was posted by an HR agency for their partner company. The position is really exciting to me and I would love to get it, the interest I have in that job is beyond me, I have done office jobs till now that never felt right for me, however now that I saw this, I felt like this is something I would love to do. It has something to do with helping kids. 

The problem I have now, maybe I am overthinking, I don't know. So, I did not want to apply through the agency. I saw their post, I went ahead and applied directly to the company they posted it for (they had only mentioned the name of the company, I found their website and applied there). The reason why I did not apply through the agency is that the founder of this agency is an HR manager I have worked in the same company with in the past and I (not just me) did not like her much. The company we worked together went through a crisis and was doing layouts (which means they had to pay you 2-month salary or let you work for 2 more months). I did not know the laws and many others like me and she used it against us and made us sign resignation letters which means there is no need to pay the 2 month salary. In any case, I don't care about this story, neither about the money, I was happy to leave back then. The problem is that I knew she did not like me either and so I did not apply through her agency because I am almost sure she would not even consider to show my application to the employer. 

Now I am just overthinking ... what if the employer gets back to me and they ask me how I found them and all, and if I say how I found them there will be questions on why I did not apply through the agency and then maybe this HR will find out they contacted me. 

To be more context relevant, I am in Armenia, the agency is Armenian but the company hiring is not Armenian, they are American. So the  probability that I saw them accidentally somewhere on the net and not on LinkedIn through this Armenian agency is not high. 

I know these thoughts are redundant because I sent the application yesterday and haven't been contacted yet. ",Conscious_Content,1,0.6700000166893005,5,1735202218,2024-12-26 08:36:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hmkbg6/telling_the_truth/,12,2024
1hmjex7,Employer makes me share a hotel room with my coworker while on trips. I’m honestly not loving it.,"Hi all!

So I’ve been working in marketing for my current company since July, and part of my job involves extensive travel around the USA so I can provide demos of our product to different users. It’s pretty intense, as from September until December I was on the road the entire time, meaning no breaks to see family, friends, or have time for myself. I literally sold my car and ended my apartment lease since I would never be home. My days are usually spent working on-site 8-5pm and then traveling in the evening and in the night to the next stop.

I share these responsibility with one other coworker which I am with 24/7. We working together all day, drive the same car from state to state, and share the same hotel room. I’m ok with the working part, but I’m constantly with this guy who, mind you, I just met and have been working with since July. It’s not like we’re best friends or anything. My next chunk of traveling is happening after the new year, from January to April, and I honestly don’t want to room with him anymore, and never really wanted to in the first place. I was under the assumption that I would have my own hotel room, but I was told that is not in the budget, and heard from someone else at the company that they hired two guys so they could make this work. Nothing against my coworker, we’ve made the best of it, but I’m getting really depressed being on the road so much and being with him constantly is not helping. He snores alll night long, is not super tidy, and if I want to do anything personal like make a phone call to loved ones, I always have to go outside or in the hotel lobby.

Again, I asked my supervisor about the situation and they said it’s out of budget to allow us to have two separate rooms. The company pays for the hotel room and rental car, so I don’t want to seem ungrateful, but I’m not sure what else to do to convince them we need our own spaces. I don’t make enough money to reserve my own hotel room for months with my personal budget. I don’t really want to go on this next leg of traveling knowing I can never get some personal time/space. Again, this isn’t some week long conference where I can suck it up and move on. This is months of my life, where I’m in a new place, working all day, and driving all night. I’m looking for any advice that people can offer as to what I should do.

1hmj8h2,A little guidance please ,"So first of all I am 27 years old male, with an overall experience of 3 years and 7 months. Within this, my last 2 years and 7 months is as a consultant, but actually the work that I am doing is more of a support role and just a little bit of power BI. The domain is ETRM, which is a very niche area/domain, but at the same time the number of jobs are also very less. I don’t want to bad mouth, my office, seniors or colleagues, but I can rant for hours if required. 

Nevertheless, I recently got PSPO 1 certified at my own expense as I want to grow. I don’t want to be in a comfort zone as I am young and I can hustle at the moment when I am single and don’t have much responsibilities. I do not know much about switching and also trying/job hunting for the past two months, but not getting any shortlisting or calls. I am thinking currently to upskill myself in Advance Excel, SQL, Power BI and Python (just a little as I don’t like coding) and look for business analyst for data analyst jobs. I am currently doing AI Python for beginners where it teaches python and how you can ask AI to help with little bit of coding and saving some task or keyword in a list of dictionary, and you can ask the generator to to get the response to those activities by calling functions that get the response from ChatGPT. I am currently halfway through the course, so I cannot tell what is in it completely, but so is the chest from what I have learnt till now. And for reference, this is AI Python for beginners course by Deep learning AI, which is a new learning platform by Andrew Ng, the founder of Coursera.

Am I thinking in the right direction or so is not the case?

Or else should I go for cyber security or AI or God knows what ? I will be very honest I want to increase my salary as well, and I can achieve that in my current role as well, but for that, I will have to stick with this organisation for at least another 3 years and hope that I get some better project as there is no learning curve of any sort. 

About my background, my current organisation work experience is 2 years and 7 months as a consultant (but my work feels like IT support which I could have done post eighth class and thus, my current frustration that I am not doing justice to my education and skill sets) prior to that I did my post graduation (MBA) in 2022, and prior to that I was working at another firm as a QA for 1 year and before that I did BTech. 

I am open to any suggestions and constructive criticism.

Should I do any certification or online courses, or should I just keep on learning stuff from Udemy or Coursera and lie on my that I did so and so depending on what I learnt from those courses and hope that my resume will get shortlisted and switch eventually with a lie. 

Please guide me because I have never felt such frustration and demotivation in my life, not even when I was about to get back in my BTech, not even when my school teachers said that I won’t be able to do a thing in life.

Looking forward to something fruitful!",That_PC_Enth,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1735197132,2024-12-26 07:12:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hmj8h2/a_little_guidance_please/,12,2024

1hmi8we,Unpaid Leave Request Denied by Manager – Need Advice on How to Proceed,"Hey everyone, I need some advice. I recently requested an unpaid leave of absence to attend a family reunion out of the country. My supervisor was on board with it and approved it, noting that no one else is booked off during that week, so it wouldn’t impact work. However, when it went to the manager, he denied it, saying that granting unpaid leave ""sets a precedent for others to ask for it.""
Here’s where it gets weird: my supervisor told me he’d just not schedule me that week and said to keep it on the down low. The thing is, I’m leaving the country, and I need something official in writing to avoid issues.
I know my manager has a reputation for being difficult and even my supervisor called him an asshole, but I’m wondering if this kind of response is normal in workplaces. Should I push for written approval or just go with what my supervisor suggested?


Also, are there any laws under the Employment Standards Act (I’m in canada toronto]) that I should be aware of regarding unpaid leave?

","**Goal: to work in immigration field, probably in policy.**

Hello, I’m 29, currently working as an Assistant English Teacher under the JET Program in Japan. I am interested in working a job related to Immigration, probably something related to policy.  During university, I took a lot of interest in migratory causes and positive/negative effects of migration in the places they left from and went to. 

Up until my current teaching job, I worked as a supervisor for a ferry company, worked in car insurance claims, and now I'm doing my teaching job as a break from hating my previous jobs. All throughout my professional career, I worked as a volunteer English Teacher for immigrants at the local community centre. However, I was unable to transition to a proper well paying job. I heard the best way to get policy-related jobs were through internships during university but I wasn’t able to do that because I was working a full-time job to pay for my school. 

I am now in Japan, taking a break, rethinking how I can approach my goals of working in Immigration. However, I am starting to feel some stress as I am approaching 30 with an unstable & low-paying career path. 

Any tips, advice, or any guidance on how I can approach my goals?  Any questions welcomed!

I'd like to get back into higher ed which I have experience in but I don't know how to explain what the heck I've been doing for the past 3+ years.

I am a very open person and would rather just be straight up and say that I was exploring other career options and at some point I had to take any work I could find after moving to a new location but I feel like I've overshared in previous interviews.

(During my gap I pursued working in the tech industry and landed a tech sales job, I wanted to explore life coaching and completed a certification course on it but I feel if I share all of this I will look like I'm all over the place and dont really know what I want. I've spent thousands of dollars investing in personal coaching and such so it's not like I was completely aimless during my career break but it sure looks like that on my resume.

Besides working on personal stuff and building a portfolio, what would be other ways of approaching this industry? Certificates or courses I should look into? Or is it all just freelancing and networking and who you make contacts with to get a gig?

1hmgaew,Feel I’m going back to school because idk how to approach my dreams….,"So my dream career is to be an entrepreneur (holistic/beauty), social media influencer (YouTuber/Tik toker, model, and just basically work for myself and be self employed . Don’t come for me but I’ve also considered sex work like findom (financial domination-They make bank!) 

I just don’t see myself work average 9-5 for the nexts couple decades of myself just seem miserable and I feel I’ll be depressed 

I’m currently unemployed right now at age 25 and I’m a female. I’m currently in process of applying for unemployment and becoming a security guard until I figure out my next steps in life 

I keep having back in my head to probably go back for Masters in Social Work (Mental Health Therapist) but with this I’m not too excited about this but feel I should go through with it as time is passing by quickly and I feel I need to hurry up and do something in life quickly before I know it I’ll turn 30

But I’m considering MSW as I relate to Mental Health and feel it would make me feel good to help others who have mental health issues as well. 

I’ve also considered nursing but I lost that dream along time ago and just see it as back breaking work and feel I’ll be miserable in that now as I’m older . But the pro is that they make money 🤷🏽‍♀️😭

The holidays have me thinking about my job and I've realized I want a change.

1hmfh7j,Hierarchical Confusion and Career Expectations at a Fintech. Any tips?,"I work at a fintech company in Brazil, remotely, hired as a Specialist. I take pride in my work and what I've accomplished so far. In just 8 months, I've successfully structured several processes involving complex calculations and programming. Additionally, I have a great relationship with my boss and the two people who report to me, always being supportive and collaborative.

Recently, my boss has frequently asked if I’d be interested in moving to a management role, like a Coordinator, shifting away from the technical side. I’m good at interacting with people, so I’ve always said yes, expressing my willingness to take on this kind of role.

However, I recently found out from another employee that they’re hiring a Team Lead. I casually asked my boss about it via chat, and he confirmed the hire. I felt quite frustrated, especially when he mentioned that this new hire would be my superior. This confused me because, hierarchically, a Specialist shouldn’t report to a Team Lead (which is considered a lower-level position).

During our conversation, I politely mentioned that I would have appreciated being involved in this decision, especially since he had often asked about my interest in management roles, which built up certain expectations. I also asked for clarification about the company’s hierarchical structure, as this situation has left me feeling unsure. He told me we would discuss it further in an upcoming 1:1 meeting.

Until then, I must admit I feel less motivated and uncertain about how to proceed. Additionally, I would appreciate tips on how to stay calm and composed during meetings and chats. I also realize that there isn’t a clearly defined career plan in the company (which I know is common in most places). Any advice or suggestions on how to handle this situation?

1hmfeup,Feeling Stuck and Unsure About My Career Path – Looking for Advice,"Hey everyone,

I’m in my mid-20s and could really use some perspective. I graduated with a degree in Statistics and a minor in Computer Science. After college, I landed my first job as a software consultant at a company that developed tech solutions for government agencies. While it was a solid starting point, the technology stack was pretty outdated. Most of my work involved JavaScript with older frameworks, some low-code solutions, and occasional SQL Server or Java. It wasn’t the most exciting or modern environment, but it gave me some professional experience.

A few months ago, I was laid off, and since then, I’ve struggled to find another job. I live in the New York Metro Area, and while I’ve been actively job hunting, learning new technologies, and working on side projects, it’s been a really tough and demotivating process. I’ve realized I don’t love coding enough to dedicate every waking moment to it while unemployed. The constant pressure to stay ahead in this field feels overwhelming, and it’s starting to wear me down.

Now I’m at a crossroads. Part of me wonders if I should give it more time. After all, I’ve only had one experience as a software engineer, and maybe I just need to find a better fit. But another part of me questions whether this is really the right path for me. I want to feel excited about what I do, not like I’m just grinding to keep up, and failing miserably.

I’m open to exploring other career paths but feel lost on where to even start. I've been considerring actuarial since I have some friends in insurance. It leverages my Statistics degree, and they are pretty well compensated.   
  
Should I keep pushing forward in tech, hoping my next role will reignite my passion? Or is it time to seriously consider pivoting to something else?

Any advice, personal stories, or guidance would mean the world to me right now.

1hmdt13,Career Transition,"Merry Christmas to everyone 🎄

I have some questions about experiences and technical skills for upcoming new grad/entry-level positions in the insurance industry. 

I have worked full-time as an inventory analyst at a biotech company for almost three years, with great benefits. However, I am graduating in June 2025 and looking for a career transition to banking/ investment (finance) and consulting. Those are highly competitive fields regarding target schools, GPA, networking, leadership, etc.… I got rejected all the 2025 internship applications from firms. Because my school is online, there are no campus recruiters, and I study largely self-paced, riding solo to search for career resources. I can accelerate my courses. Thus, I applied to full-time 2025 graduate programs but heard nothing from companies. I completed Hirevue and/or online assessments and attended several online information sessions and events. I asked for career advice from coaches on some free platforms for 1st gen students. I did not even get invited to a single virtual/single interview. 

My work experiences include restaurants, healthcare, and being self-employed, so I have about 8 years of serving clients. Recently, I have seen many of the 2025 Underwriting Program/Underwriter Trainees, and I applied to about 8-10 firms. I got rejected from Zurich. For the rest of the applications, I haven't heard anything since October and November because of my current salary and family financial responsibilities. I can not apply or go for positions that pay under $60k. I am open to relocating, so:

1. What is your advice?
2. Is it hard to get into those programs? 
3. Are there any other programs for new grad/entry level that I can apply for? 
4. Do I have to network with professionals in finance and consulting recruiting?

1hmdckd,How to Build a Career in U.S. as an Immigrant? ,"Hi there,  

I’m a female immigrant who recently arrived in the U.S. I’m married to an American citizen, and I came to this country just a couple of months ago. As a fiancé visa holder, I’m not allowed to work until I receive my green card or Employment Authorization Document (EAD). I’ve already applied for both and am currently waiting for them to be processed. Once I receive my EAD, I’ll be able to work, so I’ve been thinking about how I can develop a successful career here in the U.S.

My parents taught me that, even as a woman, I shouldn’t rely solely on my husband. They encouraged me to pursue a fulfilling career and strive to become a skilled professional who contributes to society. I firmly believe in this principle. In my home country, I worked as a lawyer. However, I discovered that I didn’t truly enjoy the profession—but by the time I realized it, it felt too late to change paths, so I continued working in law keeping in mind that I would like to change my career path.

Later, I met my fiancé, who is now my husband. The immigration process was lengthy, and I haven’t lived in my home country since 2022. As a result, I haven’t worked as a lawyer since then. Over the past three years, I’ve tried a variety of jobs, most of which were in the hospitality industry. While I appreciated the experience, I know that working in hospitality long-term may not be the best fit for me, as the field might be not very financially rewarding (do you think I'm mistaken?).

That said, during my time in hospitality, I managed several projects in a hotel setting, which helped me realize that I might enjoy project management. I’ve been trying to pivot toward this career path by studying independently, though it has been challenging at times. However, I don’t give up easily and believe that with persistence, I can learn and grow—just as I did with law in my home country. I don’t abandon project management simply because I don’t grasp everything immediately.

Still, I wonder if there might be other fields that align with my interests and strengths—fields I’m not yet aware of. I generally enjoy administrative and organizational tasks. My husband and I have even managed a few projects together from scratch. While he’s great at coming up with ideas, I excel at structuring and organizing the processes to turn those ideas into solid, functional projects.

The reason I’m asking is that I’ve realized project management is a highly competitive field in U.S., and I worry that I might be wasting my time trying to break into it directly without relevant experience. Instead, I’m considering exploring a similar field where I could gain valuable experience and have a better chance of success.

I’m not ruling out the idea of working in project management entirely, but perhaps I could start in a related role and transition into PM later once I’ve built up some experience. Realistically, I understand that it’s unlikely I’ll land my very first job in project management without substantial, hands-on experience in the field—not just managing a few random projects here and there.

That’s why I’m thinking there might be a related area where I can gain relevant work experience, build a track record on my résumé (within the U.S.), and eventually position myself for real project management roles with proven qualifications.

One thing I’d like to avoid is a job that requires sitting in front of a computer for eight hours a day. Back when I worked at a hotel, a 12-hour shift involving guest interactions and managing the entire place felt much easier than an eight-hour day in a law office working with computers and tons of paperwork. I find physical activity and engaging with people much more energizing than prolonged computer work, which feels mentally draining for me.

Recently, I’ve been thinking about roles like sales management. A friend of mine back home works as a sales manager in an office, and her job sounds quite appealing. She works with warm leads, doesn’t have to make cold calls, and uses a computer only for tasks like managing contracts and coordinating deliveries. Her role also involves project management, as she oversees the entire sales process—from the initial call to the final installation of goods at the client’s home. I think this type of work might suit me as well.

I’d love to hear your suggestions about career paths that might align with my skills and preferences. I’m particularly interested in roles that involve interacting with people and don’t require excessive computer work. Thank you in advance for your advice!

1hmd3q9,"Transitioning out of public relations into a new stable, future-proof career","Hi everyone,

I’m a 30-year-old woman who recently moved back to the NYC area after spending 4 years in Spain, where I worked as an ESL teacher and freelanced as a book publicist. The transition back has been challenging, and I’m still trying to find my footing professionally and personally.

I live with my disabled mom and manage my own chronic illness that limits my energy. My mom has made it clear that she doesn’t want to hold me back from pursuing my career or independence, so I don't need to be her sole caretaker. However, I personally want to avoid a career that leaves me too burnt out to be there for her when needed, or is highly at risk at being taken over by AI. I know we can't totally predict the future, however.

With limited financial resources and a small support system, I’m prioritizing finding a stable, remote/hybrid-friendly career that balances my health and work needs. PR, in my experience, has proven to be a high-stress and unpredictable job that favors extroverts, which has kept me from advancing in it (I am still at a junior level with 5+ years combined experience in the field, and my manager turned me down for a promotion/raise.)

# My Background:

* 3+ years as a freelance book publicist (lifestyle, self-help, health/wellness, and some tech/business authors).
* 2+ years PR experience with consumer brands, as well as about a year of social media copywriting and art direction experience in this industry.
* 4 years of ESL teaching abroad, sharpening cross-cultural communication skills (did this PT while also working PT as a book publicist).
* Strong writing background: press materials, media strategy, coverage in outlets like *USA Today*.
* Bachelor’s in Journalism and Media Studies.

**Skills/Interests:**

* Strategic + creative thinking/writing: I excel at transforming complex expertise into clear, compelling formats for media and finding hooks, even in technical fields like cybersecurity.
* Exploring UX research: Aligns with my journalism and research skills (though I lack a design background).
* Accessibility advocate: Inspired by my disabled mom, I’m passionate about improving accessibility in communications and design.
* Meetup organizer: I run a group exploring abandoned spaces, praised for creating a safe and engaging environment.
* Open to learning: Willing to take courses or gain certifications to transition successfully.

# Concerns:

* Many roles I’m qualified for—PR, copywriting, and marketing—seem increasingly vulnerable to AI.
* I’ve heard the UX job market is oversaturated, and bootcamps may no longer be a helpful path to transition into the field.
* I want to focus on future-proof jobs that leverage my writing, research, and communication skills.

# Careers I’m Considering:

* Internal communications
* Marketing copywriting
* Technical writing (was recently told this was a risky choice by someone who works in tech, however)
* UX research or design (longer-term goals, possibly requiring more schooling)
* Accessibility-focused roles in UX/UI or communications

I’m also considering a master’s in Human-Computer Interaction or Interaction Design to relaunch my career, but I worry about being overqualified for entry-level roles after completing it.

# Questions:

1. Based on my background and interests, what jobs should I pursue that are safer from AI disruption?
2. If jobs leveraging my skills are at risk, what career shifts would you recommend for long-term stability?
3. Have you transitioned from PR into roles like UX research, technical writing, or something totally different? How did you do it?

Thanks in advance for your advice, and happy holidays (hopefully)!

# TL;DR:

30-year-old freelance book publicist with a journalism background and chronic illness looking to transition into a stable, future-proof career. Considering internal communications, UX research/design, technical writing, or accessibility-focused roles but unsure about AI risks, oversaturated markets (like UX), and whether pursuing a master’s degree would be worth it.

The starting pay isn’t the best but the benefits are great!  However, I recently was contacted for an interview for a part time library assistant job. Although it is part time, the hourly pay is slightly better. I live with my parents, but want to move out in the next 2-3 years.

Healthcare(physical therapy assistant) is my backup career whereas Library Science is what I’ve been wanting to do with my career. However, I’ve been feeling pessimistic about my odds in the library field because there aren’t many jobs available. I’ve been searching for library jobs all year whereas it only took me a month to find a job for a physical therapy technician. 

Whichever job I pick I’d have to go back to school somewhere down the line unless I wanted to be a manager/ office coordinator for either position. If I decide to become a physical therapist assistant I would just need to do a certificate, but a Librarian requires a masters.

Realistically I want to stay at my new job for a year to see how I like the field before seeking out other jobs, but I want to at least do the library assistant interview. I’m just upset that the library job reached out to me after accepting the new job.

1hmaauh,Take potentially toxic job or end my contract and look while on unemployment? ,"Hi all. I've been working almost 2 years as a remote contractor for a FAANG company (yes the one based in Seattle) as a Supply Chain Analyst. Despite the title, I would say my job is 2/3 purchasing and 1/3 data analysis. I enjoy the freedoms of WFH and am able to do my work in about 15-20 hours a week. I make about 3700$ a month net from it. I am currently pursuing professional firefighting and have been a volunteer FF coming up on 18 months with Fire I and Fire II certs and am currently in EMT school. Once this is completed in February, I will have a solid leg to stand on in applying to FT firefighting jobs. I coming up on my 2 year contract expiration (end of march) at my current analyst job. I have been told to apply to a job with high chances of getting in (personally referred to by my current boss who created the req). The job is for a Buyer I, and while I've told my job responsibilities will stay the same, I'm told because of an org change due to a recent higher up manager leaving, I will be reporting directly to a different boss. It is also 5 days a week on site which would make my commute 2-2.5 hours a day. There will be flexibility on when I can come in and leave, but I will still have to be onsite 5 days a week, per my current boss. The pay however is a significant jump, with $5k-6k a month net with a sign on bonus of about 5k. I decided to speak to my old coworker who left for a different division a couple of months ago. I worked with her since I started and she is my mentor at the company. She told me not to apply as she says it will be probably be toxic and unflexible with my FF aspirations. I also have a really good relationship with the account manager at the staffing firm that initially recruited me to my current remote job. He said that a 90 day rollover was mandatory after completing my contract but it would be highly likely he will find something for me as I have past experience with said company and am in good standing. He did say that most of the new contractor reqs would be onsite. It would be for net 4k a month. He also said that he would refer me to any remote/hybrid roles and would negotiate with contracts on this as well, but was unsure just how many of those would be available and if they would be flexible on it. Should I use from now till the end of March to apply to remote/hybrid/ roles with a much smaller commute and then use unemployment if for 3-6 (I'd be getting ~2400$/mo unemployment, 6 months is the max) months while pursuing firefighting jobs, and taking another contract role that is possibly onsite if I can't find anything else? The unemployment would cover my rent and almost all expenses. Or should I apply to the Buyer job and take the pay raise until I find a FF job? If I take the Buyer job, it will likely result in me to put applying to Fire Departments on the backburner for a while until I get adjusted to the cadence of the schedule and commute. I could also just apply and really try to get a feel from the hiring managers/ HR about the workload and if I'm not satisfied, withdraw my application.

I went to high school there and then got a Political Science bachelor's from the best Argentinian University , which also ranks as one of the best in South America and like #80 globally (QS Ranking). 

I'm bilingual in English/Spanish, and have American citizenship since my parents were born here in the US. Life took a turn and I need to be here in the US now for personal reasons. 

I'm a new grad and have no job experience, sadly. I also kind of don't like anymore what I studied and I'm more inclined to a corporate private sector career than one in the government. I want something unrelated to political science (I know I studied that, but, long story short, I don't want anything with it). 

I'm aware the job market is tough, I'm aware my degree isn't the most marketable, and I know my lack of job experience will make it even harder, but I want to break into ANY corporate 9-5 type career and build from there. 

I've thought about Sales, Human Resources and general stuff like that. What do you think? 

Can anyone please tell me if the fact that my degree was earned in a foreign overseas non-American University, would end up disqualifying me from most corporate private sector jobs since employers might feel it doesn't count as ""having a 4 year degree"" and it won't check the checkbox of ""candidate has a bachelor's degree"" since it's from a non-American institution?",PlatypusFast3561,1,0.6000000238418579,1,1735164381,2024-12-25 22:06:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hma55c/newly_arrived_argentinian_migrant_in_the_us_how/,12,2024
1hm9w50,Asking for advice =) on the IT world.,"**Hello, everyone! It's my first time posting here.**

First, let me introduce myself a bit: I’m 22 years old and have one year of experience as an IT technician in a small company with five employees. There, I had to solve any problem that came up. After leaving that company, I started working three months ago at an IT consultancy, managing ticketing systems for one of the largest hospitals in Spain.

Currently, I hold a degree in Computer Systems Administration and Networking. During my job transition, I developed a strong interest in the world of cloud computing (Terraform, AWS, Azure, etc.) and earned one of the initial certifications in this field: the **Cloud Practitioner**. Now, at my new job, I’m preparing for the **RHCSA** and studying English at an academy.

My main issue is that my salary is relatively low: I’m currently earning €15,700 annually. I’m from Spain, and I’d like to grow professionally, but I feel like I don’t know where to start.

My current plan is to gain experience at the consultancy so that, once I obtain the RHCSA, I can move into a sysadmin role. From there, my goal would be to transition into the cloud computing field. Is this realistic? Is there anything else I could do to improve my career prospects?

Lastly, I’d like to clarify that my degree is below a university-level qualification, in case anyone from outside Spain is unfamiliar with our education system.

Post in Spanish

¡Hola a todos! Es la primera vez que publico aquí.

Primero, me presento un poco: tengo 22 años y cuento con un año de experiencia como técnico informático en una pequeña empresa de cinco personas. Allí, cualquier problema que surgiera debía solucionarlo yo. Después de salir de esa empresa, hace apenas tres meses comencé a trabajar en una consultora IT, gestionando sistemas de ticketing para uno de los hospitales más grandes de España.

Actualmente, tengo un grado de Administración de Sistemas Informáticos y Redes. Durante el cambio de trabajo, desarrollé un gran interés en el mundo del cloud computing (Terraform, AWS, Azure, etc.), y obtuve una de las primeras certificaciones en esta área, el **Cloud Practitioner**. Ahora, desde mi nueva empresa, estoy preparándome para el **RHCSA** y estudiando inglés en una academia.

Mi principal problema es que mi salario es relativamente bajo: actualmente estoy ganando 15,700 € anuales. Soy de España y me gustaría poder escalar profesionalmente, pero siento que no sé por dónde empezar.

Principalmente, estoy pensando en ganar experiencia en la consultora, para que, una vez que obtenga el RHCSA, pueda pasar a un puesto de sysadmin. Desde ahí, mi idea sería intentar dar el salto al mundo del cloud. ¿Es esto realista? ¿Hay algo más que podría hacer para mejorar mi futuro profesional?

Por último, aclaro que mis estudios están por debajo de una carrera universitaria, por si alguien de fuera de España no está familiarizado con nuestro sistema educativo.

1hm6iw3,Are there any career promising jobs that aren't too difficult to get into?,"I have a social science degree from a foreign University and now I'm living in the US (long story lol). I don't want to work in the public sector and I don't care if my job is not related to my degree. I'm either planning on going to grad school to get a more competitive in demand degree, or, to start applying to entry-level corporate jobs with just my liberal arts bachelor's. 

The thing about grad school is that it would probably mean getting in debt, plus, I would be way too occupied to get internships so graduating with debt,  a degree, and no job experience might not be that good compared to where I'm at now, especially considering that I probably wouldn't be going to an amazing great university, so name recognition wouldn't help me either. 

The other option is too use what I have now: a social science bachelor's. I could probably apply with this to entry-level corporate jobs and build something from there, but everything is so saturated and competitive that it might be extremely difficult, especially if we consider that I lack job experience and my degree isn't only not in a ver marketable field of study, but also from a university, that even if it's ranked high enough globally, located outside of the US. 

In case it matters,  I'm bilingual in Spanish/English.

1hm6g73,I got fired from my first full time job. ,"So, I got my first full time job in November. First day was November 11 and was terminated on December 6. My cousin helped me get the job, she told me to fill out an application and said it would be fine if I put no I don't have any relatives working for the company. So I was like okay, but the director and manager in charge of the role I applied for knew we were cousins, but I was applying for something in a different department so they didn't mind. I ended up getting the job after a couple of interviews. 

Somehow word got around that me and my cousin are cousins and a coworker who desperately wanted to work in their mother's department in the company but was never allowed to found out and continued asking around about me and my cousin to the point HR had to start getting involved. At that point my director even asked HR if it was okay and they said it was fine because they didn't consider us immediate family, but I guess since that coworker kind of kept making a deal about it and talking to people it forced HR to get more involved and look into me. 

Without notice HR called me on December 6
informing me because I put that I had no family in the company on my job application that they would have to terminate me. They had asked why | put no, so l said at the time I had been applying to so many jobs that I was on autopilot filling out information and it did not cross me to single this application out to put yes I have family (I know it was a dumb excuse lol). So they told me they understood but that I will still be terminated and to immediately stop working during that call and hung up. I was informed later on that my director and a couple of HR people tried convincing the rest of HR for me to stay but the other half won I guess you would say.

So the advice I’m asking is, when I apply to future jobs and they ask if I ever have been terminated from a job should I say yes even though I was only there for 4 weeks? I don’t want to lie again and be terminated AGAIN. Also, what would be the appropriate explanation when they ask me to explain in the application and in person? 

I appreciate any thoughts. And yes I know it was a dumb mistake to lie about having no family, I shouldn’t have listened to my cousin on that part… ",xxapplepi,92,0.8799999952316284,75,1735152584,2024-12-25 18:49:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hm6g73/i_got_fired_from_my_first_full_time_job/,12,2024
1hm6dyy,Should I stay or should I go?,"Hi everyone! Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah to all who celebrate. ✨ I have two days left to make a big career decision, and am looking for some non-biased perspective. 

I’m 28 and have spent my career so far in nonprofits and education. I enjoy the passion and impact in the work, but would also like to make a bit more pay. I currently work as an admin in a school, with amazing healthcare and retirement benefits, and a good work culture. It’s tiring work of course, but overall feels good. I also have a great, supportive boss and flexible time off. 

I was just offered a job at a nonprofit, and am trying to decide if I should take it or not. They made me a competitive offer with a 20% raise from what I’m currently making, plus a hybrid work schedule (a luxury compared to my everyday at school job!). The biggest cons are the health insurance isn’t quite as good as my current job, and it’s a lateral move in that it’s the same job title as I currently have. Important to note— I’m also in the midst of prep work for surgery in the spring, so health insurance is a top priority. 

My current job then did the unexpected and made me a counteroffer. The same salary that the new one offered, a professional development opportunity, a title change to a higher position, and while they couldn’t offer full hybrid, they did offer “flexible days from home as needed.” 

I’m torn about what to do. On one hand, a new opportunity seems exciting and fresh and would give me growth that could launch me into the next phase of my career. On the other hand, the current job I’m good at and they have offered all of those benefits as a counter. Especially with surgery coming up, the idea of staying in the job I already know that also has the superior health insurance feels like it could be good to. 

Any advice or words of wisdom? Thanks in advance! 🤍",Potential_Control844,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1735152385,2024-12-25 18:46:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hm6dyy/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/,12,2024

Cut to today our organisation goes through mid year review and he gave the following review:
“Reporting Manager Comment
While the employee has decent knowledge of tax law, the interpretations are quite often incorrect. Employee lacks focus and is unable to priortise sending documents to clients which he has promised to send. The gravitas and seriousness which is required from a mid career professional for dealing with clients is missing. Have given this feedback multiple times over the last 3 months.”

1hm3p7z,Work while getting MBA or take classes only?,"I apologize for the lengthy post. If anyone has experience in what I’m writing about either as a student or as an employer, I would greatly appreciate your input. I’m done with my current job. I basically work at a call center, and the job is mentally exhausting. I am 27 years old. I’m good at my job, though, and a promotion for a much higher paying position is in the works if my performance continues. However, there’s a lot of BS that comes with this position, and I’m questioning whether or not I truly want that. If anyone wants further details, I’ll edit the post to explain. 

I want to get an MBA, but my parents think I should work and take classes at the same time. In my opinion, I would need a part time job or something completely different to achieve this. My hours are not flexible, and it can range from 8-4:30 to 8-7 per day. It is already stressful trying to get out of work just to relax afterwards, and the stress of the irregular schedule coupled with the daily mental fatigue does not seem like a good idea while taking classes.  

I believe if I did work and school at the same time, I would not be able to give my best effort to either one of them. My dad thinks it would look more impressive to employers if I worked and did school at the same time. I understand that, but does it really matter that much? The program at my local college finishes the MBA in a year if done full time, 2 years if done online while working. Furthering my education would not help me further my career path at my current job.

1hm3hno,Should I take a gap year from university?,"
I’m a 19 year old student in my first year of university in Belgium. I’m studying Multimedia and Creative Technologies and I’m considering of taking a gap year. Here’s why.

I’ve finished high school really well, and on top of that, I’ve also finished a 1 year course at IT STEP Academy which is a known international academy and this gave me a profesional diploma in Graphic Design. 
As a job I always wanted to become a graphic designer for a company, and that’s why I did this course. And my mentality was finishing high school, graduating from the Academy and going straight to university to study more graphic design, but now that I’m on winter break in my first year of university, a part of me regrets it a little for not staying home one year.

Besides that, I also have my own YouTube channel that has slowly been growing, which is good news for me because ultimately I want to be able to do YouTube full time. For reference, I’ve got videos with 40k, 50k and 60k views on my YouTube channel and I’m getting payouts from YouTube every month, ranging between 70-100 USD, but I’m planning to dedicate as much time as I can in order to make it my main source of income.

My biggest question is this. Should I take a gap year, go back home and get a job as a graphic designer in my home country which is where I graduated from IT STEP Academy? I really want to work because for one, while I’m in university my mom (single mother) is paying my rent every month which is a lot, and our financial situation is very bad at the moment. It’s very hard for my mom to pay hundreds and even thousand of euros per month to pay rent/groceries for me. And before you go ahead and say it, yes I have tried to apply for jobs as a student in Belgium. I have spent 3 months, the whole autumn trying to get a job. I think I’ve applied for hundreds of jobs and nothing. Everyone tells me you need to know Dutch in order to get a job in Belgium, and I don’t know Dutch. I’ve applied to every fast food restaurant, every local one, I’ve applied even to delivery companies and nothing. 

That’s why I want to take a gap year and work from back home while I grow my YouTube channel. If my YouTube channel takes off and I make good money from work I’ll continue doing it and not go back to uni, if not, worst case scenario I go back to university because my university allows me to take off where I left off. 

What do you think I should do? I basically wanna focus more on YouTube but instead of doing university and not having money I’ll work and have my own money while I grow my channel. I’ve also found a lot of job options for graphic designers in companies from my home country and I’m qualified for a lot of them.

I’ve been working at my company for almost a year now, and I’m feeling increasingly frustrated with my role. I started as an Account Manager, and about 7 months in, the Regional Sales Manager position opened up. I was told I’d be stepping in as an ""intern"" for the role for around 4 months. This was supposed to be a temporary thing, but in that time, my responsibilities tripled—no extra pay.

After those 4 months, my boss told me I needed to ""prove myself"" and said I’d officially get the full-time position once I was ready. It's now almost a year of me constantly getting praise from my boss, and I’m still in the ""interim"" position, with the same responsibilities, but no extra pay. 

My boss is great—he’s supportive, a good teacher, and a people person. Throughout the years he’s  constantly told me that he’s been trying to convince management to give me the role + extra incentives but nothing has ever happenedThe thing that really got to me, though, is the recent company-wide bonus. I received the smallest bonus of anyone - including positions lower than me just $800, which honestly felt insulting given my increased responsibilities+ all the hard work I put and got praised for this year.

I respect my boss and enjoy learning from him, but at this point, I can’t help but feel undervalued. Am I being used here?

I'm 19 and I'm in the UK. I started working in IT when I was 15, doing work experience. That role turned into a junior technician job when I was 16 at apprenticeship pay (4.67 an hour). After 6 months, my pay increased to £10/hr. FF 2 years, I now work as a hardware engineer in a workshop, at a slightly better rate of 23k/yr. I would like to say I'm pretty good at what I do, and have a pretty good amount of knowledge for my age. I have experience in datacentre, and some pretty good hands on experience with dell and supermicro equipment especially. Wondering what I should do for next steps. Once I learn to drive I have the opportunity to become a field engineer, probably with a pay rise to about 26-28k, or so I've heard. This is good money, but long term I don't think there's much room to grow being a field engineer. I'm seeking advice on what to do next, and how to increase my salary at a steady rate over the years. I'm very much willing to learn and grow, I just need some advice on how to do that.



TLDR: 19 working in IT in the UK, earning 23k, need advice on how to grow in the coming years, and how to advance my career to something perhaps more technical and challenging.",FatRedditor69v2,2,1.0,0,1735137758,2024-12-25 14:42:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hm1wbi/19_in_the_uk_working_in_it_need_advice_for_next/,12,2024
1hm1w7t,"Internal transfer - I have made the same mistake twice, and I need urgent advice.","I have been at my company (very large tech company, household name) for one year now. I was hired in January 2024 in city Y due to me needing a visa for city X (where my team are based). I was not obliged to go to city X, but I was willing as I had just completed an internship there during the previous six months.

In April of 2024 I obtained the visa, but due to mounting mental health struggles, I cancelled the move because an international transfer would not have been good for me at that moment in time. This was all OK, a question was asked by HR to my manager about why I cancelled the move, because it costs the company money and resources to pay the immigration lawyer to file my case. But there was no issue.

In October of 2024 I decided that I was open to the move again, and requested the transfer again. My manager jokingly asked me whether I am really sure, and also joked about how ridiculous the whole ordeal is (because I cancelled the last one). But, we triggered the process again, the immigration lawyer filed my case, and I now have the visa. This process took around 6 weeks, over November and December.

During these 6 weeks, my mental health has taken a terrible turn in part due to being dumped. I am back on antidepressants, suffering from panic attacks daily, and have lost over 6kg. I can obtain proof of this from my doctors and psychiatrist. I would probably say I am in the worst spot I ever have been, and I am by no means equipped to deal with this international move in January. Every fibre of my being wants to cancel it. But I realise how ridiculous this looks from the outside, and I am worried. This is all adding to the stress that I am currently under.  
  
I don't know what to do? I am worried that if I cancel the move again, I risk being fired. I am wasting company resources and behaving in a way that is not reasonable. Even if I can explain it.  What should I do? I am worried that if I make the move I will quit in a few months because of the toll this will take on me. I just want to stay where I am, and would even pay the company the several thousands in lawyer fees that they have wasted on me. This is incredibly embarrassing and I am ashamed that I have let my mental health impact my job to this extent. Please can you offer some support and advice? I need it badly.

1hm1cri,What degree to go into: maths or an engineering one? What about a double degree?,"Good afternoon! I'm a student in the Spanish equivalent of Year 13, so I should decide what degree to pick this year. When I was younger, I wanted to study Chemistry, but I realized I liked learning facts over actually studying it, so I've dropped the idea. Now, I'm considering studying either a maths degree or an engineering one. I had a 9.8/10 grade in Maths last year (I was the best in my class), and a 9/10 in the Technology & Engineering subject, but this year I am doing better in technology and a bit worse in maths. However, I'm aware that grades are arbitrary and one shouldn't really pick their degree based on them.

I don't know if I'd say I like problem solving. I like getting integrals right, Boolean algebra; the sort of stuff you only see at school (university maths leans more toward proofs and engineering degrees have a lot of physics, which I don't like; I picked Chemistry as another elective this year just so I wouldn't have to study Physics), so I don't know if I'd do well in the degree. I don't feel much of a pull towards anything. However, Maths and Technology are pretty much the only subjects I enjoy studying.

Now, inside engineering, I can pick between Chemical (not many jobs, at least, in my country, so I'm not choosing that one), Telecommunications (this one was actually my backup plan for a while, in case I didn't get a high enough grade to pick Maths), Computer/Informatics (I don't like programming), Software (I don't like programming), Electrical (I'm bad at circuits), Mechanical (I don't know what I think about this one).

There is also a double degree being offered for Maths & Telecommunications Engineering. They likely won't even ask for as high as a grade that they ask to get into Maths. However, my father has advised me that if I don't get into Maths, I should simply go into only Telecommunications, because a double degree is too much work and too hard.

I don't know what I should do. Should Maths be my first choice and then should I leave Telecommunications as my second choice? Should Telecommunications, or any other engineering in general, be my first choice? Should I go for the double degree? Any advice is appreciated, thank you very much for reading.",AttentionCravings,1,1.0,0,1735135718,2024-12-25 14:08:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hm1cri/what_degree_to_go_into_maths_or_an_engineering/,12,2024
1hm19bm,Am I Suited for Web Development? Seeking Advice,"  
Hi everyone,

I need some advice because I'm starting to question whether web development is the right path for me.

I graduated with an IT degree last year and completed a nine-month internship during my studies. During that time, I worked on a few projects, and overall, it was a good experience—challenging but enjoyable. However, I didn’t stay on with the company after the internship and had to search for a new job.

I found a company and was given a one-month trial period. Unfortunately, I didn’t perform well during that time. It was a tough experience, and it left me doubting my abilities as a web developer. Since I struggled to meet expectations, I’ve been feeling extremely worried that this career path might not be for me.

For some context: I’d describe myself as a typical programmer—I enjoy coding, but after about five hours of intense work, I start to feel mentally drained, and my productivity drops significantly. I also tend to overthink things, which sometimes slows me down.

If any of you have been in a similar situation or have advice on how to navigate this, I’d greatly appreciate your input. Should I keep pushing forward, or is it worth considering a different path?

Thanks in advance for any advice!",EasyGoingLad29,2,1.0,4,1735135347,2024-12-25 14:02:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hm19bm/am_i_suited_for_web_development_seeking_advice/,12,2024
1hm03hs,Advice for dealing with a boomer boss?,"I work a office job in a small team in the public sector and the main boss (in his 70s) is the biggest micromanager on planet earth. I chose to work through christmas / family lives far away so its just me. I don’t report to the main boss directly / I report to a manager below him.

The main boss called me three times on the morning of christmas eve asking about work updates. Even when my work schedule is update to date. Even when my manager is up to date with work stuff / checked in with my manager last week. He was basically over-riding my manager and telling me do some additional work stuff. On the morning of christmas eve when literally all of our clients and departments are off. We work hybrid and even though he’s off he said he wants me to work from office when nobody of the team is available everyone is off for the holidays. Also it’s the public sector, there are no imminent deadlines, we’re not an emergency service, why tf are you chasing me at this time?

The guy seems to have a subtle indirect undertone that I am underperforming or not working properly but when I asked him point blank about feedback and what he wants me to do differently he avoided the question like a politician. He’s not evil enough to document stuff and send me emails etc to effectively build a case to fire me - he also isn’t the most liberal or open minded person and just loves to tell people to go to the office to work even though he himself does not. He loves to put his hands on my day to day work, which I don’t think is suitable for someone at his level (do you not have bigger and more important tasks to do?). Guy even said during his christmas time off I should call him if I get stuck with work stuff (when he is on leave), effectively not giving me any excuse to “sit around” (in his understanding probably).

May be because I’m a millennial idk but never in my life will I ever love a job this much that I will allow people to call me on my phone outside working hours. The way boomers are married to their jobs is insane. I can somewhat understand why they do this though - their jobs made way for them to buy a house start a family on one income etc - no longer true for the average millennial in 2024 given the stagnant wages. I also think at their age they are perhaps very lonely and have nobody to talk to so subordinates at work become their soundboard. And the boomer boss pays their salary so the subordinate has no other option but to listen and pretend to engage in conversation. I am grateful that I even have a job given the current job market but yeah it can get difficult to process at times.

Dunno where I was going with this probably venting thanks for reading. Any advice to navigate the situation would be helpful.

I’m majoring I marketing and haven’t changed my major. I figured I just finish this degree. However in struggling with worry that this would just be a waste of time.

I’m looking for opportunities that pay well at least not instantly. A path where I can work hard and make a high income and then go full time into building my own business. I’ve tried starting a business in college and I tell you, that shits not what everyone makes it seem. I have minimal funds to fund the business venture making it difficult without investors. At this point my best decision is to work my way to earning a stable high income while working my way to building my own venture and definitely make more than 6 figures a year.


What are some recommendations for me to plan these next 5-10 years of my life. I know I want to make a lot of money in terms of income and that will take time. What are the industries that are high paying that are worth pursuing for a job, and eventually turning that into a business long term?

I hate marketing honestly, I have an interest in finance, but I’ve never done any internships yet and I plan to do some during the summer. I hate office work, I’m naturally a hands on worker and feel more focused when I’m doing things hands on like car detailing, fixing things, building, etc. 

My 2 interest that I really want to do is Finance and Electrician work. However I can only chose one. What is I hate both, how can I strategize this? My college counselor doesn’t help with shit on this lol

1hlyrx7,How i landed 5 clients through this simple AI tool!!!,"Hey everyone,  
I just wanted to share something that helped me land my first 5 clients on Upwork, and it’s way simpler than I expected. I’m still in high school, but I thought I’d try freelancing to earn some extra cash. Problem was, my resume was kinda bland and didn’t stand out at all.

So I found this free resume-building tool called [ResumeFromSpace](https://resumefromspace.com/offer?ref=67684dcaf08f26f1779d7a91), and let me tell you, it made all the difference. Here’s what it did for me:

1. **Easy to Use:** I didn’t have to deal with complicated templates or formatting. It walked me through everything step by step.
2. **Professional Design:** The best part? The design was way cleaner than my old one. It looked way more polished and professional.
3. **Shareable Link:** Instead of attaching a boring PDF, I got a shareable link to my resume, which looks way more modern and made me feel more confident.

After updating my resume using this tool, I sent it to a bunch of clients on Upwork, and I got 5 clients in my first month! Honestly, I’m still shocked, but I think the new resume definitely helped me stand out from the crowd.

I just wanted to share this with anyone who’s thinking about starting freelancing but isn’t sure how to make their resume pop. If you're curious, feel free to DM me and I can share how I did it.

This year I needed to make ends meet for various life reasons and took a job as a logistics teacher in a professional high school (don't know what's the equivalent in the USA or in English but basically here in France those are high schools where you learn a job and go to work once you finish).

It is supposed to be a one year thing just so I can land back on my feet and go back to marketing. But I made various contacts with the local companies (out students must have training there twice a year) and I am asking myself is it a good career to go back at ?

I am not 25 anymore I got 3 kids and a wife that I must support now. My main concern is making money, to be blunt. I don't dislike the logistics work, but can I get a 100K job easily if I go back to school and earn a masters degree ? It's something that's on my mind and I don't know what to make of it yet.

What bothers me is that compared to sales or digital marketing it hasn't got a bonus component does it ?

Also you must chose between logistics, supply chain or transport. I like logistics more because you're in the warehouse and even in a managing/supervisor role you're not glued behind your screen. But supply chain seems to pay more ?

1hlx4tg,Questioning whether it’s worth it to become a psychiatrist,"Hello!

21M from the Middle East, former computer science student. I am now considering a career in psychiatry (possibly research).

When I began learning about neurodivergent disorders, the idea of understanding behavior through neuronal activity instead of black-and-white labels (’they’re not trying to socialize', ‘they’re not serious enough’ etc) really made so much sense to me, I want to tell others who put as much effort as their peers that their struggles don’t come from them being lazy, but because their brains simply work in a different way.

so my question is; Is it worth the \~11-year commitment to become a psychiatrist?

About me:

* I am a Neurodivergent myself (ADHD & Autism)
* I am working a company in a contract for 3 years, so the earliest I would be able to start is 25 year old.
* I would like to believe I am good at understanding people, but I think I really suck at expressing myself.
* stupidly honest, which might result in me hurting patients’ feelings.

Any advice from psychiatrists or others in the field?

I ran ot of ideas of what to do to earn some money online. I'm looking more options besides math tutor. I don't feel confident enough on my Math skill to be a tutor yet.

1hlshum,I need some insight,"So I graduated this year with a BS in Computer Information Systems.

I was able to still work at my university past graduation up until this Aug. During that time period I've been applying, and I'd get interviews, but closest I'd get is second/final interview. 

I nailed a ""Computer Technician"" job in November, but it was actually misleading, and it's straight nothing like the title.

Been working here ever since, and it's just been constant micromanaging and bad business decisions that just drain me to where I just can't really enjoy anything once I get to work. In just my time, I've had multiple new hires come and leave within 1-2 days. It's because of the misleading position title, and because of the managing.

I want to quit, and go back to school to be a dietitian, because I like that field too. Sure I can do both, but I tried this Aug - Dec, and it was just difficult. I'd like to just quit and just focus all my time on school. I live with my parents still and have a good amount of savings, plus I've been saving from this job as well 

I know I hear that it's recommended to leave once you have another job lined up, but I honestly can't mentally and emotionally take it. Sometimes I also feel it just physically too.

I spoke to one of the employees of the pharmacy company who referred me and he mentioned they are extremely short staffed and are looking for someone to join immediately.

 I am interviewing with other company but due to holidays there is delay in hiring process there.

My question is should I negotiate with them or accept the offer since I had selected the range already while applying for it. Can I use leverage of my interview with another company? They offered me 70k, the highest end of my expected range. From what I have heard usually the first offer is the lowest one.

1hlr0u3,Good jobs for my picky feelings?,"Short introduction about me: I'm someone with extremely limited skills and experience, and I have no idea what kind of career path I'm supposed to pursue. So far my only work experience is a fast food place, I loved it for the people I worked with, but management, hours, and pay were all terrible, so I left. And all those problems there really boosted my current anxiety and stress levels. They're through the roof, and nowadays I feel like there's very little I can handle without having some kind of breakdown.

Now onto the present, I have no idea what kind of job to aim for, but I have a couple things in mind that I do and don't want:

Some things I really want to avoid include customer service. I know that's a big one, since that's what most entry-level jobs come down to, but I've learned that I can't mentally handle working with customers too well. Actually, in general I don't like public attention, I prefer places where I can work behind the scenes. I also generally try to avoid places on too high a scale, or too small, I prefer places that are comfortably medium.

Now onto things I do want, I'd love some job that lets me follow the exact same routine every day, I work best in repetition, even if I'm not great at first, I'll try and master my routine once I learn it. Then I like places that are clean and orderly, I'm not very good at critical thinking, so I like there to be a set procedure for things, rather than having to figure out what to do on my own, I don't trust myself. 

But I realize the thing that is truly most important for me in a new job, is to find somewhere where I can work as a community again, and feel like I'm a genuine help. That's what I loved about my first job, the fact that I got the opportunity to bond with my coworkers on a personal level, my motivation to come to work every day was the knowledge that I was helping these people I truly cared about. Helping my friends is my #1 motivator in most of my life, so I really just want to be somewhere where I can be a help in a community once again.

I know that's a lot of me being picky, but that's just how my anxiety-high brain works. I don't need a job to check every one of those boxes of course, but job websites make it hard to filter stuff like that. I'm just hoping for some general advice here to be pointed in the right direction.",Psychological_Log434,1,1.0,1,1735090016,2024-12-25 01:26:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hlr0u3/good_jobs_for_my_picky_feelings/,12,2024

1hlok6t,Put on PIP before 3 months are up - how am I going to get another job in this market?,"I was lucky enough after 7 months of unemployment to find something - but the role was not what it seemed. I wanted to have a job I was used to and could do while working on building up my freelance efforts to replace my 9-5. But 3 strikes at the beginning of my experience (wouldnt meet my salary floor even though it was a 1k difference, booked a really heinous hotel for my orientation despite a decent one being closer to the office, two live checks that took longer to process - I was basically working for free 7 days out of two pay periods) turned me off and had me quiet quitting early. They also use proprietary systems that are glitchy, dysfunctional, and make work take longer. Some of their ""benefits"" are deceptive too. It wouldn't be such a bad gig bc people are generally nice but I was always planning to stay a couple months, stick the experience on my resume and start applying.

My underperformance is real, but there were also gaps in my training. I'm surprised this came before 90 days were even up. My manager put on daily 1:1s and that's when the micromanagement started, even after I caught up on homework (from training class) and work tasks - I felt like I was improving - getting more things done and communicating way more and faster - but my manager delivered the news and said the decision was based on me not sending an email update and finishing a task in time (a task I was told to deprioritize to work on other things. I also notified them of my struggle with ADHD and not having access to meds at the moment - my manager passed this information to a people experience person without notifying me, who abruptly set up a meeting with me and mentioned ""medical issues"" they heard of within the first 2 minutes. Though I understand where they're coming from, I feel a PIP is overall unfair.

Now, I'm afraid I'll be fired without anything else lined up. I applied over 500+ times before being recruited for this job. I know the best thing to do is try to hold onto a decent thing - but I do not want to waste time earnestly trying to improve and comply with the PIP just for my manager to disregard it over a mistake I may likely make.

im just so unsure of what to do. do i need to just suck it up and stop expecting to like my job? am i just hoping the grass is always greener somewhere else? or should i take a chance and try to find something that uses my strengths better and is fulfilling? i chose engineering because i wanted to help people and this research engineer position would allow me to help and mentor students and possibly even be a lecturer one day. i just now it will only get harder to change careers as i get older, have kids, etc. so now really feels like the time.

1hlmb6n,Confused with Career Trajectory - Chemical Engineer post grad working with industry environmental affairs and lobbying,"**Hi Everyone,**

I’m posting here to seek career advice and guidance on improving my profile. I graduated with a master’s in chemical engineering three years ago. I was supposed to graduate in 2020 but deferred because the job market at the time wasn’t promising. For context, I am a non-European who studied in Belgium and didn’t have the option to stay back and look for jobs after graduation. This was the primary reason for deferring my graduation.

One significant barrier I’ve faced in finding a job as a process engineer is the language requirement. Many roles require interaction with operators in the local language. While the shortage of personnel in STEM fields has led some companies to be slightly more open to hiring foreigners who don’t speak Dutch, they often still prefer locals or other Europeans as their first choice.

After graduation, I landed a role in regulatory affairs as a consultant in the downstream plastics industry. I took this job out of necessity because my family was going through significant financial difficulties, and I needed to become financially independent as soon as possible. In this role, I managed projects related to regulatory issues. For instance, if a substance was flagged by authorities as a potential respiratory sensitizer, my responsibilities included:

* Defending the substance by proposing improved process steps to reduce exposure,
* Conducting exposure measurements and identifying areas for process improvement,
* Performing socio-economic analyses, and more.

Currently, I work for an industry body representing upstream polymer resin manufacturers. My primary focus is on a program aimed at reducing resin loss to the environment, as these are primary microplastics. My responsibilities include:

* Overseeing the implementation of industry-wide best practices,
* Managing the development of a methodology for estimating losses to the environment using risk management practices (e.g., Layers of Protection/Bowtie models),
* Facilitating data collection,
* Leading the development and deployment of a resin loss prevention certification program based on ISO 14001 principles.

Another major aspect of my role involves influencing the regulatory framework. As a subject matter expert, I represent the industry in discussions with European authorities. I was actively involved in drafting the framework alongside the European Commission, advocating for the industry’s position. When these policies enter the political sphere, I help conduct impact assessments, particularly if proposals might negatively affect the industry (e.g., shifting from flexible to rigid packaging).

Broadly, my role requires stakeholder management, project management, and a blend of engineering and sustainability knowledge. To enhance my profile, I recently completed a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) course and have been involved in managing industry net-zero initiatives. However, much of this work is at the theoretical and policy level.

I sometimes feel underwhelmed because I’ve never had the opportunity to work in a traditional ""engineering"" role. Having worked for three years now, I worry that companies might not consider me for engineering roles. I also feel that lacking engineering experience could hinder my ability to move into higher management positions within a company.

Given this background, I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to carve my career path, specifically on these three points:

1. What steps should I take to transition from EU affairs to a role in a chemical or large manufacturing company, with the first goal being to get hired?
2. Do I need hands-on engineering experience to advance up the corporate ladder?
3. Should I consider pursuing online courses (e.g., in management or a certificate in supply chain management) to transition into a different field?

Thank you in advance for your advice and insights!",flaringmonkey,1,1.0,0,1735073682,2024-12-24 20:54:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hlmb6n/confused_with_career_trajectory_chemical_engineer/,12,2024
1hlm9x4,What should I do? ,"I recently completed my Master's in Communication and Journalism from a decent college in Mumbai. During my second year, I interned at WTC Mumbai and a startup led by an IITian.

Previously, I worked at various places to earn pocket money, but the experiences were generally unpleasant. However, working with this founder changed my perspective — it didn’t have to be that way. Unfortunately, the startup shut down due to funding issues, but we parted on good terms.

In December 2024, he offered me the role of Chief of Staff, and I accepted. A few weeks in, I’m questioning my decision. I enjoy working with him, but the dynamic role demands much of my time. On a call today, he urged me to reconsider my priorities.

I’m preparing for my PhD entrance exam in January and feel confident about qualifying for a good college, in India or abroad. My research papers could also secure my admission. I had planned to pursue my PhD in humanities and continue working with him, as I believe I can manage both. Humanities align with my passion for reading, and I expect to balance the workload. Am I wrong to think so?

1hlkihc,Back degree to Nursing? ,"Hi Friends! I'm currently trying to figure out my plans postbacc. I am on a gap year working in research right now. I have been intending to pursue a graduate degree in clinical ethics, as I have an immense passion for bioethics but also specifically the clinical application. I absolutely love working in the clinical setting. I finished my EMT-B recently-ish and have been working part-time with Fire as an EMT and absolutely love it. I did it as a way to keep busy and get involved with patients while working in research. 

I finished my undergraduate with a BS in Neuroscience and a BA in Biomedical Ethics and Philosophy. 

I was talking to my mom the other day and she mentioned that she has seen how much I am thriving and enjoying working in the medical setting as an EMT and brought up the idea of maybe going on to get my nursing degree, or NP, with the potential to subfocus or pursue a masters in bioethics. I REALLY love this idea. I've been dreading applying to graduate schools because it has not felt exactly right and has not gotten me excited. Bu the idea of going going into nursing really thrills me. I love the challenge of caring for people and trying to find out what is going on, while also dealing with the ethics and complications. 

Does anyone have an idea or advice on how to achieve that? We were thinking potentially that I might be able to do a few of the pre-reqs my degree would not have covered - like A&P - at my local community college, where I also did my EMT, then find a masters program in nursing potentially?

1hljpqq,"First Job After Graduation – Toxic Environment, No Support, Should I Quit?","I am a 22-year-old guy from India. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering in May 2024 and started working as an ASE at a service-based company in June 2024. 

Until September, I was in training at the company, and for a month, I was on the bench before getting onboarded to a project in November. 

My project team doesn't have a proper onboarding process for new joiners, which has made me struggle a lot. I faced difficulties in gaining access to project resources, getting KTs (Knowledge Transfers), and learning different technologies.

The KT videos are poorly organized, with many parts missing, which has left me still unable to fully understand the project structure and flow.

They gave me an entirely new service to develop using a completely new language and framework that I have no experience with. Honestly, I don’t even know anything about it. However, I was okay with it, thinking it would be a learning opportunity for me. 

But today, things took a turn for the worse. I somehow managed to create the frontend and integrate it with the backend in 3 days, only to be told that ""anyone else would have done it in a day."" Of course, they would! They know the exact project dependencies, the language, and the framework. I’m completely new to all of this.

It got even worse when I requested PTO (Paid Time Off). I saw that everyone else was taking leave to be with their family during the year-end, so I thought I should ask too. My PL (Project Lead) responded by saying I couldn’t take leave because I’m still on probation. But my probation ended just a week ago, so just say you don't want to approve my leave.

Then they said that I couldn’t take leave because it was ""last-minute,"" even though I asked for leave on the 31st of December (a week in advance). Meanwhile, other team members could apply for leave on the 23rd or 24th, and it was approved. I even notified my PL a week before that, back in early December, with tentative leave dates.

The company doesn’t give a holiday on January 1st, so now I’m stuck working on both December 31st and January 1st with no hope of taking leave anytime soon. It feels like I’m never going to get approved for time off.

To top it off, they specifically assigned me work to do late on a Friday night, asking me to use my weekend to complete it. I'm not getting paid for weekend work, and honestly, I'm not getting paid enough to work 11 hours a day on average when 9 hours is the norm.

I don't know what to do. The work culture of the team is really getting to me. I don’t have any other job offers at the moment, but I don’t want to continue working in such a toxic environment.",AverageIndian11,1,1.0,7,1735065610,2024-12-24 18:40:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hljpqq/first_job_after_graduation_toxic_environment_no/,12,2024

1hliox8,CONFESSION: I took a stats class... and I liked it!,"Something terrifying has happened. First some backstory; this semester I went back to school at 28 to pursue an associates degree in an allied health field. I was taking pre-reqs and one of them was a statistics course. That's where the trouble began. Granted I got along really well with the professor so that may be a part of this, and the class moved kind of quickly for me but I finished with a 95.

I never liked math but I went into this semester with an open mind. I realized in my years out of school how part of why I did poorly in math was I was downright afraid of it, and I really didn't have a reason to be. I found this statistics course interesting and really enjoyed the class discussions which were centered around lessons based on real world applications of statistics.

So my question is; what if I actually have an interest in statistics? Are there careers you'd suggest I research outside of data analysis? (is that even a good field?) Even beyond school and careers are there any websites or free learning modules you could suggest I explore to get an idea of if this is something I could do for 40 hours a week 46-50 weeks a year? I'm continuing my allied health pathway for now, but if there's a career out there that offers better pay and work conditions with equal demand and ***relative*** ease of entry, I'm willing to explore pursuing a bachelors degree.

1hlhzno,Completely Pivoting Again At 23.... My current job is going to kill me.,"Hello everyone, looking for some general advice or wisdom. I'll try not to ramble too much about the details, but I graduated recently with a ""useless"" BA degree after choosing to withdraw from a graduate program. It would have been a lot of debt for a low-income job. I managed to pivot into another field, and I'm now making a good salary for my first job out of college. I worked hard to get it and I'm proud of myself, but I didn't realize the large amount of liability/stress that comes with the field I broke into. 

These positions are underfunded, hated by coworkers/management, and if shit hits the fan, you WILL be thrown under the bus and could even go to prison if you don't constantly CYA well enough. I do not want to be in that environment for the rest of my life, even if the pay is good. The stress has already started to effect my day-to-day health, which sucks because I like the other aspects of the job.

I know I'm only 23, but the idea of pivoting again is very daunting because I'm scared of making the wrong choice again. I currently live with my parents and have about 10k left in student loans. I'll have to save up for a car after that, as my current one belongs to them. 

Once I get those covered, I'm thinking about my options. What could give me a second chance? Getting a second bachelor's degree would cost a fortune, and I'm not sure what other graduate programs I would qualify for because my BA degree was not math/science heavy. I'm trying to research, but it's all very disheartening and seems unachieveable so I wanted to come here for some general advice/success stories.

I know I'm not screwed, and am technically not even in a bad spot, but I'm still scared shitless because I don't have a set path forward. What would you / did you do in my position?

1hlhw7k,Monitoring Software: Am I going to be in trouble?,"Hello and thank you for reading. I'm in a full-panic spiral since this was announced and I guess I'm just looking for advice.

My employer is piloting more extensive monitoring software on my company computer, not yet implemented on mine, and I'm really worried about what they are about to find out.

I love my job. I find it meaningful. I work hard. I do 25% more work by volume than the next closest colleague, and >50% more than my team average. My quality is impeccable. I frequently win awards, have high year-end ratings, and am consistently told what great work I do. The problem is that this takes maybe between 2 and 4 hours a day and with the new monitoring software it's definitely going to get noticed.

I don't leave my office during work hours, I respond to any message or email or question immediately. I don't have another job or anything like that. But I am medically diagnosed ADHD so large parts of my day are spent doing... embarrassingly nothing. Hitting my broken turbo button until it works, then I am 10,000% hyperfocused until I get too tired to have confidence in the quality of my work. The type of work I do, quality *cannot* be sacrificed. I can't ever be wrong.

My employer started with a baby version of this software about 2 years ago and I really tried to do things their way, working slowly and uniformly, it took about 3 months before my performance tanked to the point that I was on track to be let go. When I abandoned working how they want and went back to doing what I was doing, I immediately start winning awards again.

I'm really sorry. I don't even know what my question is. The monitoring software is going to say that I should be doing 2-3x the amount of daily work, 4x+ what the average person is doing. If I do that then I'm going to burn out.

I have a good relationship with my boss, do I mention any of this (not written) to them before the software is rolled out on my pc? Am I worried about nothing? Would you be mad if you were my employer?",Future-Wish6061,34,0.9300000071525574,75,1735060308,2024-12-24 17:11:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hlhw7k/monitoring_software_am_i_going_to_be_in_trouble/,12,2024

1hlh8ae,"Former ""gifted kid"" turned special needs mom with passion but no drive. What industry can I succeed in?","This is long. Skip to the last paragraph for the tl;dr if you don't want to read the details. I'm not very concise and I have ADHD, so I apologize in advance for my squirrel-like way of explaining things.

Like the title says, I (38F) grew up a ""gifted kid"", getting straight A grades, on the Dean's List, etc. In every job I've had, everything came very naturally to me, and, if I liked it there, I moved up the ranks as quickly as the company would allow my supervisors to push me. But I have so much passion and feel a calling to do more for humanity. I've been passionate about making the world a better place since I was little, living in poverty with a single teen mom and her single mom and seeing the worst of modern society's treatment of humans. It makes working a regular job feel like my soul is being sucked out of my body. I also get bored if I get stuck in a low position for very long because I master things quickly and become frustrated at not being able to take on more responsibility so I can help my peers improve, as well. I originally went to college for Social Work, but dropped out when I got married and lost financial aid and couldn't afford to pay for it myself, and got disheartened being told I'd never make it as a social worker because I'm ""too caring,"" and it would break my heart. I went back as a sociology major last year, but some bad things happened in my life that sabotaged that attempt, so I quit again. Now, I don't have time to finish a degree before getting a job. I just need to make money now, and hopefully find a place that will support me getting a degree and/or training while working.

After covid took the best job I've ever had from me (I worked in the hospitality industry and my position was permanently eliminated), I spent some time trying to build my own life coaching business, but anxiety, PTSD, chronic health issues, and massive imposter syndrome... are all the excuses I used to not take responsibility for my failure to really put myself out there and be successful. I spent thousands of dollars on training, advertising, supplies, and even a virtual assistant (though I'll admit the company I used did not deliver anything near what they promised in the training of their assistants). The more time and money I spent on it without getting any actual paying clients (my bleeding heart (and ill-advised business coaching strategies) led me to take on many free ones), the harder it got to actually make myself try to get paying clients. I was good at it. I gave some clients amazing results. I also failed a couple of clients when I was too beaten down to be helpful to anyone, so I gave up. 

Now, my husband is stuck in a terrible situation of not being able to find a better job and being a severely underpaid android developer because he took the first thing he could get, which was a crappy paying contracting job where he's indispensable to them, but his contracting company won't let the client company hire him on direct because they know it's impossible for anyone to actually get a job in tech anymore because the market is oversaturated, so he's at their mercy. His pay isn't enough to pay the bills anymore and our debt is mounting, and I need to get a job that pays well so that he can have less anxiety and maybe even just change careers to something he has an actual shot at being valued in. 

But we have kids with special needs who have multiple standing weekly therapies, as well as unpredictable needs for me to manage, in addition to my own unpredictable health problems. In my last job, I had made it through long enough to qualify for FMLA for the times I needed to suddenly take off, and my employer gave me plenty of PTO and good enough benefits to have an enjoyable life without feeling like a slave, and still pay the bills on my income alone. They valued my high quality of work, and let me work around my life's needs to do it. I highly doubt I'll ever be able to find another job like that. 

But here I am, asking reddit if anyone knows a place where I can work remote, have a flexible schedule, be valued for my contribution and recognized for the quality of my work, make a difference in people's lives, and still get paid a living wage. I know I won't last long unless I find something like this, so I'm trying to avoid something that will cause me to have a total break down.

I have experience in customer service, sales, tech support, cybersecurity, Medicare health insurance, surveying (people, not land), hospitality, fundraising, mentoring, life coaching, and functional nutrition. No formal degrees, only some college experience and professional certification for coaching.

1hlgk6b,Should i stay or move on,"Should i stay or move on?

I’ve been working as a marketing executive at a new company I joined 4 months ago. I have 5 years of experience in the field, but things have become frustrating since my marketing manager left.

The CEO has stepped in as our direct manager, but he doesn’t seem to understand my role or the value of my work. He avoids meetings, isn’t data-driven, and often bypasses me to ask non-marketing coworkers for advice on marketing decisions. These coworkers, instead of redirecting him to me, give random opinions just to be involved, which feels really undermining.

On top of that, some coworkers have changed their attitudes since the manager left. They’ve become bossy, asking me for irrelevant information just to seem knowledgeable in case the CEO asks them for updates. It’s chaotic—no one knows the team hierarchy anymore. I’m technically at the top, but it feels like I have no authority.

I’ve been considering looking for a new job because I’m tired of the lack of recognition and the messy dynamics. But I’m worried I might be overreacting.

To make things worse:

	•	When I joined, HR said it’s a 6-day workweek, but some team members work only 5 days. When I raised this, HR brushed it off, saying it’s “the owner’s decision,” and told me to take it up with him.

	•	Despite working extra hours and even on my off day (because marketing is dynamic), HR has warned me about being 3–5 minutes late.

	•	I recently discovered that colleagues in lower departments are earning higher salaries than me.

	•	The CEO refuses to communicate via email or WhatsApp. Instead, he sends his secretary to summon us when he wants to talk. If we need a meeting with him, even for urgent issues, we have to request it through his secretary two days in advance.

This environment feels exhausting and undervalues my work. Should I just move on? Or am I overthinking it?

Meanwhile, if I start looking for a new job, how should I handle this chaotic situation and protect my mental health while still doing my job?

Any advice would be appreciated.",husseinjabir97,1,1.0,5,1735056340,2024-12-24 16:05:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hlgk6b/should_i_stay_or_move_on/,12,2024

1hldtpg,Seeking Objective Feedback - Moving to New Job,"Hello Reddit,

  
 Obligatory ""this is my first time posting on Reddit"" opener.

I'm looking for some outside perspective on a big career transition. I'm 36, I've been in an abusive work situation for over a decade and am finally moving to a new job. Staying with my current employer as been due to a mix of self-destructive tendencies, low self-esteem/depression, and COVID lockdowns, but I've worked hard to turn my life around. I've gone through therapy, gotten sober, lost weight, went back to school, got into a reasonably healthy relationship, and I am addressing the roots of my anger and depression.

The new job pays $10k more, seems like a healthier environment, and aligns with my skills (IT management). It’s also a team-based role, so I’m not the sole technical decision-maker which is nice. It feels like a place where not knowing everything won’t get me fired—a stark contrast to my current job.

Still, I’m nervous. The new job involves wearing company apparel, a delay in health insurance, and it’s... different. What if I mess it all up? I’ve also been reading Reddit horror stories about bad job transitions, which hasn’t helped. (I've also read other horror stories about people being out of work for over a year or finally getting a job just to have it pay 20k less.)

**Current job:**

* Senior IT Manager with a small MSP
* Helpdesk, helpdesk management, systems administration, network administration, project management, technical account management, documentation, coaching, technical training, customer onboarding, M365 management and administration, procurement, etc.

**Pros of staying with my current job:**

* Familiar (""the devil I know"").
* 100% remote.
* Flexible enough for studying (I earned a bachelor’s, MBA, CAPM, ITIL, and several Microsoft certs in recent years).

**Cons of my current job:**

* No raise in 4 years, no bonus.
* I’m the ""crap filter"" for customers and juggle endless responsibilities: helpdesk, management, system administration, network admin, project management, training, documentation, procurement—the list goes on. 
* Owner listed my personal cell phone number as my office number and gave it out to hundreds of customers, vendors, and tied it to over 20 business-critical accounts as 2FA verification. So basically I'm spammed with all sorts of calls and texts.
* Emotional baggage from over a decade of mistreatment: financial abuse, insults, threats, physical assault, inappropriate touching from a customer, and much more.
* My boss’s response to a raise request was to suggest I add in-person sales on top of everything else and that ""I'm not worth anything more""
* Staying at one job for 11 years feels like career stagnation.

**Pros of the new job:**

* $10k more annually.
* Fresh start in a healthier environment.
* More local networking and exposure to new technologies.
* Hybrid setup, which I prefer over fully remote or fully onsite.
* The company seems to value me (they accepted my counteroffer for higher pay).
* The president aligns with my interest in cybersecurity, which supports my long-term career goals.
* This position focuses on technical account management which is one aspect of my current job, it'll help me improve in that area without dragging me eight different directions.

**Cons of the new job:**

* No longer the ""big fish"" in a toxic pond.
* Adjusting to company apparel.
* Don't really like driving, but it is hybrid.
* Fear of failure: What if I’m not as competent as I think and end up fired?

I’m looking for some combination of tough love (kick in the pants) and ""Dude, this is a good thing, calm down!"" And maybe some thoughts that even if this job isn’t my final career stop, two years here would still benefit me by breaking up my streak with my current employer, increasing my income, and opening new opportunities?

Looking for thoughts from brains less biased than my own. Thank you.",ShamblingDrone,1,1.0,5,1735047873,2024-12-24 13:44:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hldtpg/seeking_objective_feedback_moving_to_new_job/,12,2024

1hl6wev,I love my job but my bosses suck and have blacklisted me. ,"For context, I do actually really like my job. It’s the people above me that I don’t like. (Yeah I know, no one likes their boss lol).  But I started out well liked and moved up rank fast because of this, and I did a damn good job to get me noticed.  However, I had a supervisor who skirted so far around any kind of conflict that the refused to coach me and give me solid feedback or constructive criticism. They just told me I was doing great.  So I thought I was doing great. 
Until my annual raise came around and the percentage was much lower than expected. It wasn’t until that moment that they “found” things I wasn’t great at but never told me until this point. I wasn’t happy but moved on and worked to improve those things. 
A bit while later I was assigned a couple other supervisors who also could not tell me what I was supposedly missing the mark on. I managed to wrangle a couple smaller items to work on, and I consistently sought feedback to improve and grow. For months there was nothing I could do to improve, yet once again, annual raises came due and I was stuck with the same underwhelming percentage as last year. But what really irks me is that I have been working my ass off to improve and have been told that I have made great improvements, to be given the same mediocre raise.  (Raises are based on performance). 
I have talked to a few people above me and basically, I have been blacklisted from getting any kind of promotions, but no one is willing to tell me why, just a bunch of run around bs answers. So I have been tirelessly working to improve myself and it has been for nothing.  Yet, I do as well if not better than some of the people in my same role, who are paid so much more.

1hl650s,"Worried I'm a lazy worker/employee, how do I change and why do I even care?","I recently decided to master out of my PhD program; it was a decision that hinged on the revelation that I don't think I've ever been liked by an employer. I used to be a straight-A student in high school, but since college I have had consistent B's and C's. My research advisors in undergrad were all unimpressed by my work ethic/performance, and I had to attend a master's program to get letters of recommendation and boost my GPA to get into a PhD program. My master's advisor was similarly unimpressed by my work and I'm sure wrote me a lukewarm letter.

I thought I've been improving my work ethic and skill set over the years, but in the last month of my PhD, my advisor basically told me straight up that I didn't work hard enough and I was slacking off and I didn't know enough technically. We had weekly group meetings where we all presented our weekly progress, and I don't think I attended more than two in a row, as I was frequently overwhelmed with the amount of new information to learn and didn't have enough progress to talk about. (In my defense, the research was highly theoretical and I already struggled with the coursework prerequisites.)

I worry that I won't be able to hold a job. Those weekly meetings filled me with dread, and I'm sure many jobs will have similar productivity expectations. I have not been vigorously applying to jobs since becoming unemployed, and I am telling myself that I am uncertain about which types of roles to apply for, but it also feels like laziness. I have been told that I don't take feedback well and get defensive, and that I don't network enough, and I am too prideful and perfectionist about my work, and I am too emotional. I don't know how much of it is true, but I am truly terrified of not being able to grow a career because people hate working with me, and I have no professional references because no one enjoys working with me or thinks I get work done well and on time.

But why do I even care? I have tried to put this out of my mind by telling myself that I am doing what's best for me, and that other people's negative judgement of me shouldn't affect me. That my worth isn't defined by how much work I do or whether I am a good employee. Then why do I still get bone-chilled when someone is recounting a funny story about their ""nightmare coworker"" who sounds like how other people see me?

Hello, 

I am facing an issue in deciding whether to apply for an open promotion in my company or not, the reason behind this conflict is that it’s in a whole different department, I will be making a whole career shift, currently I’m supervising a team in my department for 1 and a half years, it has its ups and downs, however lately I haven’t been happy in this environment, and when this opportunity opened I felt guilty for considering it, kept thinking about all the people I met in this field and how most of them thought of me becoming a manager here one day, I’m not sure if I should stay for the sake of these great people I met or is it fear of they might think I’m a failure for switching to a different field, I know I’m overthinking it which is why I can’t sleep. 
But then I’m reminded that whatever career advancement I have in my current field, the same disadvantages that are the reason I want to leave will continue to follow me, the toxicity in this field is high even if the community holds one of the best people I met, but I don’t know if I should go for it, this feeling of being a failure in the eyes of the people I respect who expressed their wishes for me to become successful and head this entire department is gnawing at me. 
Or I should put myself first, esp if the salary is higher? 
I will also have to assign someone to lead the team before I leave. lots of responsibility.

Since then I’ve had a couple jobs that have last just a few months , also due to not having much work , and Im the type of person I cannot stand standing around not having anything to do, I’d rather be working, doing something with my hands than having nothing to do. I recently start a new job about a week ago which I seem to like, mitigation and restoration of houses pretty much , Crew seems to really like my work ethic and ability to work long hours and not giving up like other people my age. 

The only problem I see is lack of hours and fluctuation of them . I get it’s the holidays so it’s a little all over the place but Im ranging from working 5 hours to 11 hours a day. And I get paid 18 an hour and get paid weekly. I really have been wanting to get in a company that reputable and has reliable work and pays well and offers a long term career . It just feels like the places I’ve worked at so far haven’t been that, even though they might seem that way at first . I picked up this job pretty quickly because Im moving fairly soon and need the income so Im not draining just my savings. Just wanted recommendations on what I should do, like I said I enjoy the management so far with this new job and would like to stick it out, but I also need to make a livable wage and not just scrape by every month .

As the title suggests, I’m feeling lost and could use some advice. A bit about me: I have a bachelor’s degree in Finance from UT Austin. After college, I worked 2.5 years in a demand generation role at Amazon Web Services, but I didn’t enjoy the sales aspect. I left to join the Air Force Reserves, and since returning home, I’ve struggled to find full-time work.

It’s been over a year, and while I’ve made it to interviews, I often lose out to more experienced candidates. I also applied to the NYSP but wasn’t selected due to issues with the polygraph (anxiety played a role).

Now, I’m uncertain about my next step. Should I pursue an MBA (and risk the expense without a clear job outcome)? Explore pilot school? Or consider another path entirely? The NYSP felt like a solid plan, but since that didn’t work out, I’m back to square one.

1hkxwoo,Fired before Christmas,"I never thought I’d be posting something like this, but here I am.

I just got fired after a performance review with my manager and HR, after nearly 2 years at the company. I didn’t see it coming. At the beginning of the year, my manager mentioned I wasn’t meeting expectations, had me improve upon my companys targets. And just a few months ago, they said I had made significant improvement and would likely reach the targets by the end of the year. I was told I was very close.

But in today’s review, my manager said I hadn’t improved at all since the start of the year. I was shocked by this comment, so I didn’t even bother arguing. They decided to terminate my contract. Then, just 10-20 minutes after the call, my access to everything—Teams, email, everything—was instantly revoked. It was all over so quickly. Which shocked me, I thought they would give me a day atleast, felt like I got thrown out the door lol.

Looking back, I can admit I made a mistake when I first started. During my probation, I didn’t know howto do my work, and I spent time on the internet just procastinating since my manager didn’t give me much guidance—she would assign tasks but wouldn’t explain how to do them and if she did, it was very vague, she just expected me to understand what shes saying using keywords of the role like I would know. When I sent her questions, I often didn’t get answers for hours or even the next day. There were no resources or tutorials available, and the structure felt disorganized.

This was my first job, and I didn’t know what to expect, but after almost two years, it’s clear my manager wasn’t providing the leadership I needed because if I had someone under me, I can teach them my role from A to Z.

The team was small—just me, one colleague with years of experience, and another person who started shortly before me. When I asked my more experienced colleague questions, they would report it to my manager, and then I’d get reprimanded for not knowing things. This made me afraid to ask anyone for help, and I felt like I couldn't trust them.

The other colleague who started around the same time as me was helpful, he would help me but later I found out he was also reporting my questions to the manager instead of letting me know directly why my questions are worrying. One time I asked this colleague to double check something, another manager across our table overheard us. who was always kind to me, reported back to my manager, and I was scolded.

I seriously felt like I was working with snakes. but I let it be and kept working as myself.

I know I made mistakes, but I believe a lot of the blame lies with my manager. Many of the issues she pointed out were related to things I didn’t know, which I never learned from her. She could have provided proper training, feedback, or resources, but instead, I had to figure everything out myself.

This month, I checked my work logs and saw that I had completed three times the amount of work compared to my teammates. Despite being sick with the flu, I didn’t miss any deadlines. But somehow, my performance was deemed poor because I made the same mistakes apparently which I wasn't guided to or corrected. Some of which I only recently became aware of. I understand making same mistakes isn’t ideal, but if I did make the mistakes, at least explain to me about that mistake????

I also was the only one that gave gifts to my manager and team last Christmas—chocolates, cards, wines—and in return, they back stab me for asking questions, fire me just before christmas. I felt like at least they should of been compassionate and remembered I did that for them? Not making excuses, just felt like thats the humane thing to do.

Anyway, I just wanted to vent and get any advice. It feels like I was treated unfairly in a toxic environment. I will take this as a learning lesson and also avoid not taking initiation to improve on the job myself for my next job. Any advice on what I could have done better, or what I should have learned from this experience, would be appreciated.",chazzitup90,12,0.7300000190734863,44,1734989369,2024-12-23 21:29:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hkxwoo/fired_before_christmas/,12,2024

1hkxi6f,"Need Career Advice: Feeling Stuck in My First IT Job in Canada
","Hi everyone, I need some advice.

I immigrated to Canada last year, and after struggling for a year, I finally got an IT job. Unfortunately, the pay isn’t great—it’s CAD 50k annually. I accepted it because I was tired of doing labor and odd jobs, which, to be honest, paid me more. I took this job hoping to climb the corporate ladder and eventually get a promotion n raise in pay accordingly. However, after joining, I discovered that the company is outsourcing its entire software department to South Asia.

Before I joined, their LinkedIn showed they had six IT guys, but I later learned that they laid off their whole IT team. The reason they hired me was primarily to show their clients (As most of em are from NA) they have on-site support for a software engineer. I was hired as a DevOps engineer, but the actual work I do is very different. Most of my time is spent writing bash scripts, working with bare metal machines, and managing virtualized servers. Essentially, my role is more aligned with system administration than DevOps.

Back home, I worked as a software engineer where I handled everything from web development to DevOps. I was passionate about web development, but for the past six months, I haven’t been able to work in that domain. Instead, I’m stuck doing tasks unrelated to my interests or career goals. There’s no growth—neither technically nor professionally—because I don’t have a team, and I don’t get opportunities to work on my communication or soft skills.

I’m now 24, and this is my first corporate experience in Canada, but it feels discouraging. The work culture here is very similar to South Asia’s, which I had hoped to escape. That culture doesn’t nurture soft skills or encourage professional growth. It frustrates me that I’ve already lost a year doing odd jobs and another six months in a job that doesn’t align with my goals.

I’m at a crossroads and need guidance. Should I:

1. Pursue a master’s degree? If I start now, I could finish by the time I’m 26/27 (ik, too long). I hope this would also help me improve my communication and presentation skills while opening new doors in IT.
2. Stick to my current job, do the bare minimum until they kick me out LOL, and focus on rebuilding my technical skills on my own? I could work on my portfolio, resume, and job applications on the side. However, the competitive IT job market here, combined with my lack of soft skills and the unrelated experience from this role, feels daunting.

I would really appreciate your suggestions. Thank you!",Nervous-Army6615,0,0.5,2,1734988216,2024-12-23 21:10:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hkxi6f/need_career_advice_feeling_stuck_in_my_first_it/,12,2024

1hkwg5c,Can't hold down 9-5 jobs but excel at creative projects and problem-solving. Should I pivot to freelancing instead?,"I have pretty bad ADHD but I take medication for it. I have a lot going for me in life and have most of my life put together. I pursue hobbies related to programming, namely open source AI projects and whatnot. I also collaborated with other people in video game projects but more on the modding side of things, so to speak, with pretty good reception from people and strong relationships built over time.

My issue is the following: I am *really* good at starting and finishing entire projects, sometimes simultaneously, and I'm always on time and organized in my pursuits. I've also done gig work before and people genuinely liked my creativity when assisting them. I've been seen as reliable with everyone I've worked with, consistently delivering results and staying committed to the project at hand.

But when it comes to a 9-5 job I can't hold it down for very long. Best I've done is 2 and a half years at this call center job I am currently in but things are going downhill for me with no improvement long-term. Company constantly breathes down my neck over small mistakes made during calls that add up and I can't meet those expectations at call center jobs no matter which industry I joined and no matter how hard I tried. To say it has been frustrating is an understatement. Its been four call center jobs already with no signs of improvement.

I am very knowledgeable at every job that I do and I am very disciplined as well, but when you're going up against KPIs that make or break you its really hard to meet them because they always find a way to tumble you down back to square one.

Yet, in my hobbies that I pursue, I really do come up with some really in-depth things that people show genuine interest in. I have a lot of creative energy and I always seem to find a solution when the problem initially seems insurmountable. I have really good qualities in that regard and constantly think of new ideas and solutions even when I'm not trying.

I just don't understand why I can't seem to translate these skills into industries I end up working in out of necessity while I go to college for computer science (still taking prerequisites, though). But I also think that despite extensive treatment and best attempts to hold down a job perhaps I am just a fundamentally different person who is not wired for a structured, pre-established system. 

Therefore, I think I may need to look into other avenues for income generation where I am allowed and encouraged to put my creative problem-solving skills to good use. I've thought about gig jobs and freelancing but I am also afraid to make the plunge because of the unknown. I don't know if I will find success, I don't know what it takes to be successful in that field and I don't know what sort of problems I can expect when forging a high risk path like that.

What I do know is that I'm not a moron and despite a by-the-book QA team likes to think, I actually do get things done. I just think that there's usually more than one way to solve a problem. And you might read this and think its a good idea, or you might think its a terrible idea and I'll get nothing out of it. But I'm beginning to think that I can't advance any further in life going down the 9-5 path and need to find another way forward in life.",throwawayisuckatwork,1,1.0,0,1734985209,2024-12-23 20:20:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hkwg5c/cant_hold_down_95_jobs_but_excel_at_creative/,12,2024

1hkuqa8,Advice on Leaving Family Business,"I need advice. I've been mulling this over for a year with no clear answers. 

I work for my family's small business. We have been around for over 100 years and are a multigenerational company. My parents skipped working for the business and do their own thing. I am the only one from that side of the family working at the business. I work with aunts/uncles, cousins, and grandparents.

I started around 4 years ago. I came on for sales and to help the office manager as they were overworked. I am related to the office manager, but we do well with separating work and family. As of today: I am doing basically what I did on day 1. The office manager is extremely micromanaging. They have to double/triple-check everyone's work. I have asked to get more responsibilities multiple times a year. The office manager has a really hard time letting others help with their work. They are so busy they will work overtime and on weekends. I cannot do anything without being reprimanded for doing it wrong. If it's not done their way it's wrong. In the beginning, I would make mistakes because of working too fast. My manager has discussed this with me and I feel I have improved quite a bit since then. I just always feel like I'm never doing good enough.

I have a cousin who is a quality manager. They get paid more than me as I just work in the office. But they get more ""perks"". They don't have to pay for health insurance (I do), they get much bigger bonuses (4x of what I got), and they have more vacation. The office manager is a parent of my cousin so I feel like there is favoritism.

The business has been around for a long time. The owners make very good money  (Think 6-7 figures). The owners talk like they will shut down before they pass off the business to me and my cousin. But I'm sure that's not the case. 

My issue is I feel like I am treated unfairly, I don't have enough responsibility (I'm literally begging for more work!), and when my family does eventually expand, I won't be able to afford children. I am not passionate about the type of business we are in. I have been thinking of leaving for some time now. I'm being held back by:

* The potential money I can earn
* ruining relationships with family
* never being happy at any job - I could be unhappy here and potentially have money

I just need advice from an objective view.",Economy-Life-4804,2,1.0,1,1734980412,2024-12-23 19:00:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hkuqa8/advice_on_leaving_family_business/,12,2024

1hkropf,I ruined my first job experience ,"
It’s been 2 months since I left my first job, which went terribly due to my mental health. Because of a personal problem and my inexperience in the position, I developed a lot of stress and anxiety that stifled my creativity—something crucial for my role in marketing. This led me to make several silly mistakes. Things escalated quickly for the worse, and soon I felt like I couldn’t do anything properly. Eventually, I had to leave without warning because of a severe anxiety episode.  

Looking back, I feel so guilty about how things turned out. Now that I’ve calmed down, I’ve gained some insights and ideas that could have made things so much better. I can’t shake the feeling that I ruined my first job experience and missed out on a great opportunity for career growth.  

Do you have any advice on how to cope with this? Have you experienced anything similar?  ",Narrow-Jacket-5835,5,1.0,8,1734972093,2024-12-23 16:41:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hkropf/i_ruined_my_first_job_experience/,12,2024
1hkrcpf,Should I stay? (need help),"I’ve had this job for 2 years since I’ve graduated back in 2022 with a degree in engineering.
The department I work in isn’t engineering based but support department let’s say.
The company has flexible hours it’s a mess cause it depends more on your boss than finishing work in the 8 mandatory hours.

Since I joined I never knew when I could leave at the end of the day and that still bothers me. On top of that the micromanaging, the 4:55 sudden pointless meetings makes it more annoying. Dude I wanna live my life I don’t see my friends anymore I can’t make plans cause I don’t know when I could leave. Not to mention the work calls in random hours even in vacation or sick days.
First I thought I wasn’t wanted but when I saw how much I did compared to other colleagues I was pissed especially when I found out one of them doesn’t do shit all day got a better performance review than me last year. And this year she had a long paid parental leave and she is expecting a good review. 
Also the burnout is just something, I got too many tasks to count and they are complaining about shit they asked a while ago but I couldn’t do because there were other things that are more critical.

In the other side I got great exposure to a lot of things that a fresh grad couldn’t get.
I got to go in 6 different work trips out of my country.  And I actually enjoy some of the work.

To some up:
Negative: Micromanaging, chaotic meeting schedule, random task at random times, unpredictable work hours, unfair performance ance review, work made me burnout quickly.

Positives: work trips, great exposure, kinda enjoyable.

I need other peoples point of view on this because I don’t want to see it fully negative and leave because of that but I don’t want be taken advantage of by lazy people.

I learned German two years ago and reached A2 but stopped and forgot most of it. Currently, I’m in a Japanese language training program with a recruitment company (Fast Offer) that has contracts with companies in Japan. I’ll be learning Japanese until I reach N3. I’m unsure whether I should continue with this opportunity, gain 2 years of experience in Japan, and then move to Germany, or should I stop the Japanese learning , study German, and try to move to Germany directly? The challenge is that it’s not easy to travel from my country, and job opportunities in my field are limited here. Does it worth it?

1hkqqvs,Ex-Med student- New start advice? Insight appreciated! ,"Hi there! Somewhat long read but would love and appreciate any insight..


I (33F) went to an overseas med school straight out of high school because my parents really pressured me to, and I’m a people pleaser X10000. 

I went through 4 years of schooling and did clinical rotations in the States, but when it came to the USMLE I haven’t been able to pass it and it’s been 6 years. The med school I went to won’t allow you to graduate without passing and I feel I’m way too out of touch to pass at this point… it’s been 6 years of trying and I’m tired of being a student. Without graduating with that MBBS (international bachelor’s in medicine), I’m left with just a high school diploma. My husband (very smart, very handsome, very lucky me☺️) graduated and matched into residency and will be completing his training in June. 

I’ve been working consistently in adjacent fields in the meantime (PT aide, scribe, surgical scheduler, medical assistant) but it’s all been mostly part time (I’ve had a couple miscarriages and and a herniated disc so needed to take time off) with not much in terms of moving up without schooling. Because of my incomplete international schooling background, anything I do now would be somewhat from scratch. I have been able to get pretty good medical assisting jobs because of my clinical experience and no certification but that didn’t last too long because of my health issues at the time. I recently moved to TN and they have a lot more regulations in place that won’t allow me to apply as PT aide or medical assistant without certification. Hopefully we’re moving back to the Midwest soon! 

I loved doing clinical rotations and working in the medical assistant world, I love working in patient care and I get great satisfaction from patient healing and gratification! 

What’s a career move I can make at this point? I can invest about 6-9 months in a trade school, and I would love to stay in the patient care world! Is MA certification worth it? Is there anything I can do online/hybrid i may be qualified for? Is there something I can get qualified for without investing years while still getting the helping people gratification feeling? 

Thanks so much for any insight!! Really appreciate it 😅

A relative requested me to develop a website for them. I usually don't write quotes. Also, I'm conflicted since they are family....They offered to pay and other family said that I should. I set up one free website for a family member and I guess it might become a pattern. I plan to use next js , vercel. They will need a contact form, 4-5 pages. How much would this cost? I see ranges from $1000-$14000 for a set up fee. The relative that I built a website for heard $250 from a marketer to build a website.  Also, they may want, I'm sure if this would be included in the setup fee or how to charge these additions:

a database for clients,

so authentication,  authorization(Supabase,AuthJS or Lucia) will be needed.

They may want image uploads so cloudinary would be quick to set up. Free plan is fine.

The operation manager is awful, doesn't care about work hours and she makes me work overtime a lot, I have the lowest salary in the office below average and I get the most tasks which is not fair because everyone else is highly paid and they do less tasks than me. Whenever I make the smallest of mistakes because of the stress and the overwork, they make me feel so small and stupid like I'm worthless. And my anxiety has been up the roof. Last weekend I refused to do any extra work and ever since the operation manager has been treating me horribly like I made a huge mistake, doesn't address me directly when talking to me about my work, and dismissing all my questions about any of the accounts that I'm working on. I feel like I'm too young to be dealing with these issues and living a life that I hate this much.

1hknq6f,Need advice regarding finishing a master program and entering the work force,"This is a really long and complicated story, so I'll try to be as concise as possible.

Background:

I'm a 25-year-old American studying an MSc in Finance in Spain. I have no applicable work experience aside from a summer internship on the sales desk of an asset management company (2022), and a part time job as a pro bono financial planner during my last semester of undergrad (Fall 2023). I'm 1/3 of the way done with the master's program, final term ends in June 2025 and the thesis defense is October 2025.

I won't go into too much detail, but I've been suffering from severe depression for the past year and a half stemming from a comically toxic relationship (also the reason I moved here in the first place lol). I'm at the point where I've been so unhappy for so long that I no longer know what direction I want to go in. I told this to my university administration, and they offered me a leave of absence to take care of my mental/emotional health and then start the program again where I left off in January 2026. Therefore, I have two options:

1. Tough it out and finish the program

Finish the program now and then take some time after graduating to fix my head and figure out what I want to do with my life. In all reality, probably wouldn't enter the workforce for another 6-12 months after graduating, unless I have a miracle turnaround mentally in the next couple months. I'd be 26 when I finish the program, not sure when I would actually start working.

2) take the leave of absence and come back

I would take the year off and move back home, fix my head, figure out what I want to do with my life and then come back and begin the program again where I left off. In this case, I'd be 27 when I finish in 2026. I'd go to community college during the meantime and work on applicable career skills (python, Spanish, do WSO financial modeling courses, etc.), but I probably wouldn't work unless I could get an internship or a good part time job.

Overall:

I have explanations for both situations that I'm comfortable using in an interview, but I'm wondering which one would look worse. Someone who was unemployed for a while after graduating, or someone who took a yearlong break during the middle of master's program and is trying to enter the work force at 27 with little to no experience. I know this is a lot, so thanks if you've read all the way to the end, any and all insight would be appreciated.",CheekBeater101,1,1.0,0,1734960444,2024-12-23 13:27:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hknq6f/need_advice_regarding_finishing_a_master_program/,12,2024

I am not going to go into details because im just tired of it all but basically she always stutters when she talks seems shy , sometimes she doesn’t even make sense and i never thought much of this then boom when i started working there i saw another facade of her after the first few days its like she is scared i take her job or something?
The pettiest thing she did recently was that we had an event and we took pictures ( its part of a project) then i saw the pictures especially the ones i took and i loved them , i told her to send me the pics she sent me one horrible pictures i sent a text so she sends me the others and nothing, i go the next day and ask her personally heyy can i have my pics she said she deleted them from the work camera ? 😂 i said look at my face on the picture ?? She said that the other arent good?? Like what? And we are supposed to post them for work !!
Without talking about the fact that she is trying to socially isolate me in my job my spreading rumours i feel and since she studied with me before everyone believes her … so compared to the first day i came in a month after im feelings so off! Only one coworker that noticed all of this and got my back without making it obvious but we dont work the same days just met during an event .

I hold a post graduate degree in finance and also hold a Mutual Fund Certification ( I got it because initially i planned into banking when i first started) 

Even with strong referrals and hopefully good resume ( got the resume verified with HR contacts in Corporate) I havent been able to even get an interview call.

1hkkvqc,Company Refused Leave After My Accident – Need Advice on Career Switch ,"
I recently had an unfortunate accident around 4 a.m. during my night shift. I was bruised badly on my right side and informed my manager that I couldn’t continue working. After working for three hours in pain, I asked for leave. He responded that it would be considered LWP (leave without pay) and insisted I “manage it” because there was no backup.

What’s worse is that the company expects us to plan sick leaves or any absences before 10 a.m., which is ridiculous for someone on a night shift. I explained my situation, but the manager didn’t budge. Things escalated into an altercation over chat, and when I inquired about serving my notice period, the manager pushed the discussion to the next day.

When we finally spoke, the manager claimed that employees often lie, which is why leave requests are denied. Seriously? These were my earned leaves—I still have 10 pending! Yet this management refused to let me use them.

Frustrated, I informed HR that I plan to resign on January 1st. She mentioned that they might relieve me earlier if I complete the knowledge transfer (KT) ASAP.

The problem is, I don’t have another job lined up. I’ve been working as a medical scribe for 5 years and want to transition to a career in compliance, especially in HIPAA and healthcare IT. But now I’m stuck and unsure how to proceed.

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Any advice on switching careers without a job in hand?",Echoes_In_Pixels,2,1.0,7,1734949159,2024-12-23 10:19:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hkkvqc/company_refused_leave_after_my_accident_need/,12,2024
1hkkldg,need advice for my career right now,"Hello all, I just want to ask for a little advice for my current job. Currently my company suffering from major profit lost. So, my company now offering a deal plus Voluntary separation scheme (VSS). The VSS are the same for both deal. 

So, I'm currently on dilemma to accept on which deal is better for me. Before we got to the deal, I will explain a bit about my work. I'm currently work for a manufacturing company that specialized in custom industrial paint system as a designer/drafter for all the machine/component.

For the first deal, the company will give me contract that only lasted quarterly. With this deal, my pay will be deduct 10% and only work for 4 days a week. The problem with this deal, a lot of my coworker quit or be offering only for the second deal ( I will explain later) and all their work will fall on the remaining coworker. The number of worker will reduce to half. The contract also give a chance to receive a share of profit if the company has any profit for the quarter.

For the second deal, the will offer me contract based on what project the company currently has. If the company can not obtain any project, they has the power to not recall me to work for them. The only good thing about this deal, I can receive more pay if a work the same hour as my regular hour. With this I will get profit per project.

Right now I'm currently in huge dilemma on which option to choose. Should I take the first deal and continue to work with less pay or take the second deal and just start looking for job while work part time for the company?",BLENDERNOOB99999999,1,1.0,2,1734947881,2024-12-23 09:58:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hkkldg/need_advice_for_my_career_right_now/,12,2024

1hkkfvb,Internship boss gave me unsolicited advice about my profile picture and called my picture insecure,"I have interned remotely for 7 months for this company. I moved yo Sweden with already 2 years of experience in my field, but needed some swedish ""work experience"" on my CV. My role in the internship was solo graphic designer for a online store.

The boss was alway abit eccentric but since I kept out relationship purely professional, it didn't  really bother me. 

Last friday I had my last day. Thursday he wrote an odd message to me: ""hi girl, are we meeting up tomo"" 

I was kinda annoyed and surprised that he called me girl. He has never called me that before, but I ignored it and kept the confo professional. Second he kept ""forgetting"" that my last day was Friday. I reminded him and the other manager for the last 3 weeks.

On Friday the offboarding meeting started abit off. I already knew the company wasn't making enough to get me hired so no hard feelings. 

During the meeting he told me ""I  tried to get closer to you, but you never let it happen."" I thought it was wierd he said that but he is just odd in general.

Then he asked me to see my portfolio for someone he knows that might want to hire me.  Which was wierd that he hasn't seen it because he apparently hired me without looking at it. Him ""I don't look at CV or coverletters etc.. I hire people based on what they message me"". 

I know the person he wanted to revere me to and I have spoken to them. But I was okay with showing my portfolio. The first page has a shorted version of my CV and a picture of me.  The moment he saw my picture which is also my profile picture on all work accounts, he went on a wierd rent.

""You look abit insecure you need to change that picture.""

I told him straight away that I don't want feedback about my picture, that my CV is no no longer accurate and that I'm working on it with my career coach. She knows what she is doing, she is helps me and I don't  need additional feedback.

He went on by saying ""Well I have hired over 300 people and I used to be a CEO of a big bank, so I think I have a say in this. I want you to change the picture because you look insecure. I have thought about this before many times, u use this image also as you profile picture.""

At this point I broke him off and told him again I don't want to hear feedback and we are not going to talk about it further.

I scrolled back to my portfolio.

He then again asked me to go back to my CV again. I had to tell him 3 or 4 times I don't want feedback in general but he kept pressing on it for 10/15 minutes. He end up telling me his""feedback"" right after me telling him I really dont want feedback. I never wanted to get feedback, we where going to discuss what my role was at my previous job to see if it fitted his friend role description. Not look at my CV and especially not my picture.

His reasoning that my picture looked insecure was I hold my shoulders abit higher up then I normal would during the zoom calls. I have broken my collarbone and have slight scoliosis... so yeah my shoulders are very uneven. 

Also I know I don't look insecure on the picture. He has always been abit off with comments about model pictures I had to retouch like:""her hands are ugly"" the models are doing it for free.

I end up changing the subject because I was so done with the offboarding meeting. To whole meeting was off and it took 50 min in total.

I called arbetsförmedlingen (swedish government system for unemployment.) They where paying me some pocket money to intern with them. They told me to report him offically to them which I did. Also for other reasons but this was the icing on the cake.

I'm not sure if he did this on purpose, or if he was on something because the ""hey girl"" message was already wierd. He overstepped and then at one point just harassed me with his opinion.

If he just stopped when I asked him I would have been okay, annoyed but okay. 

I can no longer use him as reference because of the report and I feel like I wasted my time. This was sadly not the only wierd thing that happened but it never crossed the line of unprofessional... just greedy behaviour.

I feel sad because this was the end and I feel extremely odd how it ended.

But of context: I am 27, he is 50. We do not have the same or similar roles in the company.

1hkjn5e,Manager didn't give me promised promotion and now wants me to train the new manager,"I am a senior member within a small team in the public sector. I, alongside another senior member, mentor and train the other staff members in my team. 
 
My company has recently been through a restructure process and my current manager has been promoted leaving her role absent. 
The restructure process has been long and throughout the process I have been made to think that I, alongside the other senior member would be promoted in a job share manager role as we both need to work part time: 
- manager could set up the team however she wanted to set up the team 
- current manager advised she would advertise the new role internally just to us 
Etc etc

Push come to shove, my manager has decided to employ a new external candidate into the manager role. She decided in the end she did not want a job share arrangement, apparently HR dictated this nut I do not believe it. This new person does not have the direct experience in the teams work. 

She has now asked me and the other senior person to train the new manager and set up a temporary structure where we would have to support and train this person alongside my current manager and then we step out.

I'm feeling frustrated and annoyed. I don't want to train my manager, feel annoyed that the many many conversations about a new role came to nothing, and that the temporary structure will ultimately be benefit the manager and then I'm expected to step aside. 

Any advice re: 

- how do I communicate and create boundaries with my current manager. I feel like my manager has been dishonest with me and is preying in my good intentions.

- am I required as an employee to train a new manager (skills I've taken many years to develop)? As a senior I mentor staff members who are less experienced but wouldn't expect that this applies upwards

I’m on the verge of finishing BTech CSE in VIT Vellore (for context it’s a good private university, would say just below tier 1 colleges) 
And I initially planned on doing MTech 

Now hear me out, my thoughts at first were very amateur, like “i have to finish masters coz all of my cousins did” or “ i have to do masters coz i can” etc etc but after some further research i have some questions now 

1. A relative of mine told me that if I’m working in a company and two people are in consideration for promotion, the person who’s done MTech will be preferred over the only BTech guy. Is this true? If it is, how big of an impact will this be? Like will I stop midway of my professional growth due to lack of this degree?

2. Is 2 years of quality experience with good pay in an MNC equivalent to an MTech degree?

3. Is btech enough to survive in the corporate world? Ofc ik I have to keep developing my skills time and time to do so, but academically is it enough

1hkfozu,Commute vs more cash,"Tough decisions looking for input other than friends family and of course been reading about others in similar situations.

Current Job: Government 
Pay: 94,800. Max Pay 114,000. Each year I get a raise for 3 more years.
Commute: 5 minutes
Schedule: M - Thurs 10 hour days 
Time off: whenever I want but don't often take much cause I get 3 day weekends. 
I have roughly 400hr vacation 400hr sick in the bank.

New Job Offer: Government
Starting wage 120,000. Earning potential 158K
Commute: 1ish hour Each way. 2ish hours total.
Schedule: M - F swing shift. Occasionally working days. With potential to go to days in the near future.
Time off: same accrual rate as current 

Obviously the wage difference is huge. I see that. Time in the car seems rough and the shift also seems rough but I feel like I'm obligated to say yes because the money is that much more. 

My work is pretty cake. I run the shop (Fleet maintenance) and I do a damn good job of it. New job is a much bigger fleet managing 3 shops between 2 other managers. 

I am torn. I'm comfortable now. I have no debt(just mortgage) and make 94K a year but I have a family and have aspirations of bigger and better things that of course comes with more money 

Less time at home for more money and a better quality of life. As it sits now my family is ""comfortable"" but we aren't going to Disneyland or on vacations and nothing planned at all. This new job could mean the potential to do those things but at the sacrifice of having a Commute and losing my stressful but easy job. My job isn't easy by any means but I've been here 12 years and it just comes easy now.

Long post but damn I'm torn cause there's no going back of it turns out to be shit. I use the term ""comfortable"" loosely as well.  We do fun activities, zoo, state fair, aquarium, go out to dinner movies, date nights etc but actual vacations will be few and far between.

1hkeoop,FT vs Per diem. What would you choose? ,"
I am recently thinking about switching from full-time to Per diem, and wondering if anyone has any opinion about my scenario!

Full time package: 
- salary 135k= average hourly rate of 65
- total time off: 31 days*8h=248 (248*65=16120)
- benefits and subsidization: 3660+ licensing fees, let’s say 4k
- the only benefit I use is 401k. Company offers dollar to dollar match up to 4% but vesting schedule of 20% after two years. Only 100% vested after six years. 
- benefits I count them as post tax income. So divide by our total effective tax rate of 37.7%. (4000)/0.623= 6240
- therefore. Total compensation is 135000+16120+6240= 157540
- unsure about my company’s short term/long term disability insurance benefit and I was only told that I have 40k life insurance through the company but I don’t know how much the premium is. 

Per diem package (1099)
- equivalent pay prior to FICA according to a five day schedule: 239200 (FICA difference due to switching from w2 to 1099: around 18k). Pay after FICA would therefore be 221k
- I plan to open solo 401k with fidelity if I choose this route.

And although I don't have a finance job yet, I just got hired doing registration at a nearby hospital. (which is a huge step up from the restaurant jobs I had before).

I know there's an opportunity for me to eventually move up into an admin role, but I'm wondering how long that takes once I'm an employee. So you guys have any advice for me to actually obtain an admin role this way?

They said, “we’re looking for an employee who believes in our mission and isnt simply going to accept our offer while looking for higher paid work”.

In my mind, this is sort of a red flag. Theyre offering $95k, with an increase to $100k after 90 days.
I asked for the $100k up front and they said no.

Maybe Im being paranoid. But the emphasis on finding an employee who ‘doesnt just do it for the money’ and declining a modest up front increase makes me think the company is in dire financial straits.
Am I being unreasonable?  Her response in my mind is equivalent to ‘we’re a family’.

1hkd5ed,"Software Engineer, Thinking of Quitting/Leaving. Don't Like My Boss.","After months of being unemployed I finally got hired at a small/medium sized software company about 6 months ago. I was extremely happy since not only would I be employed again, but I was going to work with a language and library I want to become extremely proficient in (Javascript & React). The team was looking for a Senior-Level engineer, I told them throughout the rounds of interviews that I've had at most 1.5 years-ish utilizing the library they wanted me work with, and after passing their assessments they wanted to bring me on. They told me ""We did want a senior-level candidate but we really enjoyed your communication style and think you'd be a great fit to our team."". 

However after onboarding, I realized I wasn't going to actually work directly with the team that interviewed me. Instead, I was going to work solo on developing a web-app and would be working directly under my hiring manager's boss (the director). I was a bit intimidated by that at first, but was up for the challenge. I was scheduled to have a weekly 1x1 with him to talk about my progress, showcase my plans to develop the project they wanted me to do (they had no plans, just pure word-of-mouth from the director), and for ""guidance"". It was only after a couple of meetings that I realized this guy was sort of a douche. 

  
He would quickly get angered by me because I wasn't using the terminology he wanted to use when describing an abstract concept we were planning to develop: ""Stop saying \`Data JSON\`. You need to stop saying that. Start calling it \`Post-processed JSON\`."". Whenever I would accidentally call it ""Data JSON"", he would immediately get angry ""Stop. Stop. You're saying it again. Stop saying that! Remember we agreed on a specific term."".

  
When I brought up an issue I was having (I was dealing with some trouble in my code that some data was not appearing as intended), he told me ""Hey I honestly don't care what problems you're having. All I care about is what you plan to do. What is your plan to solve this issue! To me, this seems like React 101, this should be something easy for you to solve!"". That really got me pissed off and I told him ""You think I'm happy telling you this? I wish I can come to every meeting with no troubles at all. But you should know this (he was a software engineer as well), that software engineering isn't always perfect. Problems are encountered. I can't pretend progress is being made, I'm being honest with telling you about a roadblock I am having."". He later got me in contact with more experienced engineers at the company, but he started questioning my experience and started being condescending.

  
In another meeting, I was presenting him a development road-map - what has been done and where I plan to go with objectives - he immediately interrupted me (literally 2 minutes in), ""Hey, I don't care what you've completed so far. What do you want, a pat on the back?"". I couldn't believe he actually said that. I told him, ""No I don't expect a \`pat in the back\`. I'm only bringing up what I've done so far for you to understand where I'm at, and to provide some context to where I'm planning to go based on that."". 

  
There's more examples, but this post is getting super-long (sorry). I'm at the point where I'm doubting my abilities. I'm not confident in my work. I don't even want to share my ideas anymore. I dread signing into work. I dread every meeting I have with this guy. I'm sort of depressed every weekend now thinking about work.  I'm also questioning that maybe Software Engineering isn't for me (I've been in the industry for \~4 years). What sucks is that almost everything else is great. The team that hired me, is filled with friendly people. I work remotely. I've learned a lot about the technology I want to be great at. But this guy, kills it for me. At this point, I just want a software job where I'm an individual contributor in a team, do my 8 hours, then call it a day. Do these jobs even exist anymore? I'd love to hear anybody's thoughts and/or suggestions on what I should do. I'm really stressed out about this, and I'm not really enjoying the holidays just thinking about it :/ . 

  
TLDR: 

Software engineer thinking of quitting their job and finding something else (honestly doubting my career now). I work directly under my director, where he essentially nitpicks and belittles me almost every week on our 1x1s. I hate the thought of quitting, because I'm grateful for my job. But I honestly hate the idea of working for him any longer to be honest.

1hkd22a,Take potential job or keep looking?,"Hi all. I've been working almost 2 years as a remote contractor for a FAANG company (yes the one based in Seattle) as a Supply Chain Analyst. Despite the title, I would say my job is 2/3 purchasing and 1/3 data analysis. I enjoy the freedoms of WFH and am able to do my work in about 15-20 hours a week. I make about 3700$ a month net from it. I am currently pursuing professional firefighting and have been a volunteer FF coming up on 18 months with Fire I and Fire II certs and am currently in EMT school. Once this is completed in February, I will have a solid leg to stand on in applying to FT firefighting jobs. I coming up on my 2 year contract expiration (end of march) at my current analyst job. I have been told to apply to a job with high chances of getting in (personally referred to by my current boss who created the req). The job is for a Buyer I, and while I've told my job responsibilities will stay the same, I'm told because of an org change due to a recent higher up manager leaving, I will be reporting directly to a different boss. It is also 5 days a week on site which would make my commute 2-2.5 hours a day. There will be flexibility on when I can come in and leave, but I will still have to be onsite 5 days a week, per my current boss. The pay however is a significant jump, with $5k-6k a month net with a sign on bonus of about 5k. I decided to speak to my old coworker who left for a different division a couple of months ago. I worked with her since I started and she is my mentor at the company. She told me not to apply as she says it will be probably be toxic and unflexible with my FF aspirations. I also have a really good relationship with the account manager at the staffing firm that initially recruited me to my current remote job. He said that a 90 day rollover was mandatory after completing my contract but it would be highly likely he will find something for me as I have past experience with said company and am in good standing. He did say that most of the new contractor reqs would be onsite. It would be for net 4k a month. He also said that he would refer me to any remote/hybrid roles and would negotiate with contracts on this as well, but was unsure just how many of those would be available and if they would be flexible on it. Should I use from now till the end of March to apply to remote/hybrid/ roles with a much smaller commute and then use unemployment if for 3-6 (I'd be getting ~2400$/mo unemployment, 6 months is the max) months while pursuing firefighting jobs, and taking another contract role that is possibly onsite if I can't find anything else? The unemployment would cover my rent and almost all expenses. Or should I apply to the Buyer job and take the pay raise until I find a FF job? If I take the Buyer job, it will likely result in me to put applying to Fire Departments on the backburner for a while until I get adjusted to the cadence of the schedule and commute. I could also just apply and really try to get a feel from the hiring managers/ HR about the workload and if I'm not satisfied, withdraw my application.

TL:DR: Picking between a Buyer job that is potentially toxic with a long commute but a big salary bump or working until the end of my contract while applying to other jobs/ pursuing Firefighting, collecting unemployment if I can't find anything with a strong chance of landing another contract after 3 months.

1hkcl3q,Incident with MD,"Hello, I am a graduate who started working in a bank in the us almost a year ago. Something happened in a team lunch and I do not know what to do about it.

Basically, we went to a bar before and then went for lunch. In the bar everything was fine but I have to admit we had a lot to drink. The problem started in the restaurant. My MD basically called me stupid. He said it in the context of a joke, but it still made me uncomfortable. I tried to ignore it just so I don’t ruin the mood. However, after that he mentioned in a conversation that he could beat me up in a fight. I tired to view this as a joke so I said that he couldn’t do it. Then another colleague got in the middle and kept saying he could beat me as well. The conversation ended there but after a while my MD mentioned again he can beat me up. And he kept on saying this for the rest of the day. This made me feel really uncomfortable and each time that one of my colleagues got against me I just felt all alone. 

Another thing that I found really offensive is that my colleague said that apart from beating me he can probably do my job better than me. He mentioned that I code using chat gpt all the time and that he could do that too (while he has never coded in his life). This made me feel unappreciated, especially since I’m the only one who does the coding in our team.

I currently feel that my colleagues hate me. And I do not understand why they would. I could always tell we do not match but I never expected this kind of behaviour towards me. 

I might not have treated this right, I understand that. Maybe I should have just ignored everything or make my feelings clear and ask them to stop, but what should I do now?

1hkceic,i’m being taken advantage of and i need help,"long story short, i agreed to mentor one of our two new employees because the person they recently promoted to team lead apparently has too much going on in their personal life. 

**mind you, the “team lead” has absolutely zero leadership responsibilities. if someone on their team isn’t doing what they’re supposed to be doing, the team lead tells our boss and our boss follows up and does the disciplining.**

anyway, i agree to mentor one of the two new employees. i’m killing it as a mentor because i’m an overachiever, which is also my greatest downfall. an exact quote from my mentee to my boss, “i’ve never been so confident and wouldn’t be as confident as i am without my mentor.”

another coworker of mine agreed to mentor the other new employee, but my coworker is a shit mentor. her mentee knows it, i know it, and the team lead knows it. my coworker eventually tells our boss that being a mentor is too stressful because telling your mentee to ask someone else for help and ignoring them is too much work. 

anyway, our boss tells me that the mentorship idea isn’t working out like she had planned and wants to end it. in basically the same sentence, she asked me how i’d feel about training all of the new employees? the team lead told her that she only knows as much as she does because i trained her and my mentee couldn’t stop raving about me. i told her that i’d consider it but we’d need to talk about financial compensation first because i mentored my first mentee for “free”, which was dumb af on my part. however, it seems as though she may have “forgotten” about the financial compensation discussion.

**again, mind you, i work full-time, i’m training in a new position, i’m in college, i tend to my house, take care of two dogs and a cat, have hobbies, relationships, and other adult responsibilities.** 

ANYWAY, the two new employees are always talking about their team’s “disjointed hierarchy” because they can’t ask their team lead for help because that’s “not their job.”

1hkc274,Best career paths for someone with a Mechanical Engineering Degree ,"Hi, 

So I am currently 4th year on a Masters integrated course in Mechanical Engineering (5 years total) and I have previous experience via internships working on satellites. 

I enjoy the technical aspect and content that I am exposed to, but one of the issue is I feel that in Scotland (where I am based), and even in the UK in general there is a lack of interesting and rewarding options to choose from especially considering I am a dual national which makes it abit difficult getting into defense. 

Recently I have been contemplating a move into finance/tech via breaking into Risk Analysis, or Data analysis due to seeing more job postings for internships and grad roles. 

There seems to be a growing push in the need of data driven decisions, and I would be interested in breaking into it if this is the case and I think for those roles there's lots of different industries that you can push into.

I was hoping to get some people's perspectives on those roles in comparison to a Mechanical Engineering role. How do those roles compare salary wise? General working hours? Possible Opportunities or doors opened? 

If there is any other opportunities/roles/sectors that you think might be emerging or is better to break into please let me know. I am generally fine with a bad work-life balance, but Ideally would like to be compensated salary wise.

Currently love my job and the people I work with. I am well respected and second in chain of command outside of my boss. My work schedule is cake and I can leave early if I need to or if I’m having a late morning, no one bats an eye. I have a company vehicle and fuel expenses paid.

With all that said, I am capped in earning potential. I currently make around 120k in a LCOLA. I am capped because of the size of our business. 

That said, a friend of mine, got me an interview in a similar industry and I crushed the interview. I was very open with the CEO and explained to him that I love my current job and that I’m not necessarily looking; just open to hearing about the opportunity.

It will be more responsibility + more direct reports, but nothing I can’t handle. I asked for 140k + bonuses, vehicle and fuel expense. They didn’t even blink and said it’s not an issue.

On Friday, I met with with CEO and two of the partners and they explained to me in detail how much they want me to fill role and explained to me in detail about the growth/trajectory of company. It was exciting, but to be frank, I think I should ask for more based some of the things they went over.

Today, they emailed me and told me how much they want me to take the role and how excited they are about the possibility of me joining their team.

Obviously I always put in responsibilities and qualifications, and leave extra crap like the company mission blurb that are often on postings.

I find it very hard to care that the APY of somebody’s account dropped .25%. And I’m really find it hard to fake excitement when somebody is buying a brand new $70k car while I have $0.63 in my savings account. Long story short, I’m in the wrong field. I was going to college for engineering but I was only on my third semester of just getting prerequisites done when I had to drop out. That’s a long story.

Anyway, I recently got promoted and was trained for my new position. But I never used any of that training so I don’t remember half of it. I have reason to seriously dislike my boss so I was looking for other employment options for me. I realized though that if I move to a competing institution then I’ll take a pay cut because I’m not qualified for the same position in the other banks. And also, I really have no desire to do this for the next 30 years until I retire.

I mentioned to somebody that I wanted to look in to taking some courses to get a career in tech. I’m not sure in what capacity. But I’ve always loved working with computers. They’re fascinating. I like figuring out how they work and keeping them up and running. About 25 years ago I built a computer from spare parts and it was just so much fun. I’ve done a very little programming and I loved it.

Anyway, the person I said this to basically told me it’s foolish to change fields at my age (40s). They said I probably won’t have time because I have kids and then even if I do finish the courses I probably won’t get a high paying job in it because nobody wants to hire somebody so old when they can hire some 24 year old.

I just don’t know if I should give up and forget ever having a job I enjoy or if I should fight for myself.

It’s also a matter of what I want to show my kids. Do you just keep your head down and your mouth shut or do you set a goal and work to achieve it?

So I guess this is what I need advice on. Is mid 40s too late to start over in a new career? Is it unlikely that I’ll get a job in the tech field because of my age?

1hk9eva,Accepted a role at a start up but now I’m in doubt,"Hi All,

I am in need of some advice. (36m) 

Currently work for a corporate company for just under 2 years. 

Got approached for a position at a start up tech company. I know of the guys but never worked directly with them. The owner has another successful business and the co founders are very knowledgeable in this field. They also approached a few other guys I know, who all turned them down for wanting more job security. (I think I may have been their last choice) 

After going back and forth I decided to take the opportunity for following reasons:

1. Slight bump in pay

2. Needing more exposure and experience - thought a start up would be the best place for it.

3. If the start up is successful, it would be amazing to be part of that success. 

4. Potential to fast track my career, maybe even discover another position that suits me better. 

I also applied for an internal position at current employer but was told they would not give me the permanent role due to not having enough experience but happy to offer a secondment - to which I declined. 

Recently current employer got back in touch and offered me a role (worded slightly differently to the role I initially applied for) for the same wage and providing I meet my objectives they would offer me 2k raise followed by another 2k 6 months down the line (this will roughly match what the start up are offering now). 

Im not really learning a lot in my current role, would I learn taking the internal role? Probably they have a lot more going in their department. 

I have accepted and signed the contract for the start up, however I am now having doubts.. maybe Im making a mistake (not handed in notice yet)

1hk73aq,Salary increase for doing bosses job,"My boss was laid off and it was discovered that I had been performing nearly all of their job duties and they were taking credit. I am now in the position where I am able to negotiate a salary increase and a title change. The company has been extremely apologetic and say they “want to make it right”. I have been extremely stressed, burnt out and overworked…which makes sense now. It has been impossible to take time off because the work would not get done unless I had been completing it. I was totally manipulated and taken advantage of as there was little supervision over my manager. They are restructuring my department as it’s a very small team. They are bringing in an experienced manager and I have someone assisting with the more menial tasks. I have only been with the company a year and I do like it enough that I don’t want to leave but I’m not ruling it out. 

I do not want to come off as entitled, but I also think that I have been grossly underpaid. How do I leverage my situation? They really like me and want to keep me. I am in insurance and have been doing the job of a producer/broker/account executive making $70k in a HCOL area (San Diego). My actual job title is an entry level underwriting position. I came from a tech sales background so I am still very green in this industry. 

I only took this job a year ago because I was commuting two hours or more on my in office days and I had a baby…it was not sustainable.

What is a reasonable request? What title change and salary change seem appropriate?",Revolutionary_Many89,13,0.8500000238418579,22,1734899727,2024-12-22 20:35:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hk73aq/salary_increase_for_doing_bosses_job/,12,2024
1hk5i8q,"I'm 39 with 2 degrees. One of them is Mechanical Engineering that I graduated with(good GPA), and haven't used in 10 years. What could I do with it?","Crossposted from CareerGuidance, I hope that's ok.

Hi, thank you for reading. As stated in the title, I have two degrees: one in psychology with honors/research experience, and also one in mechanical engineering that I got afterward in my late 20's. The amount of work that I put into the mechanical engineering degree burned me out so much over the four years I studied that I didn't want to use it to become an engineer once I had it.

I would like to do so now, but I'm not sure where to get started. I doubt I could find work as a mechanical engineer, but I'm open to working in any field. Up until this point I've been working in the higher end of the service industry, with a fair bit of management/leadership experience, but I'm able to learn how to do most anything.

I was thinking about getting into tech/data, project management, finance, or possibly staying in the service industry in some way. What I would really like to do is develop some kind of non-service related skillset doing some kind of technical work, with good opportunity for growth over the next decade or two, but I have great soft skills/salesmanship as well. It probably goes without saying, but I'm also great at problem solving once I can lock down the scope/parameters of the problem, and I'm not too bad at complex math.

If anyone has any advice or has been in a similar situation, I would really appreciate it.

1hk4el6,Looking for Advice post deployment - Ready to shoot for director roles?,"Hello friends - throwaway for security reasons. 

**Overview**

I’m just about to hit the 10 year milestone of my professional career. I’m a consultant project manager as a civilian, working for a boutique IT professional services firm. I’m also a U.S. Army National Guard Officer, currently overseas working in the information ops/communication space. I’ve managed everything from research/marketing initiatives for a billion dollar company, major public and private sector projects, and I’ve advised both C-Suites and General Officers. I’ve managed small teams and done my command time in the Army. I have another 6-8 months deployed before I go back to the job that I feel I’ve outgrown, and I want to take this time to plan for my next move when I get back.

Problem is - I have no idea what I want to do when I grow up. I know I am able to reach for something more, but I’m at a bit of loss on what my next steps should be.

**What do I want?**

The work I’ve always loved most was always initiatives where I got to guide a team to solve an ambiguous problem. Establishing, testing, and implementing new strategies and businesses were always the jobs that felt the most fulfilling. I love work that challenges my biases and lets me learn new things with smart people. 

I also need to make more money than I do today. Today I’m at $110K in the PNW, which is competitive for the region but not enough to support a growing family. 

My current work is abundantly ***fine*** but I find project management to be an absolute mental slog. I could probably swing for a director of sales/marketing role at my current firm with reasonable success, but I’m interested in what other ideas people may have. 

**Restrictions**

* Have to stay in the PNW. I can commute and travel happily, but my roots are here.
* Private sector only - Already get enough public sector time in the Army. 
* Not at a point in my life that I can strike out on my own and start something. Too many people financially depend on me.

**Questions**

* How do I know if I am ready to make the VP/Director jump? If I am, how do I take the first step in that direction?
* Is it better to continue push for leadership roles at my existing firm (250-ish) or try and hop to a larger company?
* What are some certifications or skills that would be worth getting while I am overseas?

**History**

Wealth Management - 8 years

* Trading Associate - 2 years
* Business Process Development - 3 years
* Consumer Learning/Strategic Planning Manager - 2 years
* Sales - 6 Months (B2C is rough)

IT Professional Services - 2 years

* Project Manager/Business Analyst - 2 years

U.S. Army - 10 Years

* Artillery Officer - 8 years
* Public Affairs Officer - 2 years

**Education/Certs**

* Bachelors in Business Admin 
* PMP
* TS/SCI Clearance

1hk402z,"New year, new opportunities","Early next year, my semi-truck will be fully paid off, and I’ll face an important decision: stay with my current company, where I’ve been for 8 years, or explore a new opportunity elsewhere.

Right now, I bring home $1,550 a week before taxes, plus a monthly bonus of $600–$900. My pay isn’t mileage-based, and I’ve been here long enough to enjoy some preferential treatment—let’s just say I get away with things other drivers might not. I’m comfortable here; it’s the “BS I know.”

But once my truck is paid off, I’ll have the freedom to go wherever I want. The company at the top of my list offers percentage-based pay: they pay 90% of the load. For example, if a load pays $3,000, I’d take home $2,700. Depending on the distance, I could haul 3 to 5 loads a week.

However, I’d also be responsible for expenses like fuel (around $1,500/week), trailer rental ($400/week), and liability insurance ($100/week). That means my pay would fluctuate quite a bit. Plus, I’d have to adjust to a whole new system and deal with the “BS I don’t know.”

Honestly, I’m torn. I’m not sure what to do, and maybe I’m not even asking for advice. Writing this out just helps me process it.",Ok_Fly5187,2,0.7599999904632568,1,1734890850,2024-12-22 18:07:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hk402z/new_year_new_opportunities/,12,2024

1hk1lia,Got a promotion and demoted within 3 days because of jealousy,"I'm a F (25), i have been working for this company for almost two years, from 2022 to now Dec 2024. I applied to be a general labor within a month i got a promotion to became an inventory personnel/associate. I was under a very young supervisor, let's call him A. A is a very well built gentleman, he is black and he is only 34 when i first got it, i was 23. I'm a young asian female in a work place with a lot of male coworkers, very male dominant. So i got a handful of assaults that happened to me within a year, since i'm quite timid and scared for my job. I kept my mouth shut most of the time, until one day i came to work with teary eyes and A asked me what is wrong. I told him everything, that i got assaulted by some men in the plant ( by touching, groping, verbal harassment, etc). Being an immigrant asian, i was always taught to keep my head down and work, i was scared that i would cause trouble, i begged him not to go to HR since i don't want to face them since my english was not that perfect. After that encounter, him and i got a little more comfortable working together. I was comfortable sharing with him all the things that happened back in my country and he was very open with his gym hobby. We are both attractive people that working together. But our communication stays plutonic and professional, we have to work side by side since we are always short staffed. I look up to him like a big brother. This is when problem started, rumors start to spread like a wild fire. Due to the fact that a lot guys in this warehouse wanted me and got rejected. They made it know they did not like me being around him, he is bad, he has a lot of women,...I ignored that and keep our friendship very professional. About A, he has a child with one lady in this plant. She is the mother to his 3 years old daughter, and they go through some custody battle and child support. She is a 5'3 white woman, 33 years old, i will call her B. So A and B have an on and off relationship with each other. The whole warehouse witness how their love blossom until it burns to ashes. This woman according to all the text messages and the extreme amount of evidences, she is a very foul and degenerate person. She also very jealous and controlling, A told me when they were dating, she found the way to steal and would smash his phone when she thought she found something suspicious. He is a very attractive young men, women came to him for work advice and there were few incidents that she fought some women at work and passive aggressively hit them. It did not lead to an altercation to get HR involved but most of the women after that got pushed out by her (i will explain how and why) and half just left due to toxic environment.
A decided to break up with B for good, she used 5 different burner phones to text him, he has screenshots of those, begged him to stay. And when she could not be able to, she attacked his manhood, put him on child support, even though he always came to her house to rock the baby when she worked day shift. He tried to be civil for his kid, she used his weakness to make him stay but he ran away from that situation and agreed to pay for child support and see his kid only 2 days a month. I saw this man looked defeated whenever he talked about his baby girl. 
So, B was a very good shipping personnel, A was  able to climb up to become supervisor with his skills. B came to A asked how could he do it since she wanted to become one for her daughter. A showed her how to drive a standup lift and some other skills as a good civil parent for his child. She dropped the lesson after 2 days trying to learn. She never mentioned again to this man until they had a new shipping manager, few months later, she became a supervisor regardless of the fact she was in final in paperwork. I heard some older coworkers said the new manager, i will call him C, posted a the job in his office, which was only her could come and saw. That's how she climbed up the ladder to become a shipping supervisor. During this time she still tried to be with A, he still have his baby sometimes when she felt like it and she did not make it official with the C-the manager. But everybody could see she played both sides. As a supervisor she terrorized everyone, a bunch of men that did not agree with the decision left her department or quit. It did not satisfied her enough, she tried her hardest to seduce the father of her child, he walked away mid sentence resulted in a big altercation that he got scratched and bled out. His jacket was ripped and she went crazy texting and apologizing, begging him don't talk to HR. Her best friend at that moment, wrote a statement of what happened to HR, B had no clue about it. They separate them, A had to tell them to move him to different department or he will quit. He is a very good worker and supervisor, the old GM decided to send him to inventory. That is when i come to the picture.  
Fyi, she has 4 counts of battery when she followed him to the store and ripped the headphone out of his ear, and police was call by a good samaritan. She was chased by the cop and was put in jail for 30 days. They kept the job for her until she came back. He had a restraining order against her granted by the court. But because he loves his daughter and he kept hoping to see her so he did not renew his TPO after that

B knew she could not be able to get with A no more, she changed her plan and used his daughter to taunt him. He could not see his daughter for 5 months straight, while she made it official with the shipping manager. They always walk together, it was even hard for a new employee like me to miss. It was so obvious they had a full blown relationship.
I got send to the shipping side to count finished products, they always walking together and C always eyeing me down. I gave A my concern and he told me to be careful. C is a womanizer, and his whole shipping team let me know he sent videos of naked women into work group chat as trophies. She is a very jealous and controlling so she has to be there whenever he is. And she did notice me due to my department and her man at that time was thinking of getting to know me. It resulted in her emotionally came to HR and told them about her relationship with the manager, as a revenge to his cheating with multiple women. He got fired, they kept her and ""lovingly"" moved her to Receiving office which 1 door a way from Inventory and matter of fact we work together so she is in the picture. Before the termination of C, A got invited to have a talk with C, he admitted the relationship between him and B, and told A his daughter is with him, in his house. And he made and attempt to ask if A was dating me, he said he loved my body shape, he love big butt women, if i was not A woman, then he could get to know me. But luckily he got terminated before he could even try. A was honest and told me about all of this and he got more protective over me at work. It did not go well with this lady once she transferred to be around us. She was there for 3 months, trying to learn the new job but receiving is a little harder than shipping. So she started to break, and due to the fact Receiving already have a supervisor so she became extra. She kept walking where we were but she made sure her move was calculated. 
Back to November, Receiving got a new manager, he is brand new and barely knows the job himself. I was thinking of putting 2 weeks notice on December 11th,2024. I got interview and a new job, the new R manager came to me and told me "" Hey, i like the way you work, do you want to become a clerk under me. I think you will be a perfect fit for this position"". I came to the current R supervisor to let him know and he suggested me to say yes, because i'm a very good inventory worker also. Everything was fine. It was a promotion, i go from 17 to 19 an hour.
2 days before my transfer, B came to A tried to talk to him when he saw me standing next to him working on the floor. She asked him, ""
B: hey there is something i want to ask you but i don't know should i ask you or not
A : about my daughter ?
B : nevermind, i will not ask you...
She just stood there for another 5 mins and walk away.
1 day before my transfer, she called him on his cell, broke down, blaming him for leaving her. Because of him she is in so much debt, the house she leased with C messed with her credit score and she paid so much for their baby and if he could help her some more with money. He paid 600 a month for his child, she asked for 1800 since her lawyer said that. She blamed him that her life is miserable and now she has to live with her mom...
On this day all the guys i have been working with for the past 1 year and a half came to me and warned me to be careful since i will be in the office with her. She will push me out just like the girl before me, i'm the replacement of that lady. B terminated her after that lady asked to leave early on Sunday. I did not think much about it

I transferred on Dec 18th,2024, she came to the office at 8:24 we were short only one gentleman had to handle most of the things while teaching me. I patiently wait until he could squeeze me in to his busy schedule and did all of his assignment correctly. She kept walking towards him and ask ""hey, you look so stressed are you sure you are okay ?"" For 3 times. I was a little irritated but i ignored that
I'm a forklift certified, i always bring my key with me, we have another gentleman with lift key but on that day he was off. A came to the office, in front of everybody and B, asked me if he could borrow my key. Part of my job was organizing the floor now i'm not here so my supervisor has to do so. I gave him my whole key with my car key. She came to the floor 3 mins later, say you know it's dead giveaway right ? What is your relationship with her and what kind of car is she driving. I had a report from my coworker he came all the way around the parking lot looking for my car. And go to ask multiple people whether i live close to the job or not. When i go for lunch at 1:30 i saw her outside talking on the phone, i walked to use the restroom and go to the main office to talk to A, about my transfer. 4 mins later she walked in, i saw the footage from the surveillance and the time line. I swung my hands up defeated and walk outside the moment she walked in, she sat there with A and talked.
A : just admit it, you date her right ? She will just leave you, can you just stop messing with the little girl. She will leave you. We can go to the couple therapy. You should kick your sister out so i can move in and you can live with our daughter
B : silence
A : whatever you always a cheater, you cheat on me with multiple women. Now i'm miserable because of you....
The conversation was last for 11 mins, she walked out and the whole footage was captured, just not the convo. This is what A explaining to me.
After that first crazy day i got scared and came to HR told them i need to document something and asked them to keep it confidential. I talked to the manager and explained to her.  B walked in to the office, it got me scared and ran away, HR witness that. 
The next day,one of my coworker wrote another statement about the fact she sexually harass him, when he opened the door for her when it's raining outside
Employee : it's raining outside, don't get yourself wet
B : i have been wet for so long already

December 19th, 2024, she calm down hindering my job, but her target is A now. She kept coming and be on the floor with him, begged him to teach her how to use RF gun and please show her something so she looked busy. She admitted that she could not get a grip of herself. She does not know how to work the system with this job. She followed him and he back down, it was cat and mouse game. The more he avoids her the more she comes into him. She make it clear as a statement, ""you know i'm a type of chick when i want something, i will not stop""
She called him to go lunch with her, and texted him ""really...""when she got outside and he did not.  She is careful with her text so whenever she  meets him she makes sure he is not recording and asked to have his phone. He refused and she got more upset and cried in front of him in the office. ""You make me feel unwanted"" 
After lunch, she pulled me aside and asked if we had a problem because HR let her know that i came to them. I said that is what HR said, i don't think i have to give you any more information. 
I got pulled into the office after that, with the Receiving manager, HR manager and GM and her. They terrorized me since i did not name dropped nobody, they said it was just he said she said. The asked me if i feel unsafe by i took the opportunity, HR manager asked. I told them i saw the growth in my career and mister Manager was the one that asked me if i wanted to. But i was inexperience so i could not be able to win. They told me they took my claim seriously because they said i was scared and paranoid and freak out when she is next to me. They GAVE ME TWO OPTIONS, either i go back to where i work THEY TRANSFER me to shipping while i can keep my dollars. Then B pulled the card saying she was not feel safe with me no more. 
The next day i was off they called my phone informed me after talking to corporate and ""investigation"", i have to go back to my department. I called A and cried, that is when he blew up on them, and told them my claim was true and his side of the story. He was harassed by her and alway silence because he loved his daughter and he needed this job. But this is not right, their investigation is flawed. I get promoted and demoted within 3 days and if they said they took my claim seriously, i'm still working around her, we are just one door away from each other. I was able to contact more people, one lady, her sister was also a victim of B, she left the job and threaten to beat B up because, she kept attacking her whenever A is with her. Mind you, A is a selector trainer, he trains everyone professionally. She got jealous with every woman come his way.
I cried to the Receiving supervisor that is on PTO, just like how she pushed another clerk out when he was not there. This is how she does to me. He said he will have a talk soon with the manager.
I was fortunate to hear about B's personal life, she still share the house the manager guy, she pulled a gun on him broad day life when her daughter was there as she removed her stuffs out of his house. He dropped a charge since she decided to go back to him after file for TPO against him. I was able to pulled the battery charge from the court. She played victim card and played both sides. 
My question is, should i contact corporate, and i'm scared that both me and A will be push out of the job even though we have all the evidences against her. Footage of her coming after me an eyewitness, but some are so scared of HR. My offer letter from another job just to prove i was not looking for trouble. I'm so stressed, i'm worried about my supervisor, he is nothing but a good man. And he is protecting me right now. It actually makes us way closer than we intended to be. She always made him a bad guy in front of everyone, i'm here to clear the rumors and i can see as scared as people are. They look at him with different eyes. And should i let them see my job offer and i was not a liar when i said they come to me for my performance. Is it the retaliation and mishandle from HR ? Monday we will have to have a talk, i'm quite scared and worried. I'm scared of them twisting word, this is the demotion within 3 days and it's very unheard of. They did not even let me have enough time to make a mistake, nothing is about my performance.

1hk1aae,Career transition from Mechanical Engineer to a Risk Analyst or Risk Assessment role (a field within International Affairs),"# Hello everyone,

I am a mechanical engineer in France, but I have always been passionate about intellectual debates on social, economic, and geopolitical issues. I love listening to podcasts, which nourish my thoughts and interest in these topics.

Today, I feel the need to pivot and move toward a profession related to these themes, which I could pursue on an international scale. Therefore, I am looking for testimonies, advice, or opinions on several points:

* Your experience in this field: If you work in geopolitics, economics, or a related profession, how did your career path unfold? What are your daily tasks?
* Education and universities: Do you have recommendations for recognized programs or a book to start with to get an idea of the field? I am open to considering universities abroad, but I am looking for something serious and affordable in terms of cost (France or Switzerland)
* Career opportunities: What types of jobs are accessible in this field that I can pursue either in Switzerland or the USA (I want to work internationally because I love traveling and discovering the world)?
* Salaries for beginners.

Thank you in advance to all those who will take the time to respond! Your feedback could really help me better understand this career transition and embark on this project that is so close to my heart.

1hk0ccn,What to put on my resume,"I (28F) am planning on quitting my job over the summer because my husband and I are moving deep into Connecticut and I will no longer be within a commutable distance to New York City (my husband is fully remote). I currently work at a furniture showroom, where my official job title is Showroom Sales Associate. My function is to drive sales and maintain client relationships. I've been there for over a year and make $48k (I recently got a 4% pay bump so I''ll be making \~$49k and do not receive commission, but did get a bonus). 

Sales were soft this past year and I've fallen into a more tech/IT role. I am the only person in the showroom (1 out of 4 people total), who knows how to troubleshoot the computers without getting our official IT department involved and can make and format an Excel spreadsheet. After a month of me starting this role, I was added to the IT meetings and I liaise with that department regularly on matters beyond just troubleshooting but they've also trained me deeper our sales software (Acumatia) and made me an admin.

I was pretty upset with the salary increase (percentage-wise I got the higher increase, but I live in a pretty high cost area and I was hoping to at least break $50k especially considering how much I do compared to the other people in my showroom who make significantly more than me), but decided to stay on because I didn't want to start a new job in my current city and they'll be teaching me more IT tasks in the next few months so I figured I'd stay until I move.

I'm getting my certs in the next few months (A+, Network, and Security) and transition into a career in IT. I'm wondering how I'll present this role in my resume. It's turned into more IT than sales, but obviously my title doesn't reflect that and they are not planning on changing my title at all (I've asked).

1hjzqf6,"3 Months at new job and Its not working out ( got shingles from stress), time to quit?","Got laid off in march from my tech company job,  Fast forward to September and the only company that would take me is this small company as a customer service rep. The office sits about 13(most days its 10) people, that's the whole company almost. the role is to input data orders and logistics of warehouses of the product and handle customer service. there are about 300 orders a day give or take. The product that they sell I know nothing about and there has never been training on the product, so I am expected to know about the product to tell customers about it, yet they have no training materials. The training consisted of someone watching me do it once and saying okay. I have ADHD and do not take meds for it and am constantly making mistakes, little fine detail stuff.  This unfortunately results in errors and I have, since I started, tried to improve in my role, make less errors. I look over my work before it goes out. I review all my orders from the last 4 hours every 4 hours.  I've gotten it down to about like a couple a clerical errors a week. the problem is this results in losses for the company because of like miss shipments of product on my end.

my 4 co workers hate me, its definitely what most people would consider an old boys kind of work place. when i started one co worker found out where i was from and went ""ew"", this guy also in the parking lot while parking drove his car up to me about 2-3 feet away from me, almost hit me. they fired another lady before I started who was making the same kind of errors I am making, this co worker constantly is trying to throw shade at me and by saying it was this lady who left who just made this new error. one co worker started 2 weeks after me and was experienced in this role, is a veteran and 9 years younger than me. he is actively trying to bully me, and people in the office notice he is aggressive, rude. thing is he is really good at this role/knows the product. he has tried walking into me when i was at the printer, has yelled his voice telling me something when i asked for clarification. he actively talks with the other two co workers but never speaks to me, so i know this guy definitely does not like me.  Also is saying stuff that alludes to me, I have said I am trying my best and when mention of this old lady they fired 6 months ago and my co workers keep bringing up her up this guy is saying ""come on guys he's trying his best. "" its usually some biting remark from these guys during the day. my own supervisor called me a dumb ass behind me because I made a mistake and vocalized i had made a mistake.   
I dread going to this job, I dread the mistakes I make, I dread the long drive. there is nothing I look forward to at this job, its literally a dead end job. I lose sleep because I hate this job so much. I broke out in shingles because of this job and had to take a week off of work.  I so badly want to quit and just start looking for a new job. I have looked for new jobs while I have been employed for 4 months and I have not heard anything, ive applied to almost 600 jobs basically that were ""entry level"" anything but what this job is doing.

1hjyswg,Building a USP ,"Hi all,
I'm a 2024 graduate and have recently completed six months in my role at an e-commerce service firm based in Hyderabad. My firm provides end-to-end services for brands in the e-commerce space, and I primarily work on PPC/CPC ads for Amazon and Flipkart.

Currently, I manage seven brands with a daily ad budget of around ₹35 lakh. Despite being a fresher, I was initially handling the highest number of brands and the largest budget in my team. This gave me confidence as I was outperforming even senior team members with more experience.

However, after a recent team restructuring, the brands and budgets were redistributed equally among the four team members. Now, I find myself on the same level as my peers in terms of workload and responsibilities.

This has left me wondering how I can justify asking for a promotion or raise after completing a year. If others are handling the same responsibilities as me (some with lower salaries), what can set me apart?

I understand no one is irreplaceable in the corporate world, but I want to build a unique value proposition (USP) that I can leverage for career growth. As a first-generation corporate professional in my family, I feel a bit unsure about navigating these thoughts.

Would appreciate any guidance or tips on how to stand out and build a USP in this field. Thanks in advance!

If I resign, I’ll fall short of 3 years of experience, which makes me wonder if it will hurt my chances for an MBA abroad. Alternatively, I could defer the CFA Level 2 exam to August to complete the 3-year milestone.

1hjy2j4,I'm not sure what to do to get into engineering/mechatronics. Can anyone help? (UK M 21),"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this but, I've been in love with engineering since I was a child but never thought about going into a job for it until the past couple of years. I am technically minded so I ended up getting a job as an installation engineer but it's not what I want. i.e. it's just repetetive installation tasks that you don't need any engineering knowledge for (There is no room for progression in this job). 

I've been thinking about leaving my job for a proper engineering job but I quickly found you either need a lot of experience or degrees. My first plan was to get an easy part time job in anything then work on personal engineering projects and create a portfolio to get my foot in the door, but I am unsure how viable that is.

The other option would be to go to Uni to get a degree, the only issue there is, due to family issues I was unable to complete my A-Levels so would struggle getting accepted for any course.  
That means if I did want to get a degree, I would have to spend 2 years getting my A-levels then an additional 3-4 years for the degree. Although time isn't much of an issue, I'm currently living with my partner's family and don't have any family of my own so relying on them for 5-6 years is unfair, additionally I don't know how money would work.

1hjvgdr,Thinking of quitting 6 months in ,"In a bit of a dilemma and could really use some perspective. I started a new job 6 months ago in what’s technically my first major promotive role—head of department. I was super excited about the position and initially felt like it was a good fit. But two months ago, we got a new CEO, and things have taken a turn.

To be blunt, she’s a nightmare to work with. She’s made it very clear that she’s here to “make changes” and doesn’t care if it “pisses people off or makes them upset.” She’s also made comments about other people in the office to me—criticizing them as individuals, not just their work.

One incident that really rattled me happened in a meeting. I was taking notes (as was everyone else), and she singled me out, telling the entire room that it wasn’t appropriate to take notes while the CEO is talking. After the meeting, she came up to me and said, “Sorry for calling you out, but as a rule of thumb, when the CEO is speaking, you shouldn’t be taking notes. If you need notes to remember things, we can work on a template for you.” It felt condescending and unnecessary, especially since no one else got called out for the same thing.

She’s also made a lot of assumptions about my experience and given feedback that feels more like personal criticism than anything constructive. I’ve honestly lost a lot of confidence since she took over.

Here’s the thing—I feel like everyone else at work is smart enough to “play the game” and avoid her wrath, but I can’t seem to find a way to do the same. It’s starting to feel like this environment just isn’t for me.

The problem is, I’m only 6 months into this role. If I leave now, will it look terrible on my résumé? Should I try to stick it out for at least a year, or is it worth prioritizing my mental health and moving on?",General_Ad4050,3,1.0,3,1734860771,2024-12-22 09:46:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hjvgdr/thinking_of_quitting_6_months_in/,12,2024

1hjt5rn,What should I do?,"Looking for some insight if anyone has any. I’m 20 and I have my career pretty much lined up. Almost done college, finishing up my practicum where I might get a job, and I’ve made good impressions in the field, with teachers, and professionals. When I’m in the field, I am determined and push myself to be better, stronger, and take risks. I get to help at risk demographics which is so rewarding, and awesome that it helps me better myself too. 

I’m on winter break right now, and I don’t know if it’s just the blues but I feel kind of done? I think about the field and it is fond to me but so overwhelming, anxiety inducing, and exhausting. The demographic is hard to reach which is understandable, I love them but they also stress me tf out and make me question whether I should be doing this! Everywhere I’ve gone career wise I feel like I’m putting on a mask to make people happy and like me. It feels refreshing to not suck up to people and suppress myself because I’m younger and more inexperienced. A lot of the times I want to do my own thing and be left alone, help the demographic myself, but I can’t do that. I’m strung to corporate, teams, meetings, and bosses and supervisors. Which is just life I get it. But I can’t help but feel like there is something more for me out there. 

I always thought this was my purpose, and I think it is in some ways, but if I could choose what I wanted to do for the rest of my life it wouldn’t be this. Unfortunately, my life long dream isn’t very fruitful or lucrative, and not valued in todays time as much as it was in the past. It also takes a lot of time and energy I feel like I don’t have within me. What footprint do I want to leave on this world when I die? Easy: I want to have helped people. 

But is what I’m doing the vessel for me to do that through? I’m not sure. I hate the over sensitivity and acting like I care about things I don’t (which is completely understandable and necessary in the field). Like I don’t want to dance around the issues, pretend I empathize with drug addicted, absent parents. I guess it makes me more patient and opens my mind. I hate having to put on a show that what they’re doing makes sense, fuck no I grew up with abuse and alcoholism and I hate have to justify that. I’m really strong valued and I have to put on a mask. I don’t know, I’m just confused. But I need money, and this is where my decisions has lead me. It’s not a horrible path, it’s very rewarding and I’m so so lucky. I just feel lost. My husband is really the only person that fully understands me. I want so badly to be creative and help people in my own unique way. But I got to squeeze into sterile spaces, read files, and deal with shitty parents :/

1hjt5jm,Boss asking me if I plan on staying at this job for 2025,"For context: I’ve already works on my 2025 goals with my direct manager for my department. Those are available to both her and the department director.

The director of my department, who I barely interact with, set up a meeting with me for the start of the year to “connect and hear about what you're hoping to achieve for yourself in 2025. | want to help you reach your goals!” This was sus to me because I’ve never had to connect with her regarding my goals for the year. If she had any questions about those, she can easily connect with my manager who works beneath her. 

I also wanted to add that my company is incredibly toxic. There’s absolutely no sense of professionalism and management is incredibly petty and will lash out if criticized. Last year, my dept was incredibly short shaded and our beloved manager had recently quit. That left the director to run the department. We had one on one meetings with her every other week. She knew I was unhappy at the job and burnt out and turned these meetings into career chats of sorts where we talked about long term goals and what I could do to get there. I didn’t reveal too much about that since I know better to trust any type of management and kept my cards close. This turned into her getting frustrated with me because I was unhappy but planned on staying at this job because I didn’t have anything lined up. She called me and basically cornered me and tried to get me to quit. Money was tight and the CEO was trying to cut expenses anywhere he could, including staff and he was pressuring management to sus out who was planning on leaving/ very unhappy to see who they can cut.  It was an extreme t unprofessional call where she yelled at me
Like a child saying “I don’t know what we’ve been doing these past months.” Referring to our career one on one’s. I never wanted her to coach me or give me advice. I know what’s best for me and can find my own way in my career thank you very much. Since then I trusted her even less

Fast forward to yesterday and I get that message about her wanting to help me reach my 2025 goals…. ok that’s vague? If she wanted to know about 2025, she could easily access that doc to learn more, it’s all laid out there. I have a creeping suspicion that she’s going to try to pull another call where she tries to figure out if I’m trying to leave in 2025. They haven’t set the budget yet, which tracks, so based on the timing I wouldn’t put it past her if this turned out to be that type of call. I am planning on staying at this job for the foreseeable future, and obviously if a better opportunity presents itself I’m going to take it. 

I’d love some advice on how to navigate this type of conversation. This whole situation is slimy and is very on brand with my extremely toxic workplace and I’m so tired of it all.

1hjqa5d,Should i stay and buy a home or should I go?,"I am 43 and live in a rural area with only a handful of good employers -- I work at one, and I have a good job. I'm about maxed out on salary, but I make a good one, somewhat consistent. Of course, things could always change and if I didn't have this job, it'd be hard to replace in flexibility and salary in this area. Also, this area is really expensive, I can afford a place an hour away even more rural than here but I'd be isolated -- but building some equity. I can't afford rents around here.

I am about to graduate and seriously level up my abilities --- I can start applying to jobs in new cities. The new jobs will be tough (double the workload and hours) and a change but cost of living is better and I can afford much more. 

I'm just scared to leave the steady and what I've known for the past 5 years. A part of me wants to stay because it's easy money but it's putting all of my eggs in one basket and cutting me off from a lot of growth opportunities.

1hjo37j,Offered assistant manager need advice,"So I have worked for my company (a very large well known shipping company) for a little under two years. In that time I have advanced from team member to shipping captain to a lead consultant. I love this job and find the pay and benefits very good compared to anything else I have had. Over my performance review in November, my manager told me that herself and the store manager from the town next to us talked and both agree that they would like to offer me the assistant manager position at that store. I was shocked but happy , she gave me basically the month of December to decide. Here’s the cons: it’s about 20 miles away and I only have a motorcycle where it rains a lot, the staff is all younger women (I am 38 M) so I’m not sure the dynamic would be good, I would have been promoted over women who have worked there longer so there’s a possibility of some resentment, and it’s a training store so I’m assuming I would be responsible for a great deal of training new hires even though there is a full time trainer. The pros would be a bump in pay ranging from $2-$5/hr, a jump forward in my position within the company and a better path in life.

1hjnmcp,"Implicit expectations of salaried employees, and help moving forward. ","TL;DR. US based, I am leaving my first salaried position of 2 years at a small business where the owner said that it’s expected that salaried (exempt) employees across any industry should be working a minimum of 50 hours per week. Is this actually normal?

Context:
I am a very hard worker, in any position I’ve been in, I’ve always worked up to become a trainer/manager. I say this because this usually means over time pay and I’ve never minded and actually enjoy working really hard. I worked in food service in HS and college and the mental health field after college. I then left the mental health field to avoid burnout and starting working for a small company (average of 15 employees). 

I started in the as an entry level CSR at the small business which I’ll abbreviate to ‘SB’ which was a major step down from what I was previously doing (running a dementia floor as an admin). At SB I was quickly promoted and I could honestly go on forever about how toxic this job was primarily due to the owner. I’ll leave a few examples at the end to demonstrate this, and get to the point for now. 

For the 2 years I was at SB the owner, my boss, would say to many new hires and my self that salary is performance based solely and not hourly based. That every industry he’s worked in and anyone who is salaried would understand that a minimum of 50 hours per week is standard for salaried employees. Salaried employees who work exactly 40 hours a week just don’t understand the salaried role. 

There have been many other things the owner at SB said that make me highly doubt his judgement on many “industry standard” things and I was wondering moving toward new employment aiming to become a salaried employee again, is he right? 

Examples of toxic workplace (as short as possible leaving out my personal feelings as much as possible)

- after 4 days of being employed the owner told me he was firing my boss and that he wants me to take over her responsibilities…before she was even told

- within 3 months of employment, my boss was firing another manager who’s last day was in about 2 months and my boyfriend (who I also worked with and live with) was going to be promoted into this position but I couldn’t tell him directly and my boss waited another 2 months until the managers last day to tell my bf he was being promoted. 

-asking everyone in the company about their feelings about a coworker and directly saying he’s going to fire them

- calling everyone stupid for any mistake, including me

- owner being 100% certain it was a specific employee did something wrong and telling everyone in the office what they did but was mistaken after basically, and then not apologizing when he was wrong 

- having all office employees to send daily emails to the anyone who has a work emails (avg. 6-10 people) of everything we did in a day so he can use it against us at a future date. 

- hiring people for me to train/take my responsibilities/directly oversee at 10-20k a year more than me. 

- asking for a raise = first to get fired “if you ask for 80k a year I’ll give it to you, then fire you the next week for not putting out 80k a years level/quality of work, why would I say no to a raise when they are basically asking to get fired” 

-our turnover rate this year including my soon termination and the person we fired yesterday, will put us at 175%, most of the terminations are involuntary…

1hjn0zg,Should I stay or should I go,"I work as a data operations manager, I love my job, the work life balance has been great, and raises/bonuses have been better then expected. Well… things have really changed this year. Work life balance is still good, and I expect it to continue to be, but I just don’t feel much job security anymore. This year the owners who are nice people… sold our company to a much larger company that is owned by a private equity group. Since then, things have changed rapidly. The worst of this is that they laid off 2 whole departments which amounted to about 40 percent of the company. Morale is very low, and we were told that this will be the only mass layoff, and the rest of us are safe, but we were also told at the beginning of the buyout that this would be a good move for our careers. We are changing systems that we work in, and in my opinion they are inferior to our previous process and systems used for data deployment and management, and I also fear that many of my responsibilities will no longer exist due to these changes. I don’t know if this will be a good or bad thing (this may present me opportunities to move into other roles) Our company was doing great, we weren’t bought because we were a failing business or anything.

1hjmzaw,Stuck in training with someone who doesn't ,"I'm in a training program at work.  It's brand new.  We're being rotated around facilities to learn a very specific job role, with the eventuality of being moved to the new facility opening in a few years.

I'm stuck training under someone who isn't happy because I won't eventually become one of her assistants (she is maxed out on those already) and isn't happy we're slated for the new and shiny facility when she's never been slated for a transfer.  She doesn't want to put a ton of effort into training someone, so she doesn't do anything with me.  I have no assignments.  I ask her questions and she responds about half the time, half the time she pretended she doesn't hear me.  She leaves me out of teams chats for different important activities with promises of forwarding me the information, which doesn't happen.  She often stays late to finish tasks I specifically asked to help on, after lying and saying we'll do it tomorrow and I should go home.  A situation happened today, and instead of being allowed to assist or participate, I was told to go watch a movie at my desk because they'd be waiting on guidance all day.  Tldr; they weren't, so I awkwardly stood around while they discussed the plan forward.

I'm trying to work with her assistants, but she's a bit of a control freak, so they either don't have a ton to do or they're an independent contractor who doesn't want a real employee learning their job.  I'm trying to learn from other people at the facility, but they know a minimum about my particular specialty.  I feel like I'm falling behind, because the things I've found out I need to learn just aren't being shared with me and I'm at a loss as to how to learn them on my own.

I'm nervous to bring it up to the training coordinator, because she does do great work and is known for being a high performer.  Nobody has any complaints about her, largely because she's doing the work of four people herself and giving four people a cruise control job. Her supervisor is in a different state and honestly not very good at his job, so he's very attached to her making him look good.  The entire management team thinks she's fantastic.

I'm at a loss.  I'm not a college graduate.  I have a decade of experience at other companies in this industry.  I've never been treated like this before starting a new job and I'm at a loss as to how to proceed.  In my previous jobs, I was known for being a fast learner and a fairly high performer, and I feel like I deadheaded out of nowhere.",Desperate-Buyer4,1,1.0,0,1734826809,2024-12-22 00:20:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hjmzaw/stuck_in_training_with_someone_who_doesnt/,12,2024

The pay however is a significant jump, with $5k-6k a month net with a sign on bonus of about 5k. I decided to speak to my old coworker who left for a different division a couple of months ago. I worked with her since I started and she is my mentor at the company. She told me not to apply as she says it will be probably be toxic and unflexible with my FF aspirations. I also have a really good relationship with the account manager at the staffing firm that initially recruited me to my current remote job. He said that a 90 day rollover was mandatory after completing my contract but it would be highly likely he will find something for me as I have past experience with said company and am in good standing. He did say that most of the new contractor reqs would be onsite. It would be for net 4k a month. He also said that he would refer me to any remote/hybrid roles and would negotiate with contracts on this as well, but was unsure just how many of those would be available and if they would be flexible on it. Should I use from now till the end of March to apply to remote/hybrid/ roles with a much smaller commute and then use unemployment if for 3-6 (I'd be getting \~2400$/mo unemployment, 6 months is the max) months while pursuing firefighting jobs, and taking another contract role that is possibly onsite if I can't find anything else? The unemployment would cover my rent and almost all expenses. Or should I apply to the Buyer job and take the pay raise until I find a FF job? If I take the Buyer job, it will likely result in me to put applying to Fire Departments on the backburner for a while until I get adjusted to the cadence of the schedule and commute. I could also just apply and really try to get a feel from the hiring managers/ HR about the workload and if I'm not satisfied, withdraw my application.

TL:DR: Picking between a Buyer job that is potentially toxic with a long commute but a big salary bump or working until the end of my contract while applying to other jobs/ pursuing Firefighting, collecting unemployment if I can't find anything with a strong chance of landing another contract after 3 months.

I guess I'm just asking if this long-term commitment is worth it, or has anyone finished this program and liked/disliked it? I'm just at a headspace where I don't know what to do with my life. The Job market is horrendous, nor am I sure I want to commit myself to being a full-time teacher.

1hjlavj,Junior in college needing advice. I feel my 2nd major is a career-dependent decision. I feel stuck in place and it's tough to overcome this.,"Currently a junior studying philosophy whilst thinking of adding business or chemistry. I originally wanted to add on Psychology, but at the undergraduate level, I feel it's not employable. Meanwhile I'm at a university with a good business college. I should take advantage of that, right? If I did go business, I'm not sure which concentration to do. 

About me: I love ethics, people like Mark Manson, Olivia Fox Cabane, and Simon Sinek. I also like little things about neurochemistry. I originally wanted to do neuroscience and philosophy, but my college lacks a neuro program. So I like little facts about drugs, chemistry, serotonin, the bullshit that's in food and negatively impacts us and the chemical explanation for that. Specifically, the ethics of why the FDA is allowing unregulated use of toxic and cancerous chemicals in American food. I feel passionate about that.

I presume the advice you give me will depend on my interests and goals. I wrote a little about what I'm interested in above, in addition to the loneliness epidemic. I like the idea of chemistry and neurochemicals that make people function and socialize -> but I don't think I should do psychology, I must stay practical.

I don't know what out there that exists for me, let alone how do I discover such a career. Maybe some help into career discovery would be useful, I feel unequipped with the knowledge of locating such people and careers.

1hjl24c,Severance package or assured job,"About 2 weeks ago, my team within the company was disbanded, so the specific job I had does not exist anymore. The company however, wanted to retain us by placing us in another team. The other option we were given is to be fired without cause on December 31st with a severance package. 

If the company did not find us a job, then we would be fired. Recently, they did find a role for me, but the truth is I dislike the job they offered, as it is very different from what I used to do. 

Ever since I received the news I have been job searching, and after 20+ CV sent, I got 2 job interviews that more align with what I am looking for In a job.

Both interviews are in January, and I have until next week to accept the new role. This role, should I accept, is a done deal.

Now here's the issue, should I reject the change in role, I am also rejecting the severance package. But by doing that, I am banking on getting a job from either of the other 2 companies. So essentially, I am betting on getting a job that is not assured and risk ending up with nothing but the severance package, or accepting the new role, and down the line quitting but without the severance package.

1hjhpyl,Public Health Career Advice Needed,"Hi friends,

I don't even know where to start. Feeling very overwhelmed and disheartened about where things are at in my life despite all of my hard work. Please note that you'll see me referring to this ""very prestigious"" institution throughout, and it's honestly to try to not give away who it is since they are corrupt and I don't want any negative (further) outcomes from this post, but I'm sure some will be able to figure out the place anyways. You'll find that I have some rather negative feelings and experiences from there that I can't help but share. I also want to note that I didn't include every little detail about these experiences, but please know that I have gone above and beyond to improve communication in the workplace and worked extremely hard and always got everything done on time and without flaws. Each position I've been in, I have worked consistently at least 15 hours unpaid OT each week without complaint.

I have my MPH and BS in Public Health. My MPH is from the ""most prestigious"" public health institution in ""the world."" I also am a part of a very ""prestigious"" fellowship within that institution as well.

I have experience working as a research assistant where I got my BS and then a prevention educator for sexual & domestic violence at a small shelter in a rural area after getting my BS. After my MPH, I worked at ""the gold standard"" of DV/IPV shelters in the US as an advocate supervisor and then promoted to a shelter coordinator. I was getting paid $54.5k here.

I missed working in research, so I became a senior-level research coordinator at the ""prestigious"" public health institution. Words cannot explain the level insanity and hostility I worked with under my PI, a highly-regarded PH leader. She found out I was looking into other positions, so she fired me for ""not completing"" a document I had completed 5 months prior that she had approved (as well as submitted to and was approved by the IRB). That role was focused on violence experienced by immigrant women in the US. Even the HR director told me that I could sue for a hostile work environment, as my experience was kind of the ""norm"" for this PI. I was getting paid $59k here.

I started working with another PI for a suicide prevention study under the same institution with an even bigger name in research. It was great for 3 months until our new manager started. The PI continuously kept forgetting the work I had done that we discussed throughout several meetings and emails every week and did not check her emails. She told me this was not working out, and honestly I was extremely exhausted from my previous experience and then this turning into the same thing as before. I put my two weeks in, which resulted in a meeting with her crying and apologizing that she was under a lot of stress because she was helping her child apply to colleges. I was making $52k here (please note that I was filling in the gap for the manager who was hired later on for 3 months who makes $82k).

I have been unemployed since November 22nd (today is December 21st). I know it hasn't been too long, but I don't even know what to do next. I've been applying with instant rejections despite having a resume and experiences I would've never dreamed of 5 years ago. I had to move home. I'm about to be 30. I have been waiting 21 days for the Medicaid department to get me enrolled, and now it's staying it won't be effective until the middle of next month. I moved across states, so I have to switch everything (ID, car stuff, etc.), but I tried to pay off my student loans as much as possible (which I now regret), so I have absolutely no money left.

I'm frustrated to see state-level PH program coordinators offering a maximum of $18 an hour. Rent is insane now, and the pay is insulting at most places. I have 6 years of public health and violence prevention experience, 4 years of research experience, 3 years of supervisory experience, and more. I know some of my complaints seem stupid, but it's so frustrating when I've worked so hard and put my all into this, and all I have is debt to my name.

At this point, I'm open to trying something new and getting out of the PH field. I've worked in private and public institutions, and no one wants me/I don't qualify/I won't accept pay that won't even pay half of what rent costs now. I have so much passion, drive, and compassion to make change within communities but it kind of feels impossible anymore. It's hard for me to imagine myself working in a company/organization that goes against my values, but they seem to be the only ones that can pay the bills and give me a work/life balance.

After letting her go, I was given the opportunity to replace her role. I'm sad and confuse at the same time since I love my manager so much and now I'm replacing her. I was even hesitant accepting the offer.

This is my first time being a leader and I'm really excited about it but mostly anxious at the same time. I have told the director that this is my first time and I'm not as good as my previous manager.  He said that it looks like I'm not appreciating what i have done for the company And he assured me that he will guide me as needed. With that being said, he does guide me. But, i don't know why, everytime i make a mistake or missed something, i have this fear that i will be fired. 

I have been transparent to him most of the time and i strive my best to do better everyday. I work 7:30 to 6:00 pm most of the time since I'm having a hard time to let go of my other tasks when I'm not promoted yet.

I am currently working in a national business development position for a large corporate. 

As I am looking for a next career step, and looked for a step either in 
I have an offer at hand from a mid-sized company that discussed a position for multiple markets with opportunity to grow rather soon.
Now with the contract at hand it got trimmed down to:
A) one market vs. multiple markers 
B) more operational and less strategic than discussed previously 
C) over-time of 15% monthly is already within the normal size of contract -> which comes to net less $ per hour than my current role 
D) the bonus which has been told to be fixed is kpi based.
I'm normally fine with that, but they are both company performance dependant and I have no hand in developing the kpis together with them.
E) cost for company car comes from my salary and no extra car allowance.

How would you adress these issues in a polite way? 
And that feels not trustworthy before it even started.

1hjgb6m,Is my cooking career doomed due to back pain?,"Hey all, any advice or information you can provide is greatly appreciated! Basically, I love to cook, and I would really like to do it for a living. But my last cooking job (at a big chain pizza restaurant) was impossibly hard on my back (I've had lifelong issues with mid-back pain, mostly endurance-related), and after about six months, I ended up having to quit. I've tried braces, gels, pain relievers, yoga, back exercises, etc, and nothing seems to help. I also don't see my doctor prescribing anything on the stronger side. But it only starts to hurt if I have to do certain things, mostly involving deep cleaning (I can still clean to an extent) or prep work like stretching dough. When I'm on the table, I feel great, and this is something I'm honestly fairly good at. It's the most satisfying job I've ever had, especially walking out to a dining room full of people eating the food I had just put so much work and care into. So my question is, where do I go from here? Are there any big chains that hire for food service but also have a dedicated cleanup crew? Should I look more towards the smaller establishments that might be a little more lenient? Is it possible that my management/co-workers would be understanding of my situation and allow me to focus more on the food itself instead of cleaning? (Because my last managers wouldn't). Or is that just unfair to my co-workers in general? I'm really lost here, and I just want to figure this out. I miss cooking for other people so much, and I'd really like to find my way back to it.

Entry level pay in my city and industry has technically ranged 40k-75k, with most jobs being 50k-60k. I had a job interview earlier this week. The posting listed the range as 45k-70k. The interviewer asked me my salary range and I wasn’t prepared. I panicked and answered honestly and said at least 50k and that most jobs I was applying for were in the 50k-60k range. I honestly didn’t feel prepared for the interview at all, as the job description was pretty short and I couldn’t find much information about the company online. 

As soon as I left the interview and thought about it more, I wished I asked for more money. Yes, most jobs I’ve applied to over the past month have been 50k-60k, but they’ve also been hybrid with 1-2 days remote per week. This job is fully in-person, no potential for remote work, and has somewhat odd hours which means I wouldn’t get to take Pilates classes with my favorite instructor. The job itself also has way more responsibility than other jobs I’ve looked at. The other jobs I am still in the process of interviewing for have ranges of 55k-60k and 60k-70k listed on their postings, though we never discussed salary in those interviews. 

I kind of assumed there would be a second interview, and I would be able to correct my salary range. There wasn’t, and they offered me the job at 50k on Friday afternoon. This is the first offer I’ve gotten in 6 months of searching, so I don’t want to say No or offend them, but I really think 50k is too low.

1hjdbwk,I need career guidance!! Please help me out!!,"I am 25 male, from India. I graduated from Delhi University with a degree of B.COM Honours.

I took a job right after graduation in a clothing manufacturing company. I have been working as a merchandiser for the past 3.5 years. I overlook all aspects of the business from meeting international fashion brands, sourcing of fabric, sampling, production, costing and shipments.

I don’t have any degree in fashion. I feel that my learning has gone limited & I want to grow in my career. I would love to work in another country & increase my remuneration. I am willing to up skills, but not able to set a certain path to move forward in my career. 

Please advise what can I do to make myself more important in the industry.",Alarming_Prune_3113,1,1.0,0,1734798582,2024-12-21 16:29:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hjdbwk/i_need_career_guidance_please_help_me_out/,12,2024
1hjd3ub,Should I make a lateral move for added marketability?,"
About Me: I work in Compliance in the staffing industry at a decently large and successful organization. I’ve been promoted 7 times within the same department but have seem to hit a ceiling in my current role. Early 30s, ideally starting a family in the next 1-2 years. I have no other professional work experience. 

Situation/Opportunity: I was offered a lateral opportunity - same title, same pay, completely different role, new managers. I’d be replacing someone currently working the role. To put it bluntly, they said the current leader is not cutting it and isn’t a good fit. They are not as detailed, technical, assertive, or as effective of a communicator as “they need to be”. Essentially I’d be working with our Product Support team and a team of 6 direct reports to plan, collaborate with, and execute high level, mission critical, development (software) initiatives that would fulfill Dept and Company wide goals.

During the convo, I was told that roughly 10 senior leaders recommended me out of roughly 50+ of my colleagues for the role,  saying they think I am the perfect fit due to my skill set. 

So…..HELP! Do I take the risk? I don’t feel excited about the opportunity, but feel like I have no choice given the companies recent emphasis and investments into Tech\software solutions AND feeling I’ve hit a ceiling in my current role. Opportunities for growth are non existent right now and unsure what other opportunities would come up, or when. 

Context:
* Most of our current initiatives are aimed at automating tasks human employees are doing, currently. Likely removing the need for those humans in the future (my educated guess)
* Internal employee morale, trust and motivation is very low department-wide primarily targeted towards senior/executive leadership 
* I am risk adverse and hate change but am a damn good worker and realize that growth requires these things.

Pros:
(I am too anxious to think logically about other pros right now) 

* Something new - unsure when another opportunity for something new would come up in the future or if I’d be considered for whatever that is
* New role is aligned and directly connected to/impacts direction company is headed (strong tech/dev focused)
* If people jobs are reduced, I’d likely be safer due to the nature of the new role
* Increases my marketability and diversifies my experience
* Demonstrates my ability to be a team player in helping where business needs adapting and succeeding in a new area
* Might not be the move I’m looking for but may be strategic and increase my value for the long haul

Cons:
* New Manager and Sr Manager
- Haven’t heard the greatest things about direct manager. I love and feel safe with my current manager. 
- Haven’t had the greatest experience with them either direct or Sr (ie. Lack of responsiveness, skill, drive, competency and attitude)
* Would feel isolated (no colleagues I could trust or be close to, do not anticipate befriending anyone)
* Lateral move, no room for negotiation.  Was told that compensation bump would be a discussion if I am doing well post transition  
* Not excited about the job duties itself based on info I have so far 
* My current direct reports would transition to other leaders who are potentially not good fits for their needs and could impact their growth potential

I wanted to ask the you guys about something I’ve been pondering lately. I worked as a full-time remote Android Developer Intern for 10 months. The role involved real-world projects, contributing to production apps, and handling responsibilities similar to a junior developer.

Would this experience count as **""work experience""** when I apply for jobs?

1hjbzd0,Returning to old company,"To give some context, I graduated with a job lined up and started it pretty much 2 weeks after my graduation day. I continued working there for 1.5 years, which was when I had the very logical idea of resigning without a job lined up since I felt frustrated and was slightly interested in exploring other career options. Now, I am working at a different job but I really don't like it, so I've been hoping to return to my old company since it was a very good fit on hindsight. The only thing I'm worried about is how I left pretty much right after coming back from vacation and collecting my bonus, as well as how I left without another opportunity lined up. Furthermore, my resume does not look good since the existing gap is 10 months long.

I'm about to graduate from highschool and I'm not sure at all what career I want to pursue for college. I know I'm still young but I can feel the magnitude of my potential as much as I feel it slipping from my hands as time goes on in this state of indecision. I think to myself — should I figure out what I want to do and anchor myself in that, I could pretty much be limitless. 

And that's my problem. I don't know.

All I know I want to do is get enough money to travel around the world. Problem is: I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to get to that point. I know it's a lofty goal. The people around me have wasted no time in telling me how lofty they are. But I really don't want to give up because they are telling me to.

Another thing I know - I love learning about things. I was thinking of becoming a SWE and pursuing a CS degree for that reason, and because I love mathematics, but I'm aware of how people are painting the state of the job market online and now I'm not quite sure. 

I want to live a fulfilling life and I need money to be able to chase after my goals. I feel restricted by my financial situation. I want to use my time so that I can maximise my potential now. Please... I want some advice.

I recently got an opportunity to work as an Account Manager remotely for a well-known company. The job comes with some great perks that align with my current situation:

* Work From Home
* Opportunities to travel internationally to expand the business (fully covered by the company)
* Working for a globally recognized company, which could significantly boost my career.

For context, I’m not fully satisfied in my current job, so this opportunity feels like a step up. However, the salary offer is 1K USD per month.

Here’s where I’m torn:

* In my country, this salary is considered 70-80% higher than the local average, so it’s good by local standards.
* On the other hand, compared to similar roles globally, it feels quite low.

The job offers valuable experience, exposure, and career growth, but I’m unsure whether I should negotiate the salary or accept it as a stepping stone for future opportunities.

And my dispatch supervisor is a pure narcissist and hate monger, and a old pervert. he wants everyone to kneel before him and beg him multiple times to get something done. So what happened i was supervising my evening dispatch team, and i had multiple calls from sales reps of our company regarding a pickup we did at a certain place, and we picked up 2 oven from a different company, so the other company complained about those missing ovens. So our sales team contacted me...i was alone in the warehouse, because most  warehouse and dishware department were gone.... i was all by myself, i took their request and went to warehouse to look for those ovens and i couldn't find them in the first place but with the help of a guy in the warehouse i found those oven and sales team really appreciated me for this crucial help, otherwise we would have had to  sent our own oven later, because other company had a very important event ....technically, i did a right thing, i saved my company's money, time and integrity and i followed up with the company's owner got their details and told them you'll have your oven tomorrow morning before 11 am, he really appreciated me...

I told my supervisor what i did, he said that's not your job to look for ovens and talk to customers, that's customers service and tableware's job to talk to customer and looks for the missing items.

I said it was important and urgent that's y i helped, because they have an event tomorrow and they are asking for their ovens or replacement for the items. I did the right thing.

He said, you should told me first and then the sales team to contact, warehouse and tableware department next day and solve this problem...and i was like bro, wtf i solved a major problem, i solved a problem within 10 mins and you are asking the customer and sales team to waiting for next day, nd now you are taking out on me by saying that that's not your job, i saved a 75 km of an extra trip, your driver and helper's money, your time.

And i got to know by a driver of our company, my supervisor said, he won't stay in the dispatch for so long because of this incident, because i helped those ladies. 

nd i know the real reason, i sorted out this issue without his help and no sales rep or customer had to kneel before him, they didn't had to beg him multiple times. he's 70 years old male and flirts with women close to 25 and 27...and most of sales rep are around this age and rather then taking his help they came to me...and within 10 min i solved the problem and in the end he made me look stupid",chandannarsingh,1,1.0,0,1734770515,2024-12-21 08:41:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hj5tpv/canon_workplace_politics/,12,2024

I recently received feedback for a position I was more than qualified for they were only looking for three years in Social. They said to build out my portfolio and show versatility in all forms of media including content for fictionalized entities/organizations. 

I have a lot of content on my portfolio from videos to social media examples, websites, newsletters, press releases, brochures, and ads that I created. I’m not sure how creating fictionalized work would help or how to present it on a professional portfolio? Has anyone done something like this and do you think it is best to add it to a portfolio? I don’t know something about it just feels disingenuous.

1hj37sy,Should I watch out for my manager?,"I had my review my manager recently and other than me slightly critiquing myself, it went extremely well. I received praise for my work and shared the areas I’d like to take on next year. During the meeting, she seemed extremely supportive and in agreement, so I was excited.

Fast forward to now and it seems as if she’s morphed into a whole new person. She’s given the areas I said I wanted to take over to my coworker while having me continue overseeing the areas I said I no longer wanted to oversee. The reason being is I’m not passionate about these areas and have proven to thrive in the requested areas. 

To me, it seems as if she doesn’t have my best interest at heart. She smiles in my face, acts sweet and bubbly, but I now wonder if I should watch out for her?

Two coworkers were consistently rude to me and seemed to have a new complaint every day. They often got me in trouble over trivial things, creating a lot of unnecessary stress. As a result, I admit I wasn’t always cheerful or pleasant, especially considering their behavior. 

They overworked me and constantly criticized everything I did. When my dad was their age, he was working hard in 100-degree weather, tearing off and fixing roofs, and they sit in air-conditioning all day sitting in a chair complaining about how cold they are. 

And they pick on a woman who is way younger and take her career from her and all of her hard work and still call themselves men?

1hj2smh,Career Switch - is the pay cut worth it?,"Hey everyone. I recently got a job offer for a tech role in a fairly stable company (been around for 70 years and has had continuous growth) and am needing some outside opinions. 

I am currently in a sales job and I am going to close out 2024 with ~$135k gross, 50k is base rest is commissions. However, my book of  business has suffered greatly the past few months and the start of 2025 is not looking great, I am playing a lot of catchup in a highly competitive market and will be lucky to make what I made in 2024. I work from home with this job. 

The tech job (data related) offered me a $95k base, quarterly bonuses (though not an exact number and I am following up on what the average % is), employee owned stock option program, and yearly COL + performance raises. This job would be a hybrid role, 3 days in office and two days at home with occasional domestic travel. 

I have a bachelors of science and have been wanting to utilize my degree and did not think I would find something in this market, so that is exciting. 

I live in a MCOL area and it is going up every year, my mortgage is quite expensive due to high rates and my hopes of refinancing are diminishing. 

Do I stay in the sales role and try to catch up plus some to make over $135k (no guarantees, can be put on a PIP, lots of uncertainty) or do I take the “pay cut “ and take the tech job? I am a rock in a hard place right now. My heart says tech job but I am scared to put my family in a bad situation financially.

1hj10oe,Company Change Opportunities ,"Hey everyone,

I work in tech sales right now as an SDR as 24M at a fairly large company. Been in the role for about 18 months now and will be finishing 2024 as the #1 rep and lead in almost every category.

In September, I was turned town for a promotion to account executive because some of the leadership felt that I cannot “control a room” or didn’t have 100% confidence. Currently interview for another AE role again and they still worry about the same thing. Never had any closing experience and have been practicing sales cycle for the past few months but you never really know game speed till you play in the game and get comfortable.

I have also been exploring other jobs and a smaller startup reached out willing to pay me 54K more for the same role and with a plan to become an AE in the first 3-6 months if I was to join now and exceed early. They are rapidly growing and dont want to let other people get ahead of me if I were to leave to that company

Having a tough time deciding whether I should take a chance at another company when I have developed a great personal brand at the large company.

Even if I were to be promoted within the larger company, I would be paid 10K less than the smaller company but would have a AE role and gain closing experience.

Has anyone else been in this boat? What were key decision criterias?

I have a bachelors in finance and a masters in corporate finance and have been looking since September.

1hizonb,unsure if i should i leave my job?,"Hi everyone! I am looking for some advice about my work.

I work in social work and really enjoy the clients I work with. I make about $28 an hour. No pension plan, but i have benefits. I'm on contract until June. I enjoy most of my coworkers, but I recently had an interaction with a coworker where i made a small mistake and my coworker reported me to management. Management is also constantly micromanaging but have recently made promises to change. The building has some major issues and we have had multiple floods. They're very disorganized as an organization as well. So I started looking for new work.

earlier this week i applied for a different job, which includes counselling and group facilitation, which are things that i have been missing in my current role. Today i was sent a job offer and now i'm weighing the pros and cons. I would make $25 an hour and would probably have to take a second part time job to help me cover my expenses. This job had a range offered and given my experience and education, i was expecting to be placed a step higher on the pay grid. It would be good to have a fresh start, but I am really worried about taking such a drastic pay cut. This job has opportunities for further training. its also full time permanent, with a pension plan. i'd have opportunities for pay increase every year. They have a good reputation and seem to be a good place to work at. They also offer a good amount of support to their staff and overall are a lot more organized as agency.

1hiyso7,Advice for a young engineer,"Looking for some advice as somebody who is relatively early on in their career and trying to determine next steps.

First, some background.

Graduated with a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering in 2021. Been working at a large fortune 500 manufacturer ever since. One of the highest paying companies in my area. First 2 years were on a rotational program (four 6-month rotations) and for the past 20 months have been full time on an engineering team. 

After completing my company’s rotational program I took the position I currently have based on advice and feedback I recieved from some senior level leaders saying it would be a good fit and opportunity for myself. I quickly realized that was all more or less lies, as the real reason they pushed me towards this team was due to a lack of personnel currently on the team to handle all the work they had (was not aware of this before hand or else I would have kept looking). For some context, my team is notorious for high turn over rates. People usually join, stay for 1-3 years and then leave due to frustration, burnout, etc. 

Ever since joining my team, I was basically thrown headfirst into projects with little time to get up to speed or focused training to prepare me for the task at hand. Add to that that our team does some extremely technical work that its not necessarily straight forward and easy to understand/pickup, and 90% of the knowledge and skills needed to be successful are very much tribal knowledge. Not much in the form or written processes or procedures to go off of as almost every problem/situation is very specific to whatever project or task we are currently tasked with completing. Often times I feel extremely pressured and stressed not just from the very technical nature of our work, but also adding to that stress is the constant feeling that I am always missing some key background information or skills that I truly need to be successful. Almost like I am constantly behind the 8-ball so to speak at any given moment. 

These past 20 months have been very rough for me. While my performance on paper has been ok (never been put on a PIP or had my manager speak to me about my performance in a negative way) I just feel like I am always lost and confused at work and like I can’t do anything right. I have a very experienced team member who I can thankfully lean on for support, but I know at times he can get frustrated with my lack of knowledge and skill, sometimes causing his feedback to come off as a bit condescending. While he is always willing to help me learn and has told me he likes working with me, I feel often like I am a burden to him. Couple that with my overall low self confidence in my position, I just feel like I am going nowhere in my current position and am not advancing my skills or knowledge at a fast enough pace compared to where others think I should be or their expectations of what I can actually do without the assistance of more experienced folks. 

Coming to the end of this year too, I finally was able to admit to myself that at the end of the day, I just dont like the work myself or my team does. And not just in a “oh, this job/work is not exciting so I dont like it” way, but in a “I actually despise the work I have to do & cannot fathom how somebody could want to do this job for their entire career” way. 

Bottom line, ever since starting on this team I have found myself quite miserable most of the time while at work. While there have been some good days and projects I have enjoyed, they are far out numbered by the bad days & projects that make me want to rip my hair out. 

I have made it a goal for myself in 2025 to try and identify a new role within my company that fits more in line with my skills (hands on engineering, testing, people/project management, getting stuff done and knowing how to influence others to do the same, etc). The good news is my company has tons of opportunities and other positions that would allow me to do that type of work, but I’m not sure how I should approach this topic with my current manager. Do I tell her I hate my job and the work we do, do I do the whole “its not you/the team, its me” thing? Do I just silently look in the background for a new position and dont say anything? 

Obviously however I do it I want to be professional about it, but I also really want to get the point across to her that I do not enjoy the work, do not see myself ever enjoying the work/getting good at it, and that my mind is made up about trying to find another position within the company.

Currently in working as a 1099 contractor providing service for the end client with no benefits.The other agency is offering me the same exact position I'm working as of right now except on W2, full benefits such as life, health, 3% 401k match and also I'll be getting a higher payrate with them. 

I had spoken to the Recruiter from there and he really liked my work ethic and all from the current agency and wanted to bring me on over. Had spoke to the client and they were drafting my offer letter. 
Just today, I got notification from my current agency that I was supposed to talk to them first if I wanted to move out from them regardless..

It seems I bad mouthed them, which I hadn't but I was just trying to join with the other agency because of suggestion from my colleagues who were with the agency I was told to join. 

They said I was on grounds for termination and that If it was regarding benefits or pay raise I should have approached them earlier. In addition, according to them,  it's a conflict of interest for me to be working at the same company but with different consulting agency. Once again, since I'm not an employee on W2, rather a 1099 contractor, would this make sense?

All this and I haven't even accepted the offer from the other company yet. It seems like the people im working for right now really don't want to see me leave to another branch and don't seem interested in giving me a raise or benefits from the looks of it.

1hixjsc,Buscando orientación: ¿Qué camino debería tomar?,"

Hola a todos, quiero compartir mi situación y escuchar sus opiniones.

A finales de 2021, se me pasó por la cabeza la idea de vivir del dibujo. Me inspiré viendo anime y leyendo algo de manga, y decidí que quería dedicarme a eso. Sin embargo, por una decisión poco pensada, terminé eligiendo una carrera larga: medicina. Mi plan era estudiar medicina primero y después enfocarme en mi sueño, pero fue un error.

En 2022 comencé a estudiar en la UBA. Repetí el CBC, y este año (2024) logré entrar a FMed, pero me fue muy mal. Desaprobé materias importantes, estuve lleno de dudas y en junio decidí abandonar la carrera. Desde entonces, he estado buscando alternativas como programación, electricidad, enfermería, tatuajes o algún oficio corto, pero ninguna me convenció del todo.

Lo de la programación se me ocurrió porque me gustan los videojuegos y usar la computadora, pero no estoy seguro si podría destacar en algo tan competitivo. Estudié programación por mi cuenta de forma autodidacta, pero lo terminé dejando como en octubre debido a que seguía con dudas.

En noviembre de este año conseguí un trabajo cualquiera, para que 2024 no fuera en vano y para no ser completamente una carga para mis padres. Sin embargo, me despidieron a la semana. Eso me hizo reflexionar sobre lo difícil que es el mundo laboral y buscar opciones más concretas.

Recientemente, descubrí el tatuaje como opción. Me atrae porque está relacionado con el dibujo, pero tengo unas dudas e inquietudes:
1. ¿Es viable económicamente ser tatuador en España (mi padre vive allá y me sugiere estudiar algo práctico para mudarme)?
2. No quiero tatuarme todo el cuerpo, como hacen muchos tatuadores.
3. Me preocupa lidiar con personas bajo el efecto de drogas o tatuadores que las consumen.

Un plan podría ser volverme tatuador y mejorar en el dibujo mientras ejerzo dicho trabajo. Mi segundo plan sería elegir algún oficio o carrera corta y, en paralelo, en mis tiempos libres, estudiar de forma autodidacta el dibujo para poder vivir de ello.

Mi padre no planea apoyarme en alguna carrera de dibujo (como bellas artes) ya que no lo ve rentable, por lo que esa opción queda descartada.

Necesito algo que pague bien, así puedo abastecerme y, quizás en un futuro no muy lejano, poder vivir del dibujo.

¿Qué opinan? ¿Alguien tiene experiencia o consejos sobre qué camino podría tomar? Agradezco mucho cualquier ayuda, y por favor, sin hate. ¡Gracias por leer!",bee_archimonde,0,0.5,0,1734739729,2024-12-21 00:08:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hixjsc/buscando_orientación_qué_camino_debería_tomar/,12,2024
1hixh2x,Am I crazy for expecting a leader ship role vs a lower stress position for close to the same money? ,"
So long story short I applied to a different company and received a job offer for it, the compensation is higher then I thought it would be. 

In the meantime my current employer recently created a lead role/management and they have offered the role to me. 

The total compensation is within a few thousand dollars a year so very similar. 

Both roles are in the same industry. Obviously the lead role comes with a lot more responsibilities. 

One side of me wants the mental challenge of the lead role and to be able to add it to my resume and then one side of me wants to take the easy less stress job but I am worried I will get bored in the role….

I (23f) work in marketing doing social media management and content creation. 

For some reason I just kind of started doing social media stuff for work while in college and kept at it. I went to school for film but got burnt out so I decided to pursue marketing after graduation. 

Honestly, i don’t think i’m good at creative things. I am too much of a perfectionist and with art there is no right or wrong. I also suck at design and i don’t really come up with good content ideas. i am extremely shy and introverted, and it feels like people need me to be the opposite for me to do my job. i also hate how social media affects my mental health and would like to quit it altogether.

but the main thing is that i constantly feel like what i’m doing sucks and it is tiring. 

i’m thinking of having some change in my career but i don’t know what or how?? any tips?

I have seen many hardworking and motivating people advance in their careers and I am happy for them but i always come back to reflect when will be my turn and end up making myself feel bad for not working hard enough.

1hiuoly,How can I transition from a high paying corporate job to entrepreneurship?,"Hello. I (24M) have done well for myself despite dropping out halfway through college. Starting at the bottom after high school, I have poured everything into my career and am currently two years into a demanding operational role in restaurant management. This year, I will have earned $120k and have a clear career advancement strategy that could see me making $500k in a senior-level role by my 30s.

Initially, I loved the demanding work schedule and the intensity of this role, averaging 60-hour work weeks. However, about a year ago, I began to feel an inner conflict that I tried to ignore. Since then, this feeling has intensified to the point where even getting up to go to work feels stifling and mentally draining. I find myself easily frustrated by mundane situations, whereas before, these challenges motivated me.

During the summer, I took a week off due to COVID and used that time to reflect on my values, emotions, and plans for the future. I realized that my frustration stems not from solving problems but from solving someone else’s problems. My strengths lie in strategic agility, execution, relationship building (which has been critical for my career growth and success with guests, vendors, and direct reports), delivering results, and business acumen.

However, I recognize that I have a weakness in decision quality. My impatience sometimes leads to quick decisions without fully balancing priorities or considering long-term implications.

This brings me to a crossroads: my greatest desire is the freedom to build my own vision rather than executing someone else’s. For those who have transitioned from a corporate role to entrepreneurship, what advice would you give me? Specifically, how can I approach this transition strategically and thoughtfully to ensure I’m making well-informed decisions?

1hitqyu,"Offered higher pay externally after just moving horizontally at my current company, worth the risky jump?","Looking for advice:

Background: I recently took a horizontal position at my current company which is a fortune 250 company. No pay raise but it gives me direct reports and site leadership experience overseeing the entire site operations. During the interview process I sold them on the vision I had for the site, the process of getting there is underway but I don’t expect us to get there fully for 6-12 months. The position and company is stable, I make roughly $150k/year USD, benefits are okay, commute is 60-120minutes each way per day which is the main downside.

A recruiter reached out the other day about a position in a different state, I told them I didn’t know anyone out that way but if down the road they hear of anything in my area be sure to reach out.

Sure enough, there was one he had open 30 minutes from me. In a very similar industry, not exactly the same. I explained I would like to complete what I set out to do at my current company before really being open but would at least hear them out and use it as a way to gain another connection in the industry.

I interviewed with them today, they seemed to like me, and a lot of their issues are the same ones I’m working through at my current company. The company is smaller so less development opportunities and not sold on the workforce (they bought the company a few years ago and previous employees still work there and are set in their old ways). 

Pros: commute, salary ($200k+) a jump that large is the main reason I’m even considering

Cons: smaller company, less secure position, not sure of how their current workforce is and how well they would be open to change, my current team is great but still have to push them on change. In my industry a lot of these smaller company’s get bought up by larger companies, I’m sure that’ll happen sooner than later which concerns me about longevity of the position. The CEO who I interviewed with is sort of known for the moves. But he also said when he does he usually has his main team/performers stick with him in future moves. But I would also sort of leave on bad terms with my current company since they just hired me for the new position which wouldn’t be ideal if I ever needed a new job due to how much of the market they own.

If my current position was closer to where I live I probably wouldn’t even have taken the interview since I like my team and company but the commute is draining. I can’t move closer since I just bought the house a little under a year ago and need to be close to the area for personal reasons. Even though the companies are similar in what products they produce, the one I am in know I have a little more passion for.

Am I crazy for even considering it? Am I crazy for not considering even with a large salary and commute improvement?

1hitg3o,Current supervisor reference?,"I just completed a two-round interview process and am now being asked for 2-3 references. One thing that strikes me as odd is their specific request to speak with my current supervisor. I’ve never been asked for this specifically before.

I’m a bit flummoxed because first of all, I haven’t decided if I want to take the job if offered, and this would put me in a bind since my current supervisor obviously isn’t aware of me interviewing for other positions, and it would make it hard to keep working there if I decide to stay.

Secondly, it would seem to create an opportunity for him to give me a bad review out of spite if he’s upset be my leaving. I don’t mean to seem egotistical: I’m not exactly irreplaceable, but not easily or immediately replaceable since I’m in a rather niche field. I am probably overthinking this. 

In case it is relevant: I’m being considered for a staff position in a different department at the same university so the insistence on references seems a bit excessive. All this being said, I have never had any disciplinary issues or professional problems so I’m not worried about that aspect. 

I already asked some friends, none of whom are managers, and some said to try to suggest a different reference. Or to insist on an offer first.

1hit706,Inclined but not hired???,"I’m in a bit of a tricky situation and could use some advice. I recently went through a job interview process at Amazon for a Program Manager role, and I received positive feedback from the team—they are inclined to hire me. However, I just got an email from the recruiter saying:

*""While still inclined, the team is not prepared to send out an offer quite yet as the role may be shifting to a different capacity. I understand the urgency and certainly do want to help you where I can. The team will be meeting to discuss this next month so if an offer is made, it would be towards later Jan.

We will also be looking at openings from neighboring teams to see if there are any good matches.""*

1. What does it mean when a role may be “shifting to a different capacity”?
2. Should I be concerned about the delay?

1hirili,Help me make a job switch decision,"I just got a job offer and I'm wondering if I should take it. I work in IT/software and have around 10 years of overall experience. I've been in this US state for almost 8 years and don't want to move since I have my life here and my young child is settled here.


My current job is with an IT consulting giant, fully remote and production support oriented. It has 10% conditional annual bonus, 4% 401k match and 15 PTO days.  
Cons: i don't like the lack of ownership; multiple levels of bosses;  next project could be out of state or fully in office, so might be forced to move or quit; occasional weekend shifts; sometimes being fully remote is isolating
Pros: good pay, great work life balance due to being remote, more job security since they still pay me on bench between projects.


New job offer:
The job offer is only a 2% increase in base salary, 8% conditional annual bonus, 8% 401k match! and 25 PTO days.
It is with a well known local big employer and I would have more ownership at work.  
Cons: hybrid-3 days in office, over an hour drive one way; more work responsibility; no bench, if I'm fired I'm out.
Pros: more interesting work; will always be in this state


Should I make the lateral switch with the hope that it will be better for my career? It's potentially a net zero salary increase if I factor in the commute and time costs. But the work would be better since I wouldn't just be a disposable consultant.

1hiqyf9,Top Learnings from 5 Careers in 10 years ,"What all I learnt from 5 career transitions in the last 10 years?

Not all dreams are meant to be chased forever. Sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is let go of one dream to make space for another & yet another.

I began my career as an engineer, thinking I had my path set. But over time, I realized success isn’t a straight line—it’s about adapting to your passions and purpose. Here’s how 5 career transitions reshaped not just my journey but also my definition of success & achievement.

1. Engineer at Samsung → Social Worker at Teach For India

My role at Samsung was exciting, well paid & offered good stability. However, corporate stability felt hollow, so I joined Teach For India to create an impact. Teaching underserved students gave me a purpose like never before.

Key Learning: Success isn’t about paychecks; it’s about purpose.

2. Social Worker → YouTube Content Creator

I was growing & helping the entire community to grow as a social worker & teacher. However, my impact was limited to physical interactions in real world. Therefore, I started a YouTube channel to share thoughts on growth and public policy with a wider audience online. A small side project grew into a platform with 20,000 followers, showing me the power of storytelling.

Key Learning: Every passion deserves a chance—you never know where it will lead.

3. YouTube Creator → UPSC IFS Aspirant

Driven by governance, I pursued the UPSC exams. Though I didn’t achieve my goal of becoming an IFS(Diplomat), the journey taught me discipline and reignited my interest in public policy.

Key Learning: Even when you don’t succeed, the process can shape your future.

4. UPSC IFS Aspirant → UPSC Enforcement Officer

Joining Government of India allowed me to experience policymaking firsthand. While impactful, the role lacked the creativity I craved.

Key Learning: Every role is a stepping stone, even if it isn’t perfect.

5. Enforcement Officer → AI Researcher

Today, as a PhD candidate studying AI bias in public policy, I’m exploring how technology and governance intersect. My research bridges ethical AI and equitable governance.

Key Learning: To stay relevant, evolve and embrace new fields. Even Darwin & Einstein used to say that flexibility & adaptability are key markers of human intelligence.

What I’ve learned overall:  Success isn’t linear—it’s deeply personal. It’s about letting go of societal expectations, stepping into uncertainty, and aligning work with passion and vision.

Are you chasing a dream because it’s truly yours—or because others expect it? Let me know: Have you ever pivoted to redefine success? How did you redefine achievement for yourself?",2curiousChef,0,0.5,1,1734721151,2024-12-20 18:59:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hiqyf9/top_learnings_from_5_careers_in_10_years/,12,2024

And the fact that i have to violate a client and ask them to bread their legs and let me wax their hoohah while a giant camera is sitting there filming is completely against my moral, nobody would be comfortable with that. 
Its so strict to the point of if i dont clean my room down to the tiniest particle of dust they make me stay longer to make sure its perfect. Whoch yes i under cleanslyness but there was literally a dust particle on the bed and she made me reclean it all over again, i usually have to stay and extra 45 mins after my shift to clean. AND they have me working ten hour shifts 3 times a week which are technically 11 hours because of the cleaning. 
We get zero commission on services, i did 22 Brazilian waxes today and only make tips off of it. 
And like i said in the beginning im a facial specialist yet ive only done 1 facial since being there they have me doing so many waxings and i hate waxing.
My boss cant even give us new products we have zero skincare products everything is empty yet shes making so much money off of us working for her.
My boss is so greedy and so unrealistic in what she wants from us. I cant keep up. 

THE POINT SYSTEMS FOR THE PRODUCTS SOLD AND VIDEOS/PICTURSS ARE PER WEEK

Is this a fair work environment and im just not fit for the pace or is she really just a bad boss.

1hiq9eq,How can I move forward after I was fired with a false accusation?,"The day before Thanksgiving, I (20sF) was suddenly fired from my job that I loved (and desperately needed) after my boss accused me of attempted fraud. I had made a $130 mistake on my expense report after a work trip, and thought everything was acknowledged and corrected, but my manager decided my reaction to initially learning my mistake was “weird” and not serious enough, which meant I was hiding something (I have the full story on my profile if anyone cares.) I am certainly not a thief, but I was so stunned & horrified that I barely said anything in my defense- not that it mattered, she (my boss) looked like she was about to spit on me and couldn’t fire me fast enough. 

I only worked there for 11 months, but I desperately needed this job to build some stability on my resume, because I’ve had bad luck with jobs:

-Job 1: 8 months. 
Worked for a startup during grad school. My role ballooned into a much bigger scope of work after the company went through explosive growth. Became way more than I signed up for & I resigned to prioritize school- I was working until 4am sometimes then had 9am class. 

-Job 2: 8 months.
First post-grad job. Laid off after a department restructuring.

-Job 3: 7 months.
Fled from a toxic, snide boss. I became legitimately scared to even speak to her & my nerves made me make a lot of mistakes. 

-Job 4: 11 months.
Suddenly fired after a horrible misunderstanding. I would’ve stayed there for 4-5 years & thought I’d finally found a steady job- something all my friends seem to have with no issues. 

I’ve now had 4 jobs in 3 years. I know my work history looks horrible & makes me look like a job hopper or someone who can’t keep a job (which I apparently can’t do anyways.) That, coupled with me being unemployed, are two huge hurdles in finding a new job. 

I feel like an empty, broken shell. It’s been 3 weeks and I still cry every few days. I’m not mentally/emotionally ready for interviews again, but if I can get any next year, how on Earth do I explain this in relation to my other short tenures, when I’m inevitably asked about it? Do I lie and say I was laid off again? Do I try to be honest? Any advice would be hugely appreciated.

1hiq49e,To leave or not to leave? ,"I started my new career almost a handful of years ago and was fortunate to find a job that I loved. Unfortunately, there had been a few restructures in the company and I ended up going through a few management changes that lead me to be very unhappy. The company itself was also struggling and making some not great choices so I started looking elsewhere. I ended up getting a new job that had a significant pay bump so I took it. The job was supposed to be similar to what I was doing, which u was excited about, with a company that seemed to be a great company. Unfortunately, pretty early on, I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped. I ended up sticking it out for 11 months before accepting an offer for my current job. Now, my current job isn't as bad as the previous job which was extremely toxic and stressful, but it honestly isn't the best nor what I really want to be doing. My manager is a severe micro manager, the company culture isn't great, since safety concerns I've brought up have been ignored, and upper management can't agree so my work suffers from that. I've been here for about 7 months and I'm trying to stick it out until my one year to see if it gets better but I'm honestly just struggling. I don't dread being here but it definitely drains me. 

I'm trying to decide my best path forward, part of me thinks life is too short to be miserable so I should just look for a new job but the other part of me is scared of ending up in another similar situation. 

Sometimes I think about going back to my old company, if they'll take me back. They have a few positions that I'm qualified for, to though it won't be my old job which kind of sucks. But then I wonder if that's a good idea since I did have reasons why I left. But I still keep in touch with old coworkers and I think that has to say something about my time there, I definitely mourn it. 

Then I wonder about job hunting in general - should I possibly try a different job position? How to I properly vet companies so I don't keep ending up in situations like this? 

Any advice would be helpful. I just want to enjoy work again since I'm stuck working for a long, long time 😭",greenfairee,1,1.0,2,1734718879,2024-12-20 18:21:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hiq49e/to_leave_or_not_to_leave/,12,2024

1hipp4x,Is it all over?,"**--TLDR--**

I graduated with a 4.0 GPA in IT in 2023 but spent the last year on a failed business venture, gaining some business-related experience while burning bridges with my network. I struggle with technical work, didn’t gain practical skills from my degree, and have no internships, certifications, or job experience. I’m building a basic portfolio with ChatGPT and can’t use past leadership roles due to lack of references. I’m feeling stuck, unsure about my options, and looking for guidance on non-technical IT roles, improving my portfolio, and what salary to expect with just my degree.

**--FULL QUESTION--**

So, I graduated with a 4.0 GPA in IT in May 2023 but spent the last year on a failed business venture. During that time, until fairly recently, I met influential people, learned about marketing, product design (not the technical side), legal, business management, and discovered that product design takes more patience than I have. I also burned bridges with that network, so now I’m starting fresh.

I’ve never wanted a traditional job because I struggle with technical work. I haven’t passed a test without cheating since 2021. I feel like I got nothing out of my technical degree, no real skills to show for it. My YouTube feed is full of business and marketing content, which I enjoy, but I can’t stand technical videos about coding or databases, it just doesn’t click.

I have no internships, certifications, or job experience, just my degree. I have connections but I'm waiting to use them as a last resort. I’m currently building a portfolio website to showcase GitHub projects made with ChatGPT. In university, I excelled in leadership roles and was even awarded for it, but those experiences were tied to the network I fell out with, so I can’t even use them on my resume because I lack references.

The main reason I’m making this post is to ask:

1. **What can I actually put on my resume** to make myself look employable, given my limited experience?
2. **How can I realistically prepare for and pass an interview**, especially for roles where I’ll likely be asked technical questions?

Additional questions:

* Are there entry-level IT or project management roles that prioritize soft skills and leadership over technical abilities?
* What salary range should I expect with just a degree and no additional qualifications?
* Are there certifications or career paths in IT that don’t demand deep technical skills but still have potential for growth?

I feel like I’ve screwed myself and should just give up on aiming for a high-paying job, settling for mediocrity or unemployment. At this point, my degree feels about as useful as toilet paper. I’m feeling lost and need guidance.

\--

I apologize if that seemed like a rant, but I tried to make it sound as professional as possible.

The question still remains:

1hioxwk,My first 6 month review at my new job,"Hey everyone, 

My first 6 month review is coming up and I wanted some advice on how to approach “upward feedback”. I’ve never had a manager prioritize this before so I’m a little unsure of what to say. 

I feel I do my job pretty well, but I will say there are times where I feel action items are not completely clear to me, or I don’t understand my next task fully. I work in a very fast paced environment where needs change quickly. I try to gather as much information as I can to do my job the best. I do feel my manager gets a bit frustrated when I ask questions, and tells me I need to OWN the project instead. 

How can I word this as “upward feedback”? It’s a little awkward to tell my manager what I think they can do better, but I appreciate their approach here. I’m sure there will be a lot of feedback about me coming up.

1hiop48,"Mixed Past, Can’t Picture the Future.","Excuse the dramatic title.

I have worked customer facing jobs the majority of my adult life from pizza delivery, to fitness, to retail electronics, some light technician work, and now retail sales again, all while operating a side hustle doing various digital design/illustration projects from time to time as it’s always been a hobby. Very hard to imagine my next step.
 
I was tired of nearly a decade of retail sales a few years ago and managed to switch in to working for Best Buy’s “Geek Squad”. I enjoyed fixing minor PC issues, replacing the odd part here and there, and installing audio/video and networking equipment. I loved being able to make people happy with a fix/solution for their needs. I was doing well at the job but was not being paid well. I sought a company that did higher end installs; more knowledge, more training, the “big leagues” as far as I was concerned. I failed miserably; I am prone to injury due to a muscular/skeletal condition and that work was far too much for me. Apart from a lack of knowledge and experience, physically I would not have lasted and was let go. I ended up in commission sales in the rebound and haven’t found a path forward since. Pay is up and down as retail commission goes, and I don’t feel like the people in my environment are my people, if that makes sense. 

I have a family and working evenings and weekends again is taxing on us. I don’t have much to my name education-wise besides a community college certificate and a Comptia A+. School full-time is out of the question if rent and bills are to be paid… but I feel I need better education as I’m not qualified for the majority of job listings out there in the wild, and the ones I’m qualified for are not calling back. I don’t know how to look for the next step.

1himmjr,22M Student NJ,"Hello everyone,

I hope you guys have all had a great week and a great start to the holidays. 

I’m currently a college student at MSU and I’m in my 4th attending year. My major is Data Science, but I don’t believe it’s what I want to do anymore because I can’t keep up with the coursework and I’m losing interest in it fast. 

As far as my grades, I have pretty much been failing or getting really low grades for the last 3 to 4 semesters. The first 3 or 4 semesters, I was very strong and confident, however it’s the complete opposite now.

I want to stop pursuing data science and transition somewhere into the healthcare industry. The pay isn’t an issue for me. I just want to genuinely help people and I’ve seen that more and more as I’ve been working part time at a rehab facility as a front desk receptionist. I love the environment, I love the people, and I love what they do for others.

I guess my question is, is it too late to pursue something in the healthcare industry? My GPA and course history in my current university is terrible and I see myself most likely dropping out either this semester or the next. Can I get into any health career program? Will I be able to use my high school stats again or do I have to use my current college stats? I would prefer somewhere in NJ, but location isn’t a big deal either for me. I’m willing to move away from my current area. I want to be in my own for once since I have never experience life without my parents. 

TLDR: I was strong and confident in my first few semester, but I’m failing the last few semesters now and losing motivation quickly for my major. What are my options to transition into the healthcare industry as NJ student.

In my case, I met a sales prospect through an industry event that I organize, and we've become friends.  A coworker organizes another industry event, and he asked if I knew anyone who he could invite to the event (and he invited me, too).  Our company pays for that event.

I let my coworker know that I had an existing sales lead who I would invite, and gave the event details to my sales prospect, and my sales prospect went and liked it.  Now my coworker contacted the sales prospect directly, trying to lure the sales prospect- who I've been trying to onboard for months-to become his own sales lead.

I find it shocking that a coworker would do that, but my coworker has that reputation, and I stupidly didn't think that he would love in on a sales lead who I had identified as mine.  At least my coworker leaves his office door open and has calls on speakerphone, so I heard him talking to my sales lead.  I marched in and reminded him that the contact is my sales lead, so the problem is solved. But I'm still shocked.

1hil8sz,Do I tell my boss I got a job offer (i didnt interview for) even though I dont plan on leaving?,"So I’ve been at this job for a year. Im committed to the team and dont intend on leaving for another year. My current boss told me a promotion doesnt look likely in the next year because of how the company is approaching promotions. My boss really values my career growth and said they want to help me look for roles on other teams in the company.

My stance is: i like this team, I want to stay here. IF I leave this team, I’m just going to leave the company altogether. 

The problem is my boss seems convinced I’m ready to check out of our team and wants to help me look for new roles. Should I tell them I already received an offer (from a former manager of mine at a startup with a new team)? It was a good offer, but I had no intention of leaving my current team so quickly as I genuinely enjoy the work I’m doing here and the people I work with. I didn’t even interview. Former manager is just building a team from scratch and said its mine if i want it.

Honestly, the point is: I kind of want to let them know I’m committed. This might be reverse psychology because we’ve lost a lot of amazing colleagues due to not being promoted within 2-3 years. I could be stupid.

However, Carnegie Melon does not have finance or accounting as a bachelors but has Business Administration and I can chose a concentration in either finance or accounting. I can also do a minor at the same time in financial management. Will this keep the same doors open for me as a finance/ accounting degree?

1hikcp5,Discussing side business with employer,"I have a 9-5 W2 office/WFH job.  I also have a side business running a small e-commerce operation, which I do in my free time.  I don't think it interferes with my day job work, but it is a full blown business.

My work has a formal policy that you must inform HR/manager of any other employment/jobs.  And an informal policy that they'll probably terminate you if they find that you are doing this.  So, I've just been keeping this business private.

There are a couple avenues for them to figure out that I'm doing this though, one is the fact that LLC's are public information and the second is that I get a lot of deliveries to my home so all the local delivery people in my small town are clear that I'm running a business.

Last few months at work have been unproductive for reasons unrelated to this, and as a result HR/manager has been giving me increased scrutiny, and I believe they might have become aware of this business... So I'm just getting my ducks in a row and preparing in case they sit me down and start asking questions.  If that happens, what should I say?  

One option is to just completely deny everything, invent an excuse for having an LLC (""I needed an EIN to get a credit card"") and move on.  Another is to acknowledge it but portray it as a very small hobby, like ""Yeah I flip playstations and sell a few things on ebay here and there"" or something.

1hihe2p,I don’t really understand jobs,"Ever since I (26M) was 18 I’ve been busy with other areas in my life like love or hobbies and spent all my 20s until now living with my parents and being somewhat functionally depressed. I tried getting hired at basic jobs like cashier and I successfully got hired at two restaurants. If you put my whole CV together I’ve worked for a month in my entire life or maybe even less. I’ve never had an interest for anything college related. So now all I do is sell clothes online and that makes me like 500€ a month while I still live with my parents and try to maybe grow the business. Most of the time I feel dumb seeing other people I went to school with getting real jobs and doing real people things. But every time I had the opportunity to do the same I felt awfully bad like that life wasn’t fulfilling for me. I’m not interested in dating anymore or having children or living alone away from my parents or having friends so what’s the point in even performing and becoming someone I’m not. Yes this route is kinda depressing, but so are the rest. I had a partner for 5 years and after we broke up she moved to two different countries in less than 3 years, made money, dated other people and thrived. I, on the other side, have been going downhill in the social path. Sometimes I feel dumb. Like I’m not meant to live this life. I barely understand jobs and I don’t have much interest when people talk about degrees and stuff like that. I also worked as a freelance tarot reader but after a while I lost interest and felt like an imposter.

1higui0,Unsure what route to take in next step in career.,"To give context, I'm 21 and have been working in different analytical roles since I was 16. From the UK, didn't do A levels and instead did an apprenticeship in Data Analysis at a Level 4, which I believe is equivalent to the first year of a undergrad. I then continued to work from 18 once it was completed instead of going to uni.  

I've worked in 3 different roles, the first role with my apprenticeship I was at for around 2 1/2 years, then moved to another role as a business analyst for 1 /12 years and now been in my current role for a year. I'm not very happy in my current role as it's quite easy and not very challenging, the work I am able to do very quickly and easy. I know I'm fortunate to have a fairly straightforward job but I've always wanted to do work that is challenging and learn from other people who are more knowledgeable than me to develop and I don't think I'm currently doing that.

The problem I have is that when I do apply for these roles that would be more advanced and require skills that I might have but don't necessarily have work experience doing, I don't tend to hear back from them. I feel it is because, even though, I have experience and I am confident that I could succeed in those roles as I am good at what I do, the work experience I have is probably more basic and doesn't show properly the skills and knowledge that I have. Also, a lot of these roles say they require a degree, I don't have one.

I'm in the mindset where I think I should do a part time degree while working as it would be more beneficial to my career but also is something I am interested in and can learn more of those technical skills. I feel my two routes are either to continue to apply for those jobs I'm interested in until I might find one and go with that or stick in my current job and do the degree which would then enable more opportunities to open for me down the line. 

The reason I say I would stay in my current role if I was to do the degree is that I currently work remotely full time so would allow me much more time to focus on the degree, whereas at a new job I may be more likely to go into the office more and would restrict the time I could spend on it.

  
I was wondering what others thought on my options and might be the best step to take as I'm unsure, I do feel a degree would be beneficial but as I would do it part time it would take multiple years to complete and then I would be stuck in my current role and not sure if that would then just further restrict me too?",SBG-Ryan,1,1.0,0,1734689887,2024-12-20 10:18:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1higui0/unsure_what_route_to_take_in_next_step_in_career/,12,2024

A year ago, the MD offered me a Business Development role with promises of close collaboration, development, and a significant raise.

However, I've always felt drawn to mechanical design. My past aptitude for physics, in which I excelled, reinforced this. Believing I'd find greater success and fulfillment in mechanical design, I humbly declined the Business Development offer and instead requested for a chance in the product design department. The MD said he'd see what he could do.

Since then, nothing has changed. I'm now stuck in my current role with limited growth prospects and a strong desire for more. I'm hesitant to approach the MD again, fearing a negative response or even job termination.

1hidmbu,BSBA in Marketing. What do you do now?,"25F w/ a baking and pastry associates may ‘19 and BSBA in Marketing dec ‘23

I had to pick a bachelors degree and I thought I would enjoy marketing. While taking the core classes and working on multiple projects, I do not enjoy it, but it did occupy me and got them done on time. The only class I can remember and that I enjoyed was MIS 300. Working with Microsoft Access was quite confusing but I passed the projects. Working with Tableau thought was very interesting and fun. The professor was very goofy and he made it very understandable, he also opened up discussion boards for each project so the class can help each other and the professor can chime in. I also joined a tableau discord server to seek help but I’m still in it though I haven’t touched tableau ( the program was only available during the semester I took it) 

Right now, I’m doing nothing with my bachelors degree and I guess I’m still behind with work experience. I used to be very sheltered and started my first job at 19 at a retail cupcake shop, receptionist for my brothers nail salon at 21, nanny at 22-24, and lastly a bakery/deli clerk at 25 for 5mo. I know there unemployment gaps and look like I’m job hopping.. life happens. 
I like my growth in confidence and talking to people over the years but not so much in talking to higher up people. I’m still growing but right now I’m rotting and unable to push myself to apply to the simplest jobs out there. Im also looking back at my MIS 300 folder and thinking to myself that I could’ve really pursued studying and getting a job working with Tableau, but at the same time, I don’t know.

I would like to know what you do now whether or not it aligns with your degree and if you have any advice for me. I know my mindset is junk right now and I’m seeking for help. :) thank you.

1hidck3,Need Career Advice: Deloitte (Takeda GCC) vs HighRadius ?,"I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could use your advice! I'm in talks for two job offers, I am currently an analyst with 3years of experience, from Hyderabad :

1. Deloitte (ServiceNow Business Analyst) – It’s a role for their client, Takeda Pharmaceuticals’ new GCC in Bangalore. After 2–3 months of training with Deloitte, I’ll transition to Takeda full-time. There’s a one-year bond and this is at their GCC in India
2. HighRadius (Associate Consultant 2) – It’s a FinTech role in Hyderabad offering ₹8 LPA fixed, which is just a 23% hike from my current package. While I like the role, I feel I deserve more compensation based on my skills and experience.

I’m leaning toward Deloitte because of the brand and the healthcare domain exposure, but HighRadius has no bond and keeps me in Hyderabad. Both have pros and cons and the timelines are tight

(HighRadius wants me to join in late December that's next week, while Deloitte’s offer process is ongoing).

What would you do in my situation? Should I negotiate with HighRadius for a better package? Is the one-year bond with Deloitte worth it?

1hicz9d,Help Me Decide: M.Tech at IIT vs Job + Experience vs MS Abroad? ,"Hi everyone, I'm a final-year B-Tech student in Computer Science Engineering from a tier-3 college. I’m passionate about pursuing a career in areas like Data Science, Maths, CS Core, or STEM fields like Quant Finance or Data Science for Astronomy. I’m keen on roles that aren't monotonous, like a typical MERN developer.

Here’s my situation:

* GATE CS Performance: In my 3rd year, I cleared GATE 2024 with a 621 score. I’m appearing again in 2025 to improve it.
* Job Offer: I’ve been selected for TCS Prime (9–10 LPA) with 12 months bond (training period) + 3 months notice period. I also reached the second round of Oracle Communination’s recruitment process, but unfortunately didn’t make it past that stage.
* Long-term Dream: I want to pursue an M-Tech from IIT Delhi (especially since I had a JEE Advanced rank of 10785 but skipped IIT back then as I got Civil Engineering). Post M-Tech, I aim to work in my desired fields or move abroad for further opportunities.
* Family's Perspective: My parents are pressuring me to join the job, gain at least 1 year of experience, and then do my masters.

I’m torn between three options:

1. Join M-Tech at IIT right after GATE 2025 results and skip the job.
2. Join the job, gain 1 year of experience, use the time to further improve my GATE score if needed, and then pursue M-Tech at IIT.
3. Take the job, gain experience, and aim for an MS abroad in my dream field instead of M-Tech.

I’m conflicted because I truly want to experience IIT and feel it would be a great launchpad for my future aspirations. However, the idea of gaining experience and exploring MS abroad also seems appealing.

What would you suggest? Should I directly go for M-Tech or balance experience and education through a different route?

1hic9cu,Has Anyone Else Been Passed Over for a Role Despite Positive Reviews?,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share my situation and hear from others who might have experienced something similar.

I’ve been with my company for about two years. Earlier this year, I applied for a senior position within my team under the same manager but for a slightly different role. My current manager was the hiring manager for this position. After the interview, he asked if I really wanted the job. I was honest and said that while I was primarily seeking the promotion, I believed I could do well in the role because I liked both the job I currently have and the one I applied for. In the end, I wasn’t selected for the role.

Recently, I applied for another senior position within the same team, but this time with a different manager. This role was something I was genuinely excited about and had lots of experience in from my previous company, even though it’s not directly related to what I’m doing now. Unfortunately, I wasn’t selected for this position either.

For context, I’ve had great annual reviews and received lots of positive feedback from other managers and directors about my performance and contributions. I’ve even had some leaders from other areas of the organization ask me to lead projects in their realms, which makes these decisions feel even more puzzling.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation where, despite positive feedback and strong reviews, they weren’t selected for internal opportunities? How did you handle it, and what steps did you take to move forward?

I’d really appreciate any advice or shared experiences. Thanks in advance!",RoundBed7390,2,1.0,0,1734670349,2024-12-20 04:52:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hic9cu/has_anyone_else_been_passed_over_for_a_role/,12,2024
1hic6uh,Asked not to tell colleagues that my employment is being terminated -- what should I do?,"My last working day at the company I work at is tomorrow and I want to make an announcement to my team that I'm leaving the company and the circumstances behind my departure. When I asked my boss if that's OK, he said that the company asks that I do not announce this. Should I tell them anyways? I feel it is important to leave on a positive note with the company and my colleagues and I don't want to burn bridges.

Context (probably not so important): 

I have started working at a certain company I don’t want to name in March. It is a sales-like role. I have usually achieved 50-60% of the target each month. 

In early July, I was placed on a one month Performance Improvement Plan with the company stating that their desire is that I achieve 100% of the target each month. I failed that Performance Improvement Plan. 

In early August, I was placed on another Performance Improvement Plan. I failed that one too.

In late August, I had a meeting with the team's vice president. She told me that ""from the company standpoint, it is not very stable to see that there are ups and downs in your performance"" and that ""I [the team vice president] am here today to discuss whether you want to pursue the further career in [the company whose name I don't feel comfortable disclosing] or move on to another role and move to another company because you have already tried for six months."" I repeatedly told her that I'm not interested in leaving the company, and she told me that ""this is not a primary school fight"".

A couple days later, I had a meeting with my manager where I asked him if the company is asking me to resign and if they will fire me if I choose not to resign. He told me that ""I think there is a misunderstanding on your part. First of all, the company does not ask employees to resign and will not fire [dismissal] you unless there is some kind of massive violation of the company rules like if you embezzle money. Given your performance, we would just like to give you an opportunity to reevaluate if this job is in alignment with your personal skills, talents and future plans.""

In early September, I joined a labor union. After I discussed with him, my labor union representative sent a letter to the company asking them to not ask me to resign and to cease any acts of workplace harassment.

After two months, in early November, the company's legal representative responded with a request for a meeting. We met in mid-November and the company's legal representative told me and my union representative that the company would like to make a proposal for my departure. My union representative asked the company's legal representative to send details by email. In late November, we received an email where the company informed me that they are, in fact, asking me to resign and they proposed that I have my employment terminated by mutual agreement in exchange for six months' severance pay. (I felt a little disappointed because the fact that the company wants me to resign came as a surprise to me given my conversations with my manager.)

I told my union representative that I would not leave the company for six months' severance, that it would have to be at least ten months' severance pay for me to leave. In early December, we had another meeting with the company's legal representative where we proposed ten months' severance pay.

Finally, in mid-December, the company's legal representative responded to us that they agreed to our proposal and that upon our final confirmation in writing, my employment would end on 12-31. 

On 12-18 (my second to last working day), I asked my manager if I could call him and he told me that he's really busy so he can't talk over the phone. I messaged him asking if the company objects to me sharing the news of my departure to the entire team, and he said that ""given the nature of my employment termination because it is a mutual termination instead of a self-resignation, we're sorry, but [the company] kindly requests that [you] do not tell other members that [you] will be leaving the company tomorrow"". I told him that ""I'd like to make sure that the projects will be able to go on smoothly without me telling any colleagues that I'm leaving. Are you sure this is OK?"". He replied ""Yes, we will inform those who need to know. We don't need you to tell anyone, and we kindly ask that you don't tell anyone. Thank you for your understanding.""

[Note: I wrote this post post-facto. I decided to tell each colleague through a direct message to express my thanks and share my contact details without telling them directly that I'm leaving because of a mutual agreement due to poor performance. I'd like to gain perspective on what you think I should have done.]",naoyao,0,0.33000001311302185,7,1734670108,2024-12-20 04:48:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hic6uh/asked_not_to_tell_colleagues_that_my_employment/,12,2024

1hibkab,I’m not sure if I should take this job — will be unhappy,"I'm in final rounds for a Senior SEO Copywriter role. I didn’t formally apply — a recruiter found me. I previously worked for this company’s direct competitor.

I have very limited SEO knowledge and they're looking for a ""unicorn"" that does that and copywriting. I think they're overlooking my lack of SEO skills because of my experience with their competitor. I have been upfront that my knowledge is limited, and that doesn't seem to deter them. But here's the thing: they're looking for someone who has an opinion about SEO and can serve as an expert for the team. SEO is not a skill you can learn overnight. Every role I’ve had has a dedicated SEO point person I've worked with. 

The clincher: I have now been unemployed for 11 months (mass tech layoff in Jan 2024). It's been such a tough (and outrightly depressing) year. I've had lots of good traction last month. I was in the final round for 2 jobs, but ultimately didn't get either.

This is not about ""imposter syndrome"" — I straight up don't have the skills they are looking for. I hate the thought of starting out a job that way and struggling to do my work because I’m learning how to do half of it on the fly.Compensation for the role is low (the other jobs I was in final rounds were had a delta of 20-30K and 70K more). I'm thinking in another month or two I could get a job I really want. I could take the offer, delay the start date as much as possible, and work til I find something better — but then there's burning a bridge with this company and then trying to explain to NEW recruiters why I'm looking to leave my current job. I could also just leave it off my resume, but then it may show up on my background check.

So I’m torn:
1. Take the job (if I even get it), delay the start as much as possible, and keep looking.
2. Hold out for a role I’m genuinely excited about.
What would you do?

1hia6d3,Manager won’t let me quit,"Basically the title, I just need some advice here. 

I recently got a new job and put in my two weeks at my old job. At first my old manager didn’t seem to have any issue with it, she said she was sorry I was leaving and confirmed my last day with me. Then a few days later she pulled me aside and asked if I’d be willing to still work one day a week or super part time. I felt a little pressured in the moment and she wanted an answer from me right away, I told her I’d have to see what my schedule is like and what I can do. I tried to make it clear in that moment that I wasn’t committing to anything, because I had applied for my new job with the intention of quitting my old job completely. After starting my new job my old manager texted me almost every day for a week asking how it was going and what day I’d be available for her. For a few days I didn’t respond because at that point I still didn’t know my schedule. When I finally did respond she sent me a list of days/shifts that needed coverage and asked what I could give her, I told her my training is during most of those times and that I couldn’t commit to anything. 
Eventually I texted her back and told her that I won’t be able to work for her anymore, she responded and told me she would just put me on as a seasonal employee until I decided what I wanted to do. This has just confused me so much because at that point I had straight up told her at least twice that I was quitting. Now she’s texted me again today asking if I’m available this weekend. I genuinely don’t understand why she won’t let me just quit. 

Anyway, I just don’t know what exactly to do. Should I just leave it or do I need to make sure I’ve officially left that job? Would it be bad if I’m still technically an employee there?

I am currently in charge of a department of 6 people, and have a ton of autonomy/flexible schedule, and work remotely. My job is also pretty secure, and if I stayed, I’d probably be put on the leadership team in the next couple of years. However, the workload is extremely demanding, and I am pretty wildly underpaid compared to my responsibilities. We get a COLA each year, but merit raises are few and far between. In addition, if I was put on the leadership team, I doubt I would get more than a 4% raise. 

Current benefits: $100k/year with variable bonus ($10k this year); 5 weeks vacation

New Offer: 128k/year with 6% annual bonus and better medical benefits; 4 weeks vacation 

New role would be fully remote, but much more corporate. Probably would be a bit less flexible in schedule. Would be an 8-5 vs a 9-5.

I also have an infant, so flexibility is super important to me right now. But the increased pay is nothing to sneeze at.

I work as a manager at a day program for special needs adults. It’s a pretty stressful environment; keeping up with the individual’s needs, staff that doesn’t want to be there, and lots of paperwork. 

I decided to go back to school to be a rad tech, I already have a Bachelor’s degree in psychology, but I feel lost in this field.

1hi7ps9,OT Error?,"I work in Career Services, remotely. I prepare my own billing forms to each client I perform services for which my company bills at a much higher rate to the referring agency, or non billable billing forms to the company for ""overhead"" ... ie training, responding to co worker emails.

Policy states we must request OT in advance..

I was letting my boss know each week previously when I had OT but she had said OT was fine, as long as I met the required billable percentages. (80% or more of time spent) average Averaged per quarter. I track this and always make the goal.

This last pay period I noticed I was not paid for 8 hrs OT.

Week 1: 7 day period 16 hrs holiday 10 hrs work

Week 2: 7 day period 48 hours of work

Vacation request: 6 hours (to make two week period 80)

I brought this missing OT up to manager- she said I had not asked for prior approval as the policy states...

Still not sure what they will do but now HR is involved.

My guess is manager has been miscalculating and incorrectly submitting payroll in the past, another co-worker said they were missing OT pay the same as I was but did not bring it up.

Is my company allowed to calculate OT over a two week, 80 hrs pay period?

We were told at hire by previous HR that it is better to look at our time as 80 hrs over 2 weeks due to the fluctuating schedule/demamds.

Should I have just not said anything?

I'm worried I have ruined the OT flexibility I had before, although the work I do generally necessitates overtime- as we are required to document, ie billable for things within 24 hours- and things happen with clients that I cannot predict (they call me) on a daily basis.

I feel like it's an impossible situation to know ahead of time if I will be in OT or how much each week.

Ps. I'm Also burned out already by the inability to use vacation time and randomly changing unpredictable billing/ schedule.

1hi7fxi,"Chemical engineer tired of toxic job, need advice","**Part 1 of my question**: I’m a 30-year-old chemical engineer currently seeking career advice. For the past two years, I’ve been working at a small (<20 people) consulting engineering/EPC firm. While I’ve worked hard and delivered consistently, I recently encountered a situation that’s left me questioning my future at this company.



Recently, a fellow engineer and I received promotions after earning our PE licenses. However, while she received a 25% salary increase, mine was only 10%. For context, we have nearly identical profiles: we graduated the same year, started working at this company at the same time, and share similar roles. Yet, I’ve independently completed seven projects compared to her two.



I’m not trying to compare myself to her out of pettiness, but I feel this highlights a broader issue with how promotions and raises are determined here. My boss seems to prioritize interpersonal dynamics and negotiation skills over measurable performance. While I’m not the best at negotiation, I was taken aback when my request for a 35% increase (to match her salary) seemed to offend him.



This experience has led me to reconsider my long-term goals. I’m exploring opportunities at larger EPC firms, hoping they might offer a more structured and merit-based approach to performance evaluations and salary increases. Additionally, my current firm operates in a niche industry with limited room for growth. A larger organization might allow for more mobility between departments, which would keep my career fresh and engaging.



For those with experience in larger EPCs, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Are promotions and salaries generally tied to performance and output, or do office politics play an equally significant role? Have you found larger firms to be more equitable and supportive in terms of professional development?



**Part 2 of my question**: I’ve been reflecting on my career lately and feel like I might be ready for a significant change. As a process engineer, I spend most of my day working alone behind a computer, and I’ve realized that this setup might not align with my long-term aspirations.



I also find it challenging to collaborate with colleagues who struggle with social skills, which has made my work environment less enjoyable over time. This has prompted me to consider alternative career paths that might better suit my personality and interests.



Some options I’ve been exploring include moving into application engineering, where I could work more closely with clients, or making a bigger leap into finance—specifically as a financial analyst in venture capital. While the latter seems like an exciting challenge, I’m unsure how realistic it is for someone with a process engineering background to break into the VC world.



Has anyone here made a significant career switch? If so, how did you navigate the transition, and what steps did you take to gain the necessary skills or experience? For those who’ve moved into roles involving more client interaction or shifted into finance, I’d especially appreciate your insights.



Thanks in advance for your advice!",Hitman-Codename47,1,1.0,0,1734654522,2024-12-20 00:28:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hi7fxi/chemical_engineer_tired_of_toxic_job_need_advice/,12,2024
1hi7e51,OT Issues and Confusion,"I work in Career Services, remotely. I prepare my own billing forms to each client I perform services for which my company bills at a much higher rate to the referring agency, or non billable billing forms to the company for ""overhead"" ... ie training, responding to co worker emails.

Policy states we must request OT in advance..

I was letting my boss know each week previously when I had OT but she had said OT was fine, as long as I met the required billable percentages. (80% or more of time spent) average
Averaged per quarter. I track this and always make the goal. 

This last pay period I noticed I was not paid for 8 hrs OT.

Week 1: 7 day period
16 hrs holiday
10 hrs work

Week 2: 7 day period
48 hours of work

Vacation request: 6 hours (to make two week period 80)

I brought this missing OT up to manager- she said I had not asked for prior approval as the policy states...

Still not sure what they will do but now HR is involved. 

My guess is manager has been miscalculating and incorrectly submitting  payroll in the past, another co-worker said they were missing OT pay the same as I was but did not bring it up. 

Is my company allowed to calculate OT over a two week, 80 hrs pay period?

We were told at hire by previous HR that it is better to look at our time as 80 hrs over 2 weeks due to the fluctuating schedule/demamds.

Should I have just not said anything?

I'm worried I have ruined the OT flexibility I had before, although the work I do generally necessitates overtime- as we are required to document, ie billable for things within 24 hours- and things happen with clients that I cannot predict (they call me) on a daily basis. 

I feel like it's an impossible situation to know ahead of time if I will be in OT or how much each week. 

Ps. I'm Also burned out already by the inability to use vacation time and randomly changing unpredictable billing/ schedule.  Ie if a client gets an interview I need to change everything last minute to be there with them.

1hi731d,Should I Do This Program,"I go to a school rather close to one of the biggest ski/resort destinations in the US. I'm just finishing up my general education classes, and I've already bounced around a couple majors - however it's getting to the point where I'm going to need to just pick a path and stick to it. Currently, I'm in Digital Marketing and I work at a Digital Marketing agency - and I don't like it very much. I've been considering making the change to Event Management for a little while, as Events are something I have experience with and have greatly enjoyed.

Recently, I learned about a program my school offers - it's a hospitality management program where you work Full-Time at a paid internship for one of 7 luxury resorts in the area (4/5 star hotels) while studying part time during the Winter/Spring, and then in the Summer/Fall you study full time and work part time. It's a 20 month (5 semester) program. I'm really enticed by this because it seems like a great way to get through college with 1. A degree, 2. Experience, and 3. Pretty good money.

The problem, however, is I'm not super passionate about working in a hotel. I don't hate the idea - but my passion is much more in the sports/music/special events area. For this reason I met with the director of the program, who told me that it would be possible for me to get the Event Management Degree instead of Hospitality Management, but he wouldn't recommend it. He said most students get the Hospitality Management Degree with an Event Planning Minor, and that he's had students go on to work in many areas like the Oracle Arena in the Bay Area and the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, both of which sound like jobs I would be passionate about and interested in, as well as graduates who work in concerts, golf courses, and endurance events - all of which is much more what I'm looking for.

My questions for you guys are -

1. This opportunity is a big commitment for me - at surface level, does it seem worth it?
2. Would you recommend going the Hospitality/Event Minor route, or the Event Major route (if you have experience around the industry?
3. Does it seem like Hospitality Management would locked me into hotels?

The director made a great case to me, but it's also his job to sell the program. Wanted to see what you guys think about it, and if you have any insight.",QuestionHaver13,1,1.0,0,1734653433,2024-12-20 00:10:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hi731d/should_i_do_this_program/,12,2024

1hi5z4p,"Advice Needed:  I ask if help is needed, told no, but yet there is a lot going on. What would you do? ","Here is what I am facing:

In April 2024, I left the first place I started working at when I was 19. I was there for 11 years. The place became toxic, I became unhappy, and it was affecting my mental health to the point that I ended up quitting. I took the summer off to be with my daughter.

In July 2024, I went around to other injection molding manufacturing facilities like I worked at previously because there are a lot of them around where I live and it's what I know! It's where I have experience. At one of the four facilities I dropped off my resume, I find that the operations manager is someone I used to work with. With what she knew that I knew and her needing help, it was an interest in both of our parts.

At the end of August 2024, I started working at said-manufacturer. To my knowledge, I was coming in to help the operations manager as her assistant. My job title is Planning Assistant and I do marketing stuff (LinkedIn and Website stuff).

Fast forward to today, December 2024, and I am miserably **BORED**. I was expecting to be a lot busier than I have been for the past 4 months. The operations manager is busy, but she's not giving me the option to help her minus entering some data in an excel sheet and putting stickers on boxes to mark them as good to go. I also post content on LinkedIn. Oh, and I get to drive around to 10 different places tomorrow to pick up all of the stuff for our Christmas party! 

I am a single mom and my daughter has needs so I am having to take my daughter to appointments, figure out child care, or leave for emergencies at times. I'm GRATEFUL for how flexible the company is with me, but it makes me unreliable at times.

**In my defense,** I am constantly asking if help is needed but I get told no most of the time. I ask questions, I inquire, but I also don't want to have to keep interrupting what she's doing. I don't get told anything unless I ask. 

Their processes need A LOT of improvements and there are many simple fixes that could be implemented to eliminate bottlenecks but the supervisor is set in his ways and doesn't want to change anything.

I often ask what my purpose is. But I'm getting paid, have good benefits, in a decent spot, but I AM MISERABLE & BORED. I don't want to do this forever.

So, the question is... What would YOU do?

1hi5x86,"I have 3 promotion options: Dallas, Atlanta, or Seattle","Hi, I'm an account manager in distribution sales. My role isn't super prevalent to the decision I have to make though. I'm being promoted and have the option of working in Dallas, Atlanta, or Seattle -- all field positions, with a company car, and fully paid relocation plus some other benefits. For context, I'm married, I have 2 young kids, and will be the sole income for my household for at least the next few years. 

There's pros and cons to each but I've never lived in any of these areas. Each has opportunities for promotion but Dallas and Atlanta options have more corporate visibility and would give me more exposure, and let me promote more easily in the future. Here's the way I look at each opportunity:

DFW: Higher work load, best cost of living, most corporate visibility and opportunity for advancement. Total compensation roughly $80-90k

ATL: Less workload, tighter cost of living, decent corporate visibility. Great team, great mentors. Diabolical traffic and driving time. Total compensation roughly $85-95k

Seattle: Moderate work load with more of a slow winter season, highest cost of living, lowest corporate exposure, long flights to conventions & trade shows (those are usually on the east coast a few times a year). Highest total compensation roughly $100-120k

I'm most partial to Dallas because I'm working towards buying a home but I can't come to a decision. Would love some outside opinions.

1hi5pym,Job search and stress management advice ,"So I’m 22 and in May 2024 I graduated from a Top 10 American University. 

Since September, I’ve been applying to jobs in Product Design and I’ve gone to the last round for 3 jobs and got rejected for each. 

This entire job search process and experience really takes a toll on me. I’m very privileged in that I live at home and don’t have to worry about bills, but it’s so hard to enjoy the process like everyone tells me to. 

I know I’m young and have my whole life ahead of me, but that’s hard to enjoy. I can say all these reassurances to myself a million times and they barely make me feel better. 

I have hobbies and exercise, but when I do my job apps or start interviewing or start working on my portfolio, it feels all consuming and I’m filled with anxiety and spiraling thoughts. 

My peers at this top 10 school all have jobs, they have plans, they have exciting change in their lives. 

I’m grateful for what I have, but the fact that my career isn’t fulfilled right now is somehow insanely overwhelming. I don’t want these however many months of unemployment to be horrible memories I look back upon. I want to enjoy these months while also being proactive and job searching. But it’s hard to when it feels like there’s no light at the end of the tunnel. Or that my hard work didn’t pay off. 

I got the 3rd rejection today and I spiraled. It feels like I’ll never get this job in design or tech and I’ll be a year out from graduation and be a failure. I don’t know how to control these dark thoughts or have a better outlook on this. 

I could keep going but you get the gist.

1hi51zv,What Jobs and perspectives are there in international security in Europe?,"Hi all,

I’m at a bit of a crossroads in my career and could really use some guidance.

Here’s the situation: I have a bachelor’s degree in European Economics and Management. During my studies, I took some fascinating courses like economic policy, international security, and “Russia as a Global Player.” 
For the past five years, I’ve worked as a salesman in the IT security industry. It’s been financially rewarding, but honestly, I’m burned out from dealing with greedy and unethical people. I feel like I’m stuck in a role that doesn’t align with my values, and I’m ready for a change.

What I really want is to become an expert in something meaningful, something that lets me contribute positively to the world. 
I’m drawn to international security because it ties together my interests in geopolitics, policy, and solving big-picture problems. 

Ideally, I’d like a career where I can:
- Work on interesting, impactful issues.
- Occasionally travel and engage with people from different cultures.
- Still earn a good salary while making a difference.

I’ve applied to a Master’s program in International Security Management in Berlin. The program covers topics like cybersecurity, human rights, conflict resolution, and risk regulation—things I’m genuinely excited about. Plus, it seems to offer a pathway into roles in government, NGOs, or international organizations, which appeal to me far more than corporate life.

Here’s where I’m hoping you can help:

1. What careers should I consider? I’d like to explore roles outside traditional for-profit companies, like in government, international organizations, or academia.


2. Is this a good path? I’m thinking of starting in government (in Germany, Berlin), building experience and networks, and eventually transitioning to the private sector or consulting. Does that make sense, and how might I structure that transition?


3. What roles pay well? While I want to focus on meaningful work, I also want to make a decent living. Are there jobs in international security that balance purpose and good pay?


If you’ve worked in international security, policy, or a related field, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Any advice, insights, or resources would mean a lot. Thanks in advance!

Looking forward to hearing from you all!

1hi4qk7,Owning a new role ,"TLDR: Hair stylist turned legal operations coordinator 

I was a hair stylist for over 10 years. I was overstimulated constantly and my body hurt constantly. I had started joking with some of my good clients that one of them could give me an admin job. I was often told I was ""too smart"" to do hair. (That's a rant for another day.) 

One of my clients helped me get an interview for a legal assistant position. And somehow. I got it! I was hired to manage mail, schedules, general administration stuff. I learned that in about 3 months and became bored. 

We hired a legal operations manager around the same time. I would regularly check in with the attorneys and the ops manager to see if there was anything I could help them with. The ops manager would often take me up on my offer. She would explain or teach me how to do whatever she wanted help with and I'd go do it. And apparently I did a good job cause she kept asking for my help. 

A little over 6 months later and I'm basically considered a legal ops team member. I've somehow learned to do data analysis, project management, and 100 other skills. I'm loving all of it and I feel so beyond grateful that this has worked out the way it has. 

The problem. 

I struggle horribly with confidence. I'm blessed that my manager often gives me praise and assures me that I continually earn my place on her team with the work im doing. But I don't have any background like the people I work with. I have zero college education. I am a ""forever learner"" with ADHD (if you know, you know).

I also know that I'm grossly underpaid for the work I'm completing. I made more money doing hair but I took the leap knowing there would be room for growth and I may avoid needing surgery on my wrists/shoulders. I feel like I can't really complain because I am not technically qualified. 

I would love any advice that anyone could give me. I'm very new to the corporate world. My only previous knowledge comes from talking to clients or friends. How can I gain more confidence? Any corporate world knowledge that isn't common? ",sneakyscoop,1,1.0,0,1734646701,2024-12-19 22:18:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hi4qk7/owning_a_new_role/,12,2024

1hi34dk,What to do - Fashion Design graduate,"
I graduated in July from BA Fashion Design. I was an average student first 2 years but my last 2 years I barely passed and I ended up graduating with a Third Class Degree. Had my valid reasons for this. 

I now want to transition into jewellery making, but I still want to gain experience in the fashion luxury industry because my goal is to have my own jewellery brand, and then slowly expand into accessories and then clothing once I have a bigger capital. Now I have some jewellery making skills, but I am still learning;
The jewellery I make now is more handcrafted costume jewellery rather than fine jewellery because that requires machinery. I have enrolled in a jewellery making course and are debating if I should do masters in Jewellery Design, or if I should do a Fashion Business Master, or do a bunch of short courses or internships because ultimately my goal is to be the Creative Director of my own brand. 

I am currently overwhelmed by the amount of knowledge I need to learn to become an intelligent creative director and CEO and I’m thinking I need to try a few jobs such as sales associate, assistant designer, and jewellery maker, but it would also be helpful if I knew some marketing at least at the beginning because that would help me set up my brand identity. 

Now I know I can hire people but that’s not something viable right now on my budget so at least at the beginning as a sole trader I should know a bit of everything before I can outsource work. 

Where should I start working as an employee to gain the necessary skills  for my brand? (I’d work on my brand as a side hustle) or what should I do? Also how can I get employed with a Third Class Hons Degree? Has anyone else been awarded that type of degree and if so, what do you do with it? Should I work my way up in a job while building better skills and a better portfolio? I’m so confused, please any suggestions I would deeply appreciate.

My title is junior accountant and I work with another 2 guys - one accountant & one senior accountant. My boss is the finance boss / controller of the company.

Yesterday my boss was chit chatting with our HR director and not long after he came to me said he just volunteered me for some of HR director (she)’ work - as we’re trying to switch to another HR software, she’s not sure about the cancellation policy like if there’s any restrictions on active employees and apparently she doesn’t want to read through everything by herself. So my boss decided it was a good idea to volunteering me to do the job, as I have “detailed keen eyes”

This is the first time like this happened and I don’t feel comfortable because I have already got a full plate even though I only started for 3 months. I work without any supervision everyday and finish my tasks everyday (and honestly not much slack-able time for me because of the workload). And also the fact that he ‘volunteered’ me for some work belong to HR manager, that doesn’t fall into my duties at all. 
Besides that, I really feel reluctant doing it because what if my advice is wrong and if some penalty happened because of the decision they made based on my work, will I be punished for it?

1hi1mxc,My job lied to me about my pay ,So I am a hairstylist and most salons hire you on as an apprentice if you’re new to the industry (which I am) and I was told I’d get paid 14/hr plus tips for shampooing and doing blowouts. Today I got my first paycheck and it said 10/hr and when I asked about it they told me that they never told me I’d be paid 14/hr and that they can’t afford to pay me that. They told me that I’m being paid to learn and I get all my tips (I’ve made about 15-25 a day in tips) and when they move me to a commission rate in 3 months then I’ll be making more money. I feel indifferent about the salon. I’m not overly attached and I don’t see myself in anyone that works there. I took the job bc it’s in walking distance of my apartment and the 14/hr bc most salons don’t pay their apprentices or pay minimum wage.. the salon has a very good review for my city and the clientele is very wealthy and influential in the community.. (I washed the city mayors hair!!) The commission stylists make over 100k a year. I am wondering if I should tough out the 3 months at the low pay for the potential of making 6 figures or if I should find somewhere where I can get paid more..

1hi1adc,Move to competitor or stay at current job with 1% pay rise & flexible hours?,"I am currently in my mid/late 20's and working full time at a local engineering firm which I have been employed at for the last 2 years. I have around 5+ years within the industry in both contracting + consultancy. My work offers a flexible 4 day work week with the caveat being we works 10 hour days + breaks for a total work week of 37.5 hours. My current salary is around $98,500 AUD. 

We are currently assisting a client as an advisor with a larger engineering firm overseeing the project. The larger firm has head hunted me due to my work ethic on the project and are offering an additional $23,500 on top of my current salary to $122,000. After a brief discussion, they are looking to expand their office local to me as the majority of their company is based in the major cities. The overall company is 2x bigger than my current workplace. The total weekly work hours are the same at 37.5 hours but I will be back to 5 day week, just with shorter daily hours.

With the end of the year approaching, I asked my current workplace what this year's remunerations were looking like. After sitting down with General Manager, they have upped my pay by a staggering $1,500, around a 1% increase. I advised the GM about my offer and asked if they could meet me in the middle with a counter. After a few days I was advised by my GM that my output could not justify the requested pay increase. 

Taking this job would ruin my reputation with my current company as I have been poached on a common project. The office of the competing company is quite small currently but are looking the expand within the region in the near future.

1hi12sv,Which major would I choose?,"
Hi everyone,
I'm an international student in the
U.S., female, and I just turned 22. I'm at a point where I really need to decide on my major, but I'm feeling overwhelmed and unsure about what to do next.
My ultimate goal is to find a stable job in the U.S. after graduation. I've always been a creative person—I love sculpture, drawing, and working on detailed, hands-on projects. At the same time, genuinely enjoy math and chemistry, and I've done well in those subjects.
When I first came to the U.S., I started by taking art classes, and I loved them. But I realized pretty quickly that it would be hard to find a steady job in the arts, especially as an international student who needs visa sponsorship.

After that, I got really excited about becoming a dental hygienist. It felt like a perfect match for me—it's hands-on, meaningful work, and it fits my skills. But then I learned that I wouldn't qualify for an H1B visa because dental hygiene doesn't require a bachelor's degree. That was tough to accept because I was so passionate about it.
Now, I'm considering accounting. It seems practical because it's in demand, and earning a bachelor's degree in it would make me eligible for a work visa. I love math and chemistry, so I think l'd enjoy the subject, but I'm honestly not super confident in myself. I'm not naturally a super logical or analytical thinker, and I worry about whether l'd do well or feel fulfilled in the field.

On top of that, I have a boyfriend, but I want to earn an H1B visa on my own, even though I know how challenging that can be since I’m genuinely not sure if we are gonna get married. 

Right now, I feel stuck between:
* ﻿﻿Arts, which I'm passionate about but might not lead to job opportunities.
* ﻿﻿Dental hygiene, which I loved but doesn't meet H1B visa requirements.
* ﻿﻿Accounting, which seems practical but feels a bit intimidating for me.
Does anyone have advice on choosing a major that balances passion, practicality, and visa sponsorship? Are there other career paths I should consider that could fit my interests?

Thanks so much for reading! I'd really appreciate any advice you can give.",Blackcat0002227,1,1.0,0,1734636951,2024-12-19 19:35:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hi12sv/which_major_would_i_choose/,12,2024
1hi11ob,Meta New Grad SWE London Pass/Fail? (My experience),"TLDR:  
Solved 3/4 questions optimally with correct time and space complexity + all follow ups. Chocked when implementing the second question on my first technical. Was close, but struggled implementing the final part of the question. Also, the question I failed to answer, I was asked in the next interview, but I didn't realize at the time since it was asked so differently. Behavioural went well. All interviewers gave good vibes and stayed past the interview time for questions. How do you think I did? Do I have a chance?

Hi Guys,

I finished my Meta full loop 2 weeks ago and received an Email today saying that due to the holidays, they will not be able to update any applicants on their interviews. They will start looking again on the 6th of January.

Due to this, I wanted to take my thoughts to Reddit / discuss my experience and also gauge how well I did. I applied via the Meta website on 30/9/24 and heard back from a recruiter on the 14/10/24. They set up my OA for the 31/10/24.

**Coding OA**  
It was 4 questions, probably 1 LC easy and 3 LC mediums, maybe one of them was a hard I'm not sure, I had never seen any of the questions before on LC. None of the questions were that hard, but the time constraint is what makes it difficult. I was able to clear this round, getting 4/4 and passing all of the test cases.

I received an email 5 days later confirming that I had cleared this round, and was now heading to the Full loop. This consisted of 2 Technical interviews and 1 behavioural interview. I was able to choose 5 possible days, and I was also able to choose if I wanted the interviews on the same day or not. I chose slots in December to give me the most time to prepare.

**Behavioural**

I had my interview on 3/12/24. I think it went well. The interviewer had good vibes, and he seemed very friendly and he was cracking some jokes throughout the interview. I made sure to structure my answers using the STAR format. I also had 2 mock interviews, which helped my hone my answers and make sure I was using good stories. The one thing I would say is that I didn't expect him to ask so many questions. In my mock interviews, I was asked 5-6 questions, and they kept digging on my answers, while here, I would give my long STAR answer, and he wouldn't question me on anything, or dig more, he would move onto another question. This led to me being asked around 10 questions I think, which was a lot more than expected. I should note I had 15 minutes extra time across all of my interviews due to dyslexia, so maybe that's why. Anyway after all of the questions we had a nice 10 - 15 minute chat about Meta and the culture etc. He even stayed 5 minutes after the interview had ended to keep talking to me. I felt pretty positive after this interview as he was giving off good vibes, and I felt like my answers were strong.

**Technical 1**

I had my first technical on 3/12/24. This interview took place an hour after my behavioural. I had prepared for this using LC specifically Meta tagged last 30 days and 6 months. I solved about 150 problems, and memorized 70-80 of Meta's most recent. First question was a matrix question which is not on Meta tagged (LC medium), made sure to ask clarifying questions/check edge cases. Becuase I had never seen it before, it stumped me at first, but I figured it out and explained my solution, he gave me the go-ahead to code it, and I did. I needed one small hint for one line I was blanking on, but besides that, it went well. Gave correct space and time complexity as well, and it was optimal. He asked me to move on to the next question. This was an intervals question, which is a variation of a Meta tagged (LC Medium). I asked clarifying questions and edge cases etc, and explained my approach, he was happy for me to start coding. Now as I was coding up my solution, I got to the last part of the code, and then blanked, and panicked, and I was struggling to implement this section. I made sure to keep voicing my thoughts, but the only hint he gave me was to try to dry run to see where I'm going wrong. After a doing some dry runs, I was still stumped, and he asked me to move onto the time and space complexity. I'm not sure if I got these correct, As I was feeling very thrown off after failing to answer this question. The only good note here is he stayed 15 minutes after my interview was done to answer my questions, he only left when He was physically asked to leave his office.

**Technical 2**

I had my second technical on 4/12/24. After my disappointing first technical, I was feeling very very down and unhappy, but I made sure to try to forget it. Luckily for me, this interview went extremely well. First question was a popular Meta tree question (LC easy), I recognised it immediately. I still made sure to ask clarifying questions, and check edge cases, I also discussed the trade offs of DFS and BFS on this problem, and justified why I was going with my approach. He was happy for me to start coding, and I coded up the solution with no bugs. The only thing to mention here is that I forgot to include one of the variables in the function header, which he pointed out. I correctly gave the time/space complexity and then he asked a follow up. This was also simple, and I explained how I would solve it, changed a few lines, and he was satisfied with my response. We then moved on to the next question (LC medium). Now here is where it gets interesting. He gave me the question, and I asked clarifying questions/edge cases, and explained how I would solve it. He gave me the go ahead, and I started. After finishing and doing dry runs, I realised that this question was the same interval question I had failed to answer on the previous day. It was just asked in such a different way, and was not using an external class, that I didn't realise until that point. I did not bring this up, as the interview was past half way done, and I was worried that I would be given a question I could not answer. I'm not sure if this will affect me or not, the question was worded in a completely different way and was using a completely different interface. I was able to answer it this time as I used a different approach. I correctly gave the space and time complexity, and then answered his follow up, which leans on a LC hard problem that Meta likes to answer. He seemed very satisfied with my answers, and we moved on to Q&A. I actually finished with like 20 minutes to go, and he also stayed after the interview ended, so we had a great chat for around 30 minutes, it was amazing.

I'm not sure how well I've done. On the one hand, I messed up that one question, but was definitely close to the answer. As well as this, I was technically asked the same question, but I didn't realize, and Im not sure if this will be an issue. On the other hand, 2 interviews went very very well, and one went okay, and the interviewer was still giving good vibes, so Im on the face about how to feel. What do you guys think?

For anyone who wants advice, I'd say LC premium is a must. Also, I would strongly recommend mock interviews, they made a world of difference.",sadGreenRL,0,0.5,0,1734636865,2024-12-19 19:34:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hi11ob/meta_new_grad_swe_london_passfail_my_experience/,12,2024

40K my Income. Wife is currently making 60K.

We had an opportunity to move anywhere we wanted due to wifes remote work. So we took the opportunity to explore. We landed here and have been enjoying it for the last year.

I freelance (Media Production) and do ok, we don't have much of a social circle or family anywhere close by, but we are somewhat ok with that. The beach lifestyle is our bread and butter and we enjoy living here for it.

Originally from Hawaii, we are beach lovers at heart. I grew up a surfer. Its in the blood. No where compares to the environment at home in Hawaii obviously. So thats what made this place feel good, I love the warm waters where we are currently living. Its nice to have that for the soul.

I recently got a job offer in Oregon, about 3 hours away from the coast. My job offer would allow me to be hybrid, both freelancing and contracted for work. Increasing my take home to 65K. Bring our total to 125K

Our dilemma is- would it be worth leaving an environment we love for more cash (25k).

Sure I could be just 3 hours from the coast, closer to some family and friends in Oregon, increasing our income, and closer to take a trip home in Hawaii. But the ice and cold/ fire season, lack of a warm beach out in Central Oregon has us second guessing.

1hhzca1,How do you handle a toxic boss? ,"I began working at my new company in August. At first, I liked my manager and thought she was very considerate and kind. Very soon I learned she is the opposite. 

She is passive aggressive and does not teach me how to do my job, only tells me what to do. Our system is not organized and there are no Standard Operating Procedures. I explained how important written instruction is for me, and she said that I could do it if I wanted, but that is not what she does. More and more it feels like I am an errand girl. On my second or third day of work, as soon as a pretty long winded coworker left the room she mock “shot” herself in the head. I immediately realized that if she did that behind his back, what would stop her from doing that to me if I aggravated her. 

I have record of some passive aggressive emails she has sent to me, one where she openly admitted her dislike for a colleague. Her emails are unprofessional, for instance I asked a question and she replied, “NO!”. 

She also is never here, she comes and goes as she pleases and is pushing back her retirement another two years. I spoke with the person who had this job before me and she only had negative things to say. 

I have a performance review (hopefully if my boss is even here to give it) in January where I hope to bring up my concerns and professional goals. I am extremely nervous, how do you approach a bad working environment/relationship with a level head? I don’t want to cry during this meeting.

One of my employees found my main reddit account. He copied the contents of some personal posts I made in mental health subreddits and sent them in an email up the chain of command all the way to the vp of the company. I can't work here anymore. 

I'm so done with this and I want a completely fresh start probably in an entirely new industry. Maybe in another city or maybe remote work I don't know. I don't care.

1hhz0hy,Can someone please help me reframe the way I think about my job? I want to like it because it pays well and is mostly not stressful but it feels like a huge step back and is meaningless.,"Yes, I fully acknowledge that I am in a privileged position of having a tech job as a project manager. I am so aware because many friends have been laid off and in hard temporary jobs. I want to like it and do well. However, the subject matter (recruiting processes) is so incredibly boring to me and because of that and my unmedicated/undiagnosed ADHD, I struggle to focus and I struggle to care. I have always been an overachiever but for the first time in my 10 year career I am on a performance improvement plan. 
 
I had a job that I was once passionate about (leadership development trainer). I love the psychology and human elements of teaching leadership courses, and my current job is purely focused on recruiting process changes within the software we use. I was initially hired for something else that I actually enjoyed but when there was a vacancy on this project team, they had me fill it. This job is almost exactly like the first job I had out of grad school, where I ended up very depressed and I applied to jobs for a year to get out of it. So the way I see it, I ended up right back in something I knew I hated about 8 years ago so it feels like a huge step back. In both situations, I never chose this kind of role, there was just a vacancy and I was told I would fill it.

This job funds the hobbies in my life that bring me so much joy and fulfillment. Hobbies I would love to just do full time, but I prefer to keep doing them for fun instead of monetizing them to retain the joy I get out of them and not feel pressured to make money from them.

My mental health is not great as a result of this job, performing poorly, and a few other things in my life. I really would like to just be ok with this meaningless well paying job but I'm having a hard time. And I know mindset can change so much. Any advice is appreciated, especially if there are any fellow ADHDers who have managed to trick themselves into being ok with such a job.

1hhysbf,Should I apply for a 3rd job at the same company?,"I'm in the process of attempting to transition to a new career from education into international development. I recently applied to a job at an INGO that actually blended both my education experience and my recently acquired higher-level degree in NGO management. Unfortunately, that job was posted about a month ago and so I don't expect to hear back.

I saw another more entry-level job on their website posted yesterday that doesn't relate to my previous career, but is something I'm very interested and have the academic and administrative experience to fill the role. That said, though the posting didn't explicitly state they are looking for a national of the country where the job placement would be, I don't suspect I qualify based on my nationality.

Today, I saw an internship position posted. I definitely qualify and am happy to take on an internship as I want to get my foot in the door in the international development world. Even though I'm 33, I'm totally fine with taking an unpaid internship if it will get me closer to my career goals (and I truly believe this one would).

I'm wondering if it would look bad though to apply for a 3rd job in as many days, with each position decreasing in seniority. Keep in mind I tweaked my resume and submitted completely different cover letters appropriate of each position that I already applied for, and would submit a tweaked cover letter for this internship as well (likely similar to what I submitted for the second job I applied to as the roles are similar).

For reference: the organization is a massive INGO that does important work all over the world and has thousands of employees. They use workday for their job applications.

1hhybev,Making a Counter Offer,"So my company is being acquired by a Capital group. This is going to be a pain in the ass. There's going to be a huge increase in work in the short term to migrate the ERP, which is my primary responsibility. That said, there's a lot more room for growth than I would have previously had.

They gave me an offer (not everyone got one), and it's not awful. They're matching my salary, and tacking on the difference I'll have to pay in premiums for my family health insurance. They don't offer 401k match (I thought everyone did this), but they do offer HSA match, which actually adds up to about the same amount. So that's a wash.

What I will lose is 2 of my 4 weeks PTO, and my annual bonus. That's not a guaranteed bonus, but it is substantial. 16.5% of my annual. This year I'll be receiving the full amount (the day before the sale goes through).

The HR rep said after my 90 day probationary period (everyone gets this even mgmt), they'll ""almost definitely"" bump me to 3 weeks PTO and ""probably"" do a salary adjustment to make up the difference from the bonus.

Here's what I'm going to ask for in my counter: After the probationary period if they keep me and I decide to stay, a guarantee that A) my pto is increased to 3 weeks and B) my salary will be adjusted up the same amount as my bonus that I receive this year.

From a personal perspective I think young leaders bring a different dynamic to a team, however, they without doubt doesn’t have the same experience as a person in their 50’s who been in job for a lot more years. Even though they haven’t been a leader and possibly doesn’t won’t to, they have some more business experience.

As a young leader, what are the toughest challenges you’ve faced?

When business do look for people to pick up a position with leadership, they all want someone with prior experience. There will always be personal traits which can point in the direction of a decent or good leader - but how can a young person fill that gap, and jump the cliff from zero leadership experience into a leadership position. At some point, they have to take the step and someone above need to have trust in them.

To the young leaders; how was your path into a position as a leader?
Furthermore, was you asked to take up that role, was there a posting you applied for did you shoot your shot and asked for a promotion or chance to become a leader?

1hhxunx,Workplace dynamics: referral,"A friend of mine referred me for a position at his workplace. He works in another department. I’ve been working 100% remotely in this role for just three months, and I only have a one-on-one meeting with my manager every two weeks, so I haven’t really had a chance to get to know anyone yet.

Last week, we had the company’s end-of-year party, and I was invited. When I arrived, I noticed that most people already knew each other and were very comfortable in their groups. Shortly after, I ran into my friend, and I naturally stuck by him because he was the only person I really knew, apart from my manager, with whom I only had a brief five-minute chat.

I did not interrupt his conversations and every time he approached someone, like his boss, I didn’t follow him and staid by myself at the bar. 

Since I’m new and unfamiliar to most people, they started to notice that this colleague and I already knew each other and began asking how we knew each other. I realized he avoided answering that question every time it came up, and he seemed uncomfortable with people knowing that we were acquainted outside of work.

At one point, he asked me how my life was going, and I replied, “It’s good, I met my nephew last week.” However, I noticed that he didn’t respond to my comment and quickly changed the subject. I mentioned my nephew because he knows my brother, the father of my nephew, so I thought it was a casual and harmless comment to make.

He’s a really nice guy, but I’m wondering if his discomfort is a justifiable concern on his part. Did I make a mistake by sticking close to him at the event? I’m trying to understand because, if necessary, I’d like to apologize to him.

I want to know if, from now on, when I see him in company events I should act as if he was just a regular coworker and not my friend. 

Would you in this case not want other people to know that you’ve referred someone and want this person to act as if they don’t know you or don’t say anything that implies you know each other?

1hhx0dt,Not sure what to do next after failing the DP-900 by 1 question(670/700) and no banchlors. ,"TLDR at the bottom.

Backstory:

Always been interested in coding, not really software engineer or web dev, did a lot of coding in HS went to college but when I got there they weren't teaching anything new and I didn't want to pay for it so dropped out.

Got into sales and spent 7 years in wireless where I was a top performer individually and territorially.

Started studying the markets in my down time and learning financial analysis (more technical side) so ended up pursuing financial advisor licences and got my 7/66 and life and health producers in 2022.

I was commission only and did not have a network so obviously failed out of that pretty fast, but I was finally doing something I wanted to do which was portfolio analysis/management I loved the data side and building portfolios. Ended up learning Python and writing scripts for better analysis.

I also built a CRM and lead generation system for myself because Salesforce sucked at my company. I couldn't get the volume I needed with their systems.

After that I got hired on in dental insurance as a claims technician, using that ive been in contact with our data team and have a track to move there after I've been at the company for a year which is in April.

I have no banchlors and just failed the DP-900 by once question (670/700). I was passing the practice exams on . Microsoft's website at 90%+ which is 10% higher than I was passing the FINRA exams at.

Non-realtional data was the failed section, delimited data. Never saw it ONCE in the practice exams.

My question is, is it worth it to actually get the DP-900, should I just focus on projects, what would you do in my shoes?

My question is though, how do I know if I've just crossed the bridge from junior to mid level, or if I'm well into being mid level or if I'm on the cusp of being senior? Reason I ask is that salaries where I am range from 40-50k for mid level swes? But 50 starts to approach the point of senior, so I just want to know if it's stupid to ask for 50 when I speak to recruiters. 

I get it's hard to know without knowing me specifically/persoanlly. But some context I guess:

We employ a microservice architecture so I've upgraded a bunch of services from .net3/4 to .net8. I've created a couple from scratch. This has involved designing the db table(structure), then creating the table, the service reading from an event store, writing to db, and vice versa. Pretty good with SQL. I can identify bottlenecks in queries, and have dabbled in looking at execution plans and optimising a little by removing unnecessary joins, using temp tables/ctes in certain cases. I've used third party APIs and integrated them with some services. Ive deployed to prod servers via azure pipelines. Have experience with SQL Server and mongodb. Created replica sets for mongodb. Confident with Linux as we have a bunch of linux servers. I also have react experience. Generate reports on the backend via sql/.net, display on frontend via react.

1hhwcxq,How to deal with a boss who manages terribly and has 0 empathy for her staff?,"I work at a fire dept, been there 10 years. In the fire dept you get reprimanded by write-ups, then time off, then fired. Not always in that exact order, but usually. In my first couple years, I had a period of time where I kind of got out of shape and wasnt able to perform properly one day so I got written up. Since then I've tried to be in shape and do well, but every since I had covid the first time I have difficulty breathing every time I get any sort of cold or anything, makes it hard to do this job, to explain better... putting my gear on the truck sometimes in the morning will make me winded, or making my bed. So In fear of being reprimanded further, I call in everytime I'm a little sick because I fear not being able to perform properly. Also if I take a sick day then I cannot work my side job while I'm off, so it forces me to call in the side job as well from time to time. 

I work part time at a county fire dept, the lady who runs the place isn't a fireman she's an administrator for the dept who lucked into the job. She doesn't understand what it is like to be on the floor. My wife almost died and I was gone from both jobs for a month taking care of her, and she never even asked how shes doing. We have a group text for the job / scheduling. I had the flu this week, I texted 4 days ahead of time to try and get someone to work for me JUST INCASE I couldnt make it. Nobody responded. She responds back with a text indirectly aimed at me:  ""1. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT EVERYONE SHOW UP FOR THEIR SHIFTS AT THIS FIRE DEPT. IT IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE FIRE DEPT IF YOU DO NOT SHOW UP FOR YOUR SHIFTS!!! AND PICK UP SHIFTS WHEN YOU CAN AS WELL. 2. unrelated topic 3. unrelated topic. "" No, hey how you doing man, you gonna make it thursday? Nothing. Just rude as can be. Everyone else at work gets a jacket with their name on it for the winter. I ask where mine is ""oh I'm gonna have to find yours."" Well what do you know she never found it. I had a paycheck, which i was mistaken and had put down for holiday pay for veterans day, apparently we dont get that. I go into the office to ask her and she says ""oh you dont get paid for that holiday."" which... she does the paychecks she could have let me know when she cut my check down by over 200 bucks that I wasnt gonna get that this month, instead of letting me think I was getting it the whole time. 

To me, it is clear shes trying to run me off due to calling in sick a few times. Which really it hasn't even been that many minus the month for my wife, which I couldnt help at all. I mean we are talking maybe 3 times in a year. I work four to six 12 hour shifts a month. 

How would you approach dealing with this person. I need this job pretty badly honestly or I would just leave, but this is the most money I am able to make on the side at the moment. Have any of you ever dealt with a manger like this anywhere? If so how did it work out for ya?

I’m currently an 18 year old in my final year of high school residing in Dubai, UAE studying in the CBSE Indian curriculum with the subjects Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Psychology and English.

Since grade 4 I’ve wanted to enter the healthcare field and become either a doctor or any other medical professional, as biology and chemistry as well as helping people is what I enjoyed the most.

Right after grade 9, I decided I wanted to pursue dentistry as I found it fascinating with a mix of medicine, art and design and I liked the fact that it was a career with good work life balance.

I’ve always wanted to migrate to Canada as many of my aunts and relatives live there and I wanna make a life of mine there. However as yall know in order to pursue dentistry you need to go through undergrad which is 4 years and then face the fierce competition of dental schools which have about 5% acceptance.

Hence I thought Europe specifically Hungary as a good place to pursue dentistry as its only 5 years without undergrad, but once I’m done with it, where else will I go? I don’t want to return back to Dubai as the food market is super saturated for doctors and dentists and I don’t want to practice anywhere in Europe except maybe the UK. My goal was to settle in Canada itself and immigrating as a dental professional from a non accredited dental university to Canada is a long tedious process.

Hence I decided that I should go to undergrad in Canada in some healthcare field and further my career by doing masters and obtain a PR p easily and have a good life by calling my parents asw. I’ll also have my family nearby, but will have to give up pursuing  dentistry as there’s no guaranteed chance I’ll get in.

However, now I’m in a dilemma, where I should actually go for dentistry in Europe but have no clear indication of where I’ll live, or just go Canada and do something in the healthcare field and give up on dentistry for a better life in Canada.

I know some of yall will say Canada is not worth it, but it is for me, I have loads of family there living who have all told me to come here because the quality of life and ways of making passive income is really good and you will have a country to call home.

Also my parents and my aunts have never put a pressure on me to go to Canada but they are telling me the benefits, but idk.

I honestly don’t know what to do, ny mind and heart is telling me the correct decision is Canada but maybe like 5% of me is like I should go Europe and do what I wanted to. 

And also the chances of me getting in these unis is really good as my gpa and my IELTS scores is p good. 

What would yall do in my scenario?",Armaan_Dabhi,1,1.0,0,1734617218,2024-12-19 14:06:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hhtn3y/what_should_i_do/,12,2024

Since then, I have been looking for MERN stack or frontend developer jobs. I also have MERN projects on my GitHub, but I still haven't secured a job. I feel completely down about my career and don’t know how to enter the IT field.

Recently, I connected with an HR professional via LinkedIn and shared the truth about my career situation. He said he would help me and mentioned that he provides backdoor jobs for IT. He is also from TamilNadu, and we spoke over the phone.

I asked him if I would face any problems in the future if I entered IT through a backdoor job. He assured me that I wouldn’t and said it’s common in the IT industry — if you have connections, you can get in via backdoor opportunities.

However, I still have doubts:

1. It has been almost 1.5 years since I graduated. Should I try to secure a job through a backdoor opportunity?
2. Are backdoor jobs still happening in IT? If true, please share any experiences you know of people entering IT through backdoor jobs.

1hhs7zk,"Here is what I am interested in, looking for jobs or careers that may fit that I don’t know about. ","Right now I work in employee benefits such as FSA’s, HSA’s, etc. In this roll I’m a plan administrator. I’ve been doing this for about 7 years, sometimes I like it and sometimes I need a new job tomorrow. Every couple months I go through a “what else can I do with my life phase”, but looking for a new job is so overwhelming! 

Sometimes I look for almost the same job. Maybe the experience with be a little better in another company? My main issue is that it’s a local company that’s growing. More work, procedures and systems constantly being updated. The main system is proprietary and has an error AT LEAST a few times a week. 

Other times I am looking for something completely new. I’m beginning to get interested in something UX Experience based. I like the idea of trying something out and making suggestions on how to approve on it. In my head this pertains to electronic systems like website, software. I have no technical skills, so my suggestion would not have the lingo on how to arrive at the solution. 

I love working remote and would like to continue if it’s feasible. I am pretty introverted so no matter what limited interaction with people is ideal. Right now I’d say my job is 40% emails (internal and clients), 40% working in the systems, 15% internal meetings, and 5% client meetings and phone calls. Sometimes I get so drained with all the emails, like “I just want to work.” Which obviously that is work but  I just want to bury my head and to the other stuff (if I can get into the system).

I was thinking about nursing school, but I can only think of a researcher as something that’s more in the background. Maybe I need  the education to jump into more of an administrative roll?

What else is there that fits my personality? Does Not have the be healthcare related.

I just got recalibrated on depression medication, so maybe I’m about to be on an upswing. That being I think my time is just about up at my current situation. Sometimes think about going back to school, I just don’t want to waste anymore time and money. While working on my BS I changed my major twice, then gave up. 

I’m sorry for the rant just trying to make sure I get all the details in. Also I live in the US.

I have been trying to get into our IT audit branch and I was able to do that in 2023. I am still green and learning a lot but now I am an IT auditor for 7 months and work on federal compliance single audits 5 months of the year (hate it!). It’s a great job. I work 4 days a week and fully remote besides 1 day a month. I live in the middle of no where Eastern Kentucky where cost of living is amazing. My issue is I am at the top of my salary at 92k. I am an Auditor 6 which is the highest rank we have besides manager. So, the only growth I will get is if we get raises across the board in state government, which happens occasionally. No pension btw, it’s a hybrid cash plan and seems to grow extremely slow with my employer matching my 4%. I love the job for the work life balance, hours, freedom, merit employment, and the ability to live anywhere in the state of Kentucky, and I get some IT audit in the mix for the expierence I want on my resume.

I have been offered a job working in NERC CIP. This seems like a huge step up for me as far regarding industry and cybersecurity. I am starting out at 96k, with my employer giving 10.5% to my 4.5% in retirement.  This position caps out at 145k, doesn’t mean I will get there but it shows room for growth. They will pay for my masters degree and any certifications as well of which I plan to do if I take this position. So, this job is all about career growth and pivoting out of accounting into full cybersecurity and a better industry (energy). The job is about 1 ½ hours from where I currently live and the cost of living there is almost double. The job is hybrid with 3 days in office and 2 remote. I plan to stay at an Air BNB and stay at home for the first 3-6 months until I find the house I want (this is about extra $500 month for me). Also wanted to add my best friend works there and has been the inside source of saying it's a great job and won't be overwhelming, etc. I do worry I am flying to close to the sun and not prepared for what this job brings, but in the interview I was very honest about having low technical skills and is more of a compliance/audit person than IT/cybersecurity. So this job is about getting a chance to fully be in Cybersecurity and have a great experience, but I lose remote status, Fridays off, and take the risk of course even though I have inside source telling me it's a great gig.

1hhpvdj,Seeking career & visa advice,"Hi everyone,
I'm an international student in the
U.S., female, and I just turned 22. I'm at a point where I really need to decide on my major, but I'm feeling overwhelmed and unsure about what to do next.
My ultimate goal is to find a stable job in the U.S. after graduation. I've always been a creative person—I love sculpture, drawing, and working on detailed, hands-on projects. At the same time, genuinely enjoy math and chemistry, and I've done well in those subjects.
When I first came to the U.S., I started by taking art classes, and I loved them. But I realized pretty quickly that it would be hard to find a steady job in the arts, especially as an international student who needs visa sponsorship.

After that, I got really excited about becoming a dental hygienist. It felt like a perfect match for me—it's hands-on, meaningful work, and it fits my skills. But then I learned that I wouldn't qualify for an H1B visa because dental hygiene doesn't require a bachelor's degree. That was tough to accept because I was so passionate about it.
Now, I'm considering accounting. It seems practical because it's in demand, and earning a bachelor's degree in it would make me eligible for a work visa. I love math and chemistry, so I think l'd enjoy the subject, but I'm honestly not super confident in myself. I'm not naturally a super logical or analytical thinker, and I worry about whether l'd do well or feel fulfilled in the field.

On top of that, I have a boyfriend, but I want to earn an H1B visa on my own, even though I know how challenging that can be since I’m genuinely not sure if we are gonna get married. 

Right now, I feel stuck between:
* ﻿﻿Arts, which I'm passionate about but might not lead to job opportunities.
* ﻿﻿Dental hygiene, which I loved but doesn't meet H1B visa requirements.
* ﻿﻿Accounting, which seems practical but feels a bit intimidating for me.
Does anyone have advice on choosing a major that balances passion, practicality, and visa sponsorship? Are there other career paths I should consider that could fit my interests?

Thanks so much for reading! I'd really appreciate any advice you can give.",Blackcat0002227,1,1.0,0,1734603411,2024-12-19 10:16:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hhpvdj/seeking_career_visa_advice/,12,2024
1hhpsri,How Do I Prove My Worth in a Workplace That Only Promotes Based on Connections? ,"Title: How Do I Prove My Worth in a Workplace That Only Promotes Based on Connections?

Hi everyone,

This isn’t my first time talking about this issue. A few months ago, I shared my frustrations about working in a government office where I am the only one who hasn’t been promoted, despite being hired at the same time as my coworkers for the same position. The reason? I don’t have any “connections.” The favoritism in this system has been so frustrating.

Here’s what’s happening now: During a meeting with my boss, he mentioned that he’ll be moving to a higher position soon. Once that happens, someone else will need to take over his current role. He said that one of my coworkers—a newbie—is the one who’ll get promoted because she was “hired earlier” (even though we were all hired for the same role at the same time). After that, her current position will be given to me.

Here’s why this feels so unfair:

I have 8 years of experience in this office, doing the same type of work. Meanwhile, this is the first job of the newbie coworker. She doesn’t know basic tasks like preparing transmittals, checking reports, or even using Excel confidently.

If she gets the supervisor-level role, I’ll end up reporting to her, but I’ll also be the one who ends up checking my own work because she doesn’t know how to do it herself.


It feels like I’m being taken for granted. I’m the one who’s been doing the hard work, yet she’s the one getting promoted. I don’t want to be someone’s stepping stone—it’s not fair to me.

Here’s what I need advice on:

1. How do I make my boss recognize that I’m more qualified for the promotion?

I don’t want to come off as petty or like I’m undermining my coworker. At the same time, I feel like my boss doesn’t see how much more capable I am.

I’ve thought about building better relationships with the higher-ups so they notice my hard work, but I don’t know how to approach this without seeming fake or overly pushy.



2. Should I just leave?

I can’t resign immediately, but I’ve already started applying for positions in other government agencies where I hope my skills will be appreciated.

I feel like staying here might just lead to more frustration, but I also don’t want to leave without giving myself a chance to be recognized.




I just want to get what I deserve based on my skills and experience—not because of connections or favoritism. Has anyone else gone through something like this? How did you handle it?",NoPossession7664,3,1.0,11,1734603080,2024-12-19 10:11:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hhpsri/how_do_i_prove_my_worth_in_a_workplace_that_only/,12,2024
1hhppxs,Career Dilemma: Corporate Strategy or Project Management? Seeking Advice on Next Steps,"Hi Everyone,

I’m at a pivotal stage in my life, and some personal events have made me reflect deeply on my future. After much thought, I’m reaching out to seek career guidance from those of you who have experience in these areas. While I’m not necessarily confused, I would appreciate advice from anyone who has been through similar transitions.

1. Career Change Guidance:
I’m seeking advice on what to expect when switching careers, especially in terms of preparation and things I should keep in mind as I move forward.

2. About Me:
I’ve been working in HR for the past 1.5 years and recently joined a new firm in an HR role. While I appreciate the work-life balance and the stability it offers, I feel like I’m limiting my potential. The work is becoming repetitive, and although that’s not inherently bad, it’s no longer challenging me. As a result, I’ve been considering a career switch.

3. Long-Term Goals:
My fiancé (who is currently a chef) and I are working towards opening our own business in the hotel industry. Given this, I’ve been thinking about learning new skills to help us achieve this goal. I recently explored project management, and I found the field to be quite interesting and challenging. It seems like an area where I can expand my potential and gain valuable skills for the future. I also feel it will allow me to be more involved in our long-term plans.

4. MBA and Specialization:
I’m about to turn 25, and I was planning to pursue an MBA next year. My question is: what specialization should I consider? Should I focus on Project Management, Entrepreneurship, or something else that aligns better with my goals? I’ve also been considering an MBA in Strategic Management, as I believe this could be a better option for running a business and would align more closely with my long-term aspirations. Additionally, I’m wondering if pursuing a career in corporate strategy could be a good path to explore.

5. Next Steps:
Should I focus on upskilling myself through courses or start looking for jobs in project management or corporate strategy? What types of entry-level positions would be suitable for someone transitioning into these fields?

6. Corporate Strategy vs. Project Management: 
Given my long-term goals and interests, should I focus on building a career in corporate strategy or project management? Which path would be more beneficial for achieving my aspirations in both business and personal life?

I realize this post covers a lot of ground, but I would be extremely grateful for any advice, suggestions, or insights you may have.

1hho117,Trying to figure out what to do ,"I grew up in a privileged household, with my dad working as an airline pilot. He was often away for 10-15 days a month, traveling to far-flung corners of the world. Whenever he came home, he’d share photos and stories from his journeys, igniting a deep fascination within me for the spirit of aviation. For much of my childhood, I dreamed of following in his footsteps and becoming a pilot myself.

At the same time, I discovered a natural talent for math and physics, which led me to pursue a degree in aerospace engineering. By the time I graduated at 22, though, I took the first job offered to me, and the dream of flying took a back seat. Now, at 30 years old, I’m finally about to take my first flight lesson—a milestone that feels long overdue.

As a teenager, I had a vivid dream of owning a 100+ acre property in an overlooked corner of the U.S., where I could build a small farm, a bar, and a cozy lodge. My vision included taking people heli-skiing and building a life that combined adventure, community, and financial sustainability. Leaving my last job and chasing a higher salary was supposed to bring me closer to that goal, but instead, I’ve found myself caught in a cycle of unfulfilling work and a lifestyle driven solely by money.

The truth is, I’m miserable working a 9-to-5 job. Chasing money hasn’t brought me closer to my dream—it’s only made me feel stuck, with my performance at work suffering as a result. I’ve recently come to realize that money isn’t my true driving factor, yet it still feels like the only way to eventually achieve the life I envision.

I’m fortunate to have few responsibilities right now—no kids, no major commitments—but I’m torn about what to do next. Should I stick with my high-paying job to keep saving for the dream? Should I chase a career in aviation and see where it leads? Or is there another path I haven’t considered?

Many people told me to try to stay for atleast 6 months and even i want to do that but the work and environment is making so very difficult to cope. They hired me as a fresher and barely into this job they set such unrealistic targets for me and when i tried communicating with them, they blame it on you. It happens with everything. You cannot win with them, no matter how much you try to reason with them or give me justifications for not being able to source a quality candidate, they don't understand and humiliate you in front of everyone. My manager is biased towards the people whom she likes and treats me like shit and makes comments on the way i talk or my economic background in front of everyone in performance meetings. Surviving each day is getting difficult day by day and it is taking a toll on my physical and mental health. When you try to reach out for help, they just say that there is something wrong with you or you have no skill or potential.

What should I do?

1hhn0kz,Confused about career path,"I earned my bachelor’s degree in General Studies because Ive explored many different classes and couldn’t settle on a specific path. I minored in Business Administration and Management. I’m artistic, creative, detail oriented, and technical. I have always loved working with kids. While I’ve considered teaching—something I think I’d be good at—I tend to feel overwhelmed very easily and am naturally pretty introverted.

I’ve thought of many career options like medical coding, teaching, startup business, and ultrasound tech, but some of these require additional education, and I’m unsure which path would be worth pursuing. I have the freedom to choose a direction, and while I’m not focused on finding a high-paying career, I want something meaningful and fulfilling.

1hhmp5d,"I want Job B more than Job A, what’s my move here? ","Hi, looking for advice on my current job situation. I just graduated college, going into my first job in my career field. Job A and B are the same position, but I prefer B due to the higher potential of professional growth/development, also the salary of A is way below industry standards. Here’s the dilemma: 

I interviewed with A first, then B a week later (this week).  A offered me the position prior to my interview with B, so i asked for a week prior to accepting in case B sends me an offer. Unfortunately, B is a much larger company and will take 1-2 weeks to make a decision. However, my interview with B went the best it could’ve gone and I know i have a very good chance of getting the job. 

I have to talk to A tomorrow morning about my decision, however my interview with B was very recent (a few days ago), and so not enough time has passed for them to make a decision.

I am trying to delay giving A an acceptance as much as possible so I can give B a chance, but I don’t want to come across flaky or that I am procrastinating (which I know that I am). How should i do this? 

My solution was to initially accept the offer, however I do need myself and my mentors to look over the contract prior to signing (this is my first job) , so I think that would buy me a few days and then reject later if i get an offer from B as I wouldn’t have signed anything yet? unfortunately it is the holidays which does slow things down a bit, and my tentative start date for A would be end of Jan. 

I know this is not the best approach and i know i will not come across as a good person but i seriously need help to really give B a fair shot 😭 i also will be going out of the country for a week in the next couple days for the holidays, which would probably slow things down even more which isn’t great. i also have to say i don’t mind A, and would’ve definitely accepted had B not existed. 

Would this work? what other way could i spin this to gain more time? is there a different way to approach this? any and all help is much appreciated!

Now I am wondering if I chose poorly and should consider another direction, go back to an older one, or come up with some hybrid version? I was enjoying the visualization part of Data Analysis (and learning  R and SQL), but I might be wasting time for such a low entry chance.

So I was almost done vacuuming anyway. So I just stopped for the rest of the night and stayed in the office. Away from the other 2 coworkers. And just cried my eyes out.

1hhl8t1,Do I address my boss making snarky and passive aggressive comments towards me and about me? ,"I started as a Recruiter/HR Coordinator for a small company a year ago. It’s an in-office role, but the company moved so my manager, the HR Director, works remote. She doesn’t see what I do all day but I keep her up to date. I haven’t made many mistakes, but she doesn’t let me forget the ones I have. I’m starting to notice it’s a pattern. 

The first instance was when I had to start a week after my original start date because I had Covid. She would bring this up for 6 months after. Usually saying “if you could’ve started when you were supposed to…” with a snarky tone and an example of something that could be added to my already full plate. 

Then I messed up sending a check while our accountant was on pto. I should’ve been more careful about this, but nothing came of it and the check was cashed. This was probably springtime, and she still brings up the time I messed up, like every few weeks to remind me to be more careful. This was a one off and I have demonstrated every time after that instance that I am careful and it was just an off moment. 

This week I requested 2 extra pto days over the holidays for my grandpas funeral. Maybe she didn’t read the note attached to my request or maybe she doesn’t care, but she’s brought it up in every meeting. We had a call with the GMs today and she said “[my name] has decided she needs extra pto after our holiday break (we get 1.5 weeks off but the funeral is the day we get back) so please make sure to get requests into her today.” It briefly made me consider missing the funeral, but I decided the my family is more important always (I struggle with boundaries at work). Then she said in our weekly check in that I need to take more ownership if I expect to take pto. I don’t really know what this means and I’m going to ask her about it tomorrow. I also might mention that I am taking this pto for a funeral. She knows that my grandpa and I were incredibly close and I’ve only used pto to visit him this year. 

It’s hard to convey tone in writing, but every instance of this has had a snarky, disproving, or passive aggressive tone attached. How do I address it with her? I could maybe let the regular reminder of the check thing go, but making me feel guilty for taking time off for a funeral is too far for me. Any advice?

1hhl7jr,How/If To Ask For A Promotion ,"Background:
- 2 years public accounting experience 
- CPA 
- 2 years industry accounting experience 
- 1 year financial analyst experience 

I have been at my current employer for 3 years. For the first two years I worked as a staff accountant and last January I moved over the the FP&A team as a financial analyst. This move came with a 15% pay increase and was presented to me as a promotion. 

Over the past 12 months I have had increasing responsibilities and have been able to work closely with leadership on a number of projects. Across the board, I received praise for my work and I believe I am a valued member of the team. 

What I am seeking some advice on is how to approach leadership for a promotion or clearer picture on the pathing to a promotion. My goal when I started at the company was to get to senior accountant in two years. The move to FP&A essentially took the place of that promotion. While the move was a substantial raise and a substantial increase in work, my title is still “entry level”. Most of the people I graduated college with are “senior” or higher in their organizations and I am starting to feel like every year spent is costing me on the backend.

How would I go about expressing my feelings about a promotion? Would I be in the wrong to express that given I was just “promoted” to financial analyst in January? 

Both my parents work for government and don’t really have great advice on how to approach things like this so hoping someone can provide their 2 cents. Thanks in advance.

1hhkywm,Non-technical manager asked me to document everything I’ve done before my contract expires—should I be worried?,"
Hello, I’m looking for some career advice. My non-technical manager recently asked me to document everything I’ve done so far without any formal training during my onboarding period. My contract is set to end in two months, but they haven’t given me any indication yet about whether they want to extend it or not.

I’m not sure how to interpret this request. Is it just for reference or knowledge sharing, or could it be a sign they’re planning not to keep me?

I’m the only one who truly gets things done, while other team members mostly talk without providing real assistance. At times, their troubleshooting skills leave much to be desired. Honestly, I do have a feeling that they want to learn from me, which I’m fine, but i didn’t learn anything from them (bluffing maybe).

I’ve been putting in a lot of effort to learn and contribute despite the lack of structured onboarding, but this situation is making me nervous. Should I:
	1.	Take it as a normal part of the process and not worry?
	2.	Use it as an opportunity to showcase my contributions and advocate for myself?
	3.	Start looking for other opportunities just in case?

i got an email from another job that i applied for, which is six hours closer to my college town than georgia, though still 3 hours away. i could more easily keep up with my friends from college, and visit them more frequently. this job would probably pay me less overall: the same pay rate but less hours. the job itself is exactly the same. they asked me if i am still interested in the job, and they sounded like they were in a hurry to hire for it seeing as it is meant to start in less than a month.


i’m trying to convince myself that i would make friends in georgia the same way i’ve made friends in similar instances, but i do miss my college friends. i would visit them probably twice during the six months anyway, but i could visit them every month at the other job.

I admit I messed up. I was only hired as an average worker but I became interested in the computers used for production. I played around and figured it out. Management was happy to have somebody with a knack for computers fall into their lap and I was happy to finally be needed after losing a couple of jobs this year alone.

For some reason, I am now tasked with teaching and leading the whole production team on those computers. I barely know what I'm doing. I'm not even the official supervisor. They hired someone else to be the actual production supervisor but they're busy being trained themselves. So they left me in charge. Of teenagers and young, young adults. I don't have the parental voice needed to tell them what to. And they need so much supervision that I can't work on the computers myself. Someone has to hold their hand to get them through a project from start to finish.

I don't know what to do. I'm doing the jobs of two people: a computer specialist and a supervisor despite still being a temp. (The temp agency won't let the boss buy out my contract.)

I’m currently working as a manager in the automotive industry (one of the fortune 200 companies). It’s a (mostly) stable job with good pay, but honestly, the work environment isn’t great, and it’s not something I see myself doing long-term. Plus in the automotive industry it's not uncommon to just get replaced or moved without any warming. After a long job search, I’ve received two offers, and I’m feeling pretty stuck on what to do.

One offer is for an IT internship at a credit union. It’s definitely a step in the direction I want to go, but the pay is lower, there are no benefits, and the commute is about an hour each way. The other offer is a salaried position at a casino that also pays less than what I make now. The commute is still long, but the schedule is more regular, which I like.

The pay cut for the salaried position would be pretty big like over $35,000 less and I’m not sure if I should make that kind of leap.

1hhixac,Manager threatened to terminate ,"My manager is threatening to terminate me if I don't make ""immediate"" improvements to my performance. She has gone again and again about my performance and my ability to think critically at my job. I work at a medical device company. 

One instance is that I would bring up some of my thoughts to the group including my manager and other managers about my thought on how to respond to a reviewer for a submission. It is meant to be a brainstorm session where I felt like I can freely speak my mind. Little did I know she took it as I did not do my due diligence and totally missed the basic knowledge that is required of my role. This was brought up at our development conversation as a miss. I don't understand how this would be brought up as a miss if I was just using the group as a sounding board. Sure I might be wrong in my thoughts, but that's what it's supposed to be for. One of the mantras of my company is that employees should feel free to speak up about whatever they feel and feel that they should be able to collaborate freely and not be judged. This does not seem to fit that at all. 

Honestly I cannot work with this manager. It is screwing with my mental health and I've been trying to look for a new role for a few weeks now. Her trying to threaten me to terminate just puts the icing on the cake. I can deal with this toxic environment. She is ""confident"" I can make immediate improvements. I don't want to stay for her to find out but at the same time one of the other pathways I can take is to move within the company to another operating unit, which would require me to stay with this manager.

1hhi62l,Nervous to tell job I am leaving,"Title says it all. I have been at this job since mid august and will have been there about 4 and a half months come January. I like my team, however I absolutely hate what I have been doing. Long story short, they fired someone two months ago and replaced him with me. I now receive daily emails from people asking about things I have absolutely no clue about. 

My day is filled with 8 hours of severe anxiety thinking about what email is going to come in next. My hours not spent working are spent thinking about this job. It is hard for me to even get out of bed in the morning. I wfh, however that’s more of a curse than a blessing atm. It’s much harder to get proper guidance this way, and I feel like I can’t take advantage of it because my time not working is spent worrying. I don’t enjoy the work, but I understand work is work. That isn’t the issue. The issue is the dread that I feel everyday not knowing what is going to pop up. It seems like when I finally have something figured out, three new things will pop up that I need to figure out. I really can’t take this anymore. 

I found a job near me that I am interviewing for, and if I get it I am most likely going to take it. That being said, I like my team and they’ve invested time training me. Just thinking about telling them I’m leaving makes me sick. I also feel horrible given that they essentially fired someone for me, only for me to leave two months later. 

Please, someone give me some advice. This has been the most stressful period of my life. This is only my second job out of school, the first one being only 8 months because the company went out of business. I didn’t like that job either, but at least i didn’t have a problem getting out of bed in the morning.",Chemical_Magician986,3,0.800000011920929,11,1734573960,2024-12-19 02:06:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hhi62l/nervous_to_tell_job_i_am_leaving/,12,2024
1hhi3mm,Am I crazy / being overly sensitive? Toxic culture ,"Long story short, I’ve been working at this new company for 5 ish months now. Everyone on my team is new, company has a culture of “building the plane as we fly it”manager is MIA and is just letting us roll with whatever building a framework for our customers with no clear direction, one of my teammates is a workaholic and is pushing that onto us as well..but isn’t very productive and meeting are pretty useless imo even when I try to keep the convo organized, sometimes we’re working until 11pm onsite last minute changing stuff even though we’ve all had time to review the materials prior..but no one took a close look (I was the one who developed it) and asked everyone for feedback. A ton of shit talking and passive aggressiveness..

Everyone I work with outside of my team also sounds super lost, no structure in place, burnt out, and to be honest very aggressive when they communicate with each other. I have never been in this environment and I’ve hopped around a bit. This is a diff industry than what I’ve been at before…but it’s a pretty old established organization so I was shocked how disorganized 

I’ve been thinking about quitting everyday for 2 months bc I mentally can’t take it anymore. I have enough savings and I have no major financial obligations (I live at home so not rent)

I completed a 5-day classroom training course and one day in the office, but when I went in, I just couldn’t handle it. The internal system, Lorenzo, was far too complicated, and I didn’t understand what was being explained. Even during the training week, I struggled to process and understand the materials being discussed. I sat in silence the whole time because I couldn’t keep up.

I’ve now sent my resignation email to my boss, and I feel terrible because I don’t know what I’m going to do for money or what kind of job I could even do. At the moment, I live at home with my parents and rely on benefits such as PIP and Universal Credit, so I don’t have any bills, but I still want to work. I’ve had bad luck with previous administration jobs, and I also struggle with anything mathematical because of my dyscalculia.

1hhh3u7,"Car sales for 9 years, want out, college opportunity. What do I do? ","*Introduction*

This is long winded but I want to provide complete context. As the title states, I've been in car sales for 9 years. My home life was always terrible and I moved out at 17. I struggled through life as most of us do and then I hit a lucky break with my current job when I started at 21. 

I come from a low cost of living and low wage area so I honestly thought the most I'd make in my life was 40k a year. I've worked my ass off in this job and have overcome a lot. This year I'm going to end at 112k. Financially, it has been a dream come true. I have a house, nice truck, max out my 401k/Roth IRA, and have a beautiful family that I provide for so my wife can homeschool. I get every Wednesday off and every other Saturday. Go home everyday for lunch. Come and go as I please. Work/life balance is very good. 



*Problem*

Those are the good things. There's things that I'm not comfortable living with and are the point of this post. 



1. Finances aside, the job itself is soul sucking. 

2. Everyday feels like a fight for your life. It's like living in a dog pound and there's one bowl of food that you have to scrap with the other dogs for to make sure you eat. After 9 years of it I'm tired. 

3. I'm in a low volume store, so, to be ""successful"" and make money you have to go for gross, period, which oftentimes becomes a very gray area of being unethical (hidden accessories, rate hikes, withholding trade in value etc.) This is no surprise and nothing new that people don't know about dealerships but it's a reality. I've convinced myself that it's ok, even though at the end of pretty much every day I feel like a piece of shit. I still do it though because that's the culture and that's the only way I can make money. 

4. Every single commission I have to get out a microscope to see how the sales manager has tried to fuck me. (Ironic, I know) I've caught him stealing from me countless times in various ways. 

5. Now for the cherry on top. They hired a new lady whose sole job is to answer every phone call (which we used to all race to get to as fast as possible) AND handle every single internet lead that comes in. So now, they've taken the most basic thing we had to make a living there. Our chance and opportunity to compete for the phone calls/internet traffic. Now you have to wait for her to bestow the CHANCE to sell a vehicle on you. What it's really done is create a control vacuum that funnels to the sales manager which is the owners son and on salary. Where it gets even worse is his brother is a salesman and also on salary mind you (conflict of interest much) and it just so happens he has gotten all of the biggest sales since she's started. 

6. All of this combined has whittled me down but the single worst thing of it all... (what sales truly is when you boil it down) the art of persuasion to acquire financial gain. I've stopped looking at people as people and as $100 bills. I've become half the man I used to be to make a buck. I have never worked a job that leaves me unfulfilled more than this one. It's like an addiction. You know it's bad but chase the high of the next big sale. 



That all leads into my dilemma. There's no job out there where I can make what I make here without expertise or a college degree. That feels paralyzing. However, I'm at the point I don't care. I want out even if it's for a lot less money, longer time to retirement, and comfort sacrifice to get there.



*Solution*

I've saved enough money and my mom is in a position and willing to help with my family so I can pursue a different career. I've scoured the earth for viable options and possible interests. 

The best option I've found that can be obtained in a reasonable amount of time (2 years) and have a guaranteed career directly out of school with good pay is a Radiologic Technician program at my local community college. All of my classes will be paid for by the state because of a program they have to get adults back to school and educated. 

Pros: New rewarding and fulfilling career, good starting pay compared to any other 2 year degree or program I've seen, job security/stability, and the opportunities for advancement once you get certified and in the field are many. 

Cons: Huge sacrifices and strain on my family. I will be giving up my career because it's not possible to do this program part time, will drain my savings/emergency fund, prolong retirement most likely significantly, and pay will be 40% less than what I currently make starting out. 


                    
*Closing*

What do you all think? Am I crazy to pursue this? Am I missing anything? Should I just suck it up, make my money, and retire as soon as possible? 

I think I've provided all of my thoughts, pertinent details, and open truths. I'd love some insight from an outside perspective. Any and all advice is much appreciated.

I asked my friends who also work “white collar” jobs about this and they said it’s normal and that over half of the job is just fluff. How is this sustainable?

These office jobs are the opposite, everyone is just on their phones or browsing the internet (id say 10% of office workers are busy the whole day and are actually useful) I had more fulfillment from my retail job I was doing during college because atleast I was busy for 90% of my shift.

1hhegi2,In My Head About Resignation,"Hey all. So I just really need to get this off my chest because I’m surprised by how much it’s getting to me. I quit my job which I’d only been at 7 months for. It was my second job, I was at the first one for 4 years. 

Reason for quitting was that I was approached with a  great opportunity which was hard to say no to, but I felt extremely guilty about making the decision, due to my short stint and also due to the team being smaller and close knit (as opposed to my first, which was a much larger firm), it just felt more personal even though I know ideally it shouldn’t. The timing also unintentionally worked out such that a chunk of my notice (not all) falls within the year end shutdown period. I didn’t plan for that to happen, and even agreed to work an extra 4 days on their request.

Initial reaction to my resignation was positive and supportive but today I went into the office for the first time after the announcement. And I could feel something was off. Nobody was outright rude, but some comments were made. “I bet you feel like you’re stabbing the team in the back haha”, “And to think you were just casually going about doing a presentation at the end of year party last week haha”, “Wow so your notice is basically just paid leave haha?” And there was also my team leader who for some reason couldn’t make eye contact with me when thanking the team for their efforts this year. I know I was here for a short time but I put in my best, and they have all commended my contributions in the past.

With the comments, I laughed along and even explained my side at the time, like oh I feel bad about the timing etc. but have been feeling really weird about the whole thing since coming home. Who knows, maybe I’m picking apart things which don’t mean anything. In any case, I know I probably won’t be upset about this in a few days. I do feel stupid about the guilt I was feeling initially as well as all the apologetic explaining I did though...",DownButNotOut9,2,1.0,3,1734563065,2024-12-18 23:04:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hhegi2/in_my_head_about_resignation/,12,2024

1hhd214,Forced career change,"
Can’t afford law school. I owe too many loans to borrow any more. I’ve been in the legal field for a decade , early 30s. I’ve worked every position except attorney, just to give context to the depth of my experience. Since I can’t afford it, I racked my brain to think of other masters programs I could afford and get some use out of. I chose MBA at a school that I can afford. I just pay out of pocket …. im graduating in a few months and I’m not excited at all…. And I am also seeking a certificate in data analysis. I’ll elaborate on my motivations in the comments for the mba and data analysis if anyone asks, but for the sake of this initial post I’ll move past that part for now. Either way I’m going to be a complete and total beginner in the next decade of my life, again. That hurts deeply when you felt intrinsically connected to your vocation and not actively SEEKING a career change. I don’t love the law because it’s “impressive”, I truly enjoy it even with the stress it brings

I’ve been feeling so bitter and angry that everything I’ve worked towards feels like a complete waste of my time. I’ve wanted to be an attorney my entire life. I chose to work my way from the bottom just to foster a deeper appreciation for all the team work involved. I realize that isn’t something everyone would appreciate but I did feel I was doing what was best for me. It also sucks legal field is one that doesn’t allow for transferable skills in the marketplace unless you were an actual attorney. Nobody cares otherwise….its gatekept in ways that usually doctors and psychologists can relate to. 

I passed up so many opportunities to have more fun or just be more present in life, etc.because I was so laser focused on my future as an attorney. I’ve been saving like crazy trying to pay my loans down enough where I can afford to attend a good law school. But saving for a rainy day is hard when it feels like it rains every day. Always something going wrong depleting my savings. My lovely child has autism and my father just beat cancer, just a couple of things going on in my life that create a lot of stress for me….but it’s just the tip of the iceberg. So I’m trying to find joy in this season of my life and appreciate where I am now but I just can’t.

1hhcujw,Should I quit my job for something less ideal?,"I need some advice because I’m at a breaking point with my current job. I’ve been interviewing for internships in the career I’m pursuing in college, which is a step toward my dream job. The problem is, these internships are further away, have worse hours, and pay less than what I make now as a manager in the automotive sector. On the surface, it sounds like a bad move, but my current situation is pushing me to consider it.

My workplace is a revolving door with no sense of job stability. People are constantly leaving, and I recently got a pay cut, which feels like a slap in the face given everything else I’m dealing with. I’ve been trying to manage this as best as I can for the last six or seven months, but I’m at the point where I just don’t have patience for it anymore.

Team dynamics are a huge issue. One team member has been on FMLA for six months, and even before they left, they barely worked due to constantly calling out. While I’m empathetic to health-related issues, this has gone way beyond reasonable. Another team member is pregnant and constantly uses it as an excuse for poor performance. Every time I bring up a mistake, they dismiss it with, “Oh, that’s just my pregnancy brain.” It’s infuriating because I can’t even address it openly. HR is completely unresponsive, and store management doesn’t support me.

On top of that, I’m dealing with sexism and belittlement from management, which just adds to the stress. I’m essentially doing multiple jobs for less pay, and when I make a disciplinary decision, I get yelled at for not consulting HR or management—even though I do, and they never respond in a timely manner.

I genuinely love being a manager and working with most of my team, but the toxic environment has made me dread going to work every single day. I don’t know what’s worse stressing over making less money in an internship or continuing to stress in this situation. I genuinely love some of my coworkers and two members of my team are absolutely fantastic and I would hate to see a poor manager take my place. Has anyone been through something like this? How did you decide whether to stick it out or take a risk for the long-term goal?

1hhbbo2,My boss's boss will be there for the HR meaning. What does this mean?,"I am a student nurse at a large hospital. And I have been working at a new unit for about two months, and my boss has made it a living hell. During orientation, my preceptors said I needed to improve on some things. So even though I have passed orientation and everything on my skills checklist - he continues to call me a low-performing employee. I went to HR because he wouldn't let me go part-time for school solely because he didn't trust me to maintain my skills. And said that only very proficient CNAs can go part-time. I asked him what sort of skills he wanted from me and how to measure and achieve them - he just kept dodging the question. No other coworkers have any issues with me, and I get great patient reviews. This man has also never seen me work.

Having a boss who verbally abuses me and then reprimands me for not being confident enough in my duties has been driving me insane - I have needed to adjust my medication and go to emergency therapy. So, as a last-ditch effort, I went to HR and explained that I wanted to do an early transfer of units or do an amiable resignation. A different unit has offered me a position, but since I am still a newer employee, my boss has to sign off on it. But unfortunately, instead of my boss just signing off on a transfer, we will be having a meeting with an HR representative present. 

Yesterday I got a call and found out that my boss's boss will also be there. She has nothing to do with hiring or firing me. Or anything to do with me for that matter. Instead, she is the chief nursing administrator for the building.

I chose ECE because my undergraduate major was in Electronics and Telecommunication, and the semiconductor and chip industry is projected to experience significant growth, leading to abundant job opportunities in the U.S. This practical consideration is the primary reason behind my decision to pursue ECE.

1hhal2y,I really need advice ,"I’m a heating and air conditioning technician. I have been in the industry for 10 years now. I was working for a company for about a year. I have two friends that worked at another HVAC company in the area and were saying really good things about the company they work for. Eventually they got the owner to have me come in for an interview. 

After the interview my friends kept asking me what I thought. The owner of this company that I had an interview with gave me $6 more an hour, along with better benefits. In my mind it just made sense for me to make the change and I felt kinda pressured from my friends to take the job. 

I thought about it and made the decision to make the move. Last night I put in my two weeks notice and as I was doing it I had a feeling I was making the wrong decision but I still decided to go with it. 

I turned in my company van/tablet this morning and feel like I left off on a pretty good note with them. I told my new boss and he decided to have me come into the office to start training for my new job. 

I started my new job this morning as well and the first thing my new boss starts talking about is how he is debating on firing two new technicians because of their performance. He was saying that he doesn’t want “to be that guy” who fires someone right before Christmas. 

It made me feel extremely uneasy when he said this and my anxiety took off.. The whole day today I have had extremely bad anxiety along with a gut wrenching feeling that I made the wrong decision by leaving the company I was working at. 

I’m literally debating on calling my old boss later this evening to explain to him how I feel and to ask for my old job back… I don’t want to be wishy washy here but I really feel like I should have not quit… 

I don’t know what to do or how to handle this situation without looking like a total idiot. Any advice would be extremely helpful on how I can navigate this situation.

I still immensely love engineering, but hunting for placements has opened my eyes to the dogshit salaries of this career. Unfortunately, I followed my parents' advice of doing what I like most instead of weighing up other factors too, such as wages and quality of life. I want to become a high value male, and the piss poor wages of engineering offers me very little opportunities to become one.

|Further Maths|A\*|
|Physics|A\*|
|Chemistry|A\*|

1hh9ggi,Is my recruiter gaslighting me about my contract terms?,"Back in September, I started a contract job for four months. Throughout the entire process it was made very clear and explicit to me that it was a 4 month contract to hire position. Throughout my time here, I've been repeatedly told I'm doing well and that I'd be a good fit when the time comes to be hired permanently. My contract is supposed to end next month. So I went to my boss just to ask him about the future plan here, because they've been oddly quiet about things. 

My boss was visibly confused and he told me that my contract was for six months. I thought I was crazy since this was the very first time I heard about my contract being six months long. But I looked back on my orientation forms and saw that I did indeed sign a 4 month contract. The next day I brought this up in a meeting with my boss, and the recruiting agency that hired me to this position. Nothing much came of it beside them repeatedly saying that the contract I signed was a mistake, my original recruiter made a mistake and doesn't work with them anymore. They also dedicated every third sentence to tell me that I'm doing well and that I'm amazing and great and that they entirely intend to hire me at the end of my six month contract, which did nothing but make me doubt that fact specifically.

I figure this meeting was intended to reassure me but now what I originally perceived as a misremembering or a miscommunication from one person or the other seems far more suspicious to me.

I WFH and there was a pay period I clocked 80hours however they cannot verify those hours.  I was told I'd be paid for every hour of training I did.    

In the email where she sent my past paychecks, she told me no payment was due.  I responded by asking for an explanation as to why.  I was an intern therefore I was supposed to work under someone.  They cannot verify 80 hours of work I did, are they just in not paying me for that?  Also in the payout system I can see I have several hours of vacation time I have yet to be paid for.

1hh5wcq,Feeling hopeless about building a career and my financial future.,"Since graduating college, I’ve struggled to find consistent employment. When I’ve had a job, it usually hasn’t paid enough to cover my bills, rent, and other essentials comfortably. The stress has built up to the point where thinking about my future feels completely hopeless and depressing.

I graduated with a bachelor’s in Communications (Radio/TV/Film) and initially worked as a scenic fabricator, making $20/hour. I enjoyed the work but eventually wanted a change. I moved to Chicago, thinking it would bring more opportunities, but after a year, I still feel like I'm scrambling.

Early on, I found some freelance gigs that lasted anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months. I later got a job similar to my first one at a scenic studio, but the long commute and toxic work environment made it unsustainable. Now, I’m working locally as a receptionist which I've really enjoyed, but it’s only 30 hours a week at $18/hour. Despite my best efforts to budget, I keep running out of money and have started relying on my credit card far more than I'd like.

I’ve been networking and applying to jobs in my field, but have gotten almost no leads. I can’t help but feel like I wasted my time in college. Anytime I consider working on a passion project, it feels like a waste because I'm not actively applying to jobs. It’s crushing to feel like I must not have the skills or drive needed to build a sustainable career.

I want to be successful. I want to work hard. But no matter how much effort I put in, I can’t seem to break into an environment where I can thrive. I’ve been considering going back to school for design, thinking it might help me transition into a role with better pay, but I’m even doubting my ability to get back into school.

I don’t know what I’m hoping to gain from posting this. I guess I’m looking for advice or encouragement from anyone who’s been in a similar situation. It’s painful to want so badly to work and grow, only to feel stuck and unable to find a way forward.",lennothan,1,1.0,0,1734540786,2024-12-18 16:53:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hh5wcq/feeling_hopeless_about_building_a_career_and_my/,12,2024

I had an agreement with the director that saving the company money under this additional task would be reflected in my end of year bonus, we were talking about 1% and I have receipts. Submitted it to my manager and had no reply as if he's ignoring it.

1hh5kbp,Career Advice: Banking Product Management vs Digital Product Management,"
Hello! 
I’m an MBA from tier-1 B-school in Canada and have been part of a rotational program at a Bank in Canada. I’m coming to an end of the program and am confused in deciding whether to go the business route (product manager for chequing/saving, CC, etc.) or a digital PM (banking app, website, internal software).

My background has always been in strategy, consulting with focus on storytelling with data, customer-centricity, etc.
I am inclined towards digital but most digital requirements come from business product management teams which would just leave me for execution work.

However, it would be easier to switch industries if I go digital route as compared to business route. I also want to go where jobs won’t be eliminated in the next 10/15/20 years.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!

My problem in this regard is that I've never had any sort of training in rhetoric, especially when it comes to delivery.

So how can I learn this sort of stuff?  (The inflections, the hand gestures, the power to seduce and persuade, etc.)  I take it I'd need to learn the theory first and then I'd also need to spend a lot of time practicing it under the direction of some sort of a coach, almost like a performance or something.

But, further, how do I mask the psychosomatic symptoms which accompany the natural sense of nervousness and all that?

(I recall somebody a while back recommended that I check out Toastmasters.  So I was going to do that, but all the local Toastmasters meetings had been cancelled (this was right after COVID).

1hh4ahy,Should I go back to my old job,"I quit my old job about 9 months ago.  I was taking on the brunt of the managerial duties.  The boss had been thrust into a position at City Hall but was not willing to give up his role as Chief of our department ( wanted to be in control of everything).  He expected me to do it without the increase in pay and noted it is just part of my duties all while being paid the same as all the other employees whose responsibilities were far less than my own.  

He had also bad mouthed me to another company about something that was a completely untrue rumor (apparently I was after his job and had written a letter and ‘slipped it under the door at City Hall’; his close friend/contractor turned employee kept him paranoid of all other employees, especially the ones who worked hard; I assume in an effort to keep himself aligned as the bosses only close ally).  

I wanted to get a higher classification in the field I work which requires you to test and have worked 5 years to achieve.   You would think you would want the most qualified employees you could have at a workplace.  When I asked him if it was ok he said he would fire me if I tried to do that because it was not required at the company we worked (he did not have this classification and I assume he felt threatened). In hindsight, I realize this probably contributed to his paranoia.

Even with all this I left on good terms by saying that I needed to move on because of stress. (which was true but didn’t mention it was because of his actions directly).  He called me the other day because another employee is quitting and he will only have one licensed employee because all the other ones he has hired cannot pass any of their licensing tests. They need those licensed employees to attend the building because it cannot be attended solely by some without this license.  

I have a baby on the way now and the company I left that employer for pays slightly less than my old job.  (42000 compared to 47000). The old job also has more employees to cover shifts and the ability to have weekends off.  My current employer currently does not have weekends off and I don’t mind that for now but I fear I may in another 5 years once the child reaches school age.  

I’d like to believe my old boss would not make threats or may be less paranoid because he is watched much more closely by his superiors because they now have an HR department which they didn’t prior.  

I don’t really want to leave my current job because even though the pay is less it is much less stressful and everyone is great to work with including all the higher ups.  I’m working on getting another full time employee hired at my current job so we can alternate weekends when the time comes that I need some off.

I worked in a junior role for around 3 years, performed pretty well, enjoyed the job, and then moved to a new company for a higher ranking role.

I'm enjoying the work at the new job I've been at for around 6 months but it's definitely above my skill level and I'm struggling with the required workload. I'm often finding myself (secretly) working long extra hours (sometimes 15+ hours, skipping meals, etc) but I've still been told I'm working too slowly. Basically I am very tired, and starting to wonder if the self sabotaging is really worth it. I have a lot of anxiety that if I get let go for underperforming I'll struggle to find other positions because getting fired for that reason would be a big red flag. 

Also just want to reiterate, the company is good, I actually do enjoy the work in doing, I just feel like my skill isn't high enough.

Just hoping for some general advice on how to deal with this. 31M.  ",Sad_Carpet_9581,6,1.0,3,1734524824,2024-12-18 12:27:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hh0hlu/working_extra_hours_due_to_underperforming/,12,2024

1hgwao7,Will this experience mean anything,"
Just graduated college a week ago with a finance degree from a state school. I’ve been working as an accounts receivable specialist for about a month and a half now.

I very quickly realized that this is a glorified data entry job, and I can’t stand it, I never even enjoyed accounting in general. My goal is to be in some sort of analyst position, or even a sales position.

My question is, is it a bad idea to quit this job within the next month and move to a new city, with no job lined up but good connections and basically scrub this job from my resume, or continue in this role for the time being?

 I have a gut feeling that even if I stick it out in this role, accounts receivable is such a joke of a job that it won’t even look good on my resume, and that I should just take a leap of faith.",wardalertnation,1,0.6600000262260437,1,1734505996,2024-12-18 07:13:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hgwao7/will_this_experience_mean_anything/,12,2024

I currently work for a large commercial printing company and have 5 years experience in finance all with this company.

1hgvl4y,I was lied to by my boss at my last company,"A little bit over a year ago I started working in an IT helpdesk position for a biotech company called Cepheid. It was through this Indian IT consultant company called HCL which has a reputation for being a toxic company to work for. To make matters worse I was being subcontracted by another company which meant I was not being paid as much as the people who were full-time with HCL. The best way I could describe the position is that it is a toxic sweatshop. The manager was the type of person who would not do any actual work himself or provide solutions. All he would do is crack the whip and make unreasonable demands about the number of tickets we should all close in a day. He would also yell at employees and mean-mug people. In the first 6 months 7-8 people left and I should have followed their lead. 3-4 months in my manager made me a promise that he would convert me full time with the company if I gave him 2 months. When 2 months passed by he told me to give him 1-3 months. When 6 months passed, he told me that there was a stipulation in my contract that I must stay with my subcontracting company for at least a year before I could be hired full-time and get a raise.

It was confusing to me because the employees who were full-time with HCL did not know or do half as many things as I did, but he reassured me just to wait it out and it would all work out in the long term. He told me that it is an industry-wide problem and that there are people with fewer skills and experience who get paid more than him. I soon realized that the only reason he worked there was because HCL was sponsoring his H1B Visa. A year passed by and my manager still told me he needed more time. He would always nitpick the smallest mistake for the reason he wasn't able to give me the raise despite being one of the most productive technicians there. It was at this point that I was the only person who was being subcontracted and they were essentially telling me I had to be the most productive technician there while also getting paid the least. I soon realized that the only reason he worked there was because HCL was sponsoring his H1B Visa. I made this the last straw and gave my two-week notice. At the start, he acted like he wasn't going to stop me and he had a grin on his face happy that he was able to successfully hustle me out of working hard for nothing. As the end of the 2 weeks was getting closer he asked me if I could stay another 2 months. I told him no and he just stared at me like a weirdo until he said, ""Easy day?"" I looked at him mockingly pretending that I was worried and he just took a deep breath and looked up at the sky before staring down at the ground in a defeated-looking position.

This was a damaging experience for me. I can not believe I was so naive to trust that evil, abusive excuse for a manager. I feel like I wasted an entire year of my life. The only silver lining I can see is the new skills that I learned while in that job.

Was I naive for not leaving sooner? How can I get over the fact that I wasted so much time and effort?",Just_Party96,5,1.0,7,1734503022,2024-12-18 06:23:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hgvl4y/i_was_lied_to_by_my_boss_at_my_last_company/,12,2024
1hguyp1,Should I negotiate a promotion raise when the salary offered is in line with market average?,"I was just presented with a promotion today and need to give a final answer by tomorrow. I've already been doing 50% of the job for the last year and will be going from 1 direct report to 5, three of which are new hires that I will need to train. They're offering me a 16% base increase and my bonus is going from 15% to 25% which will put me at 150k total for a senior digital marketing manager role. After researching several external job sites, this is average.

For additional context, I've played hard ball a little bit lately and it's definitely caused some tension between my boss and I. About a month ago, he tried to strong arm me into taking a role I didn't really want without a pay bump and I had expressed frustration that I was being underpayed for my role and the value I've brought. After a lot of back and forth and his general unwillingness to work with me, I turned it down. Now I've been offered this promotion that is much more in line with what I'd like to be doing and comes with a raise. I don't want to leave money on the table but I also don't want to come off as overly aggressive (especially as a woman). Had I not had the situation with my boss a month ago I would have no problem at least trying to negotiate. He's also said that if I ask for more, it has to go through higher levels of approval which could take time/end up in HR purgatory and he really needs to get this in place by 12/29.",Eggo0308,4,1.0,10,1734500563,2024-12-18 05:42:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hguyp1/should_i_negotiate_a_promotion_raise_when_the/,12,2024

1hguqqk,Anyone have career advice for a Finance/Technology Recruiter who was offered to internally pivot to a Senior Recruiting & HR Technology Product Manager role? ,"I work for a Fortune 500 grocery chain in Technology. Starting out in 2021 as a Senior Tech Recruiter I successfully recruited a high number of Data and Software Engineers for 2 years of all leves from entry level all the way to Senior Director roles, and when they laid off 30% of our Recruiting Force a year and a half ago I was asked if I wanted to pivot into a new role - Typically known as a Product Owner, Product Manager, or Technology Lead, I act as a Liaison between the recruiting business and the HRIT team to push Oracle product development in the right direction, manage and drive the backlog in Jira and Confluence, meet with the HRIT team in daily standup meetings, and conduct all UAT for changes made to Oracle. 

My boss at the time also pivoted into the same group I was pivoting into, and I was made a Senior Product Manager, reporting to him as his only direct report. 

There wasn’t a lot of clarity in the role. At first it was scheduling and conducting lots of demos for 3rd party AI recruiting companies, followed by creating a massive RFP suggesting to suggest bringing one of them on. But as time has gone by I’ve had less and less to do. 

I’ve asked my current boss various times for additional work responsibilities that I could take on and haven’t gotten anywhere with those. He politely thanks me for asking but there isn’t a whole lot to do right now, mentions potential future projects, etc. 

Now his boss just left the company and it seems some things are going to shift so I’m wanting to consider other opportunities but because I just switched career space from Recruiting to Product I feel like its unfamiliar territory and I’m not sure what to do. Any assistance is greatly appreciated.

1hgrtto,I'm Experiencing Compassion Fatigue & Burnout While Being Exploited - S.O.S,"I work for a fairly large company in a specific part of the automotive industry. 

I used to the be the Administrative Assistant. While in that role, I was frequently shoved with more and more work by my then supervisor and he was becoming more and more absentee due to work getting shuffled onto him. On occasion, I managed to dodge it through protections from HR, but more often than not I would wind up just doing it for the experience and recognition (and to avoid the guilt-tripping I would get from my supervisor) which I often hoped would finally result in decent pay and/or a promotion. 

It never did, of course. 

I wound up doing research for 6 months into why I was so miserable and how I could convince management that they needed to hire more admins. According to Wilson Group research, I was doing the work of 6 on-site admins and 18 virtual (I am the fastest responder at the company...unfortunately). Our company went from roughly 200 people from when I first started to about 700 now. They wound up offering me a transfer into a different department--I would act as backup admin but someone else would take over the full role. 

I would be working a highly experimental role--one that didn't actually exist until I stepped into it. I wrote the business processes for the role + the parameters. In fact, I've since written 12 business processes for other departments which now require an NDA to access. Our software engineer wants me as a business analyst since I seem to be so oddly adept at it. I guess that's what can happen after observing over administrative departments (HR, Leadership, Accounting, etc.) for over 3 years.   
  
The problem is: I am still backup admin which meant they could still use me for more research-based projects. As a result, I've officially been roped into 3 different projects at work, including developing our first marketable remote learning program (the first in this particular part of the automotive industry as well) for agents. The head trainer (who I had to train how to use the new LMS & educational content sheet--he is extremely tech-inept and I somehow made the process enjoyable for him??) is extremely appreciative, grateful, and has already nominated me for our special employee of the month award (which is huge). I've already won it once so I doubt I'll win it again. 

Upper management, however? Literally can't give me the time of day. I've had this happen with multiple projects with them and it's upsetting every time. Our director is the COO's yes, man, get's assigned something he swears is small (but is actually big), delegates it to me, I do the thing, but while I ALWAYS design it like I'm going to leave it for someone else to do, usually management (more accurately, the Director) recognizes they bit off more than they can chew and I get saddled with it permanently (annnnd it usually gets set on a backburner until it can't be ignored any longer). What's more is that I very rarely get any recognition for these even though they have my name written all over it. Sometimes literally. It doesn't matter.

Many of whom I train are employees who can't afford to go on FMLA or short term disability, so we offer them the chance to ""work the sheets"" from home for a while. The setup is actually kind of generous -- several I've taught have been working under me for over 3 months. Unfortunately, they are starting to go back to their regular positions, and I am starting to feel the burn. 

Now, about the new admin. The new admin is young, determined, a ""hard worker""...but insecure and immature. We've had multiple issues with her--one where she accused me of workplace bullying because of...sound? She thought I was banging around the office just to scare her when I wasn't even in her direct vicinity? Actually accused me of coordinating it too--threatened me and told me I would be found out for it.     
  
As a result, her performance in my current role's work has dropped significantly (I kind of help run a hybrid department). She went from being able to handle administrative duties + 500-600 account audits (it's literally just looking for paperwork in systems--takes 1 min 30 secs per account on average) a week to next to none at all. I initially thought it may be due to time constraints in Admin and a lowered morale due to...""perceived"" slights...but no--I have access to everything she does--all is technically normal EXCEPT for helping me with the work that I'm currently doing for the other department on the side. Saw that one coming. I tried to get her yanked off earlier since I can't trust a smile & seether, but management claims her impact is too high. Now, it's obviously too low. So once again, I am getting shuffled a lot of extra work.

I'm going to be very, VERY honest: I am SEVERELY underpaid. I am being paid $19.50 an hour (standards of living are lower in my state: TN) in this role when it should've been a promotion given the work and LEVEL of work I do. I already told my manager my preferred number (bare minimum: $21.63) in my review and asked how I could get there. I've been given generous raises as high as 11% and as low as 5% (this year), but never under. I already did the research prior to my annual review and I was under market. The trade off, she says, is that I'll never be bored. She's right...but at what cost?

Considering how much work I do for the company, considering how much I save them and how much productivity I create, I am livid. My BP's the highest it's ever been (I'm averaging 153/94 more often than not now), I'm exhausted, crying to and from work...etc. I finally realized it was severe burnout + compassion fatigue when I started losing the ability to empathize. 

One of the reason's I've stayed is because of a good manager and management's willingness to work with you. My current supervisor (another Director)  is a lovely, kind woman who lets me vent when necessary, has been kind enough to include me in her 1:1 rotation even though I am not a manager underneath her (even though I should be), and I explained I needed more time off or OOO. The greatest part of the role switch was being able to WFH at least one day a week. She offered me an additional day and some extra makeup hours which was better than having to go on FMLA. This would be wonderful...if I could actually take time off? I'm the only full-time person in my ""hybrid"" department.

While I love that Director, I'm slowly hating the other one who's more ""connected"" with upper management and who keeps saddling me with more and more work. I'm fairly certain I'm being actively exploited. Aside from attempting to take more time off or finding a new job (I come home, cry and try - usually unsuccessfully - to fall asleep--I don't even have any energy to burn to put in more job applications and I used to go on interviews once every 3 months), what else can I do?   
  
I've been told by a few managers to go directly to the COO through an appointment and explain how underpaid I am compared to the work I'm producing but I feel like that may be overkill. I have another 1:1 on Thursday--I hope to address the need for incentives since I feel like over half of my coworkers get bonuses and I never see anything extra ever. 

Send help. I'm too tired to keep going at this. I'm afraid I'll be a stroke victim soon, and I'm only 34.

1hgrqas,Transitioning to a medical related career with patient interaction- Seeking advice,"
Hi everyone,

I’m currently working in a non-medical field, but I’m seriously considering transitioning into a healthcare role where I can interact with patients and work in a hospital setting. I’m looking for something that aligns with a salary range of at least 120-150k USD once I gain experience.

I am a Product Desinger. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering (Computer Science), Masters in Information Technology (Human-Computer Interaction) and a Masters in Business Administration. 

Honestly, I’m lost. I have gone down a career path hoping that I would like the job I get into, but Ive dreaded every role I’ve been in. I’m seriously evaluating my career choices. I want to switch to a more fulfilling career rather than what I’ve been doing so far. I’ve always been interested in medicine, but i wasn’t able to explore those opportunities when I was younger. 

I’m open to putting in the time and effort for education, training, or certifications, but I’d love to hear from people who’ve made a similar switch or have experience in patient-facing medical roles.
    •    What roles would you recommend?
    •    How long does it take to get there?
    •    Any tips on getting started (programs, certifications, or pathways)?

I want something fulfilling where I can truly make a difference in people’s lives. Your advice would mean a lot to me. Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts and experiences!",hunt3rasdf,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1734489422,2024-12-18 02:37:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hgrqas/transitioning_to_a_medical_related_career_with/,12,2024

Right now the family business makes around 200k annually but after expenses my share is only 50k annuallly which isn't bad for a 21 year old who lives with their parents but isn't sustainable for the future if they plan to have a family.

1hgrfa8,Unsure what to do,"I’m feeling lost, upset, and confused, and I’m hoping to get some advice on how to handle this situation professionally. It’s been taking a serious toll on my mental health.

Here’s a summary of what’s been happening:

I currently work as a Legal Assistant (my official title) but have 10 years of experience as a Paralegal. For the past three years, I’ve essentially been performing two roles, supporting both an Attorney and a Senior Commercial Property Manager (PM).

In July 2024, I requested a desk audit and a $20k salary increase because I felt underpaid and undervalued for the scope of work I’ve been doing. I submitted a detailed three-page report outlining my accomplishments, along with exhibits to support my request. While the desk audit was approved, it has yet to be conducted.

Around the same time, I learned that the PM I work under will be retiring in a year. I proactively requested a meeting to express my interest in the role, my desire to grow, and my willingness to take on additional responsibilities. Since then, I’ve been assigned more work.

Side note: For almost two years, I’ve been working part-time as a property manager to gain additional experience and strengthen my case for this position. I also included this in my desk audit documentation.

However, the desk audit was paused when senior leadership placed me in a two-week trial to fully cover for the PM. Based on client feedback and my own assessment, I believe I did an excellent job. My recent yearly performance review was also very positive.

In August, a new Deputy Executive Director (DED) joined the organization, and the PM position falls under their oversight. In November, the Executive Director (ED) asked me to provide a breakdown of my job functions, split by role, along with the percentage of time spent on each.

Shortly after Thanksgiving, I asked the PM if there had been any updates. She mentioned that the DED had someone in mind externally for the position. I was shocked.

Last week, the Attorney I work with told me that the DED wants to hire this external candidate, but there’s been pushback because the role is supposed to go through the proper hiring process.

At this point, I feel sick and incredibly stressed. I’ve taken on extra responsibilities, covered for the PM during her vacation, and have been included on all her emails—all in an effort to demonstrate my ability to take on this role.

I drafted a respectful email to the DED and ED to inquire about the desk audit and salary increase and provide some of my background for the DED. However, I’ve decided not to send it because…

Yesterday, a job posting for the PM position was shared internally and externally. Many of the job functions I previously sent to the ED are reworded into the job description. The listed salary is approximately $40k more than what I currently make for doing both roles.

To add to this, several employees in the company recently received significant raises and salary grade adjustments. I didn’t receive anything. I’m at a loss and unsure how to move forward. My performance reviews have been consistently positive, and I’ve never received negative feedback, so this situation feels especially confusing.

I understand that office politics play a role, but I feel blindsided and taken advantage of. While I’m trying to stay strong and remind myself that at least I now have the opportunity to apply for the role, I’m incredibly discouraged. The thought of having to tweak my resume and draft a cover letter over the holidays—knowing they likely already have someone in mind—is disheartening.

I’d greatly appreciate any advice or insight on how to navigate this situation.",Rememberthetacos,1,1.0,0,1734488427,2024-12-18 02:20:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hgrfa8/unsure_what_to_do/,12,2024
1hgr72o,Career Advancement,"I am a 24-year-old single man who wants to use college to go further in my career field. Ultimately I want to use my mind to make money instead of my body. I was wondering what options I have where my background is relative.

I am an arc welder by trade. I’ve been to technical college and worked in the trade for almost 5 years now. After I graduated from trade school I joined the local sheet metal union as an apprentice welder. I started in structural welding (Flux core and 6010) on a cement plant shutdown, then took a job as a ductwork apprentice building a nuclear facility. I hung a lot of ductwork, but most of my employment was focused on layout for both the welders and the drillers. I got pretty good at accurately (we had a 1/16” tolerance for hangers) getting the provided print onto the floor and into the air. I worked there for a year before I left the union and took a production MIG job building tractor implements where I learned how to simply, practically MIG weld. After almost two years, the monotony and repetition finally got to me and I decided to move on to where I am now. I currently work in a good-sized machine shop (40 machines with 60+ employees) as 1 of 3 fabricator/welders. I’ve been with my employer for coming up on 2 years now and have learned more here than I ever knew was possible, but I feel like I have started planing out. Most of the time I spend building and the welding is mainly TIG aluminum and MIG. I do a lot of blending with a grinder and run a pipe bender often. I can confidently say that I have an above-average understanding of how to get metal to do what I need it to do and I don’t struggle much with the geometrical aspect of blueprint comprehension. I actually think I do better with the abstract part of fabrication than the actual fabrication itself. To me math is math, and it’s constant. If the measurements and angles are right on the print, then they will always work in the shop. If they don’t work, then somebody made a mistake. That being said, I could see myself doing something related to engineering but I’m not fixed on that.

1hgr3z9,Advice Choosing Internship.,"Hi everyone,

I'm a mathematics engineering student in Chile, and I'm facing a dilemma regarding my internship options.

On one hand, I have the opportunity to participate in research on minimal surfaces, which involves geometry and partial differential equations (PDEs). These are topics I'm deeply passionate about and eager to learn more about.

On the other hand, I'm in the selection process for an internship at a bank where I would be working on machine learning and related tasks. I understand that machine learning is currently a booming field, and career opportunities in Chile in general are somewhat limited. Additionally, the bank internship offers a stipend of 300,000 CLP, which is considered quite good for an internship.

The challenge is that while I find the bank's proposal appealing and recognize its potential for future career opportunities—such as a permanent position if I perform well—I don't particularly enjoy statistics or machine learning as much as pure mathematics.

I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons of both options. Should I follow my passion for research and delve into a field I truly enjoy, or should I prioritize the practical benefits of gaining experience in an industry that's currently in high demand?

I’d really appreciate any advice on how to make decisions like this when it comes to career choices. Have you ever faced a similar situation? What factors should I consider to make the best decision?

1hgqxkr,Advice for transitioning out of being a techinician.,"Wassup Redditors!

I am currently looking to transition out of being a technician. I have been a Tech in different fields such as lighting maintenance and Internet Service Provider tech. I like what I do but my body is not going to be able to do it forever. I have an interest in Data Analytics and am currently enrolled in a Coursera course for Intro to Data Analysis. Upon looking into both in office and remote positions I quickly realized that all these ""Entry Level"" positions require either a Bachelors degree or 3-5 years of experience with programs that are not yet introduced in my first weeks of my courses. My main question is, are there any ""ex techs"" that have successfully transitioned out of being a field technician? If so what advice would you give to someone who is looking to do so and were you able to stay in the same industry. For clarification, I can not just go to school full time and pursue 4 year degree without piling up debt I will never pay off. I like Coursera and its ability to let me complete the program on my own time. Any and all advice/ questions welcome.

1hgqc1w,Career decision- Morgan Stanley WM or Real Estate Asset Management ,"I am very conflicted between two jobs offers and don’t really know which one I should go with. First, I interned with the VEA program at Morgan Stanley and received a full time return offer. I really liked my time at Morgan Stanley and loved the company culture and people I met. However, the work is pretty easy and I felt like I would not be gaining the best experience in the role. I know there are tons of career opportunities to pursue at Morgan Stanley but I don’t know how realistic it is for me to pursue them after having the VEA program as my only experience at the firm, ideally I would love to work in Private Credit, Private wealth management, alternatives, private markets or MSRE but do not know if it is even possible to transition to these areas after VEA. I do like the fact that I get to take my series 7 and 63 immediately but the pay is also $15k base lower than my other offer and includes no bonus while my other offer includes up to 25% bonus. Overall, the hours are very good, lots of vacation time and many opportunities for career growth (although idk how realistic) but the pay is bad and I don’t know if the experience will actually help me with where I want to transition to.  I also networked with people around the firm and connected with a lot of people in the PWM organization that are expecting me to return. On the other hand, I have received an offer with a smaller commercial real estate firm to be on the asset management/investment management team which has much worse hours, less vacation and less opportunities internally for career growth. The company is very young and has young management so I don’t know if it would be even possible to move up for some time. I am also unsure if taking a real estate position would cut off any chances of working at big bank like Morgan Stanley again just in a role that I would enjoy more. Overall, I could see myself taking both jobs as I enjoyed working at MS and would love to work with the markets, following the news and know the best investments for clients to put their money but I also really enjoy working in real estate and finding investment opportunities in that space as well. Ultimately, I’m very conflicted and don’t know what a better course of action would be. My end goal as of now is to become a portfolio manager (whether real estate or equities) at a big bank or hedge fund with principal authority or work in private equity. If anyone has advice on which course would be better to achieve that goal please let me know. If you made it this far thank you for reading!

Growing up, I never applied myself to school. I spent my time chasing folly and as a result of that, I gained a lot of scars wasting time. As I’ve aged, I’ve come to realize that I’m not living up to my potential, which can explain why I’m constantly bored. I’ve had a few different visions over the past couple of years. Maybe sharing those could help since proper guidance is not only built upon what a person can and has done but also what that person’s vision is. I’ve thought about starting my own fabrication business and even did a few side jobs before I realized that I didn’t want a business doing that. I wouldn’t mind having a business, it’s just that I don’t want to do fabrication. I do want to invest my money passively and I hope to one day get into the most passive area of real estate. I’d like to get to a place where I own and someone else manages. I don’t own a home yet but I plan for my first home to be a multi-family investment home. When it comes to my career path, I’ve even strongly considered abandoning everything and changing careers entirely, studying history, and going into education with the wild idea of cramming my foot into the political realm of education, but I don’t think the inspiration behind this desire is reliable enough to pursue at the time. I’m also not sure that it’s wise to abandon a field I’ve already spent 5 years of my life in and I’m not getting any younger!

1hgp65x,Career change: Another Master’s degree?,"Hi! I'm looking for some perspective. I've worked in higher education since I graduated with my Bachelor of Arts in Ethnic and Gender Studies in 2017. I then received my Master of Education in 2021, and have stayed within higher education since then. I've certainly been feeling pigeon-holed into administrative roles, with little upward mobility and pay. The university I currently work for offers ~free~ schooling for its employees and l've been considering taking advantage of that by earning a MSW to become a LCSW. Ideally, working in a practice as a Therapist.

Backstory: I have wanted to be a therapist since childhood due to my personal experience with them and seeing their impact on me and my family. I originally majored in Psychology during undergrad, but ended up changing my major because I, honestly, couldn't pass Personality Theory my junior year. Looking back, I was 20 years old and wasn't as dedicated and/or passionate as I am now about my career at 29. Everything seems to point back to my desire to do this work, and I am 100% feeling ready for a pivot career-wise.

I'd love to hear from folks who've pivoted into the Social Work/Therapist direction from doing something else. What are some things I should be aware of? Was it worth it? Any other advice?

1hgn5wl,AM I COOKED? ,"I just turned 25 and now live in New York, barely making ends meet. Life isn’t terrible, but I know I want more for myself. I’d like to think I’m pretty tapped into fashion, music, and the creative world, but I’ve been feeling stuck. Lately, I’ve been thinking about going back to college—my dream would be The New School’s Art History and Design program. That said, even starting the application process feels like an impossible task.

Here’s some background: I graduated high school in 2018, but back then, I had no idea who I was or what I really wanted to do. I grew up in a small with my conservative mexican family, and pursuing a career in fashion or art didn’t seem like an option. I focused on making my parents proud—becoming the first in my family to go to university—so I moved to Dallas and started studying medical business. While I was there, I met a lot of people outside of school, mostly in the music and rave scene, and it felt like I started to figure out who I wanted to be. Eventually, I realized the medical field wasn’t for me, so I dropped out and switched to a local college to study Fashion Marketing. That was 2018 or 2019. I enjoyed it—the projects were fun, and I was still having a good time outside of school—but then COVID hit, and everything changed.

During the pandemic, my friends and I said, “Screw it,” and moved to Austin. I couldn’t tell you why—we just thought it was cool and wanted to be in the middle of the action. For me, that was total freedom. I got more into DJing and producing and thought, “This is what I’m going to do now.” I even applied to Austin Community College for music production, but I ended up dropping out of that too. I stayed in Austin for two years, mostly just figuring life out. I co-founded a music collective with friends, and we actually did pretty well—even outside of Austin. I made connections and started building something, but when the opportunity to move to New York came up, I took it.

Living here has been exciting in some ways—I’ve met fashion people, gone to shows, and had glimpses of the life I want—but it’s also been lonely. I feel like I’ve fallen into a routine. The difference now is that I know what I want: to work in fashion—creative direction, production, fashion films, photography. I’ve made connections, but my imposter syndrome is unreal. I’ve let it stop me from creating, always thinking about how broke I am or how I don’t have the resources, time, or people to help me. I know others create with less, but I just can’t seem to find the drive. Writing all this is making me realize I might need therapy to work through these feelings.

That’s why I want to go back to school. I need guidance and structure. The New School’s program feels right because it’s broad and connected to everything I’m interested in. I have a vision—from shooting styles to the music—and i am farrrrr from cocky/this confident but I know I have taste. I just want the chance to show it. 

I’m applying to other colleges too because I’m realistic, but I can’t help wondering: With my messy educational history, would I even have a chance?",Affectionate-Cap8176,1,1.0,1,1734475801,2024-12-17 22:50:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hgn5wl/am_i_cooked/,12,2024
1hgn29l,"First corporate job, worth the drive?","So a little backstory, I just turned 25, graduated college at 22 with a Finance degree. Was able to go for free with a scholarship, so used it as a back up plan in case I needed it.

Now, I’m working in a restaurant serving and doing some seasonal work with UPS. I’m making great money now, but once I go back to serving only I was going to start looking for a corporate job as I know serving is not the career I want, even though the pay is good.

A friend of mine referred me to his company and they are going to interview me Friday. It is a financial representative job, 8-5, 52k salary. The problem is that it is 20 miles away from my house, about 55-65 min drive each way. I know it’s a good opportunity but that drive is holding me back.

I didn't hear from them up until last week. It's definitely a no brainer going to that company- career wise it's a huge step up. I was offered to interview with them for the new sales rep team. Given my 10 years of hands on experience with the veterinary industry and familiarity with their products, they offered me the job after my interview. The recruiter mentioned to me that my bachelors in biology was a bonus and didn't see a reason for the sales director to say no. However, it is well stated in my resume that my degree is in progress. They discussed the matter and decided to offer me the position with the contingency of being able to get my degree in 6 months. If I fail to provide at least an associates, my employment would be terminated. Which I was grateful for but after discussing with my advisor, is basically impossible. It isn't a matter of me not wanting to put the work in but scheduling with work and school would for sure overlap and I fear that a strenuous amount of class load and the new job will not allow me to perform as well as I know I can in both areas simultaneously. I understand the importance of the degree but was so caught off guard by the call from them.
I truly never expected to hear from them and was qualified to do what I'm currently doing so I didn't prioritize the degree. I would hate to turn the offer down but also don't want to ruin any future opportunities with them by being fired in 6 months because I bit off more than i could chew.

I feel like I’m at the age where it’s time to decide what I want to be when I “grow up” lol. So a little about me: I love working on cars and driving manual is my favorite. I love making music and media creation, I write and sing songs, play instruments with friends, film videos and edit audio and visuals, as well as having an infatuation for Dj mixing. I have a passion for Performing Arts like acting, singing, and my favorite of all dancing!! Point is I have a lot of interest for anything creative. I’ve been working and attending school at the same time. First I Majored in performing arts, realized it’s not a stable career at all.. I knew I had to be more realistic. Then I changed my major to Communications because of my strong social skills. Recently I’ve been thinking of changing my major to Computer Science for a more promising career that makes more money. Then I started to realize college is a scam. I’ve been looking into trade schools, I don’t want anything in the medical field, but Welding has really caught my interest. Next I thought I really want to travel, why don’t I leave everything behind and join the Airforce or maybe become a flight attendant. Again I’m not sure what I want to do but I’m very open to ideas. I just don’t want to waste my time or hate what I do. I’ve been working since i was 16 so my work ethic is strong. My work experience has included working at O’Reillys Auto parts as a parts specialist and working with Honda doing PR (Public relations) for major events in SoCal. Both jobs very fun but not financially secure as a career. All of this uncertainty in my future has been stressing me out, I even started smoking cigarettes and made myself a bit depressed.

1hgit24,Do I include new role on my resume or not? I've been there less than a month and seeking a new position. ,"Additional context: I have 8 years experience in Training/Curriculum/Instructional Design, and switched from nonprofit to tech in 2021. I worked in Customer Education for a successful mid-sized SaaS company for 3 years, and started at a new SaaS company in a different field earlier this month. It was an upgrade in title (senior level) and salary, but I quickly learned that it's not a great fit and do not plan to stay at the new company. So I am seeking a new position. 

Should I include the new role I've been in for less than a month on my resume? It does show that I moved up, and can be successful with different types of software, and I can list some initial achievements in the role. My Linkedin shows that I started the new position, so if a Recruiter were to check they would see that I started at the new company. 

I am confident that I can articulate why this new role is not a good fit in an interview. I'm a great interviewer and confident that I will do well in the process if I can get a callback, just wondering if I should including the new role on my resume or not will be a better chance to get past the application stage. My previous companies I stayed for 3 and 11 years, so I do not come off as a job hopper.

1hgiapw,Burned out working in the corporate world (Supply Chain) and need a change. What are some interesting careers that might be a good fit for someone in this situation?,"First of all, I hope this is the right place for this sort of question. I tried to make sure this was a good place to ask this and to provide the details needed for others to help, but please let me know if you need more information or if there’s a better place for this sort of post.

I am an American man in my early 30s, and I work in an office job in the Supply Chain/Logistics field as a mid-level analyst making in the $80k-90k range per year. There are a lot of things I like about my job. I am very satisfied with my salary and am able to live well above my means due to my lack of major expenses. I also don’t mind sitting at a desk all day; a lot of people who hate corporate jobs say they think sitting in front of a computer all day is “soul sucking” but I personally don’t mind it. I enjoy the structure of an office job and having work to do without having to go out and hunt for it.

What I don’t like about my job, however, is the lack of training, office politics, and always feeling like no matter how hard I work it’s never good enough. I have a boss that is never satisfied with my work, and constantly criticizes me for relatively minor things. I feel like I don’t fully understand some of the work I do, but when I ask for help I get criticized for not knowing it already, leading to a negative feedback loop where I’m damned if I ask for help and damned if I keep my mouth shut and suffer silently. I feel tense whenever I am in the office and am constantly afraid of being criticized. In order to get any recognition I have to be loud and say “look at me, I did this thing” which is not the kind of personality I have. And no matter how good my own work is, if some issue outside of my control happens and brings my numbers down, I am the one who gets blamed for it. All of this leads me to being depressed and anxious, which has other health consequences like a lack of exercise or life outside of work. I get so anxious about work that I can’t eat or sleep. I can’t live like this much longer.

I’m sick of living my life in fear all the time. I feel like this environment is not a healthy fit for me in the long term, and I need a change. I am very seriously considering quitting my job and being unemployed for a period of time. I have about a year’s salary in savings and would be financially ok with being unemployed for a few months. I considered just looking for another job in my field since a lot of my current issues are due to a bad office culture, but I really don’t see a long term future in this career. I would have to go into management to move up, and that’s not something I want to do in a corporate setting.

So now I’m trying to figure out what to do in order to pivot to a new career and lifestyle. I don’t want to quit my job without any sort of plan, but I also know that I have to leave and make a decision soon or else things will get worse for me. I also know that economically, leaving a job is risky right now. My rough idea is to go back to school for something and learn some new skills to make me more marketable but I am trying to get some ideas of what might be a good fit for me. I would really appreciate some advice!



About me:

* I have a BSBA in Computer Information Systems that I never really used due to difficulty finding a job in this field after college. I kind of fell into supply chain and feel stuck in it, but maybe there’s a job in this field that might be a better fit?
* I live in inner-city Chicago and do not own a car. This does somewhat limit my career options as I could not do jobs that requires owning my own car. I also enjoy living in a place where I can live car-free, but would consider giving this up for the right opportunity. Not opposed to moving somewhere else necessarily but it would have to be for the right job.
* I always enjoyed jobs where I help people or get to serve people. My favorite job ever was working at a kava bar in college. It was so fun to get to know the regulars and to make drinks for people while not having to deal with intoxicated people. But it was a minimum wage job and I know that kind of thing wouldn’t be sustainable in the long term. But in the short term, maybe a job like barista, concierge, tour guide, etc. might be a good option?
* I enjoy travel and wouldn’t be opposed to a career that allowed me to travel.
* I’ve always been a more shy person, but I also have thrived in the past in jobs that allow me to communicate with others in an official sort of way (like the bartending job I mentioned earlier)



Some potential jobs that I’ve thought about:

* **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** Seems like an interesting field and my CIS background might make pivoting this direction more feasible, but it seems like advanced maths skills are necessary and math has always been a difficult subject for me in the past. But maybe as an adult it would click with me more than it did as an adolescent?
* **Medical field**: Nursing is often brought up as a potential option for people trying to leave the corporate world who want to help others. But I do worry about some of the practical aspects of the job (dealing with bodily fluids, watching your patients die, etc.) I also thought a specialized medical job like optometry might be interesting, but going to optometry school would be both time-consuming and expensive.
* **Government jobs**: I would be willing to take a pay cut to work in a stable government job, but I am worried about this option due to the current political landscape in the US. Without breaking the “No Politics” rule of this subreddit, I am aware that the incoming US administration has proposed drastically overhauling the federal government, and I worry that it would make a job working for the government less feasible in the long term. Furthermore, My own city is in a financial crisis right now and municipal hiring is currently frozen.
* **Transportation**: I’ve considered working for the local transit agency as a bus driver, but I worry about poor work/life balance and not being able to get time off throughout the year. Plus the thought of driving a city bus seems scary to me. I’ve also read about railroad jobs, and it seems like you don’t get social security (they have a separate retirement system) and in many jobs you are always on call 24/7. This seems like a very stressful environment to work in.
* **Simply getting another job in my field**: Probably the easiest option, but as previously mentioned I don’t think I have a great long-term career prospect if I stay in supply chain. I worry that other companies will have the same issues that my current one has. I’ve worked in a number of corporate jobs at this point and I always feel anxious and like I’m not good enough.
* **Starting my own company**: I’ve always liked the idea of being a small business owner but the logistics of it always scare me. I’ve met people who left their corporate jobs to become life coaches and things like that, but that doesn’t seem like a good fit for me (I need a therapist/career counselor/life coach/etc myself, how am I supposed to do this for other people?). I have passions like coffee, clothes, etc but I don’t feel confident enough in my abilities to invest tons of my savings into this sort of risky business venture. 

If you were in my situation, what kinds of opportunities would you consider as a potential career move? Really appreciate any advice you could give. I feel like I’m at a crossroads in my life and need to make a change, but figuring out the right direction to go is not easy.",307148,2,1.0,1,1734462849,2024-12-17 19:14:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hgiapw/burned_out_working_in_the_corporate_world_supply/,12,2024
1hgi8b1,What advice can you offer about finding a remote job for a recent college graduate?,"**Background About Me** 

>I am a recent college graduate with a BS in Psychology. 

>I don’t have a work history since I spend my time caregiving when I wasn’t focused on classes. 

> I live very rural with no real opportunities for someone with physical disabilities. I’ve survived a stroke I had as a child and can’t do anything physically strenuous (warehouse, construction, etc.) and there isn’t anything else open.


**What I’m Looking For**

>Part-Time and Remote: I am primarily a caregiver for disabled parents. I can realistically do part-time because they don’t need my help every second of the day so I usually have a good 4-6 hours where I can devote for actual work while still being able to help with their care. I know that work is work and working remotely isn’t a way of being paid to do nothing. I did school fully online and balanced my time in class with caregiving. Though I’m sure there will be a learning curve, I’m positive I can adjust. 

>$13-$15/hr: Pay isn’t too high on my priorities list. In exchange for the caregiving, my parents cover daily costs like housing, food, etc. I don’t have student loans from scholarships. Ultimately, I’m looking to work so that I can build a resume, transferable skills, and figure out what my passion in life is. 

>Preferably No Phone: I’m somewhat a disaster at handling phone calls, that said, I’m actually really good at texting, emailing, etc. I can also type fast from years of research papers and discussion posts.  

**What I Have To Offer**

>Degree: As mentioned previously, I do have a degree, so I’m good with applying for jobs requiring no education all the way up to bachelors. I graduated highest honors with 4.0 GPA. I know grades don’t matter much in applying for jobs, I’m hoping there’s still some way I can leverage it though.

>Trainings: Though I haven’t worked formally, through school I’m experienced with Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Outlook) I also have taken LinkedIn Learning courses on Microsoft Office, Trello, Asana, and Canva.  

>Willingness to Learn: I’m not an idiot, I know how to learn and how to follow instructions. I know I can do the work, I’m just not getting anyone to give me the chance. Everywhere wants experience but absolutely refuses to give it, I can’t make experience appear out of thin air :( 

Overall, I hope the post isn’t too long. What are my chances of actually finding something? What are some good roles I should be looking into? Where should I be looking? I’ve tried Indeed and ZipRecruiter but they seem to be full of scams. Thank you to everyone who has advice to offer!

1hgi5vn,"Feeling Trapped in My Family Business. Long Read, Please Help.","This might be a weird one and a little melodramatic, so huge thanks to anyone who actually reads. 

So I (23M) work for my dad as a digital marketing director, and this has been both a blessing and a massive curse. I love my dad, he is genuinely the hardest working person I have ever met, most of my childhood memories of my dad involve him working away in an office or basement, grabbing calls at all times, getting ready for flights to China, or giving overly-detailed monologues of what he's been working on to a very confused 13 year old me in the passenger seat. All while maintaining a high-energy, extra-friendly salesman persona with friends and strangers. I genuinely feel ashamed of my own work ethic when I compare it to his.

HOWEVER. This job feels like a joke and I am worried it's crippling my future. Here's why: 

I went to school for marketing and got my degree; this wasn't a dream career path but a last minute choice since I was one of those creative-minded people who did well in highschool but didn't feel attracted to any standard field of work. I wanted to write books, make music, or study philosophy--but I also wanted to please my parents (dad mainly) and be realistic about making money (something I am still not motivated by). I opted for marketing since in my naive mind, I could always put that toward marketing my own creative endeavors one day or something like that.

I graduate, with very little job experience in a standard business format, and I feel scared. I've had terrible anxiety since a young age and though I've created a confident outward persona to mask this and try to live a somewhat normal social life, interactions like job interviews give me a crippling fear. I've done them before, I've done them well, and I've done them bad. The experience has not changed my confidence toward them. So what do I do to avoid my fear? I say ""Sure"" when dad asks me to work for him. It will be ""great experience"" and ""we will make a lot of money, I just know it"" he said...

I know I am yapping but hang in there. Fast forward to now. I've come to the realization that my dad has no idea how to run a business. Great salesman? Yes, he's the best. Great boss? No. He spends 8+ hours a day handling work and calls for his job as an insurance agent--where he makes great money-- and then any time in between he will talk on the phone with me about the digital marketing agency, his company I am employed through. Every decision he has made for the last 2 years has been fruitless. We make practically no money, and it's like every Monday is the first day of this start-up company's existence because he spends an hour coming up with new pricing and products and ways of doing things (like on the spot, zero prior planning and nothing is ever in writing). All the while I am still waiting for feedback on how we're going to utilize the 10 assets I created last week. Well, I will never hear those assets mentioned again, because he's already on to the next thing. I blame the YouTube gurus he spends his freetime watching--if they have some new tool or way of doing things, that is now our sole focus to do it too. Forget everything else.

I try and keep up and create solid content (websites, funnels, blogs, social media, SEO), but it's like he's just expecting money to start pouring in just because I created something he asked me to create. I lack the actual experience to know what changes need to be made or how to implement them, and when I do try to point out an issue I am shutdown because he says ""I've been doing this for years"" or ""I don't have time for this, do you know how many calls I have today?"" or an insurance call will just come in and cut the conversation short. 

It makes me question if I actually know anything, but then I see his plan fall short just how I feared and Im like ""Okay, so I should just keep doing the wrong things he tells me?"". What I've opted for, is to just do exactly what he asks and nothing more. I've become a lazy worker, something I've never been in any of my previous 5 jobs, because working harder only serves to frustrate as I watch all the work get more and more buried by the new stuff I am being asked to create. Like I come in, do what he asks, get paid (by my dad which I hate, feels like a handout), and then sulk over how pointless and honestly pathetic it all is. I am left with no motivation for writing or music since it's just more sitting in front of the same computer. 

I am not getting experience or taught anything because I am the ""director"" who is ""in charge"" of marketing and the handful of employees we've hired overseas. I do my best, and I also do everything as he asks, but all the while it seems plain to me that this experience would never transfer over to better job since I am just learning from myself and from someone who seems in over their head and unavailable. I would be embarrassed trying to explain my job to a recruiter. 

Working with him has made me feel more and more incompetent. All of my friends have moved out of state for respectable jobs in big corporations and to start their lives confidently, while I spend most days in my apartment either hating work while Im doing it and being frustrated at my dad while we interact (pretty much my only coworker interaction), or after work I am just feeling miserable and like a failure just thinking about the fact that my life has summed up to surviving off nepotism for a company that can't make a dime.

Anyone have any kind of advice as far as either what to do with my current situation or how to tastefully move on to a better one? My dad has already said he wants to stop doing insurance to fully focus on the digital marketing, and I think that is a terrible idea for the sake of him and my mom's financial security. It also puts me in a weird spot, bc he's already told me i am irreplaceable. So either I leave and be the reason he can't do the thing he wants to do, or I stay and be the reason both of us end up working in a joke of a company--him as an old man wanting to retire and me as a middle aged adult with nothing useful to carry forward to better pursuits. 

I just don't know anymore, man.

1hgi566,"Boss keeps giving no-bid contracts to friends and family, should I make a call to HR?","I'm not one to narc on colleagues, but since my new boss (director/VP level) started about a year ago, almost every new 'vendor' seems to be a close, personal friend.

I'm very very happy in my current remote job, which has great work life balance, lots of time off, a medium-level workload, and an amazing team with no drama. The job with the Israeli company would likely have fewer days off and longer hours, but it would be a massive pay increase (I'm talking 30% more than my current salary). However, work-life balance is something that's really important to me, and I've heard that Israeli work culture can be intense, and I'm pretty lazy. Also, it's not exactly the most stable country right now. Who knows what could happen in the next year or even month in that country. For one thing, I'm morally against the government's war crimes in Palestine/Lebanon/Syria, but who knows if this company's leadership is even aligned with the government.

1hgheq4,The obsession in making employees physically be at work when they don't need to,"Sorry in advance for my rant, but I am so fed up with this.

I'm currently on an assignment for my work, which basically just involves me studying for 2 months and passing a couple tests. My work tracks my progress and scores each day and monitors my every move remotely, through the studying app/ progress tracker. This software works exactly the same from home, it shows how much I got done that day and what my scores are, so there's is literally no difference in doing this at work or at home.

Here's the issue though, the place im being put to study at work is an isolated, depressing, white cubicle. I need someone to unlock the break room for me, the bathroom, the cubicle officer and somehow, even alone there, it's really loud. Employees and customers are constantly making noise and screaming and I just can't learn in an environment like this. I can't sit in a white cubicle 8h a day staring at a screen and a white wall, I just can't absorb information and learn like this, and if I fail this damn test, I get fired.

There have been now also 4 instances where my boss has sent me to study from home, her decision, because the computer at work isn't working. so I waste 2h commuting, another 3h waiting for them to try to fix the computer and I just end up home, having to work late to make up the lost time. I'm fed up with this bs. I understand that if I was doing a client-facing job at this time, fine, makes sense, but I'm just studying an you're monitoring my progress anyway... Why are employers so god damn obsessed with making our life miserable for no reason, even when it's less efficient? Why am commuting 2h a day when that's time I could be studying?

I then call my boss this morning and let her know I'm sick, stuck in the bathroom since 5 AM. I'm not going to be sick at work in and out of the bathroom all day, so I ask -"" Do you want me to just take the day off and use PTO or do you want me to study from home""? Her answer -"" You can study from home today, but we are going to need to talk about this and there might be disciplinary action down the line. I can't continue to have you working from home and constantly having an issue and needing to study from home"".

Lady, YOU sent me home all the other times, I never asked to stay home. wth are you talking about? Obviously I didn't say that, but why does any of this crap matter????? What is this stupid obsession with feeling the need to make people's life miserable even if at the cost of productivity and practicality??

If I could go back I would probably major in one of these instead. I even took some biology and Biochemistry courses in college and actually enjoyed and did good in them.

Sorry for the long rant but i was wondering if anyone had any advice about where to go from here.

TL;DR: After 1.5 years of graduating with low grades and not interships, I can't find a job and now I'm looking for advice on what to do next and if there are any programs or certifications that would help.",One_Ad_1872,0,0.5,1,1734459729,2024-12-17 18:22:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hgh34n/lost_after_graduating_as_chemical_engineer_15/,12,2024
1hggv9j,Having a job while receiving guaranteed income,"TLDR: I have been granted a very modest but in my opinion liveable income that will persist for the period of my natural life. I have no cultural or social aspirations related to having a job. Would you continue to pursue a career under these circumstances?

Long version:

  
I am a self-taught computer programmer. I have been working in the industry in somewhat variable capacities since 2020. I think it is hard work, and it causes me lots of stress. Before this, I worked odd jobs in retail, etc., but got tired of dealing with customers and poor compensation. I really like computer programming as a hobby and intellectual discipline, but after four years of doing commercial software development, I am sick of dealing with the way that this industry has instrumentalized and commodified this interesting form of scientific knowledge to produce an array of products I have no substantive interest in; I think some of them serve a purpose, while a large swathe of them are not just useless, but actively destructive. Pro forma admission: I also have serious qualms about the introduction of AI into the performance of these roles.

Earlier this month, I got the mostly unexpected news that I have been awarded a monthly income for health reasons. I won't offer any details on the source of this income, not for the sake of privacy or anything like that; I'll allow the  reader to use their imagination. Suffice it to say that I believe this income is stable and guaranteed, and only cataclysmic social circumstances would interrupt the monthly deposits I am slated to receive. Under these conditions, I am highly tempted to quit my current job--which is, as these things go, a very good one--and live off this pension. I don't have much savings, but I have no debt, no dependents, and no plans to make any huge financial commitments like buying a house or having kids. In lieu of spending most of my waking hours writing code for someone else, I plan to write fiction (my lifelong passion), learn musical instruments, pick up some foreign languages, and other such things. Maybe I'll even rediscover my enjoyment of coding as a free-time project.

As the drift of this post might lead you to see, I am a deeply unpractical person. I have trouble thinking ahead when it comes to things like housing and finances, and I have always just navigated through life on a moment-to-moment basis. So what I am seeking from such readers as I might have, is this: what would you do in my shoes?

  
A) quit immediately; pursue your goals/passions

B) continue working for a fixed period (maybe 6 months, a year, five years); accumulate considerable savings, and then quit

C) Something else",bahol-de-jic,2,1.0,2,1734459175,2024-12-17 18:12:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hggv9j/having_a_job_while_receiving_guaranteed_income/,12,2024

1hgg11l,Transition from web developer to... One of these options,"I'll keep it short. After years of working as a web developer (mainly frontend), I took a break because I didn’t want to continue down that path.

I spent a year in a digital civil service role (it's the name of a kind of contract we have in Italy that always lasts 1 year) as an administrative assistant (on paper, but I ended up doing a bit of everything: receptionist duties, low-level technical assistance with Microsoft programs, etc.) for a semi-public educational institution. I quite enjoyed the experience: tasks were much simpler and manageable without stress or pressure, and the environment was more human-focused rather than business-driven (so I was treated as a person, not a revenue generator).

After spending a few more months resting (a sabbatical, essentially), I’ve decided to start looking for work again because, well, we all need money. Reflecting on my civil service experience, these roles came to mind:

Administrative Assistant (with a focus on IT companies(?) but not exclusively)
Customer Support
I’ve also come across the “Service Desk” role online, but I don’t fully understand what it entails. On the other hand, I’d rather avoid getting into help desk roles because, sure, I can code a site or an app, but I don’t know anything about networks, systems, cloud, databases, etc.

That said, salary isn’t a priority for me, nor are positions with responsibility or career advancement. I just want a calm, manageable job that doesn’t come with too much stress, anxiety, or overtime.

Bonus points: Full remote work would be ideal, though I realize that might be asking too much, so hybrid is fine too.

Is it possible without a degree? Maybe by reworking my CV and highlighting past experiences effectively?
Could you share some more insight into the roles I mentioned above? What are they like in practice?

Please don’t tell me to try being a developer again—it’s not for me. But I’m still passionate about the tech world, so I was thinking about focusing on IT companies. Perhaps I have enough experience to offer support there.

1hgf2g4,Switch or not?,"Hi,
I am a professional with over 3 years of experience. I started my career in business finance and post 2 years, I had a medical emergency in my family because of which I had to quit my job, I couldn’t travel to office 5 days a week. That is when a contractual opportunity in demand planning (supply chain) came by. It was a 10 month long contract with a promise of permanency. However post 10 months they asked me to move to Mumbai for a permanent role and I wanted to be based out of Delhi. So they extended the contract up until August’25. I joined at a sum of 1,15,000-10% TDS. On revision of contract it was a sum of 1,23,000-10% TDS. The company is now undergoing an acquisition and my leaders believe I have a fair chance of getting integrated and permanent by the acquiring company but I feel very insecure. A month ago, I started looking for opportunities. I got an offer of 20 LPA (18+2) but it was an Indian company and I was required to go to office 5 days a week. I didn’t think it was financially rewarding so I didn’t accept it. I have another offer from an MNC which is hybrid.
Below is the salary structure:
Basic:8,25,000
HRA:4,12,000
Base salary: 12,37,000
Flex: 2,70,000
total: 15,07,000
PF:99000
Gratuity:40000
Fixed: 16.5
Bonus at 15%

Should I accept the offer? I am thinking of negotiating for another 1.5 Lakh in my fixed pay.
Should I go for permananency or wait?

1hgev6u,Trying to do an internal transfer to a term job in another department- do I tell them I’m pregnant before or after potential offer?,"I’m trying to transition to a new field and applied for a job in a different department. It’s term limited; 2.5 years.

I’m early in a pregnancy and while I know I’m not LEGALLY obligated to mention the pregnancy, I feel like I don’t want to get off on a bad foot.

Some things to consider:

-My current job requires me to be physically present so I’d probably use the max amount of allotted leave time all at once. The potential new role can be hybrid/ many tasks can be done from home, so I likely would spread my leave out rather than take it in one large chunk.

-I’ve talked to my potential new boss quite a bit, and she herself is a mother- I met her children at the holiday party.

-I have a lot of job security in my current role but it doesn’t align as well with my longer-term career goals.

-Internal transfers seem somewhat common at my workplace.

-I’m 7 weeks currently.

-I applied for the job 5 weeks ago and they are still looking at applications (my potential boss has been updating me on the process). The hiring process where I work is notoriously drawn-out, so it might be another month or so before I find out.

-I expect to at least get an interview and have had it hinted to me good things are coming my way by people in the institution/ I was encouraged to apply for this new role.

Thoughts?

1hgdhr3,How to pivot to another area of accounting after years of experience?,"After 6 years of working in fund administration, I would like to try something new in accounting. I like the idea of maybe working in corporate for a company I have brand awareness with, going the revenue accounting route, inventory accounting, etc. For the past month, I look at all these postings on LinkedIn and apply on average to over 30 jobs a week. The duties/responsibilities all look like things I have experience with minus some ERP experience or a few other items and yet, I haven’t heard back from a single opportunity for an interview. 

I finally decided to start working with recruiters and a lot of them don’t have my best interests in mind and want to push these really big jobs on me that are still in the fund space. They are trying to convince me to work on the buy-side of things which does interest me a little bit but I think I have come to realize that I am just a nerd who likes to literally work in excel all day and do the math, make numbers tie, etc. It’s clear I have plenty of opportunities in the fund space but I really genuinely want to try something new. 

My recruiters even tell me that selling me to corporate jobs is really tough because a lot of them want people experienced within their field of accounting. Does that mean I need to switch gears and start applying to staff accountant entry-level roles? I am willing to do that if so but the pay cut would be very severe and I just feel so overqualified. It’s a bit disheartening. 

I am also open to other opportunities in business in which I can kind of do my nerdy things all day like billing, payroll, treasury, etc. I’m aware doing something outside of accounting in general would likely mean starting over but I know for sure I want to try something new besides fund accounting. Is there anyway for me to find recruiters that would like to work with me for what my goals are or am I pigeonholed in this career path? Any advice would be appreciated.

At first I was a contractor for a third party company and became a w2 over a year later. Everything seemed pretty fine in the tech department until earlier this year where I felt like I was messing up a bit when it came down to tech skills and I was scolded for it.

I have an idea who that was but you can't be sure. So i've was looking for a job and with no luck I didn't get any offers. Come by a few months ago I was told by my company that the organization will not be renewing the contract and they were going to be hiring about three people from our team to join theirs permanently. Well, since talking to my coworker at that time about how I was ""considered"" I felt like they had their own decision to be made from there so I didn't bother. Well, I was asking around about who from our team was going to be applying and I found out that one of the people from the tech team (whom I assume hindered my consideration from being put on the team) reached out to one of the people on the team that I am on to apply.

1hgcxza,My toxic micromanaging boss took over my job while I was on annual leave and won't give it back,"Hey, I hope this is the right forum. Looking for some support/advice as I'm just stumped.

The context: I work in a senior position just below the manager of my team. Without getting too passionate, she is overwhelmingly micromanaging (wants oversight of every detail, constantly checks in with everyone, no decision big or small can be made by anyone without her approval) and is very gaslighting and vindictive, regularly belittling people in front of the whole team, but I've got into a swing of learning to deal with her nonsense and getting on with my job as best I can but it feels like a battle with her every day just to do my job efficiently as she's constantly inteferring and creating problems. She regularly makes my reports cry and I have to manage that too.

The problem: I took two weeks of annual leave last month for the first time since working with her. I was worried about it as usually when I have any time off, I get back and she's made some massive changes to how we work and expects me to get on board instantly.

Lo and behold, on the day I returned from leave, she got me onto a call and told me she'd decided to basically do my job herself as 'it's just easier that way' and 'only I can really know what I want'. She insisted she wasn't taking my job off me, but that is quite literally was has happened. I was so stumped and didn't really know what it meant for me, so I've given it two weeks to let it pan out, and she has quite literally taken all of my responsibilities off me and has started treating me like a subordinate, so it looks and feels like a demotion. I am meant to manage part of the work of a team of eight people and she's got them all reporting to her instead of me now, which has them all very confused, and she's basically sidelined me to just picking up extra tasks she doesn't want to do herself.

No issues with my performance up to this point.

She is a nightmare to work with and this has given me the shove to start looking elsewhere, but I am not sure whether to have one final battle over this. All my reports hate her and are desperate for me to take back over those jobs, but I think I'm tired of battling with her to do my job.

After weeks of putting this together, I’m sharing a free, structured roadmap packed with the best resources to help you crack IB/PE interviews. It’s non-gated and built to deliver real value—these are materials I’ve tested and used myself.

What’s included?

Aptitude Prep: GMAT-inspired resources to sharpen finance test skills.

Valuation & Investment Analysis: Key books and tools to master concepts.

Excel & PPT Skills: Top Excel tools + investment-banking style slide formats.

Financial Modeling: DCF, LBO, M&A, and 3-statement modeling templates.

Economic Analysis: Bulge bracket bank reports to sharpen market insights.

Interview Prep: Technical + behavioral prep to ace interviews.

Real-Life Decks: M&A pitch books from Goldman Sachs, Lazard, Moelis & others.


Work through this consistently for 3-4 months, and you’ll develop the same technical skills as a first-year analyst—minus the experience (that comes with time!).

Sharing this as a free giveaway because it worked for me to crack Private Equity myself, and I hope it helps someone here too. Drop your mail in the comments, and I’ll send the link over.

Let’s also keep this collaborative: if you’ve got resources you swear by, share them below so we can all level up together.

My chances of getting into a top econ program (the likes of DSE and ISI) are nil at the moment since I did not prepare for any exams this year, as I initially planned on graduating with an honours. I do think getting a masters from outside india, UK or US is the best option for me professionally, and I will start preparing for the GRE in January. 

What are my chances with my current profile, what courses could I take to supplement it and better my CV, should I be trying to apply to specific jobs?

1hgahaq,Advice needed from people with academia/humanities background. ,"Hello, (this is going to be a little long)

I'm an Indian student currently pursuing my masters in English literature from a distance mode. I haven't taken any gap years. I'm planning to give the UGC-NET exam after my finals next year. However, I've gotten mixed opinions from people and one of them being ""Interviewers might prefer the candidates who pursued from regular mode"" (now this has sprouted a doubt in my head). I, however, believe that it entirely depends on the merit and calibre. (But is my doubt valid?)

Moving on, I don't want to just have the knowledge of my field. I wish to learn/take up courses that would be beneficial in the coming years. Could you please suggest any affordable and time-flexible courses? (Maybe Coding, Ui/Ux, any linguistics course) 


Originally, i planned to pursue an MFA in creative writing in the UK. Sent applications and everything but then one day after discussing with my parents they said that they won't be able to financially support me. And truth be told, I don't want drown in student debts. So I decided to study in India itself and I am currently working as a home tutor.


I do want to go abroad be it for studies or for work. The question is, how? 

•Should I take up a TESOL or TOEFL course abroad?

•Should I do the MFA course?

•Should I continue doing what I'm doing right now in India itself?


My biggest fear is regretting that I didn't try harder to pursue an ambition that wasn't even supposed to be a dream for me. Living a stagnant life, working on auto-pilot mode, wishing I'd done better....these thoughts send me in a spiral. I don't want to be stuck doing just one thing and settling for whatever is minimal. 


If I could get some advice related to this, I'd be really grateful. Looking forward to your responses. 

Thankyou :)",Turbulent_Oil_288,1,1.0,0,1734441709,2024-12-17 13:21:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hgahaq/advice_needed_from_people_with_academiahumanities/,12,2024
1hgagl2,"Offered a permanent position that feels like a step back, how should I handle this?","Hi, looking for some advice here:

I'm 27F working as a Junior CAD tech with admin - I got this role whilst still at Uni and it was a major contributing factor to leaving my degree path, however, I still left with a Diploma in Engineering.

My current role is temporary maternity cover, I have been doing a senior job by myself for almost a year, with the contract due to end in February. After the news of the original CAD Tech returning but wanting part time instead - I've been offered a permanent position in the design team (which I'm not currently in) as an administrator at the same wage, which is below the average for a normal CAD tech role but they offer a 5% wage increases every August, that I may not even get due to the role change.

In the last 2 months I've been led to believe I could get a wage increase and I'll be primarily CAD focused - which is where I wanted my career to lead.

I'm happy with the job security and being in the design team but I feel like I've been given a carrot on a stick and I'm extremely unhappy with being offered an admin role. The roles' responsibilities were also not laid out in the offer and I have told HR I'm not happy to sign it not knowing them and considering the job title.

I'd spent this morning crying after reading the offer, I was sceptical about getting a wage increase since the company I work for seem to try as hard as possible to not spend any money, buy new software, or employ people to fill the gaps of people leaving - they also accidentally sent me the payroll for the entire company towards the start of my employment (a huge data breach) and I saw most of their wages (directors, of which there are many, get 20k+ a month, the most I saw was around 50k). It was a fight to get them to pay for licensed CAD software, and after half a year they've finally approved it.

Long story short, I didn't expect an offer of purely administration.

I'm unsure what to do now, I've already been applying for jobs but a lot of CAD roles ask for software specific experience I don't have, like Revit, or more than a years experience in a CAD role. I'd hate to put ""Administrator"" on my CV and I'm thinking of changing career paths completely, maybe even in sales or something I can work towards bonuses in and be earning a good amount for my age. But, I don't want all the hard work I've put towards engineering to be null and void.",_sparaxis,2,1.0,15,1734441646,2024-12-17 13:20:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hgagl2/offered_a_permanent_position_that_feels_like_a/,12,2024
1hgad5e,Need a new career before my mental health greatly depreciates ,"Quick little bit about myself, I’m 23 years old, currently working as a manufacturing engineer tech that fell into my lap which I have no credentials for making $27/h CAD but I absolutely hate this job and I need out.

School experience:
I went to school for one year for cyber security, I got good grades but I just didn’t like it and covid hit so I dropped out, went back to school for 2 years and got a computer programming diploma from a college and couldn’t get a job because the job market is terrible and I stopped liking it as well.

work experience:
- retail (hate it but was good at it)
- car detailing (cleaning, ceramic coating, paint corrections, I’ve wrapped my own personal car for a colour change)
- line worker building compressors
- after graduating computer programming my job offered me a manufacturing engineering tech job which is where I’m at now. 

Interests:
- parrots are my #1 interest they are my life, my right arm has a parrot sleeve(tattoos), I own 2 that are my entire life and want more, I wish I could work with birds all day for the rest of my life but I don’t know how to make money out of it and I don’t agree with breeding which is where people make the most money with birds. 
- I used to play guitar but from constantly failing trying to find something stable and enjoyable I haven’t had the urge to play for the last 4 years
- I would like to go back to what got me into coding to begin with which is video game development but I keep hearing awful things about the field
- industrial designer has always been an interest of mine but again the field is awful
- cars have always been a huge passion for me, id love to wrap cars either colour changes, ppf, ceramic coating, etc. pretty much anything that has to do with customizing cars I would love but again, there’s not a lot of money to be made unless you’re starting a business

Conclusion:
I’m looking for a career that I’ll actually enjoy, has a good field that’s not IMPOSSIBLE to get a job, and to find something I’ll actually enjoy doing. I just feel stuck at this point and don’t know what to do as it seems like everything I like is impossible to get into or the field is absolutely terrible. but I do know I can’t do my current job for much longer or else my mental health will greatly depreciate ",fgrossi16,1,0.5699999928474426,2,1734441326,2024-12-17 13:15:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hgad5e/need_a_new_career_before_my_mental_health_greatly/,12,2024

1hg7h5i,Am I in the wrong or the workplace is toxic,"Hello everyone, I have started working in a construction company, in an office job. 

Short context about me: graduated 1 and a half year ago civil engineering, started working on site as a construction site manager, learned a lot about construction, though it was more like real life experience, although I was doing the paperwork side of it. Fast forward to now, I have joined a company as a cost estimator of construction, however, my salary did transition, as I could 'apply' my experience on site to the office side of the work. 

  
Now I have been working here for 1.5 months, the trial period is 3 months. Here is working my friend, that recommended me, however, he is working here for 2 years and he is established, he has tought me many things about this job, and I'm still learning, as this particular job is new to me and I need some time to get better, because the tasks that I'm given are beyond my level, as he said, but I can learn them because of my previous experience.

Now the problem comes that, I feel that my new boss (54F), feels like I'm ''not working''. I do get stuck on some tasks, however, I do most of them and since I get no training from her, I do get stuck a lot. My friend is helping me and many times I do solve the issue with his help, however, the boss is still saying that it's done 'bad', and my colleague says that even if I would do it other way, it would still be bad in her eyes. Today I got sick and I got a call from her and it felt like interrogation, she even went to our HR to ask, if I did go to hospital, because she wanted to make sure I'm not lying, then went to my friend and started asking questions about my previous experience and said something like: ''oh now I have the whole picture"" (what picture???). I do feel like I'm on the bad side of her, but I'm not in a position to say anything to her, but it does feel like she just does not like me nor the job I do, maybe because of lack of experience, but I'm trying to learn and do my best. One more thing she said to me: ""You are not working for a salary like a student, you should know these things"", which again, yes, I'm not working as a student, but it does not mean that I must know everything and the trial period still didn't pass and I'm required to work at full capacity, I did even work overtime a few times, which is 'normal' to her, she said 'Oh I was working overtimes until night when I was your age'. 

This company does feel like a huge red flag considering the future, and I do really start thinking about changing career path, I'm 26 years old, I hope it's not too late.

I was told on the phone it would not be purely admin and I would be able to have some variety and not be on my bum all day as I had expressed the desire to move about and multi task. 

A different picture was painted by the guy who would be my actual manager, he said he has been the one up until now doing all the admin work and  basically kept saying how busy it is and that it would be ""flat out"" non stop from 8am to 1pm answering emails etc etc. That alone stood out as a red flag for me. I would also be the only admin person and this is a newly created role which makes me thing it would be hit and miss. He said he would train me but he gave me a sense of hurry up and learn kinda thing. The HR lady in the room and on the phone was absolutely lovely but I just generally got some weird vibes from the manager. Perhaps he was having a bad day I don't know but honestly my gut is telling me it wouldn't work out and i would regret it. He also made it clear that all he cares about is profit and how much money he can make for the company 😅🥲 I get that's what business exists for but wtf calm down lol. 

I guess it's hard to decide especially because I am currently unemployed which adds pressure. But I have ignored my gut feeling a few times out of the feeling of pressure and ""fomo"" and have ended up in jobs I hate and have ultimately left which only adds to the stress as I end up at square one.  I think I have answered my own question and as hard as it is to ignore everything else and do what's right for me, would going with your gut be the right thing to do?

1hg4hv7,Getting a job feels like climbing Mount Everest,"I've suffered from severe mental health problems my whole life. I never quite realized just how significant it was until I had a complete breakdown last spring. 

After finally graduating in geology after more than 10 years in part due to the things I struggle with, I went back to work in a supervisory position in a local Organic Grocery chain, basically picking up where I had left off after dedicating myself more full time to university again. 

I enjoyed working in an environment I was comfortable in for the time being, it helped my self confidence quite a bit. Many of the staff there still knew me and respected me enough to offer me the job almost on the spot. Things were going well until HR came in and unceremoniously gutted the entire staff and asked the few remaining senior employees to do double the work with no extra pay. Everyone was already strung to their limit as it was, overworked and underpaid... you know the drill. 

Given what I was dealing with personally, I did not feel comfortable staying there. I still don't regret quitting, but man, I didn't realize just how dire the job market is now.

I also have experience working as a lab research technician in university, while I was taking my degree, if that means anything.

What can I even do? It's hard for me to get out of bed in the morning and do basic things for myself I'm still so distraught most days. I'm finally getting therapy and medical help, which has made a massive difference, but it's been a slow burn crawling out of a lifetime of destructive habits and thoughts.

I desperately want to dedicate myself full time to looking for jobs but it almost seems pointless at this point. I have good references, just about every job I have worked before I believe I have performed well at (somehow), but with the job market the way it is I feel so sapped of energy to even try looking and applying.

I've been thinking of going back to university to get a masters, or even possibly look into some kind of career counselling. Would career counselling be worth it? I believe working towards some kind of plan on how I could apply myself for a career with a specific end point in mind would massively help with my anxiety. I have never allowed myself to be forward thinking in that way before, to value my own well-being and work towards a career goal that is meaningful to me. I'm finally starting to conceptualize my own future in that way. This has made a big difference in my motivation but it feels like I have to climb up mount Everest with the way the current job market is. 

What can I, or should I, do? Any advice? I am in Calgary, Canada, for reference. ",Actual-Toe-8686,7,0.8199999928474426,4,1734416360,2024-12-17 06:19:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hg4hv7/getting_a_job_feels_like_climbing_mount_everest/,12,2024
1hg3y03,Feeling absolutely lost and cheated - where do I go from here?,"Graduated early 2021, and all I managed to hold were 2 miserable jobs (minimum full-time pay, abusive employers, and ) and a 3-month ""consultancy"" role for my home market, which was a glorified translator role, which replaced me with AI as soon as the company trained the AI agent, and feel like my prospects are absolutely effed. I did International Business for my undergrad, and MBA as graduate degree, with zero IT/coding/tech focus.

I had a little exercise with the o1 chatgpt and asked it about the job market, current state of the economy, and best/worst majors. In summary this is what I got:

**Contextual Overview:**  
We’re at an inflection point where artificial intelligence, automation, and global economic shifts are rapidly changing the job market. In the coming decade, certain majors and skill sets are poised for sustained or growing demand, while others may struggle as their core functions become more easily automated, commoditized, or overshadowed by evolving technologies.

**The BEST Majors to Pursue Right Now:**

1. **Computer Science & AI-Related Fields**
2. **Data Science, Analytics & Quantitative Finance**
3. **Healthcare & Biomedical Engineering**
4. **Engineering Disciplines (Especially Robotics, Energy, Environmental)**
5. **Interdisciplinary Majors Fusing Tech & Humanities (e.g., Cognitive Science, Human-Computer Interaction, Applied Ethics)**

  
**The WORST Majors in Terms of Future Security:**

1. **Routine Business Administration & Generic MBAs (Without Quant/Tech Focus)** (oh hi there)
2. **Traditional Journalism & Non-Specialized Media Studies**
3. **Basic Accounting or Bookkeeping (Without Analytical/Advisory Focus)**
4. **Low-Level IT Support & Generic Programming Degrees**
5. **Pure Humanities & Arts Majors Without Marketable Supplements**

Where do I go from here?

I have already had the displeasure of being replaced by AI (the other 2 toxic roles I worked were mainly toxic because the company knew how replaceable we were, and could have a new ""me"" within 48 hours - marketers and branding people you can throw a rock in a random direction and there's a high chance you'd hit one of us in the head). We all know of the threat of AI replacing people, but Im the first case in my circle that has had this happen.

I feel cheated of those grand MBA promises, job security, management consulting position offers chasing me straight upon graduation. Instead, I got rejected over 600 times by every possible consulting company, had my cv reviewed 3 times, scored minimum pay jobs, lived in shoeboxes in hopes of saving some money. As my ""consultancy"" role is replacing me with AI, I'm forced to move back in with my parents (I'm pushing 28), and waste more time at home, not traveling, not saving, not working, not living. I just wanna catch a fucking break man.

1hg3j0k,Which internship should I take? ,"I know this is about internships, so I hope this is allowed. I need help deciding something. 

I am a senior at a school near DC and I am going to law school next year probably not in DC. This spring I was planning on doing a relatively prestigious Congressional internship and this would be my last time in Congress, but I have interned on the Hill previously. I was excited to get this offer, but then I found out that it’s unpaid and I would have to pay for the metro, so I would actually be losing at least $100 a month to this internship. I still have bills to pay and I need to save up for law school next year. I have already applied to law schools and gotten into some, so this wouldn’t make a difference on that front either. Also, internship for credit would only be possible if I worked five more days, meaning I would most likely miss spring break.  

Today, through networking, I unexpectedly got a paid internship offer at a well-known law firm. $15/ hour. I may have to drive, but I have a free parking spot at school so that is not an issue. I would get experience in many different fields of law and I could get internship for credit pretty easily, meaning I would only have three relatively easy classes to worry about left. I would also get to work remote on Fridays. 

A month ago, I told the first organization that I accepted, but I have not signed anything. I probably wouldn’t be able to apply there again, but I won’t be in the area, so I don’t plan to. I would really hate doing that to them, yet I also wouldn’t be able to lose that much money to an unpaid internship.

1hg1m2r,Advice needed: drama-free lateral transition?,"*Posting from a throwaway account and intentionally keeping details vague to remain anonymous.*

Advice needed: how should I approach applying for and (hopefully) accepting a lateral job at my current employer without raising too many red flags? Short story is I don't want to continue working for my new boss. (Boss is nitpicky and hyper critical. The constant negative feedback is eating away at my confidence and makes me anxious)

If I am fortunate enough to get a different position, it will be on a new team, although I will still occasionally cross paths with my current boss and teammates. My goal is a smooth transition into this lateral position while maintaining decent working relationships with these people. I know they will ask why I'd bother moving to a lateral position. My pay, seniority, benefits, etc will all remain the same and they will know that. I've only worked for the company for about a year, so the standard ""I'm ready for a new challenge"" isn't a great option. Essentially, I need a more tactful answer than ""I can't stand working with my new boss"". Any advice?

1hg0rwu,"Manager is stingy in giving performance review, variable pay and increement","As this is the end of the year and performance review season, I sat with my manager to discuss his performance rating for me. In our organization, the variable pay is based on managers rating and there's no other way to showcase merit for the pay. The pay is a decent amount, and is decided based on rating. I joined the organization with very few weeks left in 2023, my manager in that year got a couple of promotions and in 2024 he promoted a couple of teammates from junior level to me to my level. 

Since I was new in 2023, I didn't expect him to give me rave reviews at that moment and he just gave me a basic. But in 2024 and throughout my tenure so far I have done multiple projects with no or meager help or assistance from him. My teammate says he doesn't know how to guide us or be a leader and never offered us help because of that. His lack of suggestions never bothered me because I loved solving things and getting things done which has contributed to improving my skill greatly, in the process of solving things I got to interact with other individuals across the company and I considered that also to be a bonus. Plus his is a new family, and I never wanted to get on to his nerves or concern him as a good colleague and used to mind my business, he also used to be and is understanding in terms of giving time off, doctors appointments, and no or lil micromanagement. He is based in a different location and rest of the team he manages is in one location, the entire group managed by his manager is in his location but not us, so he or his manager rarely get to interact with us in person, there's okayish amount of virtual interactions. Coming to my review for 2024, I have done more projects than any other team member, for that matter contributed more than my manager for team goals, represented the team in internal conferences, collaborated with other teams and individuals within team, organized activities for the team, and I am more skilled than my manager or his manager or any other team members, but still he gave me a basic rating. I read the performance review notes from him and he just included bare minimum information as to give a basic rating, it looked like the agenda was to give a basic rating and for accomplishing that he entered lil info. I highlighted to him my contributions even though he acknowledged all of that he simply avoiding the rating fact. I talked to my teammate for guidance since she's been in the team before I joined, and she says that our manager is unfit to be a manager, he never represents us properly to higher management and demeans our work, he's based in the other location and his manager and him just pull strings for their benefits rather than other team members. We had a conversation for promotion as well and he simply wanted to avoid promoting any of us, reason maybe he promoted two people already this year or whatever, I was quiet because it's been not so long that I joined. I took some time off now, and would return in Jan, I wanted to have a conversation with him on the performance review he has done and how pissed I'm of his negligent rating creating variable pay loss. Please share suggestions on how to deal this.

1hg02yg,Is a Second Degree Worth it After Art School?,"I’m in art school. My work is more classical as I’m doing my best to study in the classical and academic methods rather than more abstract stuff. I intended on being an illustrator, kinda like Frazetta style. Or a visual development artist. I’ve done this without going into debt (I'd been training since very early high school this way, so had a very good portfolio and got in on like 5 scholarships, plus a part time job). Basically, I have saved a decent chunk of money, enough money that I could just go back to university and pay the tuition fees myself (they’re cheap in this country) and not take much of a hit at all aside from 4 years of life.



The reason I’m thinking of that is obviously Fine Art isn’t a great degree money-wise. My tutors say I’m the strongest in the class (but that’s likely because its not a classical art school, so seeking out classical teaching online has automatically given me more technical skills than most here) and although I’m going to try and make it as an artist, I’d rather have a high-paying plan B than a low paying one I’d hate. Whilst I’m in a good position now I don’t want to be working my retail job in 15 years. I’ve figured it could be a good idea to go back whilst I have the money and stability to do it. 



So two main questions are is it worth it to get a second degree and if so which one. I am good at maths but I absolutely hate it which pulled my grade down for it slightly. I’m far better at literacy. As far as I can tell, that plus the fact I don’t have any science qualifications from school basically locks me in to some kind of Law degree. I did get straight As in school, just none of them were in STEM subjects. Nor am I very interested in anything STEM I'm aware of. Alternatively, I could do a postgraduate or masters in a different subject that is more practical financially, although it would need to be one that accepts grads from any discipline. ",ThrowRAcokecan,1,1.0,0,1734401172,2024-12-17 02:06:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hg02yg/is_a_second_degree_worth_it_after_art_school/,12,2024

1hg014y,My new boss is creating a toxic environment—now she wants us to sign a “team vows” document. Need advice.,"I work in an office where a new boss took over recently. She has no prior experience and, months later, still doesn’t know much about the job. Another coworker and I often go to a colleague who’s been there for 20 years because she knows the ins and outs of everything.

Well, the new boss is clearly jealous of this. She told the coworker it’s “inappropriate” for her to be friends with us outside of work. For the last few weeks, I’ve stopped pretending to be overly happy at work because I’m honestly over the fake smiles and the toxic energy she’s brought into the office.

Today, the boss handed out this “Five Unbreakable Vows of the Team” document (think “I will always assume the best in my teammates,” “I will not talk poorly about my team,” and “I will keep a positive mindset”). She asked us all to sign it. I told her point-blank that the only toxicity in the office comes from her, and I refused to sign.

Now I’m wondering if I handled that the best way. I’m at a breaking point, and I’d love some advice on how to navigate this situation. I’ve tried to stay professional, but I feel like the boss is making this personal and trying to control relationships.
	•	Should I have signed just to keep the peace?
	•	How can I address her behavior without making it worse?

However, seeing the job market, almost all internship jobs require experience and I don't have those yet.

I was hoping to find jobs that would align to my field of studies like telecomms, semiconductor, and IT. I feel overwhelmed as I am in Austin Texas, and the job market for these jobs is very competitive. I am thinking of taking the FE Exam (Electrical and Computer), would that help me in finding jobs? I am also thinking of studying for the CCNA. 

I am also thinking of joining the Air Force, but the pay isn't that just good. I know military has a lot of perks and benefits, but I am keen on earning good amount of money soon to help my husband on our bills and debts, and my sister who's still in college in my home country.

But honestly, if you were me, what would you do to jump start my career? ",Yokugenstein,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1734396920,2024-12-17 00:55:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hfyo7h/how_to_start/,12,2024
1hfyexd,I’m wondering when/if/how I should send a follow up email about a position I never got a response to? ,"
Hello, 

I applied to a position that said they were looking to fill the role “asap”. But it’s been over 10 days and no response. 

My background might not be perfect for the position but I know for certain I would be able to execute the job incredibly well and also stay in it for several+ years. I’m worried my email and cover letter just simply didn’t give the best impression. 

It’s an informal butler/houseman position. I’m happy to share more details about it or myself if anyone would like. 

I’m just asking how to best send an email to the recruiter to let them know that I would be the best candidate for this position and that taking an interview with me would not be a waste of their time. 

Not sure if this means anything, but the recruiter is based in the UK, and the position is in America. 

Thanks in advance.

1hfyetq,what major should i choose?,"as i’ve been applying to schools, i’ve been choosing to major is cs. but i’ve heard many people say cs is a useless degree nowadays and it’s impossible to get a job unless you’re “a god” when it comes to coding.

to be honest, i don’t want to be a programmer when im older. i enjoy coding but im a beginner and am not that good (i struggle on easy things and take longer than others to simplify a project).

i want to go to law school and focus on financial law and/or law related to tech (like cybersecurity, wire fraud, etc). i don’t want to major in finance (but might minor) because everyone says business is too easy and if you spend a lot of money on college you should do it on something not everyone can learn on their own. my parents want me to major in neuroscience but i feel like that’s way too different if i choose to go to law school.

my main goal is to pick something practical, so if i decide i no longer want to be an attorney (or really enjoy my undergrad major) i can have success in that too. if not an attorney, i was thinking of creating a startup, probably tech related. 

also i don’t want to go into engineering of any sort since i think it’s a completely different career path than law. but if it’s a smarter choice, i would do it. overall i love math and stats but also find mock trial super interesting. 

sorry for the very long text lol. i just dont want to ruin my future 😃

also no hate to business majors, ive just been hearing those comments a lot from engineer majors ",Brilliant-Resolve579,1,1.0,2,1734396189,2024-12-17 00:43:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hfyetq/what_major_should_i_choose/,12,2024

1. Work full time while I wait to get accepted into a super cheap cc program. (Nursing, dental hygiene, respiratory therapist, radiology tech) All will most likely be a +4 yr wait.

2. Pay for a private program of radiology tech and START NOW, start making money in 2 yrs. Costs 60k 

3. Get a microbiology bachelors degree to become a clinical laboratory scientist. Requires 1 yr post baccalaureate program. Will probably also be done by the time I'm 30. And not even sure how much it costs. So a combination of the cons of 1 and 2 lol. But clinical laboratory scientist sounds fun 
I can keep applying for the cc programs while I work on the bachelor's degree...but not sure what the end game is with this one. But it's what's calling me lol (love being a student and love microbiology)

I'm torn between two paths and would appreciate your help:
1- Technical Support Engineer at one of the big cloud providers supporting Databricks.
2- AI Developer for a local stock brokerage in one of the Gulf states.

I hold a MSc in Data Science and 5 years of total experience across various roles (relevant 1 year ML research + 1 year in Technical Support)

I'm hesitant for the following reasons:
A) Multinational vs Local corporation
B) lifestyle as option 1 has remote work and better benefits, while option 2 requires me to travel to another country and work in a very demanding work environment.
C) I think 2 might be more exciting than 1. But lately I've become less attached about work being ""fun"" and accepting the idea that work is work and I should persue fulfillment in other areas of my life.

Pay is comparable in both choices if you take a holistic view.

I’ve been with my company for five years. For the past five years I’ve gotten stellar reviews knocked everything off my goals list my boss had told me to do. I even inherited a team while keeping my same responsibilities the team has grown and is doing amazing as well.

Last week I found out that one or two things might be happening after I confronted my boss about rumors that we’re going around. (This is all Speculation but something is happening by Wednesday) First thing that might happen is I get let go. The second thing that may happen as I get moved into a different role. The reasons my boss told me that this could be happening is the CEO is very upset “randomly”. The things that I heard about what was said were not real goals to be completed by me/I never hear of them or are not even my responsibility.

1hfuuxz,New job regret,"I’m about three weeks into my new job and I’m concerned at the number of red flags that are already appearing. Here is some background:

- I’ve had a successful career so far and have been in growth marketing/paid media strategy for 10+ years. I’ve been working in corporate for large companies and my new company is a global nonprofit. 
- I didn’t take a pay cut but forfeited other benefits like flexible schedule, unlimited PTO, and great work life balance. Already it’s clear that teams at this company refuse to take time off. But I wanted to work in this industry and was hoping it would at least feel worth it and become rewarding in other ways.
- I found out after accepting the role and starting my job that I’m coming onboard during a period of high change. I learned my predecessor was let go, and had applied for the job I was selected for. Almost everyone that I’ve met with during meet and greet calls has made a point to mention this. 
- Almost nothing at this company is strategic. I can’t help but feel my role is a step down from the level of work that I’m used to. Teams are not sophisticated and lack organization with conflicting priorities. 
- The company was recently centralized and there are clear growing pains. I also report to the central marketing team but still have to answer to and collaborate more closely with the local operations teams who seem extremely change resistant and rigid. 

I’m trying to look at the situation objectively to decide how much of a chance I should give this opportunity or when to see the forest for the trees and cut my losses. I’m in a very financially stable situation so more so analyzing the best path professionally. 

I’m also a go-getter and am not easily thrown off. But this role has had so many red flags so far, I’m starting to objectively doubt my decision. Going back to my old company is not something I’m interested in.

1hfu4mx,"Advice Needed: Starting a Cybersecurity Career in GRC 
","Hi everyone,

I’m a 25-year-old woman eager to break into Cybersecurity, specifically in the GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) field. So far, I’ve earned a Professional Cybersecurity Certificate from Coursera and the (ISC)² CC certification, and I’m currently preparing for the Security+ exam.

**My question is:** Is it possible to land a cybersecurity job without having the Security+ certification yet, while continuing to study for it after securing a role?

The state I currently live in (New Hampshire) doesn’t offer many opportunities for tech or cybersecurity jobs, so I’m considering relocating to the DC area, where I’ve heard there are better opportunities. However, I don’t have security clearance. Would moving there still be a smart move?

For additional context:

* I have a Bachelor’s degree in Communications with minors in Business Administration and Gender Studies.
* I’ve also completed a Project Management Certificate (PMP) from Coursera.

I’m just looking for some guidance on what my next steps should be to successfully transition into this field. Thanks in advance for your advice!

1hftpn7,LinkedIn - parlare degli affari propri e non degli interessi dell'azienda,"Ciao a tutti,

*TL:DR: L'autore si interroga su quanto sia appropriato ""pubblicizzare"" su LinkedIn un interesse personale o un'attività secondaria non concorrente con il lavoro principale. Si chiede come sia possibile far coesistere la comunicazione di entrambi gli ambiti sul profilo, temendo che un potenziale recruiter possa dubitare del livello di impegno del candidato* (Thank you, GPT!)

Titolo un po' bait per dargli spessore - premetto che non sapevo bene in quale sub postare questo mio dubbio ma poi mi son detto che il maggior numero di persone che usano attivamente LinkedIn lo avrei trovato qui, quindi *even though it's not strictly about career advice* lo metto qui.

  
Ho sempre avuto un certo interesse nel capire quali dinamiche sociali regolassero la comunicazione su LinkedIn e mi sono accorto nel corso degli anni che gruppi e ambienti diversi di lavoro hanno una cifra comunicativa diversa (com'è giusto che sia) su questa piattaforma.  
Per chi lavora nel corporate, il proprio profilo LinkedIn è strettamente legato a quello dell'Azienda (spesso un grosso nome), i ""gradi di libertà"" comunicativi si fanno molto ridotti e diventa tutto una celebrazione dei successi dell'Azienda, dei propri achievements professionali interni alla stessa e, al massimo, ciò che è concesso è qualche riflessione più ampia sul settore di riferimento (sempre molto pacata e lontana da polarizzazioni d'opinione forti) o la celebrazione di un proprio risultato nel campo della formazione.

  
Qui il dilemma: immaginate di avere una passione, un interesse più o meno sviluppato come side hustle, in un campo diverso - chiaramente NON concorrente con il vostro datore di lavoro, beninteso. Ebbene, quanto ritenete sia concesso ""pubblicizzare"" su LinkedIn questo vostro interesse? Quanto ritenete possa essere ben accetto avere un profilo LinkedIn ""corporate"" magari presentandosi come cintura nera di PM e poi parlare assiduamente e in modo estremamente professionale di (a caso) garden design o di restauro di mobili antichi?

Immaginando di avere un network che provenga da entrambi i due mondi, come ritenete sia possibile far coesistere questa comunicazione? Sono quasi sicuro che un eventuale headhunter o hiring manager che controlli il profilo sicuramente si porrà il problema che questo potenziale candidato abbia veramente un committment al 100% o meno. Vedo meno probabile che sia affascinato dall'eclettismo del candidato.

Cosa ne pensate? Vi ponete questo problema o per voi LinkedIn è esclusivamente piattaforma per una carriera lineare e non per un networking più allargato?   
Sono curioso di conoscere le vostre risposte!",CorporateFlamingo,1,1.0,0,1734383558,2024-12-16 21:12:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hftpn7/linkedin_parlare_degli_affari_propri_e_non_degli/,12,2024

1hfryek,So Lost 🪢,"

Hi all,

I’m a 28M that has been in overdraft for the past two weeks (-$1000). I managed to get my first real job without any education besides some community college credits in late 2021 as a desktop support technician and legit worked there for a week, due to imposter syndrome and just feeling like I didn’t deserve it, prior to getting that job in late 2018 I did a one year non profit career development program that had an IT track where  only attended for 4 months then dropped out, due to impulsiveness also I was 21 at that time. 

I then worked odd jobs from 2019-2021 then managed to get the desktop support job I mentioned earlier, left it after a week due to anxiety and imposter syndrome. From 2021-2022 I continued to work odd jobs, then in late 2022 I decided to do a digital marketing bootcamp where I learned skills and applied to 100s of jobs until I landed my first ever remote job in December 2022 that paid only 50k a year, mind you know I’m in Seattle which is one of the most expensive states. 

And so I worked that remote job for legit 2 weeks then quit because of many personal issues, such as living with parents and many siblings in a small apartment and there being too much noise, I regret that decision till this day, so I then continued working odd jobs until today, I’m currently looking back and seeing a pattern of lack of commitment and also after being bombarded with bootcamps, career paths I got confused and just didn’t know what to choose and mix that with living with parents and many siblings being a poor kid, and also living in an expensive city being offered just $50k starting for these opportunities I was given I know I could’ve been patient gained experience and then job hop but I guess I didn’t have that patience. 

I currently am sticking to the digital marketing career path and currently searching for jobs in that field being very focused not to look at starting something else, while I worked these odd jobs, I’ve put in many applications and have gotten a few interviews so far and the jobs are starting salary of $28 an hour, which is more than what I earn $23/hr. I also started university this October and managed to get 90+ credits from both Sophia and study.com which are equivalent credits for a degree at university of Maine yourpace program, and looking to transfer those for the bachelors of business administration marketing degree and from what my student advisor tells me with the amount of credits I have which are specific and equivalent to cover classes in this specific degree I’ve chosen, that once I transfer them all in I’d have only 10 classes left to get a bachelors degree. 

So in 2 months I was technically able to knock out so many classes on Sophia and study.com that my degree program said I saved myself from taking 40 classes to 10 classes which is a big achievement. I’m still really broke living in this city “seattle” but I have a decent resume of jobs listed (odd jobs not included) and a website with projects and a LinkedIn which is really optimized and full of projects. 

I also tailor my resume for the digital marketing jobs I apply to. My thinking is if I can get a 55-65k a year digital marketing remote job and work a odd job on the weekend making $150/day, I’d be bringing in at least $1100 a week which is ok… I don’t have kids but the situation is just weird in that I’m the oldest living with all my siblings in this house and my parents are getting older. I never had any mentor in life and sometimes just think what if I just applied for the police department and got paid $40 hour starting and just finished my degree on the side as opposed to sending out all these digital marketing remote job applications heck I could even get a CDL and work on my degree on the side. 

But then I also really want to get a digital marketing job + odd job on the weekend to supplement and work on degree at the same time as I feel that’s a better setup for me.

1hfr0j2,Too early to change jobs? ,"Hey everyone! 

Looking for some advice here. I recently got out of education to take on a corporate role. I have been employed here for 6 months and have recently earned my MBA. The job I have pays the same as my old teaching job, but I needed it for experience for my resume. 

I understand an MBA essentially means nothing without job experience, but now that I have both I want to look into a higher paying role. 

Is it too early to look for higher paying jobs now that I have business related experience and a masters degree, or should I stick it out until I have been here for a year? Obviously I want to make more money so I can support my family. I would have no problem sticking this job out for another 6-12 months, but times are tough financially.

1hfqo59,MS in data science / MBA - WHAT TO DO WITH MY LIFE,"I'm a 2024 computer science graduate working as an Associate Software Engineer at Victoria's Secret. After 7 months in this role (4 months as an intern and 3 months full-time), I'm starting to question my career path. I've always considered pursuing a postgraduate degree in Computer Science or Data Science to deepen my expertise. However, given the current job market's volatility and saturation, I'm uncertain if this is the best move.

On the other hand, an MBA seems like a promising option. Many friends suggest that chasing the money and going for an MBA could lead to higher-paying roles and broader career opportunities. However, transitioning from a technical role to a business-oriented path feels daunting since I lack a business background.

I plan to complete one full year at my current job to gain more experience before pursuing further education. But I'm torn between a master's in CS/Data Science and an MBA. If you've faced a similar decision or have insights into these paths, I'd love to hear your advice. How did you decide, and what were your experiences post-graduation?

1hfqnan,Dealing with the blow to your ego when you no longer feel valued,"My organization is offering bonuses for people to leave as part of a downsizing effort. They are strongly targeting people over 60 as well as redundant positions. I happen to fit both categories and have been informed I am highly likely to be ""retired"" by end of March in 2025. 

Well, since this started there has been one particular person in the organization who I work with who has decided he is pretty much ignoring me. In meetings he rarely asks my advice anymore. He specifically names who he wants to get feedback from and skips over my name. I should specify that I am in a senior leadership position; I'm not a middle manager. I have worked there over 15 years and I've had very senior responsibilities for more than half of that. So it would be normal for me to be leading conversations and not just providing feedback. 

It's very clear that this person (he's at a Senior VP level) is aware I'm on the chopping block and just skips right over me. He doesn't thank me for anything, acknowledge my work or ask for my advice. He just doesn't respect it anymore. 

And it's very upsetting to be honest because it has caused me to completely second guess my skills and experience and what I have to say and contribute.

Work 5-10 hours a week on developing data systems and writing statistical code for my agency. No direct reports. 

Reason for looking: current job has no career progression. I’m one of a kind at my agency and people above me refer to me for subject matter expertise. Pay raises don’t happen even with exceptional work and time. Looking to climb and earn more at the age of 32. Oh also I finish my PhD in epidemiology / biostatistics this fall.

The offer: 2 offers from the US census regional offices. Atlanta & Philadelphia. The job is a Regional survey manager. GS12 step 1, 98k or so the tables for each area are publicly available here https://www.federalpay.org/gs/2024.
 I’d try to negotiate step 3. I’d manage each states supervisor (7 total) and indirectly manage there people for a responsibility of 200-300 people. 

Philly- I’d have to relocate my 2 kids both under 3. My wife would need to transfer (currently VA GS-12 Social worker). We’d need to sell our home, acquire daycare, and find new likely worse housing. 

Atlanta- the job is 4 10s I have  family I can stay with there. I’d commute Monday morning, stay that night work then come home Tuesday. I’d work from home Wednesday & Thursday off on Friday-Sunday. I’d do this until my wife found a job or if she liked it keep our home and do it indefinitely ASSUMING the telework packet isn’t yanked from under me. That’s my biggest concern. 

Assuming you answer with I want to progress and grow my career and not rest on my laurels, what do you do?

She requires dialysis x3 a week, and she cannot transport herself. When she has the energy, she can cook for herself but beyond that she has little energy to do much else.

My sister has been caring for her all this time, and she is overwhelmed. After 1.5 years at my employer, I asked if being remote is a possibility. So I can work out-of-state to assist my sister, and to care for our elderly parents. My manager seemed hesitant, even stating at one point, *""Don't you have other siblings?""* My manager has been distant ever since I brought up remote work.

1hfp9ma,Manager raised his voice at me & embarrassed me in front of other analysts,"Not sure if I’m just being dramatic so I wanted to bring it up. 

**Context:** I am an analyst with domain experience before becoming an analyst (a good example would be if I’m a logistics analyst who used to be a fedex driver). 

I used to report directly to the VP of our department who I have always had a good working relationship with. Recently, we hired a new director who used to be the director for Rainforest company so now I report directly to him.

When I asked him for feedback, he had mentioned that he expects me to determine the KPIs (implying that I shouldn’t need the stakeholders input. If they have questions they want to ask, I should just build it all on my own and show them the finished product after) on my own, especially since I have previous domain background. 

The Issue: The director, myself and a couple of other analysts within the same team were on a call when he 1.) started raising his voice at me 2.) (I felt) started challenging me to create KPIs / views I think the stakeholders need on the spot since I have domain experience despite the stakeholder outlining exactly what he wanted to see in the visualization tool.

As an analyst, I’m of the opinion that developing visualizations is always going to be a collaborative process & I don’t understand why my background is being weaponized against me. (Personally, I am of the impression that he just doesn’t want to do the work - where other directors I’ve worked with have had zero issues with my work & they all have clear visions of what they want to see in a visualization, this director has neither domain nor technical experience / knowledge. In fact, he has done very little to make my life better. He has mostly just made my life worse.)

I have a 1:1 with my director and I’m wondering if I should even bring those things up. My options are as follows:
1.) Bring it up to my director & express who disheartened I am by how I was treated during that call
2.) Bring it up to my VP (who is my director’s boss)
3.) Just try to get out of that department and into another department that I know for a fact will take me",tenetofsushi,0,0.5,18,1734372361,2024-12-16 18:06:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hfp9ma/manager_raised_his_voice_at_me_embarrassed_me_in/,12,2024

Our team is very close, but the company cut some people over the last two years that have made things so tough because we’ve all had to take on new tasks that weren’t ours before.

Our CCO has been dangling a carrot in front of my face for two years telling me I’m gonna be the star of our team and grow, and yet after they made the cuts, I essentially got demoted to doing the same work I’d been doing for five years and things for one of my coworkers that doesn’t know how to do it (and refuses to learn).

Then there is the issue that my coworkers are constantly taking off, so we go from being a team of 3 to a team of 2. I can’t get the work done that I’m assigned because I have to fill in for them, and I feel like I’m beating a dead horse with no room to grow.

I’ve been applying to new jobs since January. Nothing has worked out yet. So “just dealing with it and quietly try to leave” is not an option anymore. I need to try to see if they can modify my role in some way so that I can grow because what’s the point of being here otherwise.

I’m very close to the manager I would be speaking with and I know she is also frustrated at a lot of things the company does. But I’m hoping she can talk to our CCO about actually making some of those things he promised happen so I can tolerate the rest of my time here until I’m able to get out.

I'm a mechanical engineer who worked for a Japanese company that builds power plants. After graduating, I worked in a remote part of my country for two years. The pay was great (triple the average salary here), but the location was isolating—no social life, no chances to make friends or date, and rare visits to see family.

After that, my company sent me to Thailand for four years, and it was the best time of my life. I loved the job, made friends, start dating, and had a great work life balance. Unfortunately, the project ended, and now I'm back in my country, single again, and waiting for a new assignment.

Now, the project in Thailand is over, and I've been back in my country for six months, waiting for a new project. I don't get paid unless I'm working on projects, but I have a small guesthouse business that covers my living expenses.

Recently my company offered me a new one-year contract in another remote part of my country.

The salary is great for my country, but I know it will be the same isolating lifestyle as before-just work, no social life, and little to do outside of work.

The work was fairly easy and I really enjoyed my team unfortunately there was no room for me to stay after my assignment. From there I started as an office manager for a non profit. I was in charge of 5 different offices all at different locations it was extremely overwhelming to start but I was hopeful I could catch on. After a few months I was networking with our companies marketing department and applied for a new role they had created. I was rejected and told that I was needed in my current department. My hopes of getting my foot in the door with our marketing team diminished. 
They fired half of our management team and never replaced those roles. A lot of that work was pushed onto me. Everything was becoming too much and I finally left. Now I’m job searching again. I have a few interviews for admin positions, which I am thankful to be getting responses in this job market. At the same time I really don’t want to be an admin assistant anymore. I have been putting a lot of effort into networking and building my marketing portfolio. I just don’t want to jump into another admin role and ultimately my fear is getting stuck in administrative assistant jobs. There’s nothing wrong with being an admin assistant it just doesn’t align with what I want for my career at all.

1hfn334,The Best Lessons I Learned After 2 Years in Therapy,"Two years ago, I walked into my first therapy session feeling broken and hopeless. I’d hit rock bottom, burned out from work stress and tangled in a web of self-doubt and anxiety. My therapist’s office became a lifeline—a place where I could be vulnerable, messy, and honest without fear of judgment. Each week, I peeled back another layer of myself. I learned to name my emotions, untangle toxic patterns, and finally see the root of my struggles. It wasn’t easy. Some sessions left me drained, but I always left feeling lighter, like I’d unlocked a small piece of a puzzle I didn’t know I was solving.

I want to share some of the most profound lessons I learned during those 30+ sessions—things that reshaped how I see myself and the world. Maybe they’ll help you, too.

1. Your Thoughts Are Not Facts

One of the most eye-opening lessons I learned is that just because I think something doesn’t make it true. My therapist introduced me to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques, particularly cognitive reframing. For example, when I found myself spiraling into thoughts like, “I’ll never be good enough,” she helped me identify the distortion (catastrophizing) and replace it with evidence-based thinking: *What evidence do I have to support this?* It’s a game-changer to realize you can challenge your inner critic instead of taking its word as law.

2. Boundaries Are the Highest Form of Self-Love

I used to say “yes” to everything and everyone, convinced that being agreeable was the only way to be liked. Therapy taught me that setting boundaries isn’t selfish; it’s an act of self-respect. I learned to say “no” without guilt and to protect my emotional energy. A mantra my therapist gave me: *“You’re not responsible for how people react to your boundaries. You’re only responsible for enforcing them.”*

3. Emotions Are Messengers, Not Enemies

For years, I thought emotions like sadness or anger were “bad.” Therapy taught me they’re not inherently good or bad—they’re signals. Anger might be telling you that your boundaries have been crossed. Sadness could mean you need rest or connection. Instead of suppressing or avoiding my emotions, I started listening to them and asking, *“What do you need from me?”*

1hfmy2k,My manager is extremely incompetent. How can I cope until I start/fins something else? ,"Basically my job situation is in limbo due to
some company restructuring, but there’s a good chance that I have new opportunity in the works, thank god!

In the meantime, my incompetent manager is becoming harder and harder to work with. Doesn’t know how to do basic office tasks so it’s beyond delegating but now asking myself and others to essentially do their job for them.

Constantly getting information mixed up and confused, and is now putting employees uncomfortable in situations with hostile clients. 

How can I cope in these last few weeks with them? It’s driving myself and my coworkers crazy and it’s becoming an unhealthy work environment fast. 

I wish I could add more details but I don’t feel comfortable sharing the whole story online.

1hfmvrb,Thinking about taking a dive into the social work career and would like some advice.,"I have been studying cyber security for about two years now. I’m in community college going for an associates degree in cyber security and then going to get some certs to help make myself more marketable for jobs. 

I have attend a couple hackathons and webinars with cyber security professionals as well as students. I feel like I don’t fit in. I don’t feel like these are my people and that I won’t adapt to the culture if there is some. I feel like I have taken a lot of time to reach out to professionals and students like myself for guidance as well just to develop a relationship. I’ve gotten nothing from this. 

I have come to the conclusion that I am not a numbers or math person. Simple statistics boggles my brain. I have a semester and a half left. I need to take python 1&2 and I also have an algebra course, I don’t think I am capable of this. I know cyber security is a lot of coding as well as analytical skills. Most of my courses I have used chat gpt to help me better understand as well as do the work for me. I don’t think I have learned or memorized how to do a lot of what I have been taught. I’m at my wits end because I think I want to switch my focus on my career over to social work and climb the ranks.

My partner is a social worker and they thrive in their career. The community they have is engaging and supportive. It almost seems like a welcoming space. 
I have not seen or felt this way about cyber security or any tech related careers. I literally only want a career in cybersecurity to help people and make hella good money. 

I also see social working as a way to also better myself and my journey for self improvement. While Also improving the lives of others. I have had a rough upbringing and I have proven time and time again that I am more than capable of achieving happiness and my goals. I just feel like social working aligns more with my will of inner work and wanting to give that to others. 

I am 32 and a dude. Would the right decision to make this change be worth while? Or stick with my associates and the certs and try and make that work?",Expensive_Gain8076,1,1.0,0,1734366314,2024-12-16 16:25:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hfmvrb/thinking_about_taking_a_dive_into_the_social_work/,12,2024
1hfmiq2,What salary should I expect in India?,"Hey Reddit Community, I need some career advice!

I’m the founder of an EdTech startup from North India. I launched the platform 6 years ago, right after graduating from college, and grew it to 2Million+ users and 2Million+ app downloads on Google Playstore. It’s been a challenging but rewarding solo journey—I managed everything from end-to-end product development, low-code implementation, business strategy, and hiring temporary contractors when needed.

Here’s an important note: this was a fully bootstrapped venture. I started with almost $0 and raised no funding so far. Despite this, I achieved significant traction, although profit averaged around 15 Lakhs INR per year.

Now, I’m planning to transition into a corporate role, ideally in product management or a related field.

Given my experience as a solo founder and my achievements, what roles or titles should I target? What salary range is realistic for someone with my background?

I already have a background in clinical genetics but I’d like to take on a midlevel provider role (medical school is out of the question for me). Mainly, I want to switch because NP/PAs make more money, they have more autonomy when it comes to counseling patients, and they have a combo of hard and soft skills that can be transferrable outside of genetics. 

If anyone can speak to how NPs or PAs fare with telemedicine and working in academic medical centers compared to smaller centers, that would be great.

I have been working with the company for 10 years and am in the team the band above dealing with much higher value insurance risks. 

I have always gone above and beyond for this company, I take on additional responsibilities, I am the main point of contact for external brokers because they call me as they know I pick up the phone and will assist. Other members of the team barely do anything, don’t assist with additional responsibilities and all get paid more than me despite most being in the job less time than me.

Do I really have a leg to stand on if I email my MD? I’m worried that I will get into trouble for discussing my pay, but I had a feeling this would happen so wanted to confirm my suspicions.

1hfjwmp,What should I do with my filmmaking career?,"I started video editing / filming around 10 months ago, and I think I've found my passion. Since a very young age I've always been interested in movies and digital art ( I was selling movie-inspired cartoons on the lunch line at 10 ), and through my teenage years I've created art and video-thumbnails for some pretty big creators in my country and mastered Photoshop. 

I always did some sketches and recorded some videos on my phone and edited them on Kinemaster at the time LOL. But it was only after I completed 19 that I started editing some short content professionally, and then gave it a shot at long form and actually managed to take one youtube channel from 1k subs to almost 30k in 10months,  (that's absolutely huge in my country) with great retention results, and always getting complements for whom I was working with for ""saving scrappy footage through editing"" and coming up with really creative ideas/shots/storytelling.

After finishing HS I felt kinda lost, because I hated school and never ""fitted in the system"" (nor liked it), although I've always had a good results and my parents were shocked I didn't apply for uni ( Although I was studying science my teachers always said I belonged to the Arts, but I never wanted to believe that because I've grown up listening you'll be poor if you work in that area). 

After some months trying different stuff, I fell in love with cinematography, and now I spend my days studying it, watching movies and videos for inspo, reading from old dusty books that my my dad has, and doing freelance and some personal projects (I have bills to pay and I left my parents house to come to a big city for opportunities). I really believe I'm a very creative and working person (specially for my age) and with the little knowledge I have, and learning EVERYTHING (from editing in Resolve to learning how to shoot a dutch angle) I'm ready to take it up to the next step and make my life around this passion. I know it may be a ""not-so-lucrative"" path at start, but I'm able to adapt and work in different areas until I'm comfortable. I wanted to ask to the more-experienced people in the area if you advise me to continue this path of learning through the internet, freelancing and working with different people and climbing my way up, try and find a job in the area and gain ""REAL"" experience there (I only have my highschool diploma), or go to a film-school and continue freelancing and working with my 2 most ""reliable"" clients (but obvs focusing more on the studies) and go from there. I really need some insight on this, thanks a bunch!

TLTR: I'm 19, I love filmmaking, I'm quite good at creating videos and stories, learned everything through the internet, and want to take it to the next step, should I continue freelancing, try find a job in the area to get experience (I only have HS finished) or go to a film-school.

1hfiz0o,Operating Room Nurse Frustrated With The Culture Everyone Thinks They Are The Only Ones Who Do Any Work,"I'm young and a relatively new nurse (25 graduated 2022) and started working in the OR in April and I Love the job itself. I try my hardest every day because I know I have a lot to learn and always help out in any way I know. Most of my coworkers are good people but I constantly hear them complaining they are the only ones doing any work and I think their belief that everyone else is slacking off let's them feel okay slacking off. So it's kind of a cycle. We have high turn over because almost anyone who comes through and actually works gets burnt out because everyone gladly let's them do all the work. I thought my management was aware of this and up until last month I felt extremely supported by them but they said that the staff was complaining that I wasn't doing any work and it seems they believe whoever was saying it. I definitely want to try to stay on until April because I'm getting a retention bonus that will allow me to easily afford my wedding (although I'm extremely anxious they'll fire me and I'll be putting up with this bs for no reason) but I don't know how to deal with the culture in the meantime. Like the laziest of my coworkers will complain about ""someone"" being lazy and obviously be directing the remarks towards me. A big issue is that our main task is to be working in the operating room and some people will only be in a room for 2 hours while the rest of us are in a room all day. The people working for only 2 hours think that the additional tasks like preparing for the next day should be split evenly even though the rest of us were working the full day?

1hfhxpp,im lost about what i wanna do in life?,"Growing up, I was always fascinated by science and dreamed of becoming an engineer or scientist. My hobby was building robots and working with electronics—it was something I truly enjoyed. At the same time, I was a massive foodie and loved cooking. Being in the kitchen gave me a sense of peace, and I cherished every moment I spent experimenting with food.  

Eventually, I decided to follow my passion for cooking and pursue a career as a chef. It felt like the perfect choice, even though I knew it would be a tough path. I was excited about the journey ahead and worked hard to get into one of the top culinary colleges. Once there, I thrived in the classes and became one of the top students.  

When the time came for my internship, I was thrilled to work at one of the best restaurants. It was an incredible learning experience, and the people I worked with were fantastic. But as the months went by, the harsh reality of the profession started to sink in. I was working 12–16 hours a day, barely getting 5 hours of sleep, and living like this for months on end. The compensation for such grueling work was, frankly, disheartening—just enough to scrape by, with no room to save.  

Even when I looked ahead, the prospect of climbing the ranks didn’t seem much better. I know not every kitchen or workplace is the same, but I realized I couldn’t see myself doing this for the rest of my life.  

Now, as I’m about to start my last semester at university, I feel lost. I’m sure I don’t want to work in a professional kitchen, but I also don’t know what I want to do instead. My goal has always been to make a big, meaningful impact in the world, and I feel like I need to explore something new.

I worked in this firm for 7 years and few years ago they started to pay late until now.. currently there are 4 months delay in the salaries. Two months ago I resigned to join an old colleague in another company , they pay on time but the stress of the work is the same.
I started my own business of taking Art commissions from all over the world 6 years ago through my social media pages and I currently have a waiting list for 6 months upfront, I gain double my salary from Art and I enjoy every commission I do so I don’t feel like it is work, unlike my work in Architecture that is becoming boring and stressful ..  I work on  the commissions at night so I am always very busy and don’t have time for social life.
If you were me would you resign and focus on Art commissions and maybe try to grow in it or would you stay in a 9-5 work and do both together?
I would really love to do art full time but so much worried that I might stop receiving commissions for some reason in the future and get stuck and maybe no one would hire me again for Architecture because of the gap?

1hfhqdn,I have a very embarrassing confession to make,"I have always been awful at maths.



Terrible.



myself



You can’t even believe how bad I’m.



I can’t barely handle a simple two-digit calculation without pulling out my phone and tap on the calculator. And sometimes I even find miself counting on my fingers (Don’t worry if we meet because I try to hide mislef in public before doing so).



Some would say that I might feel embarrassed of it or ashamed.

Maybe they are right.



But, I’m making this confession because being extremely bad at maths has taught me an extremely valuable lesson for success in life.



**Figure out what you are terrible at and stop doing it.**



Think about it. There are millions of people who are naturally far better than you at that thing you’re struggling with. If you pour your energy into improving at it, you’re choosing the slowest, most painful path to success in your career.



Instead, be smart. Identify what you suck at, and find a way to avoid it. Then, double down on what you’re actually good at. If you do that, you’re setting yourself up to win.



Never try to improve that thing you are terrible at. It’s just not worth it.

Just get rid of it as I did with maths.



Pro tip: if for whatever reason you can not get rid of it yet, try spreading some strategic incompetence (I might make a post about it and how to do it)

1hfhoyd,Struggling to Transition Careers: What Jobs Would Value My Skills as a Buyer/Reseller?,"Hi guys, I’d like to hear some advice as I’ve been really struggling in my job search. My current position I’ve been seeking to transition from is a buyer job for a company that buys and resales items on Amazon for profit. My job involves using apps to determine the sales and price history of items I find online or in stores to determine if they will be profitable for us to buy and resale and for what price. I’ve done this since high school in a lower position and increased in responsibility over the years, including my post-college years. But due to recent low sales, my employer can only pay me part-time, and I need to find a full-time position. So far I’ve struggled after many months to find a position. I don’t know somebody who knows somebody, so I’m reliant upon responding to job posts or reaching out to people on LinkedIn. So far, based on job posts and response history, the vast majority of entry-level jobs in my area demand or want more precise experience that I don’t have, so I don’t get considered or am rejected by the ATS criteria. I’ve tried staffing agencies, but I’m told by them that they don’t have a buyer position, so they can’t help me. I’ve gotten desperate for jobs, and the only jobs that have been willing to hire are jobs that later turned out to be pure commission sales jobs. So far, it seems all I have are transferable skills, and I’m wondering what kinds of jobs would realistically hire someone with just this experience or do I need to skill up and get some kind of certification or another degree?

1hfgsu7,At a crossroads ,"Hello everyone!
First thing first: English is not my first language, so I apologise in advance for my mistakes or misuse of terms.
There's been a storm raging in my head for months now... and I'd like to start a dialogue on the age-old topic of work without talking about money, but by focusing on what's really important to each of us and maybe being able to calm the tumultuous waters of my thoughts a bit.

My ‘career’ has not been very linear.
However, I have mostly and happily worked in schools (almost 10 years), mostly teaching extra courses or in private schools (didn't have the proper degree - I come from a place with very strict rules about this aspect and private schools often manage things on their terms). I love working with children and young people of all ages, I have a natural predisposition for this kind of work and I only discovered this by doing it, I never thought of this before entering UNI and getting a totally different degree. 
Since I've always had very little work (alas), I've combined it with my job as an illustrator, struggling a bit to save money for the future, but fortunately without ever needing help.
At a certain point I couldn't take the precariousness any more and allowed myself to be attracted by a position with good prospects of permanent employment in an office (thanks to a f***in' mortgage). Now I have a fixed and more than decent salary every month, benefits and well-defined hours, punctual payments and excellent relations with colleagues. But...
Work, in itself, incredibly sucks. For me, at least.
Office work has always scared me a bit, but not knowing it I had to try it and now I know that it really, really sucks.
The good stuff comes now!
I enrolled part-time at university, for my own whim (I like studying so much) and because this master's degree in particular gives access to various classes that interest me and for which I would gladly start substitute teaching, returning to my beloved school. This IS the proper degree!
And where is the problem, you will say?
The problem is that I have a really good chance of getting a permanent position where I am now (99%, and I say that only out of superstition), but thinking about doing this all my life puts me in a depressed state of mind.
I'd like to throw myself back into teaching at school, because that's where I see myself in the long term. But I can't help thinking about the precariousness of this job (this is related to where I live). That's mainly the point, because the salary I get now is no different from what I would get as a teacher (calculations already made, it's something I wouldn't dwell on).

Have any of you made this kind of choice?
Considering a mortgage (one third of my salary), does it make sense to get back into the precarious work loop?
Is it better to do what you like with no prospects of a permanent job or to be comfortable in a fixed and secure position even though you know deep down that it is not ideal for you?
How have you overcome your fear of precariousness (even for those that are freelancers)?
Thanks for reading this far :-)

TLDR: permanent job you don't like or precarious job you like? ",Technically_Funny,1,1.0,0,1734347380,2024-12-16 11:09:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hfgsu7/at_a_crossroads/,12,2024

I started working in a start up, and wore a lot of hats depending on the situation, from marketing to logistics, designing, customer care, data analysis, etc.

After 3 years I decided to choose on a niche that was social media marketing, and started working in a social media agency, but the work environment was toxic. Left it in a year to start my own fashion brand.

To sustain this fashion brand, I started freelance graphic designing on the side, but the fashion brand failed and I continued doing design. However, now I feel there are more challenges and I do not have the bandwidth to focus on this. 

I'm kind of leaning towards getting a job, but I don't have enough skills to get a job in a proper design/marketing firm. I've always had a knack for data analysis, so I'm thinking to learn about it, practice some important skills for that, and then get a job in that field.

So I was fired today, Sunday, at 4pm via telephone, by the owner of the company after just receiving my schedule the previous day, from my director. I was scheduled to work 37.5 hours this week. And just received my schedule yesterday. 

The owner called me and told me he would be terminating my employment immediately and not to come back in for the following reasons. 

1) poor leadership skills 

I am a colead teacher at a daycare. My other colead is still employed with the company. 

Mind you, I’ve never received a written write up ever and have been employed at the company for almost 4 months. I’ve never received a verbal warning either and was just told two weeks ago that my hours would be increased, and I had a heart to heart conversation with my director and she told me she wanted to keep me on the team and thought I was a good worker. 

Now I am fired? With no notice after just receiving my schedule? 

Again I’ve never received any written or verbal warnings ever. And this decision was solely the owners.

 I could get a job somewhere in construction making a good salary, but I dont love it. It's fine, it's work, it pays the bills, but I dont feel empowered with what I do.

I'm considering going back to school to become a massage therapist, but there's a few factors holding me back, and the main thing would be money I suppose. It pays way less, and doesn't have a lasting career from what I understand (also costs $30k for schooling)...

Making more money would help me achieve those goals more easily, but would I feel regret about my own purpose and career path ? I don't wanna be 40 with multiple kids thinking dang I never did something I enjoyed as a career. But also I'm thinking, maybe I'm too egotistical about my purpose? Maybe my lifes purpose is just to provide for my family and help out in my community. Maybe self fulfillment in a career is bullshit, and we really just need eachother? I don't know.

1hf9vsa,Life Changes Stressing Me Out. Advice?,"My wife is pregnant with our first child. That alone is super exciting and I am so ready to be a dad. We both don't really want to pay for daycare, nor do we really even want to put our kid into daycare. The problem with this is, our schedules overlap by a couple days so it's either daycare, or one of us quits (or finds another job). 

I was super supportive of my wife quitting her job until today when I sat down and budgeted all of our bills and compared the scenario of her quitting to me quitting. It makes no sense for her to quit, because my income doesn't cover our bills, much less bills and living, whereas hers does. She also is considering moving to a new employer in the same field and getting more hours. (Which she could do if I was at home all the time). Right now she works weekend nights, and I work weekday days. She works Saturday - Monday nights and has to sleep Tuesdays to catch up. I work Monday - Thursday days. As a 29 year old who has worked consistently since I was a sophomore in high school I am terrified of the thought of not contributing to the income. Plus we have never really hurt for money, and for two incomes, we always have lived within our means... but we will be somewhat tight on one income.

While working for my last employer, I went back to college and got an Associates of Computer Science, because I love working with computers. Shortly after graduation I got a new job as an IT Support Tech. This isn't what I wanted to do, I really wanted to be a software developer, but I figured it was a move in the right direction from industrial parts sales. I also quickly found out that getting a software development job took more than just an associates degree... in fact I feel like the degree was a big waste of time. Most job listings I find say 'x-x years experience in xxxx language"" and most of the time, at least a bachelors degree... for entry level positions. It became apparent that an associates degree alone wasn't enough. Plus I have read countless horror stories of applying to 50-60 positions and never getting an offer. Since then, I haven't really done much to progress my career. I have dabbled in some at-home projects for personal enjoyment working on a couple different small programs, just to challenge myself. All unfinished.

The company I work for currently is in the startup stages of a software company offering that would be only somewhat related to what we do now and, to the public, a completely separate entity. There have been hints and ""wink wink, nudge nudge"" gestures that it might be possible I could move into a position with that company more along the lines of what I wanted to do when I took the job I have now. They claim they want to be operational next year at some point. This is something I'd really like to entertain because it's advancement in my career and in the direction of software development. 

My question/request for advice here is this: Do I hold out and hope they offer me this position before my wife delivers? Do I start looking for a work from home tech support job and continue in the field I am settled in? Do I tell my current employer I need less hours and to work Wed-Fri? (We work a lighter crew on Fridays and most admin staff isn't there, so it's never been a priority to have me there on Fridays) Any suggestions for working freelance in tech support? I know some, if not all, of these questions I probably have to answer myself... but I have been super depressed all day at the thought of not being able to provide for my family.",Rav11s,2,1.0,4,1734318947,2024-12-16 03:15:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hf9vsa/life_changes_stressing_me_out_advice/,12,2024

I am about to graduate in June with a MSEE. I have two job offers on hand but I’m having a really hard time deciding which one to take. 

The first job is higher paying ($125k base with up to 20% profit sharing, sign on bonus, relocation bonus). It is a validation role for a chip company in the Bay Area.

The second job is slightly lower paying ($110k with no profit sharing, no sign bonus, no relocation bonus) but will be for a power electronics design role in defense in San Diego. 

Including the yearly bonus of 20%, I would be taking a 25% pay cut taking the design role. However, hardware design is significantly more interesting to me than python validation work.

I’m at a career low and trying to process where it all went wrong. I’ve always valued hard work and had a strong work ethic. I had a great education background, and for the first 6.5 years of my career, things were going well. But everything seemed to change after I moved countries post-COVID.

After relocating, I told myself I deserved to coast for a while to enjoy life. I landed a job in an industry I didn’t care about and figured I could just do the bare minimum while I adjusted. I wasn’t aligned with the work, I deliberately slacked off, and—unsurprisingly—it backfired. For the first time in my life, I was fired (the job was only 1.5 years, shorted out of my CV, but holds some substance when I'm looking for the next one).

Immediate focus is finding a new job. Thankfully, my CV is solid, and I’ve landed quite a few interviews. But I feel like I’m not as sharp in interviews as I used to be. One opportunity even progressed to the final round with a case study, but I lost out, which has shaken my confidence further.

I’m in my early 30s, and I’m struggling to balance the person I thought I was (driven and capable) with how I handled this last chapter.

Have any of you been through something similar? How did you regain your focus and rebuild confidence after setbacks like this? How do you maintain resilience while job hunting, especially when you’re feeling off your game?

Thanks for reading—I’m trying to remind myself that this doesn’t define me. Just looking for perspective and hope from others who’ve been there.",Bitter_Ingenuity928,3,1.0,5,1734310562,2024-12-16 00:56:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hf77qv/career_low_caring_less_and_fired_for_the_first/,12,2024
1hf5hex,Carpenter looking into engineering or other,"Been a Journeyman carpenter for a few years, the work itself is great the pay is solid but not amazing. Been self employed and with a company, both had their own drawbacks. 

It seems no matter where I go I’m expected to work 50-70 hours a week, the people you’re around are inherently toxic and not the kind of people you want to spend loads of time with. Their lives are usually in shambles which is why they’re in construction. 

People seem to respect you less than someone who makes half as much as you but doesn’t have glue and dirt on their jeans.

Im physically and mentally tired and want to go back to school so I can become a project manager or a structural engineer or something where I’m not breaking my body 60 hours a week and that I can have a clean dustless vehicle and wear nice clothes and have coworkers that aren’t alcoholics. I chose to be here because I liked it but now the only thing I like is the work everything else about the industry sucks.

Theres a 2 year course for civil engineering I’m looking into i understand I wouldn’t have a degree but it could get me into a PM position with my journeyman ticket. Or is going for the full 4 years worth it?

1hf5862,Career,"Hello. I work at Amazon and am 22.5 years old, and that's fine and all. It's flex time and I have good days and bad days there.

I've always wanted to enter politics or the military, but I can't serve because I am disabled, though perhaps I can work for the military. I honestly am not sure and I feel so lost and confused. Now that I graduated college and am working at Amazon, I'm in a limbo state as I am awaiting OPWDD services.

1hf54xb,Offer your POV on my circsumtance and quiet quitting approach.,"Background: I have been an analyst at a middle-sized bank for 3 years now. The executive let go of our department head and several others last year. We now have a person in charge known to have previously hated our department. I started to lose motivation once our original department head got fired because he wasn't the nicest person but was incredibly skilled and offered learning opportunities. 

Key Events: Our new department head created a new position for which three analysts, including me, applied. He gave it to the analyst with the lowest tenure at the bank with less quality work. That said, the person he hired has a similar personality, and I can understand why he chose him. It stings because higher-ups encouraged me to apply when I wasn't going to.

Issue(s) at Hand:  I'm not too fond of the new management, and my not getting the position has deepened my negative feelings. I am the highest-paid analyst on the team but still looking for more. I've been looking for other jobs but have yet to find a position I like. With serious concerns about the morality of upper management and recent disillusionment, I've started to entertain the idea of quiet quitting. I used to think I did not have the leverage to do it due to this current job market, but maybe I do, as I have the most accounts (60) out of all analysts. I am somewhat senior compared to the rest of the analyst team. How can I best do this? I want to put my best effort into my work, which rarely gets edits / reviewed, but I don't feel valued. Would it be dangerous to do the very bare minimum with my analyses? I've also started to decline social activities within the workday just because we have so much work, and again, I don't like my department anymore. I don't see the value in socializing for me or the company. 

TL;DR: I used to enjoy my job, but then they fired our department head, who I respected and always looked forward to working with due to his knowledge. They replaced our god with the devil, and I hate my job to the point it's hard to get up and drive there. I have savings for a year, but I live in a city with a high cost of living and prefer to coast while getting paid. How can I successfully quiet quit in this scenario?",Top_Tea_6986,0,0.5,1,1734304424,2024-12-15 23:13:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hf54xb/offer_your_pov_on_my_circsumtance_and_quiet/,12,2024

1hf46q4,What careers allow for a life in multiple locations?,"I have always had this rather vague idea of what I want my future life to look like. One of the things included is the idea of living in two or more places. For example, half a year in one place and then half a year in the other. Not vacationing somewhere, but actively living in multiple locations: owning property, having frends, etc. in each, and most importantly, a career which allows for that.

Why? Couple of reasons: I come from Europe where we have four season weather and I'm not very keen on rain, snow, and cold. Also, I get bored of my environment and always cherish a change. Lastly, I see it as a way to avoid being stuck in a bubble.

Now, I would love to hear about some ways people managed to get their careers, relationships, finances, etc. to support such a lifestyle. Of course, I am aware of digital nomads and remote work, but am wondering what traditional careers (primarily in business) allow for this.

For context: I come from modest background but am on my way of building a nice life for myself. I have a career in strategy consulting, degree from a top school, and currently live in NYC. Thus, I don't think anything is out of reach.

1hf1yvl,Should I get a MBA or become a cop,"Hello, these past days I been thinking of pursing policing or getting an mba. The problem with those carreers choices is that I have im scare of being a failure. I wanna become a cop cause I know I will be good at and I love helping people and I also love doing business. After high school, I toke 3 years off, became on of the top sales men and builded 3 business( they all failed ). I lost all my money there. 

I stopped being a sales men, I’m a men of honour and don’t want to lie or create fake promises to get a sale.


After 2 months of thinking, I still don’t know what to do. Cops get pay good here. The bad side of being a police, is that it will trap me into a box and I will only work in that field. I will have 0 creativity.But with a mba, I can pretty much work anywhere and be more creative. 

The bad part of getting a mba is that it is supper competitive and I’m pretty competitive, I’m not scared of getting crushed by them business people but I’m black and didn’t came from a wealthy family, it will take hard work to get in a great university. I love the creative side and the network that it will give me. 


I can become a cop in 3 years or get my mba in 6 years total. What should I do, I’m 21 years old. I don’t have time to waste and also I need to pick a field.

1hf1t6j,How to make career decisions early on in life? ,"I am in my early to mid 20, on the east coast. I currently work for a small 50 man contractor in a city about 45 minutes from me. 66k salary, 2 weeks vacation and company vehicle to and from work. I’m titled project coordinator/ estimator. 

I like the work, but some things make me not like it such as they being skeptical of my sick days/ time off, it’s a family business so there no upward growth since all the upper management is family, and from seeing other employees, they don’t give much raise. ( one 7 year long employee left and was getting 2.5% each year).

I also do side work, handyman / landscaping and pre tax make about the same as my day job. I really enjoy the work,  but also deep down might like it because I don’t have to do it/ it’s a break from my regular day to day. 

I am tempted to work for myself, but I’m a little worried that I will be 35 and be a handyman with not much more experience. And have few options. Not that it’s a bad job, just I feel I have more potential to be in other sectors. It’s more a solid money making side gig rn. 

I also feel right now I have value I. Working for someone and learning. I am leaning to sometimes more local, less commute, and sometimes I can have a broader perspective on, rather than just demo work, maybe for a home or commercial developer where I can see more trades at once.

I (15 F) need to choose what career I want somewhere next year. I know a general direction of what I want to study, or well, where I want to work. I want to work in a hospital and help people that way. But what I'm having trouble on deciding is what I want to do in said hospital.

Everyone around me thinks that I want to be a biology laborant/researcher, not necessarily about me working in a hospital. But for the last couple of months I've been thinking about wanting to be a doctor. I have watched plenty of video's about it's ups and downs and just how hard it is to get to be an actual doctor.

I like both studies, but to me what really matters is what I can do with them. I've also watched videos about being a bio-med laborant/researcher, whatever it's called, but the job just... doesn't speak to me. Yes, I like labs, but it just doesn't seem all that interesting to me. Everyone around me knows I love labs, this job would be exactly that, but it just doesn't seem like something I actually want to do.

I know that someone is going to comment ""Talk about it with your parents"", but my family isn't exactly big on communicating and all. I'm kinda scared to hear what they have to say. Someone in my class wants to be a doctor and I'm scared that she finds out that I maybe want to be a doctor as well, that she'll start judging me for it.

1hexoe7,CEOs hired my replacement without even telling my boss,"This is more of a vent but I’m truly at a loss on how to appropriately handle this situation. For added context, I’ve already had a feeling something has been off the past month and have actively been applying and interviewing for other roles. 

This past Friday, it was business as usual until suddenly I received email notifications that I was removed as an admin from a few tools. These were tools that we hardly used, but my intuition was telling me something was off. I called my boss (the CRO of the company) to see if this was something I should be concerned about or if this was a case of simply reducing our tech stack. My boss was a bit caught off guard and expressed that he had no idea what was going on. However, he assured me that he would call the CEO to figure everything out and then give me a call back. 

About 15 minutes later, my boss calls me back and states “(CEO’s Name) has decided to hire someone to take over SEO and PPC and they replaced you as users for those particular tools. Also, they decided to completely take over marketing, so consider today your final day of employment.” 

The company is a small software startup (roughly 50 employees) with 0 HR department. I was the only marketing hire tasked with not only laying the foundations of the overall messaging and positioning, but also demand and lead generation. 

My boss suggested that he may have some contract work in the interim for me as he has consistently been impressed with my work. That being said, I still expect a formal termination notice that outlines my final pay. A few hours go by, and I still haven’t received anything from the CEO. I also still have access to everything else I used on a daily basis. 

I called my mother who happens to be an employment attorney in a different state. She suggested that I send a formal email outlining the phone call I had with my boss and requesting the formal notice of termination. We both found it odd that a HUGE decision was made (hiring my replacement) without even having the common courtesy to alert the parties who would be affected. 

Anyway, I sent the email to my boss, the CEO, and BCC’d my mother. It’s been a few days now and still nothing. 

I’ve never had this happen in the 10 years of my career so any advice would be more than appreciated! I am still focused on landing my next opportunity and have a few late stage interviews this week; however, I can’t even apply for unemployment since the only record of my termination is a quick phone call.

1hexhbm,Might be in a toxic workplace. Is there anything I should do before giving in and throwing the towel?,"Last October I joined a Revenue position for a cruise line, and expected things to go quite well since I worked for a similar job before for another cruise line for two years.

Data-availability was a huge issue in my previous job, and I expected not to experience that issue in my new gig since the company I joined is a behemoth in the industry. Turns out that my last gig was similar as my current one in that I felt like I didn’t have resources necessary to come up with different strategies and make data-informed decisions.

Lo and behold, I’m working with a Business Intelligence team that is not at all flexible in providing data. It almost feels like they’re gate keeping information to stay relevant in my department. Because of that, I feel like a chicken without a head trying to constantly find data that can only be provided through the BI team. I’ve tried to escalate this to my manager and VP, and I get the sense that the BI team are doing a good job at stringing them along as well.

On top of that, I also depend on stakeholders that oversee operations which are crucial in driving revenue and unfortunately they keep things very close to the vest. They share very little, barely answer emails, and offer feedback only when it’s too late.

In one year, I’ve had two VP’s, my previous boss for 9-months left for another position within the company and now I’ve had a new boss for a couple of months. Turns out that my new boss recently advised me to be better at detecting faulty data, because he thinks I’m not good enough at doing that now, almost as if I’m the root cause of not having the data in a good place yet.

Bottom-line is that it’s getting to a point where it’s reflecting badly on me. I’d like to think of myself as a competent person, but I’m not sure that I’m in an environment that will allow me to channel that competence towards driving results.

1hewpss,"Stay at great company on bad team and wait for transfer, or go back to old company?","TL;DR: I worked hard to get a job at the best company in my area, but I'm stuck on one of the worst teams and can't seem to transfer for at least another year. Should I stick it out, or take a remote job at my old company? Which is best for my career?



I currently work at a well-respected, large corporation in my chosen industry. In the geographic area I live in, this company is the largest and most well-known in this industry. There are two medium-sized companies in the same industry nearby, and a few startups, but none of which are currently hiring for a role that I'd qualify for. I'm passionate about this industry and do not want to work outside of it. I am constrained to this geographic area for the foreseeable future both for family reasons and because my family just bought our first house. 

  
By several metrics, my current job is ideal for my current situation. Checks a ton of my boxes, well-paid, good benefits, stability, some level of prestige, and a company culture that encourages internal mobility and transfers. I worked pretty hard to build up my resume and get a job here, and that effort isn't lost on me. However, I ended up on perhaps the worst team in my office of several hundred people. We perform a somewhat niche function and the team consists of only my manager and a technician - I am the sole engineer. We exist within a larger department, but their work is markedly different from mine, and no one is cross-trained (we are all specialized toward one technology). I won't go into too much detail but there have been numerous complaints about my manager both from other departments and stakeholders as well as from me and my coworker, but nothing has changed in 2 years. Our team has the lowest metrics in terms of billable hours, work completed, etc. and these metrics seemed to drop the same year my boss was hired, yet the director above him has not made any changes. 

  
Being on this low-performing team has burned me out immensely. I'm very motivated by success and I've pitched several ideas to help improve our team, but things are moving too slowly and my boss doesn't seem to want to deviate from his strategy. He keeps telling me to be patient and he'll take care of it, but I have no confidence in him after watching him make numerous puzzling decisions over the past 2 years that have alienated customers and coworkers alike. 

  
I recently applied to transfer to basically my dream job in another department, but I lost out to another current employee who had twice as much experience as I do. I've got some connections in that department, and my biggest ally in management over there basically told me that he's going to have an opening at the end of September 2025 and would love to have me in his back pocket. I also have a strong connection in management in a different department who mentioned that I'd be ""their first call"" once a position opens on their team, but the timeline was indefinite. 

  
So the only options for transferring out of this team will not pan out until at least September. Meanwhile, I've been talking to one of my previous companies in my previous geographic area. I left on great terms and have good relationships there. The new manager of my old department said that my old coworkers still speak highly of me, and he may be hiring in 2025. He said he's got no problems with me working remote as he has 2 remote employees currently that are working out great. 

  
Here's my dilemma: I'm still pretty early in my career (early 30's). I feel I will have much greater chances of career advancement by working onsite at the large corporation that I currently work at. There's two managers in two different departments who are interested in me and seem to see a lot more potential in me than my current boss. If I stick it out, I feel like I could break out of my current situation while still maintaining the stability and benefits I currently enjoy. I may also progress up the ladder more quickly. However, neither of these potential transfers are a sure thing. If I go with the remote job at my old company, I could be stunting my career as I will have much less interaction with coworkers and managers at the company. I'd be doing remote-only tasks, which is only a portion of what my old role at that company entailed. It'd probably also be harder to get back into my current company down the road, but I'd be free from my current burnout and mental anguish caused by my current team.

  
Obviously none of these options are actually on the table at the present moment, so it may be futile to stress about any of this. But what do you think? Does it make more sense to tough it out in my current role and hope one of the transfers works out? Or should I jump ship if I get an offer to go remote at one of my previous companies?",Jolteon93,1,1.0,0,1734281584,2024-12-15 16:53:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hewpss/stay_at_great_company_on_bad_team_and_wait_for/,12,2024
1hewgib,What should I do? Is it better to stick with a terrible job or quit without having another one to step into?,"I HATE where I work, I'm miserable. I work with a small family run business for the last 4 years. There's 4 of us and the owner is the issue. First is that she's never there, she averages about 14-18hrs/ wk. That wouldn't be such a big deal if she would allow us to make management decisions, but she doesn't. Second: Our industry in boutique retail means we work Saturdays, but not her. Third: She uses the business as her personal piggy bank. 

We DON'T get lunch breaks, you have to ask permission. We DON'T get paid overtime, we DON'T get paid sick time, we DON'T get paid vacation. Hell, we barely get any time off at all that we don't have to beg for. Five out of my last six vacations that SHE APPROVED of weeks/ months ahead of time she vetoed between 2wks and 12 hours before they were supposed to start. I've lost so much $$ in deposits it's almost hilarious. She vetoed my birthday trip FOUR times. (1st was for 15 days in Moab a full 9 months ahead of time, it was vetoed 16days out. Then I scramble with my GF and the 2nd was for 4 days on a Virgin Cruise, that was approved.... then vetoed 72hrs before it started. 3rd was for 2 days before my birthday weekend at a cabin in a national forest.... vetoed 24hrs before it started. 4th was for 1x single day after my birthday to go kayaking with a group of friends..... that got vetoed 12hrs before.)

IF we get a lunch break it had BETTER be 58mins or less. Her's is regularly between 90-180mins. She'll lie to us and tell us to stay home when we're sick and give us paid time off, then she'll veto that on payday and claim she can't afford to pay us because we weren't there. I really only get to actually take vacation now when she orders us to. She'll actually order us to take an UNPAID week off when she tells us to, no more and no less, only on the dates she says. 

She loves to criticize us, about anything, loves to claim she's broke (she might be.... she lives wayyyyy outside of her means.) The list goes on. When we legitimately complain the answer is always ""You don't like it? There's the door, I hope it hits your ungrateful butt on the way out."" The list goes on.....

I would've left a long time ago, but our economy for my industry is not good at the moment. I've talked to all of my contacts, all of them would hire me, BUT they can't because they're not busy enough to afford me. (After 20yrs I'm pretty high up the food chain.) 

So is it better to leave and be unemployed for a while, or should I stick it out until I can just step into a new position?

1hetwst,Changing??,"Help - choosing my next steps

*first post so go easy on me*
Hi. So for a bit of context, I am a fully qualified social worker who specialises in the disability field (I am UK based). I fully qualified in my role for a year and I absolutely love(d) my job up until I became fully qualified (finished my ASYE). I love the children and my interactions with them, supporting them and seeing a difference I make in their lives. I completely understand the role and my job and my team are incredible. I know this is what I am supposed to be doing. However, there have been significant changes in my LA and due to staff absence, increase in caseloads, increase in work load… I’ve found I can’t cope. I’m becoming increasingly tense, stress, burnt out and overall unwell. Constantly sick and tired and I’m even under work therapy, as well as my own. I am also Neurodiverse and find this difficult to manage in a neurotypical environment. The paperwork is overwhelming and if that was taken away I’d reckon I’d actually stay. However, that isn’t going to happen. I feel like I’m working to live and I do silly hours (such as working weekends and up until midnight) to get work done but it keeps on coming. It’s impacting my friends and family life and I’ve never known myself to be so exhausted. 

Due to my lack of motivation and increased illness I’ve been searching for other roles where I can still have a similar pay, influence and service user communication. I’ve been thinking about primary school education (English, history and music) but will need to get my relevant qualifications. Can I get some help? Possibly from parents as I do not have any myself?

1hettq4,Is My CEO Being Too Strict on Interns or Is This Common?,"Hey everyone, I recently joined a startup as a Work From Home Python Dev intern, and I’m getting a bit concerned about how things are going. My stipend is ₹15,000 per month. However, the CEO is extremely strict, especially with interns.

Here’s the situation: He insists that we share our screens and keep our video on for the entire workday (from 10 AM to 6 PM). I’ve heard from other employees that the workday actually extends until 8-9 PM everyday, even though the official time is until 6 PM.

The issue came up when I was in the middle of my semester exams, and I asked for half days until I finished them. Instead of agreeing, he said I should work till 2 PM as usual, and after that, they’d assign me tasks to do offline without being in meetings.

What’s confusing is that the internship was supposed to start on December 20th and was advertised as an onsite internship, but I joined earlier because they said it was an urgent requirement. I had to go through 3 interview rounds and an assignment to get this position.

So, I’m wondering if this strictness is just the way things are at a company, or if it’s a red flag? Is this level of control and extra hours normal for everyone, or is it just me? Would love to hear your thoughts!

1hetbqr,Are these signs that fit a toxic work environment?,"I have researched a lot of Reddit post regarding this question, but these all describe general signs. I'm looking for validation that the specific signs I provided are toxic or aren't. This is regarding a small company size of less than 30 people.

* Purposely paying their employees under the market value (slightly higher than the minimum wage, but lower than the median and/or average in the same job and level).
* Social exclusion (Coworkers who organize outside of work social events and invites everyone except for 1 and 2).
* Workplace gossip (A coworker that has conflict/disagreement with another coworker and they gossip this to the rest of the company, turning them against them).
* Unnecessary complaining/nitpicking (Correcting mistakes like ""You mispelled the title reference"" or continuously complaining the the manager without trying to solve the situation in a one-on-one conversation, which results in more frequent meetings with the manager).
* Lack of self reflection (When coworkers or superiors have complaints, they're always right, even when you apologize. When the employee has something they dislike, they're always wrong).
* Not taking feelings of coworkers seriously (Often are told that it's in their heads and should seek professional help. Sometimes comes across as gaslighting).
* Expect them to perform well when they're demotivated (Self explanatory).
* Favouritism (Offering hired friends a higher salary than those with a higher degree and more experience or treating them better).
* Sugarcoating/downplaying the mistakes of their coworkers (A superior knows that one of their employees have to be corrected, but then sugarcoats the situation, acting like nothing has happend and everything is okay).
* Expect coworker to put in all the effort of social interaction with their coworkers, but barely does put in any effort themselves.

Fun facts are: there is no micromanaging or high work pressure. No yelling and cussing either. No unrealistic expectations. Some people can be/are nice though.

1hessxr,I (22m) am stuck at my current job and don’t know what to do.,"I (22m) am stuck in life and need help on where to go from here.

Hi everyone. Currently I work as an Residential HVAC helper for a small company and have been working there for 6 months. Prior to starting at this company, I went to trade school at a community college for 2 years and graduated this summer with an associate’s degree. I did pretty well in the program and felt like I had learned a lot of new material. I enjoyed what I was learning in those classes and actually felt as if I had made the right choice with HVAC. 

The first two to three months were pretty smooth, but since then I’ve been a little uneasy. I was mostly working with the Installation crew but I would also get placed with Service techs every now and then. The install jobs were a bit difficult as I had never experienced anything like this during trade school, but I was learning and getting a flow for how these jobs worked. Same thing with services as I would see how technicians would troubleshoot problems and handle interactions with customers. I would feel good doing service work, as the technicians I would ride with would often give me a chance to operate on equipment and explain what I would need to do and what I was doing wrong. 

Installs on the other hand have been a nightmare for me. I try to do things that I’m tasked with, but sometimes I rush and make silly mistakes. Then the people I’m working with poke fun at me sometimes and certain things said kind of get in my head. I also get frustrated at my own mistakes and then I keep replaying those same mistakes over and over again, even when I’m home. I can’t see what I’m doing before I go into work, so I go in assuming I’m doing install work. I wake up almost every day with stomach pains. I cry at least once a week in my car on the way and/or back from work. I come home almost every day during the week not wanting to talk to anybody. I’ve even cried on the job a couple times and it’s embarrassing. I’ve had really bad nerves for years, but with this job it’s ripped me apart. Even my coworkers notice and make comments like “he’s so nervous” and stuff like that.

If this adds any substance, I live in the one of the most expensive states in the US & I’ve been making minimum wage since I started at this company. When I first started, I needed time at this job to complete my associates so I wasn’t too upset at being paid minimum wage. I had no prior work experience in the field and I was finishing up my education. Since I graduated though, it’s been a little frustrating. I am definitely not saying I’m better than the people I work with. They have been in the industry for many years and the work they do every day is honestly impressive. But being that I had prior education in the field, I feel like I’m being finessed getting paid so low. I come in to work early every day. I treat everyone with respect & dignity even if I don’t always receive it back. I do the tasks which I’m assigned. I have a good work ethic and I always want to do the right thing. My boss has said that I learn very quickly and that he’s liked me being at the company so far.  But for some reason I can’t escape the feeling of anxiety & pressure.

The past 2-3 months I’ve been thinking about some options. I have a reinterview for an electrician union in May. But given my experience so far in the trades, I’m not sure if I want to continue trade work. There are other degrees I can pursue that take credits from my associates. I have a good amount of money saved and I enjoy cleaning, but starting a company would probably be unrealistic right now. 

I just feel like a failure. Before HVAC, I was doing CS and I couldn’t even make it more than two semesters. I woke up with chest pain one day and it took a hospital visit to tell my parents I couldn’t do that major anymore. I’m extremely fortunate that my parents still let me live at home and don’t charge me any rent. I don’t just want to quit this job/career and not have something else lined up. The last thing I want to do is let my parents and my grandmother down. If anybody has advice for me, I would greatly appreciate it.

Isa pang cons ko is wala akong makitang career growth for myself and even sa mga matatagal na sa company.

Honestly I'm so lost in life and noong nag aapply ako I planned to get a job related in psych to know if fitted ba ko sa field. But when I'm applying na I was presented with this JO as a CSR nga so pinilit ako ng parents ko to get the job para daw magkaron ako ng experience, which is totoo naman na get all the experience and learnings that you can get diba. 

But for 3 months that I've been in this job, umiiyak talaga ko every night and constantly thinking na mag resign, but I'm scared to take a leap kasi I feel so lost in what I want to do with my career.

Do I call out to make sure i dont get others sick or go in to learn what im supposed to and deal with??

It's just especially at my current job, they get upset for call outs and it's like why wouldnt i come for an orientation at that like im nervous, which granted i am nervous but i dont want to be getting everyone sick... what if they decide to just fire me without even starting for an actual day!!",No-Department720,2,1.0,2,1734266342,2024-12-15 12:39:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1herrel/more_of_a_stupid_ask/,12,2024

1heqyyw,Manager revealed the rating I gave to my colleague ,"In our 360 degree peer feedback, I rated a work colleague “average”. This person and I were on good terms but I felt like their work could have been better. I gave honest, constructive feedback on the review.

When our manager had the review with my colleague, looks like they revealed the rating I gave my peer. Now here is the fun part - my workplace doesn’t seem to have a rule around this. It says revealing the rating is at manager’s discretion but I think it shouldn’t be done. Feedback need not be anonymous but rating should be.

Now this colleague is hurt and thinks I did it from a place of moral high ground just to hurt their chances of promotion. They confronted me about it and I gave my reasons & offered to talk but have not heard back.

1heqin2,AWS System Development Engineer to Software Development Engineer,"I’m currently in the loop for a System Development Engineer (SysDev) role at AWS. Based on what I’ve found online and through Blind, it seems like this role is a mix of SDE work and DevOps/System Engineer tasks.

I’m more inclined toward the SDE path and was wondering if it would be a good idea to accept the SysDev role, gain experience, and later transition to an SDE role.

For context, I’m currently in a Software Engineer role but primarily focused on QA, including scripting and manual testing. Would switching to SysDev help me move closer to an SDE role? How challenging might it be to transition from SysDev to SDE, either internally within AWS or externally, after gaining a few years of experience?

1hen5nw,"30s, jobless, exp in claims etc lead me nowhere, do I need to go back to school or change careers?","Area: NWA, just moved earlier this year. Bachelor of Arts. Jobless. I help a family member with admin stuff for their therapy practice.

My experience the last 8 or so years is EHR data entry to Office Admin to Claims Specialist (from the healthcare provider's end); EHR, claims, coding and billing, HIPAA compliance, some light software and hardware troubleshooting, plus paperwork related to helping patients get on disability leave, stay on it, etc. Mostly remote.

Jobs relevant in my area appears to be oversaturated, overly competitive, low paying, and the opposite of lucrative. For these reasons I don't anticipate any kind of ROI in pursuing AAPC or AHIMA certs.

I even cast a wider net with customer service, admin support, data entry, sales and call center jobs. No jobs, no legitimate interviews, no nothing.

Unless I'm wrong? I really think I need to change course and find a better path.

I am open to go back to school, to switch career fields-- can I get some guidance maybe in some better-- or clearer, smarter steps to take? Idk if I'm being realistic enough.


Do a bootcamp? A cybersecurity bootcamp? I heard data analysis is oversaturated with folks like me. Do I pursue a Security+ cert from ComptiA or CSSP from Cisco? What is helpful for someone with a liberal arts degree getting employment and experience so that I gain the fiscal means to psy my bills and pursue more education, skills, experience?

I know IT helpdesk and call center are considered entry level, heard mixed opinions on SOC Analyst and most cybersecurity positions.

Still jobless. Somehow idfk how but I somehow get to saving up for Master's at WGU? I looked at MBA in IT Management and MS in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance.

Why IT or Cybersecurity you might ask. At a glance it doesn't -appear- oversaturated, it does seem competitive, but I have read about thousands of cases where someone later in life without a relevant degree or experience switches to these and finds success. No sitting around jobless up to their necks in debt. Is this a realistic expectation for me?

1helctx,Lost and Broken: Engineering Grad Struggling to Find Purpose,"M23, I've broken down in the past month. I did end up getting a job in higher Ed in administration mainly but potential of data automation because they want to streamline their admissions process. But the thing is, I graduated as a mechanical engineer recently (2024), so this job has 0 relevance, and I feel ashamed even discussing this job to friends and family because they keep asking ""but you're in engineering, why you doing this?"", and im sick and tired of it. I cant get an engineering jbo because i dont have any experience or skills, because i was focused on ecommerce during my time at uni, so i really just passed and got a degree, and dont rlly remember much of any software or knowledge, i know its my fault, but im still extremely depressed. I know i should be grateful that i got this job because im sure there are folks who are in a worse position than i am, but it's really broken me down that i've grdauted from a 5 yhear engineering degree, and ended up in addministration after 7 months of job hunting. And honestly, i dont know what to do at this point, i need to learn something or relearn CAD software if i want an engineering job, but that wont guarantee shit, and the other problem is i dont have the financial position to relocate which most engineering jobs you are expected to do so. During engineering, i ended up ding marketing internships because those were the only ones i got a offer for. So i have experience in marketing, with an engineering degree, now doing an administration job, so if anyone got advice for me... because i dont know what to do. Do i try to learn engineering related software or knowledge or certifications to land an engineering job (but i cant relocate, which is extremely limiting). or pursue marketing jobs (I don't mind persuing marketing but i know everyone looks down on me when i say I'm doing marketing when i graduated from engineering, i know i shouldn't care what others think but easier said than done). I don't mind trying to get into technical sales (since i have Eng degree + marketing background) in an engineering company but like no luck. I was even thinking of looking into software programming as a career (because i have to learn React and Python eventually why my job starts focusing on data automation once i figure out the administration process in depth to the point where I can start thinking of how to make it efficient and streamlined, at least that's what the job description and interview mentioned.). On top i was speaking with a girl for the last 4 months, and she decided to break it off for no apparent reason. So I'm in a heavily depressed place with no idea of what to do at this point. reading this myself, i sound like a depressed lunatic, but yea this was my rant. Appreciate any and all guidance, and before anyone mentions YES i know the position im in is all my fault and becuase of the decisions i've made in the past, i hold myself accountable, but im still depressed with no idea what to do at this point.

Hi everyone. If there a better sub to post this on let me know. 
I’m looking for advice for switching careers from a mechanic apprenticeship to something working with children/youth. I am 20f and I don’t think I will be able to go to university so my only options are college. I’m thinking of early childhood education, working in preschool, day care or kindergarten, but I’m not sure if those pay very well. Another thing interests me is working at mental hospital for children/teens (not a psychiatrist but maybe a teacher or a nurse? When I was in one when I was 13 there were just those people that stay at the desk and like monitor people but idk what that job title is called) or at a foster care place. Pretty much anything with kids that pays well here in Canada and preferably no university degrees.

If my boss allows me to move to days then shortly after this other job offers me the position on their unit. What do I do?

1hekcua,Company is going through big changes and I'm on the fence about starting a job search,"I started at my current company a little over 2.5 years ago as a Controller, and I was promoted to Director of Finance earlier this year. Our department was overstaffed before the old director left, and my old position wasn't replaced. I basically went from 2 hours of work on most days to going flat out for 8 hours straight, plus time working at home. I did get a bump in pay, but not nearly enough for the workload I have now IMO.

A few months ago we got a new CEO, and since then several high level employees have resigned, a few of whom won't be replaced. The new CEO seems obsessed with cost cutting and manages to work it into every conversation. The big push right now is to consolidate operations with one of our sister companies as a way to cut costs even more.

On the plus side, the new CEO and my new boss have expressed their appreciation of all the good work I've done, and I feel that I'm in a spot where I'd be harder to replace than most at the company. However, the pay is lower than similar positions in the market, and the requests I've made for additional pay have been denied.

If I hadn't been promoted earlier this year, I would've been job hunting already. But since I haven't even been in my current position for a year, I feel that it would raise a lot of red flags if I started applying at this point.

I'm pretty sure I'm about to be fired but I know I'm good at my job, but the way this place runs it was hard for me to adapt to and I'm not doing my best. I've been at my current company for 3 months. 

  
I want to find a new job before I get fired and I really loved how smooth my last job was. I wasn't tasked with more than my job, everyone knew what they were doing, and I was able to get in the groove immediately at my last job because the procedures were standardized. 

  
I want to call my boss and ask for it back soon but I'm not sure how to go about it. I left on good terms so as long as he has the work, I'm almost sure he'll take me back. 

  
I was thinking of sending a text during work hours about ""Hey X, when you have some time can you please give me a call"" 

  
One thing I want to add, this job is not what was advertised to me, I was told I'd be working on x and y, but I'm working on Z instead. This location has the capacity for X and Y, but one person does it for the entire region. I was also told there would be a bonus, but this location doesn't even qualify for a bonus because they don't get enough business (Bonus was in my offer letter). Also, the higher ups are always changing how things are done which tells me they have no idea what they're doing. No 2 people are on the same page about anything. Most days I'm stretching my work so it doesn't look like I'm doing nothing which is incredibly boring and unrewarding.

Background I've been working <4 years now as an Engineer (Mechanical, but really I do electrical, software, systems etc. essentially whatever the company needs). I travel the the US going from site to site for an unknown amount of time from 1week to +6mo. and I rarely get told a few days in advance when I will need to pack up and move again, usually to another hotel/airbnb. I'm literally living in a suitcase. I now ""thankfully"" work ~50hrs a week, down from 70-60hrs/week but still occasionally do 70+ when on a deadline (at least I have OT pay?), and with my ""days off"" not really on any set day or even time. This year I apparently made +$200,000 but I didn't even feel it because I don't have the time to spend it on stuff I like to do. When I first joined I felt like I learned and grew a lot as an Engineer but now I feel like I've been stagnant and am wasting my early career and my 20s.

I'm not an outgoing person so it usually takes sometimes before I start having friends and relationships outside of work where I'm currently living at. I grew up poor and so I still have a habit of penny pinching on everything and most of my hobbies are pretty much impossible to bring along while traveling (MTBs, Skiing, Gaming on PC).

Besides this one offer, I'm finding it hard to find a ""technical"" job that even comes close to what I'm getting paid given my experience.

1hegth5,Which career path to follow: current career path or going to medical school?,"Needs advice since I feel really lost.

Hey all. I’m 31M from EU. I’m finishing my business degree but I don’t think I can find one of my goals (to either work in a consulting firm such McKinsey or in a FAANG company).

I have no previous job experience

I’m considering doing medical school because I like a lot, earn a good money, is a job that offer prestigious but could take me 2 years to enter medical school, then 6 years medical school, then another year and then I can start residency to earn my first salary. I’m not rich I need to say.

My 2 options is either doing masters in my fields until I can break my dream roles or adjacents ones or start medical school that will take 2 years to get into medical school, 6 years med school, then at least 1 year in the best case to get into my dream Opth or ENT residency (both last 4 years).

I moved to Canada a few years ago because life back in my home country was rough. The society was toxic, and I had no goals or opportunities. To give you an idea of how bad things were, a Honda Civic there was as expensive as a Lamborghini feels here because of insane inflation.

I had to stay in high school longer because of immigration stuff, and now I’m almost done. I’m 20, but I feel completely lost. I don’t know what I want to do with my life or where I’m supposed to go from here. My grades are pretty average—I lost all motivation after basically being forced to repeat three extra years of high school. I just wanted to get it over with.

Right now, I work a minimum-wage job on weekends, and it’s draining. I hate it, and it’s making me feel like life isn’t even worth caring about. I’ve never done drugs or smoked, and I used to go to the gym, but now I don’t even have the energy for that anymore.

The only thing I’ve ever been passionate about is cars. I love working on them, driving them, everything about them. When I was younger, I dreamed of being an F1 driver, but coming from where I did, that was never realistic. Not everyone grows up in a place where they can start driving at 10, you know?

1hefgmh,Advice Needed - Career Ladder,"I am a seasoned, young 30s professional who has ample experience with managers telling me I could lead a team. 

Issue is I keep getting passed up, even though I have expressed my desire to get on that career path. 

I am routinely told it’s not me, but always seemingly someone with more experience comes in and gets the job. I have had assertive discussions about this with my manager and director and they always seem too busy to really notice they keep doing it. 

I am not losing the job to less qualified individuals, but it’s still frustrating. I am the type of employee who will go all out to help as many other people as possible and excel at completing my work. I receive high accolades and pay increases and bonuses on semi annual basis. Usually in the range of 8-12% each time. 

My question is: how many times did you have to discuss/assert your desire for more career trajectory before they finally allowed you to get to where you want to go? 

This is my third organization I have been with and it’s the same old story. 

I need an assist and advice from the community If you are willing to comment. 

To say the least, it gets beyond frustrating.

1heffyr,Can I get some advice ? ,"I WANT YOUR OPINION! 

I'm Romanian but moved to Italy when I was 8. Grew up there. Really liked it. 

Once I got my professional high school diploma I took off for London with friends, telling  myself I was seeking opportunities, when in reality I was running away from what I felt was an oppressive household. (Still thinking about that choice.)

Over the course of 9 years, I worked a wide array of jobs:  scaled up the restaurant business up to a GM role, moving from fast foods to a Michelin starred place,  then from a Thai chain to a Sushi  Kiosk. Left the field sick and tired of customers, employees, shit pay and the whole lot. All just before COVID started.  

Moved to Leicester with a chick. Broke up later. 

I tried other roles. I've done food production (night shifts),  in different warehouses (Royal Mail, DPD, Iceland). All hard labour. Hated it. I knew I could do more. I wanted to do more. 

I was mentally down: as a man alone in a foreign  country, with too much pride to rely on family and with so called friends and girlfriends too busy living their own life, to really be there. ALONE. Literally. Disconnected. Just getting by. 

Still managed to save up 10k to put down as a deposit for a home. Wanted to do an HMO, to rent out rooms. So I moved to Liverpool specifically for that purpose (one of the many changes in residency I did in the UK, 1 of 10 to be exact)  

Life threw a curve ball, of course. Met a hot crazy polish chick who used me as a rebound. Got played bad. 

I decided to go back to Romania to my family, hoping to reconnect, forgetting that people don't change. Never lived in RO before. I needed closure but I didn't find it. Moved on slowly.  

Got into University wanting to get better status, better job, more money.  

TODAY: I am studying to get a degree in Business Informatics, in Romania. The university is Mid.  I am in year 2, Sem 1. I don't like it much but whatever, I need it. 

I want to shift to online studying and move back to Italy where I feel I belong.  I am seeking financial stability so I can get my life in order and build something meaningful for myself. But I don't get no breaks from life and everything seems like a constant battle. 

What I want from you ? Answers ! 

Is moving to Italy a good idea, work potentially a shit job while completing my degree, or a job in the field low paid ? 

Should I quit uni in Romania now and start uni in some other developed countries ? ( See: Denmark, Norway, etc.) Low-key thinking of moving to one of those countries in the future anyways for a master and to get better work-life balance but unsure.

1hefbeq,Denied PTO ,"Hey everyone,

I’m reaching out because I’m feeling overwhelmed and not sure what to do next. I recently requested PTO for January 1-8th, which got denied despite having enough PTO saved up. I’m a hard worker and put in a lot of effort at my job, where I also earn commission. But lately, everything has been piling up, and even the simplest tasks are starting to feel like moving mountains.

In November, I worked all 30 days straight without a single “thank you” or even a “we see you.” I’m starting to feel burned out, physically and mentally, and I know I need a break to reset and remind myself I’m still human.

Since my PTO request was denied, I’m considering getting a doctor’s note for mental health leave. I enjoy my job and don’t want to risk losing it, but I also recognize that continuing like this isn’t sustainable.

My Questions for the Community:
	1.	Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you approach your employer when PTO was denied but burnout was affecting your performance?
	2.	Is getting a doctor’s note for mental health leave a reasonable step? How would that impact my job or future PTO requests?
	3.	How can I advocate for myself professionally without damaging my relationship with management?

1hedy0j,How to translate corporate language? ,"Hi everyone. I had a discussion with my CEO the other day (I am a middle weight technical member). We were talking about industries where our work can be applicable. And out of the blue, she said, ‘just don’t go and start a consultancy firm to rival us.’ I am confident that the unsaid part was ‘or I will have to sue you’. 
It was very random and out of context of the chat we were having.
To give some context, in my job here, I have received great feedback (in writing) from both clients and internal team. We have won many new projects. I have basically been told again and again in front of all our team that I am a star. However, my promotion request has just been denied despite achieving objectives, which were SMART. Putting these two things together, I am now worried that I am being seen as a threat and as a person who can create their own spin-off (it’s common in our industry - I don’t want to. In fact, I want to expand divisions in my current company, which I am now unsure about). When I tried to discuss next objectives, I was told very vague objectives (unmeasurable) and the timeline for review is nearly a year from now! 
I have already started chats with recruiters. 
But I didn’t think that the comment from the CEO was an anything but a joke. Now I am thinking it was not. Am I right? I often feel I have a classic case of impostor syndrome. I cannot believe they do not want to keep an employee who they believe can achieve his own consultancy. And yet they are taking the chance that I will not leave. I genuinely want to establish new things but under their umbrella. Can you help me disentangle this?

I have been in and out of college for over a decade. I'm completely lost.   


I was a hair dresser and paid for a lot of my college out of pocket for the first 7 years. I didn't enjoy being a hair dresser, because despite \*many\* of my clients saying ""this is the best hair cut I have ever had,"" they never tipped me or never tipped me accordingly. I became bitter that I spent a year and 15k on education to get licensing as a hair dresser, and was tipped \*significantly\* less than a server or waitress who spends the same 15-30 minutes with a table. And no, I do not want to be a server; I am MUCH too clumsy for that, nor is it something I want to be doing in my 30s and 40s. Maybe if I was still 21.  
  
I thought I wanted to study geology, but when I learned about a young lady who died from a bear attack on her first 3 months of work following graduation, I said, ""NOPE.""  
  
I thought I wanted to be an engineer. My brother is one; my dad was a drafter and encouraged us both to be an engineer (I was in advanced math since elementary school). But, I really disliked math in college; I was working 40 hours in addition to college, and there just wasn't enough time in the day for me to excel.   
  
I wanted to be a dietitian. I worked as a dietary aide at the hospital, and was pursuing the dietitan track in college, but learned that they increased the minimum education to a masters (masters is unrelated and purely is a way for the colleges to earn more money). The increased education does nothing for the profession itself; it does not increase the technical skills for the specialty, nor does it increase the salary of the dietitians. It's purely an agreement made with colleges so that college can earn more money from students.

I thought I wanted to be a nurse; I was a CNA and loved being at the bedside taking care of people, but I injured myself twice in 6 months. I didn't feel like I had the physical stamina for the work; I came home utterly exhausted (not to mention the injuries). People have told me that I also seem too sensitive to be a nurse (I am on the autism spectrum). I was rejected from 2 programs.

I applied competitively to a radiation therapy program, but I'd have to pay 60k out of pocket in 2 years for that program, which turned out to not be feasible for me.

My spouse encouraged me to study computer science. While I do enjoy it to some degree, I don't believe in myself that I can do it. I am not passionate about it; and it's something that someone has to really be passionate about in order to be successful in the modern saturated market.

My spouse is resentful of me that I haven't found a path. Yet, simultaneously, he's also resentful of me that if I was to go out and get a job, that it would only pay minimum wage. He has actively encouraged me to stay home and be a housewife so that I can dote on him. But frankly, this is not working out. I need a career, but I really need some guidance.

I have autism/adhd, so that kind of limits me on what I can reasonably accomplish. For instance, I do not believe I am smart enough for medical school. I am inherently disorganized and get overwhelmed easily.

1hea2bv, Seeking Advice on Career Restart After Business Challenges Is Migrating Worth It in Your Mid-30s?,"

Hi everyone,

I’m at a crossroads in life and need your thoughts. I’m a single professional in my mid-30s, based in India. After spending 8-10 years trying to build my business, it hasn’t panned out as I hoped. Unfortunately, I lack the funds to restart it, and competing in India’s highly competitive job market—especially against a younger crowd—feels increasingly difficult.

I’m now considering migrating to countries like the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, or Germany to rebuild my career and secure a financially and socially stable future. My goal is to create a strong foundation in a shorter time frame.

Given my situation:

1. Is migrating worth it at this stage in life?


2. What migration pathways (apart from study permits) would be realistic for someone in my position?



I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been through similar situations or has advice on how to transition effectively. Your insights could really help me make an informed decision!

Looking forward to your thoughts and experiences!

1he9ze2,Have kind of hit a dead end in my career. What can I do or learn to be more hirable in case I am laid off?,"I have a job that I'm content with. However, several upper management have left, people have been laid off, and it goes without saying at work that our plant is not doing well financially. So understandably, I'm a little worried about my job security, but I think my background and work experience will make it difficult to get a job if the plant closes.

All of my work experience is in warehousing and manufacturing. My educational background is a master's degree in imagination (industrial) engineering. However, I went to a small state school part time while working full time in manufacturing for financial reasons so I finished my degree at a later point than most other people in the program, (but no student debt!) However, I never landed a summer internship at a big company or anything.

When I was hired at my current job it was intended to be an entry engineering role with a focus on new product implementation and process improvement, but the industry didn't evolve as expected and I'll say bad decisions by the MBAs at the top has really stopped us from expanding our market. So while my job started as that, it has slowly come to a stop. What has happened is that everyone who's quit or been fired the past couple of years has had their busy work added to my responsibilities. So really I have my hands in most departments like engineering, quality, production, customer service, r&d, supply chain,etc. but it's just mostly work that a trained monkey could do and supporting people/processes in that department. Basically my role now is doing all the tedious stuff that other people don't want to do. The one process improvement project I was involved in wasn't impressive by any sort of engineering standards. So although my title does have engineer in it, I'm definitely not, which is why I posted on this sub and not the engineering one. I currently get paid too much for the work I'm doing, so I know if they start layoffs again I'll probably be gone.


I've applied to other engineering roles, not with an interest of leaving my current job, but to see if I stack up and have not been successful. There's actually a new factory opening in the next town over and they were looking for bodies and someone who I know that works there reached out to me to ask for a resume to pass along to the hiring manager because they were just looking for anyone with a somewhat engineering or scientific background to fill spots. Even he said I didn't have the skills they were looking for in any departments after seeing my resume.


My resume has all the technical things I do listed, but if you read it you wouldn't think the job title matched. I asked for a more accurate title change in my last review, but my manager said it would be unlikely because they would have to change my pay. So honestly I don't even know how to describe my job. My job description on our payroll portal is just ""supports staff."" 


What kind of training or certifications should I be going for in this situation or what kind of work should I look for? I'm in my early thirties so it's too late to start over in school. I doubt companies want to hire someone my age for an entry level role when they can pay a recent college grad much less. I don't want to be stuck in academia so I don't think continuing with a PhD is a good idea. I'd like to continue with 6sigma but nobody at our plant is a black belt that I can ask to sponsor that. I don't want to go back to working quality assurance for $14/hr when I make much more than that now. I have no mechanical or maintenance skills. I have no experience managing people. I don't have the social ability to work in sales. My resume isn't the problem, so please don't suggest changing it.


Sorry if this seems like a rant or whiny. Not my intention. Just trying to provide details.


TLDR: Future job security is not looking good. Was hired for an engineering related role, but has evolved into me doing the unrelated tedious work like paperwork at the plant nobody else wants to do. I have no niche skill set. Early 30s.

1he9jmi,Feeling isolated at work,"I (27F) recently started a new legal writing position at a law firm. For the most part, I've really been enjoying the role so far. The work is challenging but rewarding, and my boss and coworkers have been very welcoming to me. In spite of all that, though, I can't help feeling out of place in the office.

For context, my department skews significantly older than me (many of my coworkers are in their mid- to late 60s, and the youngest are probably in their late 50s). On one hand, I'm grateful to have the chance to learn from people who have so much experience and knowledge to impart to me. On the other hand, I can't shake the feeling that I don't belong there. Even if everyone is nice enough, I feel like I don't have anyone to really talk to or hang out with. I know I'm there to work, but as someone who's always struggled to make friends, I was hoping I would bond with someone at my new job. It also doesn't help that I hardly ever interact with anyone outside my department.

Before this job, I had a fully remote gig. It was nice at times, but it started to get very lonely after a while. I was hoping that would change once I started working in person, yet I'm somehow in the same position. 

Again, I love the work I do, but I can't help feeling a bit isolated while in the office.

1he95yy,Advice for young professional?,"So I attended a training for PSPO 1 last Weekend (Saturday and Sunday) and I am planning to give exam tomorrow i.e. Sunday

I have read that the PSPO Cert will not be enough for me to switch jobs so will look at some Data Analytics certs from Microsoft and learn some Python as well. I want to do so as my current project at my org treats me poorly and they do not let me switch for other internal jobs as well.

Am I thinking in right direction or just doing everything.

I want to go towards Product Owner or Product Manager roles( I know scrum doesn’t have it and more or less they both are same but market is filled with PM jobs and few PO jobs and companies treat both differently). This is also what I aspire and I personally feel I will do justice to my education by being in a role where I can make decisions or have some sort of ownership.

And yes for my background I have overall 3.5 years of work experience where 1 year is as QA and then I did MBA and joined another firm and working there as a “Consultant” (in name only) but they make me do support work. So I want to get out of this area and get better aligned to what I aspire for.

1he912p,Next steps a Masters.. but in what?,"I currently work for a large insurance company that offers tuition reimbursement up to $5,250 a year (not a lot, I know but it’s better than nothing). I have worked here for 6 years and would like to continue to move up in the company. I would like to take advantage of the reimbursement to pursue a masters. My question is, in what though?

Some details:

• I currently have a Bachelors in Business Administration. I don’t feel getting my MBA at this point is the best avenue based on my undergrad and the direction I want to go. 

• My current position is in claims, but I do a lot of side work and have been working towards a role in our digital transformation department as a Product Owner. I do have my CSPO. 

• I am not dead set that a PO role is the only role I would like. I know I would enjoy a project management position, as well as a role that we have in our benefits department that mirrors a project management position. 

• I would like to move up in this company as much as I can for right now, wherever that may be. I don’t want to have direct reports at this point though. 

With that info, what Masters degree do you think would be the best fit? I have some of my own ideas, but welcome all thoughts! 

Additionally, any school recommendations? I am going to take it slow to only use what I can be reimbursed for each year.

1he8tqh,Why do people avoid pursuing things they’re good at?,"I have came across many people being good at certain things and still not pursuing those that brings me to this statement by someone -
 ‘I would not want to monetise my creativity or turn it into work.’ 
I couldn’t understand why someone being good at something would decide to not pursue it until i found myself in a likewise situation.

I am 19 years old currently on an (unintended) gap year after my grade 12. Why’s it unintended? 

Long story short - As someone who wanted to do management since her early teen years but didn’t know what kind of management opted for commerce stream in high school. 

( A little background context )
I was quite good at arts and was creatively really sharp in childhood. Despite of not continuing my hobbies fully alongside academics, I didn’t let my creativity go in vain - I did make edits of kpop personalities, made posters, stickers, sketches out of interest and found myself being genuinely curious in not just kpop but its marketing aspect, more like how entertainment industries work, marketed, advertised and consumed. (pretty much behind the scenes work)

Life happened (more like academically) Not continuing my hobbies didn’t bother me until it did and left me uncertain, frustrated, anxious and what not. I didn’t want to pursue general BBA and considered going with specialisation in digital/marketing which of course many colleges don’t offer at undergraduate level. I knew exactly what my aspirations are after pursuing higher studies - to work in entertainment companies in marketing or project planning team but I didn’t seem to know the most basic part that is how (which course to go for) hence applied for multimedia and mass communication thinking i would gain cultural/media marketing knowledge along side editing. Un/fortunately I didn’t get in, no back up options either, a plenty of time was all i had since the academic session was starting - applied for journalism and digital media ( being bluntly honest in the interview, i mentioned my inclination towards behind the scenes work, content curation and maybe writing) and was not at all interested in front line reporting works which certainly didn’t align with what they were looking for in a candidate. Was still searching for courses that would align with what i wanted to do and without even realising, i am on gap year.

Thought of preparing for communication or graphic design and convinced myself to learn digital marketing and other aspects of media by myself by enrolling in courses. Now i am aligned and certain is what i wanted to say, but the fact that i am looking for something meaningful and not ‘just something to do’ makes me reconsider all  my plans and the most unsettling part is i really enjoyed creating arts, posters and now that it’s a compulsion i find myself pushing through to start and yet procrastinating. It feels a burden now to deliberately create content for the portfolio which makes me understand the title of this post. 


From practical approach, the course is of 4 years with relatively high fees which i barely can manage to afford. Giving my 4 years to something 
on a financially strained budget, it is questionable. 

Now i am overwhelmed with unanswered questions. How do i pick a career or path? Which course should i go for? I’d appreciate any insight, guidance or advice on this.

1he8bnd,How to Handle High Expectations During Probation? Should I Look for Another Job?,"Hi everyone, I need some advice on a tough situation at work.

I’m in the middle of my probation period at a small company, and my CEO recently gave me some feedback. He said that while the quality of my work is good, I need to work on efficiency, e.g. being faster, and that they were expecting more from me overall. He also mentioned I have two months left to show improvement.

The thing is, I feel like their expectations are very high for the size of the company. They’ve given me some very challenging tasks that feel more suited for larger, better-resourced organizations. Recently, they also changed the work-from-home policy. When I I was asked by the CEO how I feel about it, I said what will change? Iwork more efficiently from home, he said, “You didn’t prove that to us,” which was discouraging.

I’m trying to improve, but the workload and pace they expect feel overwhelming. I also can’t shake the feeling that their expectations might be unrealistic for the role.

Should I stick it out and try to meet their expectations, or is it better to start looking for another job now? Has anyone been in a similar situation, and how did you handle it?

Job: Software development 

Any advice would be appreciated—thanks in advance!

1he6upk,What should I say if I want to negotiate outside the salary range after getting an offer?,"I'm in a situation where I had reason to believe my company would be doing a round of layoffs this year (they did) and that there was a small but real possibility that my team would be hit. Thankfully my team was untouched, but while I had this on my mind I was approached by another company about a possible role on the horizon, and the middle/upper end of the salary range they described was comparable to what I'm making now so I applied.  
  
It took a number of months for the hiring process to begin but I've done a technical screener, and a series of interviews. I'm not the kind of person who usually gets overly cocky about these sorts of things but the skillset for the job is kind of niche, it's something I excel at and have a lot of experience in, and I've been getting a lot of feedback from the interviewers along the lines of ""wow, no one else we interviewed so far had an answer for that"" etc. So I think I've got good reason to believe that I not only should be expecting an offer but that I'm probably the top name on their board. 

Outside of an absolute mountain of other considerations (career path, family, etc) that have me wondering if I should actually make the move there are two points I'm curious about that I'd love this group's help with:

1. If I'm going to actually leave my current job where I've been for a long time now I'd like it to be for more money. I've seen some people say that 10% is their threshold for considering leaving. I don't have a number in mind but I'd like it to be better than a lateral move. Plus my current job saves me a lot of money on child care, and I'd have to make up for that. I did get a moderate annual raise in the meantime as well.
2. If I'm their top pick, and I'm pretty sure I am, I think that's worth leveraging as a negotiating move. They're probably definitely going to rethink sharing that kind of feedback with applicants in the future, but that's their problem for another day.

With all that being said (and thank you if you're still reading) what should I say to try and negotiate a higher offer and deal with the inevitable question of ""wait, I thought you said you were okay with the salary range?""",BURNEDandDIED,1,0.6700000166893005,12,1734194665,2024-12-14 16:44:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1he6upk/what_should_i_say_if_i_want_to_negotiate_outside/,12,2024

1he5z8o,Career Dilemma: New Job Offer vs. Current Role,"A few weeks ago, my boss mentioned that he thought I’d be an ideal fit for an open position. He told me he felt torn about sharing the opportunity with me because he values my current role but also wants to see me grow professionally and earn a higher salary. After reviewing the job description, I realized that I meet over 80% of the qualifications, and the new role offers a $20k pay increase.

I interviewed and received an offer for the job yesterday. However, I’m feeling conflicted because I really enjoy my current job. I’ve often joked that I’m motivated by money and will go where the pay is, and this new role offers both a higher position and better compensation.

The issue is, my current boss is amazing, and I genuinely love my role. Even if he were to offer me a raise, it wouldn’t come close to matching the $20k increase. On the other hand, the new team’s manager is a micro-manager, and I just can’t deal with that. I’ve had a traumatic experience in the past working for someone who was overly controlling. This manager was verbally abusive, required approval for every email I sent, and needed to micromanage every detail. As a result, I struggled to succeed. When I moved to my current role, my boss was the opposite—he trusted me, gave me room to grow, and because of that trust, I’ve been able to thrive. I have almost complete ownership of my role, and if I need help, he does everything in his power to get me the right resources, then steps back and lets me do my job. I’m extremely grateful for this type of management, and it’s allowed me to achieve remarkable success in less than a year, including earning trophies for automated tools I’ve implemented.

Family and friends have told me that if the new role doesn’t work out, I could always move elsewhere in a year. But why would I move to a position with a manager who might stifle my growth and success? My husband suggested that I stay with my current boss for another year and wait for a better opportunity to open up with a more supportive manager. He pointed out that I’d still be able to maintain the high quality of work I’m proud of, without sacrificing the positive environment I’m in now. I’ve also spoken with my father, who is very analytical in his decision-making, and I value his perspective. He advised me not to let difficult people hinder my growth. He suggested that I learn to manage people like the micro-manager in the new role, explaining that this person might only be micromanaging because they’ve had to deal with employees who needed more control. This has added another layer to my decision, and I’m torn on whether I should push through and learn to work with this manager or stay in my current role.

I’m feeling conflicted. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",save-the-animals_,1,0.9900000095367432,4,1734192194,2024-12-14 16:03:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1he5z8o/career_dilemma_new_job_offer_vs_current_role/,12,2024
1he5ur8,Male 30s question,"
Hi everyone,

I’ve been accepted into a private radiologic technology program at John Patrick University starting in January, which costs $40,000. This program promises better facilities and job placement assistance, but the high cost is concerning given the financial burden.

I also have the option to attend LaGuardia Community College where the program is much more affordable ($7,000-$10,000 in-state tuition). My current GPA is 2.809. To raise it to 3.22 for better competitiveness, I need to get A’s in:

Anatomy & Physiology I (SCB 203)

College Algebra (MAT 115)

English Comp II (ENG 102)


Would it be worth investing in the private school now, given potentially better job prospects, or should I go with the community college route and aim for A’s in these critical courses? Any advice is appreciated!

1he3dh8,Applying to jobs that require references - any workaround to skip the references until final rounds?,"TLDR: I don’t want to submit references until later in the interview process because (1) I don’t want my current company knowing I’m job hunting and (2) I feel weird listing the contact info of my other references on 100s of job applications (they’re willing to be references but that just seems like putting their info out there unnecessarily). 


I’m finding that nearly every job I apply to is through a company’s ATS and requires a list of references, a cover letter, resume as required fields to submit the application. Last time I was job searching (about 4 years ago) I felt like I wasn’t asked for any references at the time of application. 

I’m perfectly fine providing references, just not this early in the process. I especially don’t want my current company contacted as I fully believe they would let me go if they found out I was searching for another position. 

So far I’ve just been listing my own information in the required fields if it requires an email/phone number or writing available upon request when that’s possible. I definitely don’t think this is the best course of action though lol - any advice?  

My friend had a situation recently where the application required a supervisors name, so they listed it because it was a required field, but selected that the employer could not be contacted. Well, the supervisor was contacted before they even contacted the applicant. My friend only found out because their supervisor told them. So I don’t trust the whole clicking the box to prevent HR from contacting former employers thing. 

Thanks for reading this word wall! Really just looking to see if anyone has found a good workaround that doesn’t come off as passive aggressive.

Am I crazy for sticking around and thinking that I will get promoted? Everyone I have spoken to (hiring managers/recruiters for the jobs I am applying to) always tell me to speak with my manager.

1he0pa4,Is this retaliation?,"I have been in my dept 2.5 yrs with over 20 yrs in the workforce, and considered a subject matter expert. All my previous reviews have been l favorable. I’ve had a new supervisor this past year. He is extremely pushy, micromanages, and is condescending. In 11 months he has not really learned any of the processes, makes me hop on a call to explain things and help him almost everyday, sometimes multiple a day, everything is urgent w/ him. I found him difficult to work with right away, ~8 weeks in, I went to my skip manager with concerns. She didn’t address it. Another employee has voiced concern about how his treatment of me because she was so uncomfortable during a meeting. A few weeks later, I met with a higher manager, they listened, said they’d address it. I could tell that they spoke to him, things seemed like they were improving, he was still very pushy but would give compliments. I began to let my guard down a little, and tried to see him as an on my side like he claimed to be. My bad. My mid year review was lowered to average.

Then duties were reorganized. I voiced concerns that I had a removal of duties and the position did not provide opportunities to grow nor did it align with my development plan. I was told to wait it out, that my position would somehow become more important at the end of 2025. At a team meeting, the higher manager presented newly guidance that basically implied anytime you have a difference of opinion, it’s “pushback”. Many team members were concerned.

I try to avoid 1x1s because his treatment can be upsetting because I feel my position has been lowered and I’m punished for no good reason. He consistently tells me I do great work but the meetings can spiral because but his lack of knowledge on processes makes him demand impossible or nearly impossible deadlines. When I speak up, he doesn’t want to hear it or acts like I’m making stuff up. I’m being honest realistic. I often get defeated and just agree to the dates. Not meeting the ridiculous deadlines is then met with negativity. I have worked many extra hours, even during PTO to try and keep up with his demands. He often presents tasks with breadcrumbs of information so I can’t complete them correctly until he wants me to. Other times he just doesn’t understand the task so he can’t relay it to me, and becomes defensive when I ask questions he can’t answer.

A frequent issue is when I state i don’t want to agree to a deadline I know I can’t meet to end up in trouble for missing it. I’ve been reprimanded for the the following phrases when he’s pushed me to my breaking point, “I’m doing the best I can”, “I can only do what I can do, there is only so much time in a day” or “okay, it is what is then”.  I am his only direct, 2 others who started to report to him after me, requested a move because he is difficult. Multiple people on the team have complained about his behavior.

In my annual review, he stated that my work was of the highest quality but he is lowering my rating again to the 2nd lowest because i sometimes go off on tangents (me expressing any concerns) and that prevents me from making valuable contributions and being a team player. I have great relationships with coworkers, am always helping others, and troubleshooting. I told him that did not agree with his assessment and the issues stated were in one area of 5 and my whole rating shouldn’t be lowered because I excelling or exceeding in all others. I asked him to meet again to further so he could further elaborate and I could better understand. He ofc didn’t schedule anything.

Sorry for the book. Can any of this be considered retaliation?",Accomplished_Range21,6,1.0,5,1734174302,2024-12-14 11:05:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1he0pa4/is_this_retaliation/,12,2024
1he0407,Time to quit? ,"I’m a 60 year-old white male who has been working in logistics for close to 30 years. I spent 18 years as a government contractor and was laid off multiple times so I’ve got short-term jobs and gaps and employment.
         I’ve been with my current company since June and really enjoyed working there when I first started. But about three weeks of me starting my father, who lived out of state, fell and was in intensive care for several weeks. I had to take off and drive down to try to get a power of attorney and get a handle on his finances. So I missed four days without pay to get that taken care of. Then I took a planned week off a month and a half later to go down and spend time with him. That also was leave without pay. 
         When I came back, one of my friends was telling me that one of the managers, and East Indian, was just trash, talking the hell out of me. And word got around to the manufacturing floor with this clown was saying.
      The president/CEO is East Indian, every single manager that I have to interact with is East Indian except for too. They hire their uncles and grandfathers that basically get paid to sit around and do nothing all day.
        I won’t go into details, but let’s just say that I perform 98% of the work in my shop. We had another gentleman that’s older who they let go yesterday for missing a lot of work. So I’m pretty sure my neck is on the chopping block next.
         Now, when my father‘s estate is settled, I’m looking to inherit a nice chunk of money. Enough that I could stop work for quite a long time seven or eight years and still be able to afford to pay all my bills.
       The past two months have just gotten so toxic I can’t stand even going in there anymore. There’s one particular East End manager that just goes out of his way to write me out for every little mistake that’s made. I had a meeting with my manager, and I literally came out and told him Unless you physically show me where I made a mistake. There’s nothing I can do to take corrective action. I told him I felt I was being retaliated against and I’m getting fed up with it.
            Next week I’m supposed to be getting the first direct deposit from a nice sized annuity. My father had. I really been tempted just to flat out quit not give any notice, I’ve already got a letter typed up, I’m just gonna go hand it to HR and walk out. I’ve not had a decent vacation in 20 years so I was going to get our bills paid off, get myself a new vehicle and then go travel and visit some old friends from the military.
          I have zero desire to ever return back to this type of industry, so I’m not worrying about nuking my bridge by giving no notice. They’ve been firing a lot of people since I’ve started in every single person they fired was white and over the age of 40. So I’m starting to see a pattern that doesn’t instill confidence in me.
           What I plan to do is just find something where I can be working at a desk and not going to physical work I do every day that just beating my body down every single day.

1hdzrew,What should I do about a rude coworker?," Hello everyone. I would very much like advice. 

A coworker is the son of my direct superior and of the compagny's boss. We are at the same level but do different jobs. 

Monday afternoon he sent me a file to look at with no deadline. I responded the next morning. No answer since then. 

Come Friday morning my superior come in my office to finish said file quickly with the hope it will be signed with the client the very same day. (Our compagny close at 12am on Friday though, but my superior and coworker can work all day sometimes...). 

I still do my best on the phone with said coworker (my superior had already  left) but he still had not read my email nor the contract and couldn't even answer my first question ""do we agree with the amount on the contract since per the contract we won't be able to request anything more""?. He said no but that I should still send over the two other modifications to the client and that ""If necessary we will ask at the last minute to change the amounts"". It already happened once and the very same client had sent us a very incendiary email saying to not request this kind of changes last minute.

I say no to my cowoker and ask if he can confirm the amounts as soon as possible and that I let him take over if necessary (since he might work Friday afternoon contrary to me). I do it via email also. 

He answer by mail in an unbelievably rude manner accusing me of hanging the phone on him, of not doing my job properly, that he won't do it for me and that my modifications request are useless anyway (no, they are not and include clarifying the possible penalties among other things). 

I sent back a professionnal email with a complete project answer with putting the Direction on CC, finishing with ""I am currently waiting for XX to confirm the amounts"".

What should I do now? It's not the first time the Direction is aware of his behavior but they won't do anything for obvious reasons.",Lamune44,1,0.6700000166893005,8,1734170079,2024-12-14 09:54:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hdzrew/what_should_i_do_about_a_rude_coworker/,12,2024

1hdxzwi,my job feels all consuming and i’m stuck,"context/background: i’m 25, been with my current company for 3 years, and this is my first full time role in this field. the culture is fast paced, highly competitive, and at times normalizes overworking yourself in the name of “being truly dedicated”

over the past three years, i’ve struggled with prioritizing myself, my mental health, and personal life. genuinely some days it feels like this job IS my life, and everything else is secondary. i’ve also excelled in my role for the most part. i’ve been promoted, done pretty incredible work, retained clients, attracted new ones and have had glowing annual reviews from all team members, including higher ups. 

that said, i’ve also struggled with workload. i manage a lot, wear a ton of different hats, and am the go-to person for high stress projects because of my abilities. i’ve felt underwater in the past, things got better for a bit, and then they always went back to hectic. i don’t have a problem with hard work, and i never have. i don’t mind pulling extra hours for special projects. i don’t mind being busy. 

however, i do mind when my physical health deteriorates because of my constantly high stress levels. i do mind when i have panic attacks weekly and am unable to stop ruminating in my personal time about projects/deadlines/meetings. i do mind when i ask for help and i’m brushed off or blamed for the heaviness of my workload (“well if you asked sooner”, “well if you managed your time better”, etc) 

again, i need to reiterate: i’m not perfect, i’m new in my career, and i can accept constructive feedback when provided it. at the same time, this job feels all consuming and i’m tired of the toxic behaviors i have to put up with just to be underpaid and undervalued, despite the tangible value i bring to my role and the company. 

i feel stuck. i’m desperately seeking new opportunities, and i’ve had some successful interviews and i’ve had some rejections based on my experience level. the plan is to exit, but until then i’m just not sure how to cope anymore. 

everyone always says, “we’re in [field], no one is going to die. you don’t need to take this so seriously.” but this is my livelihood, i support myself 100% financially, and just like anyone else i have dreams and goals that i can’t reach if i’m unemployed because i “just let it all go.” 

it feels like i’ve reached a boiling point and now there’s this tension i can’t place and that i have little control over. until i find new work, i’m just not sure what i can do. any thoughts and/or advice would be greatly appreciated. i’m feeling lost and a bit like a failure.

1hdxlmu,Why won't my manager train me for BOH? Am I just useless?,"I work for a nonprofit organization in a cafe that does cafe and catering. we're part of the food services branch, so we take on all youth in the organization that need career training and experience. I joined about 3 yrs ago as a participant (youth). I quickly climbed the ranks from a participant to a FOH staff member, then from a  FOH staff member to a trainer. Then from trainer to FOH supervisor/senior trainer. But nowhere in there was I ever taught how to work BOH. 

I've been practically begging my manager for months to train me for back of house because I want to work in a restaurant one day as a line cook.

He always complains about having to do BOH work because his BOH employees won't do it when they're supposed to... And I always offer to stay extra hours if he wants help, but he always declines even if its only him there and there's extra work to do even if it's the simplest of things (ex. Put together a charcuterie board, package catering orders, etc)

But he will complain directly to me. Is this his way of saying I'll never move up? Or is he just venting? Should I just quit and move on to what I want to do?

1hdx9po,I might have offered up too much ,"I work for a healthcare organization in IT, as an analyst. Vague, I know. We (in the last 2 years) have merged 3 organizations. My team has 3 people, Team X has 7 people, and Team Y has 1 person. The Team Y person has just given their 2 weeks notice. Our manager sent out an email letting us know they were leaving and asking for a volunteer to cross train on team Y duties over the next 2 weeks and become the new team Y lead (we don't have official ""lead"" titles or pay in our dept). They also asked for someone to take their place on this big 2 year project. I talked about it briefly with husband who said I should go for it if I want. We had just had a conversation the other day that I felt I wasn't going to move up in the company if I stay with my current job and nothing changes. I have an MBA and would like to work my way up to a director or AVP position before I retire.
So I sent a message to manager asking if she was expecting someone from Team X to volunteer (since they are from a bigger team and have more bandwidth). She said she had not expectations of that and that if I was interested that would be great. I offered myself up to become the new Team Y Lead, but said I wasn't willing to take on the big 2 year project.
When telling the person leaving I'd be taking over their duties they said they hope I negotiated a good deal. Then, at a preplanned out with friends, one that I work with (not the same dept though) and others in the same industry, they said I needed to ask for a raise if I was taking on more responsibility. 
I feel like I've messed this up. I kinda assumed my current daily tasked would be moved to others on the team and I would just be handling Team Y work. And I never thought it was an option to ask for a raise for offering to help. I'm not sure I know how to. I feel really dumb about that. I (37f) have never negotiated salary or asked for a raise and I DO think it's hurt me in the long run. We are all underpaid in my part of the team. 
We do have a salary alignment coming up in addition to a merit increase. Part of me is afraid of I ask for a raise it might screw that up. Also how do I ask for a raise after I've already offered my help.
My original thought process was it would just look good to help and show I'm willing to do more to help the team. And that would help me in future performance reviews and advancement opportunities. But now I'm afraid I've offered to much of myself for little to no return. And I'm not sure if there's a what to backtrack a little and still ask for an increase or not.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",Aeemackay,1,1.0,2,1734159355,2024-12-14 06:55:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hdx9po/i_might_have_offered_up_too_much/,12,2024

1hdwspo,Senior in highschool (F) that lost herself trying to find a career path,"I am currently a senior in high school who will graduate in 5 months, and I have lost myself in trying to find out what I want to do after high school. My high school offers endorsement career classes that require credits for students to help them with their pathways. My mom and sister are CNAs, so immediately, in my first year, I got into the healthcare pathway endorsement classes because their stories intrigued me, and I knew I wanted to work in the healthcare field. Around my late sophomore and junior years, I realized I wanted to be a nurse. My healthcare class allowed us to get certified in phlebotomy in my junior year, and it excited me because it sparked my nurse dream even more. My senior year came around, and they gave me another opportunity to get a PCT certification. I have been training for PCT for about four months, and I wouldn’t say it’s hard. I’m the type to understand things pretty quickly, but throughout training and learning, I felt that this is almost like what the nurses do, and it gives me more maid vibes than helping. At the moment, I am now thinking if this is the basics that nurses know, and I feel like a dog working. Imagine how nursing would feel for me. I told my mom and sister about this, and they said, “Nursing isn’t as rewarding as you think.” This completely altered my passion for nursing. I know I want to be in the healthcare field but I don’t know what to go to school anymore. Because of this I cannot even apply to college because how am I gonna apply without a dream?
Can someone give me advice or good healthcare professions?

This opportunity came suddenly within the past two weeks, and while I’m extremely grateful, I have a lot of thoughts I guess? And I’m not sure if these are reasonable thoughts or not

1. How do I maintain a work/life balance, especially with a 12-8pm shift (tried to ask for 10-6pm but boss said it won’t be possible now, but could change in the future). I have hobbies outside of work as well, but this boss said that this job should be my main priority (which obviously it is) but it’s not just a job it’s a “career”. I am a little bummed I had times this year I planned to use PTO (thinking I’d still be in my old job) but obviously now that changed.

2. How do I do a good enough job where I don’t stress/burn out and work myself to death? Obviously I care about the job, but I definitely don’t want to stress over it. Obviously it’s working with youth, so the kid’s wellness and safety are my #1 priority, but also making sure they’re having fun and learning. How do I balance doing that while also not “working too hard”?

3. When will I start feeling comfortable? I keep thinking about how I have to be on my A game especially when starting. I feel like I’m definitely gonna constantly be stressing about if I’m doing enough or if I could get fired tomorrow.

1hdtz3k,How to land a corporate job as a BBA LLB student with 1.5 years remaining. ,"
Hello everyone,

I'm a BBA LLB student in my 7th semester (4th year) from Law College Dehradun, Uttaranchal University. I have three semesters left before I graduate in 2026.

I have no interest in pursuing judiciary or litigation, and I want to land a corporate lawyer job. However, I feel completely unprepared for it and need guidance on how to make the most of the 1.5 years I have left.

Here’s where I currently stand:

Participated in 2 moot court competitions.

Completed 2 litigation internships in Delhi-based law firms.

No knowledge of drafting or pleading.

Haven’t published any articles or research papers.


Goals:

1. Secure a decent corporate law job after graduation.


2. Start earning as soon as possible to support my dad.


3. Avoid taking too much time off (not planning on pursuing LLM).


I’ve considered pursuing the Company Secretary (CS) course, but the exam dates always clash with my semester exams. Plus, the mandatory 12 or 21-month articleship seems like a long delay in starting a career.

Questions:

1. What skills do I need to develop to secure a corporate law job?


2. Are there any short-term courses or certifications that can boost my resume?


3. How can I gain practical knowledge in corporate law (like drafting contracts, understanding mergers, acquisitions, etc.) while still in college?


4. Are there any specific internships I should aim for to improve my chances?


5. Should I publish research papers/articles to improve my profile?


Any advice on how to utilize these 1.5 years effectively and land a job in corporate law would mean a lot to me. Thanks in advance for your help!

TL;DR: I’m a 4th-year BBA LLB student with minimal skills and experience. I want to secure a corporate law job after graduation but feel lost on what to do. Need advice on skills, internships, and courses to improve my chances.

1hdstw3,Master’s Degree in Business Administration or Accounting in Europe,"I am preparing to apply to the Faculty of Business Administration and Economics at the University of São Paulo (FEA USP) in the coming years, but my biggest dream has always been to immigrate to Europe. Since I won’t have the financial means to complete my undergraduate studies there, my plan is to graduate from USP and then pursue a master’s degree abroad, preferably in Italy, France, or Germany, and afterward look for a job in the field.

I’ve already spent a year studying in Italy, and at least at the university where I studied, Business Management and Economics were the most sought-after courses. Because of that, I know the competition will be tough. I’d like to ask those of you living in Europe, and perhaps even working in the field: is it very difficult to secure a job after completing a master’s degree in Europe? Or should I just give up on this dream?

1hds4tz,Will I be blacklisted from my hospital system for going to HR about an abusive manager?,"I have been working at a new unit for about two months, and my boss has made it a living hell. During orientation my preceptors said I needed to improve on some things. So even though I have passed orientation and everything on my skills checklist - he continues to call me a low performing employee. I went to HR because he wouldn't let me go part time solely because he doesn't trust me to maintain my skills. And said that only very proficient CNAs can go part time. I asked him what sort of skills he wants from me and how to measure and achieve them - he jsut kept dodging the question. No other coworkers have any issues with me and I get great patient reviews.

Having a boss who verbally abuses me and then reprimands me for not being confident enough at my duties has been driving me literally insane - I have needed to adjust my medication and go to emergency therapy. So as a last-ditch effort, I went to HR and explained that I want to do an early transfer of units. But unfortunately, instead of my boss just signing off on a transfer, he is forcing me to have a mediated discussion with an HR representative present.

I hate my life, my manager has made this job a nightmare. I hate him with every fibre of my being and I desperately want him out of my life. But this is the TOP hospital system in my state. It took me weeks of interveies to get in. I don't want to destroy my standing with them just because my boss decided that he dislikes me.

1hdruak,Failure in my job search,"Good evening, everyone. I hope this is within the rules of this subreddit. 

My husband just got offered a promotion and it would require us to move to the other major city in my state (OKC) which is about 2 hours away. My company has several locations but there are no openings right now. I’ve applied for 70+ jobs on indeed as well as other sites and also directly through their own career sites. I’m a store manager for a bigger c store chain that has a kitchen. I only have about 3 years of experience, but in those 3 years I’ve been a top performer and a stellar employee (top 10% in my company). I’ve been rejected by 20+ employers that are a similar role. Even roles that pay less than what I’m making now or that are a step down from what I’m doing now. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? My husband may have to decline the promotion if I can’t find a job, as the bump up in pay will not make up for the money I’d be losing from taking a huge pay cut.  My husband driving back and forth for the time being isn’t worth it either, considering we’d be paying an extra $1000 a month in month to month fees on our apartment, gas, tolls, and insurance (by the mile). 

It feels like I’m not finding a job for a reason and I can’t figure out why. Even the place that everyone seems to be able to get a job with (Dollar General) hasn’t contacted me and it’s been a month. 

If it helps and there is someone that’s seasoned or works in upper management, I’d gladly send my resume (with some info redacted of course). I’d love to have a second set of eyes on it by someone who has been doing this for a while.

1hdopvk,Job Hunting While in Third Trimester of Pregnancy,"Here’s the situation: I’ve been pretty unhappy with my job this last year. I like my team overall, but the actual work I do sucks and I’ve repeatedly voiced it to my boss to no avail. But I’m pregnant, so had no intention of making moves. Then, in my third trimester, my boss denied me the amount of leave I requested. Then, my bonus was low (about a 3% increase from last year despite the revenue I brought in this year increasing by about 300%). In light of all that, I started applying to jobs about a month ago. 

Now, I’ve had a couple virtual interviews with a prospective employer and they’ve asked that I come in for an in person interview next week. I am 36+ weeks pregnant, could pop at any moment. Realistically, I can’t start a new job until March. I know they technically can’t discriminate against me on the basis of pregnancy, but they’re going to see that I’m pregnant and it feels awkward to have said nothing. Plus, I know I can’t start immediately (unless they’re cool with me taking a larger break immediately). 

Do I:
(1) Schedule the interview and just show up as the whale that I am with no heads up; 
(2) Schedule the interview and then ask for a quick call with my contact there and let him know that I am pregnant and ask expectations of start date and see if they want to proceed forward;
(3) Ask for a quick call with my contact there and let him know that I am pregnant and ask expectations of start date and see if they want to proceed forward; or
(4) Something else entirely!

1hdo5ej,Is this raise request unreasonable?,"Hello! Just looking for some advice. I’ve been at my current job for almost 2 years now, and make around 50k a year, but started at 45k, as we steadily get raises at the middle and end of the year. I realize this is really fortunate and I am grateful, however, I feel severely underpaid for the work I do.

We’re a really small organization and close group, so when I talk to my boss it would be pretty casual. I plan on bringing up all the stats that show how much I’ve improved our reach, positive feedback I’ve been getting, my market research, and also the scope of everything I do day to day, because it’s a lot more than when I started. 

I know it’s ballsy to ask for a 20k raise and I should really look elsewhere, but I do love what I do and where I work, so I’m just looking for some general advice.

1hdnq5w,Advice for Dealing with Condescending Coworkers ,"I’m the Director of Marketing for my company which started as a very small company but we’re in a scale phase and our executive team is becoming much more corporate/c-suite these days. 

The Director of HR and Director of Admin are very close outside of and within work, which makes sense because their roles need each other. I, for a long time, felt like I was by myself on Marketing Island while the two of them became closer and closer. 

Within the last 8 months I was able to hire two marketing people to be on my team so that’s definitely helped with my isolation issues but I now think HR & Admin (who have similar workloads as me), are resentful because they don’t have teams. There have been backhanded comments and condescending attitudes since my people started like: “your three person marketing team”, “you get to have all the fun while we deal with banks and lawyers”, or “ok send it to marketing to make it pretty”. 

I will also say the executive team is all women except our CEO. We’re also all in our early to mid 30s and we work in a rather open office space together M-F.

I really like the two of them as people and think they’re fantastic in their roles. I think we make a great team when we collaborate but it is sometimes uncomfortable. I feel like I’m constantly being judged, or talked to/about like I’m not important. 

I’m great at marketing, I’ve done very well in my position and as a leader of my team - so I know none of this is stemming from a performance issue.

1hdmtbd,I have put my two weeks in and my toxic manager wants to still do an annual performance review. Would I be burning a bridge by declining it?,"Long story but basically I work at a small company and have become very important over the years. They did not adjust my salary respective to the amount of responsibility I have been accumulating over the years (classic). Eventually I got sick of it and respectfully but firmly let him know where I stood and that I will need a wage readjustment if you want me to stay. Never happened so I got a significantly better job. I was fairly professional about it but I got to the point where I stopped caring and put in the bare minimum/showed up late/etc.

Our owners, who I have a good relationship with, are wondering why I'm leaving, why I got burnt out, etc. and I'm sure he had to answer for that. He left a really shitty online annual performance review, making sure to throw in digs thinly veiled as constructive criticism so he can paint the narrative that I was a shit employee so the owners don't pull their funding.

Do I have to do this review? He's gonna get all petty and I'm afraid he's going to provoke all my frustrations I've been trying hard to tamp over the last year. I don't want to leave on a bad note or burn bridges, but if I'm gone anyway do I really have to do this?

I did not have much freedom to make the work my own, since I was under a micromanager and my supervising attorney did not give me much support. My role was basically pushing paper around. I was bored out of my mind. Therefore, I transitioned to teaching. Teaching is not what I expected. It’s way more overwhelming than I thought it was. There are times when the work is fulfilling, yet I still have a feeling there is something to be desired. I’m definitely not bored. I like that my work is quite independent and the time off is great. Yet, the content I deal does not feel like it helps me grow intellectually. Being a teacher is hard and it does require a lot of skill and experience such as manipulating content for all students to understand. This part is fun, yet why does it feel like it doesn’t make me think hard enough? I’m stuck on what to do. Both options require me to go back to school, but I’m hesitant to make any type of decision.

1hdlg4c,Advice for client-facing role,"I work in a booming sector, in a client-facing role. My job often involves long sittings with customers inside a room, discussing business issues, software, or some other work details.

I feel that creating empathy in such situations gives you a HUGE edge, the problem is… very often we have these long, silent periods.

Wondering if this is normal in the business world? Or if I should try a little harder to break the silence. It is never really awkward, it’s more like, feels like a missed opportunity to create genuine empathy, which helps working together IMMENSELY. A few questions:

1) what are common conversational topics? The weather is always a safe bet, but also the 1 topic everyone knows as being boring. It often feels i have so little to talk about when I represent a respected company and everything I say can not only be remembered, but also memorized and afterwards referred to person X who has the power to influence my career. Obviously politics, religion, etc. are off the list, but it often also feels that something relatively mild, like sitting together at a restaurant and saying “I disliked this dish!” can be a recipe for trouble when culture X meets culture Y for the first time and money is involved.
Once you subtract opinions about food, opinions about women (what age you should marry, if you should have kids etc., in my role these things can ALL be potentially taken personally), it feels you have very little to say.

Should I go out more and rehearse a bunch of “in this country you can visit monument A and eat food B?” type of conversations?

2) is it possible to be nice with everyone? I meet with various customers and sometimes I meet REAL dicks. People who don’t answer to my questions when asked and run into another room. Or people who are rude for no reason (recently, someone commented badly on my drink of choice at a casual lunch - wasn’t even alcohol-based). I am not rly the emotional kind of guy, but should I read such behaviors as reflections of my poor performance, or just accept that this person I’m talking to is very unhappy in life and venting on the job basically?

For the last few months, I have been dealing with a dilemma about the sort of future I would like to take after schooling. 

Just to give an introduction: I am doing subjects in science, history, and literature in high school and have been involving myself in extracurricular activities, such as debating and whatnot. I have a passion for science subjects, such as Chemistry and Biology and I can see myself working in the chemical engineering side or medicine. At the same time, I can see myself working for international policy because my passion lies on speaking on global issues, fostering constructive solutions and understanding the dynamics of other countries. In short, I love to pursue medicine and probably wind myself in community development, public health or some sort response unit on non-communicable diseases (cardiology and whatnot.

1hdjhw3,"How should I handle leaving white collar job after just 7 months?
","I’m feeling conflicted. I started working at a local government agency right after graduating from college out of necessity. They were the only ones to offer me a full-time position since I completed an internship with them last year. While I’m grateful for the opportunity and the good benefits, the degree I earned and my specialization don’t align with the work I’m doing now. The pay is disappointing, and I often feel miserable waking up for this job.

I’ve also realized that moving vertically within the organization is very difficult due to workplace politics, and lateral moves are the only realistic option. On top of that, we’re a small team—I can count the number of people on one hand—so my absence may hit them hard. The agency is also notorious for taking a long time to hire replacements, with the process taking a minimum of three months. I don’t see a long-term future here, even though they seem to expect me to stay for years and eventually move into a managerial role in 5-10 years.

Recently, a relative of mine offered to help me transition into the oil and gas industry, specifically the firm where they work. That’s due to a position that luckily opened up and aligns directly with my interest/specialization, and the salary is nearly double what I’m earning now. It also cuts my commute time by a little and would better help me finance going to grad school to get my masters with the help of one of their benefit programs. To my surprise, I’ve already made it to the second stage of interviews, with the next one scheduled for next week, and things are looking promising.

If I do get the job, I’m unsure how to approach my current manager about leaving after only 7 months. I’m not even done training and hundreds of hours have been invested by my mentor in teaching me the ropes. I also feel conflicted because they funded the license I needed for my current position, which I’ll still be able to keep if I leave. While I feel like I’m betraying the organization that gave me a chance, I know this new opportunity aligns better with my career goals. How should I navigate this situation? Should I feel guilty? What would you do?",SleepyMeadow48,1,1.0,1,1734116403,2024-12-13 19:00:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hdjhw3/how_should_i_handle_leaving_white_collar_job/,12,2024

1hdj2gd,Help me decide which job to take ,"Trying to decide what job to take. By taking job B I will forgo my bonus for the year- approx $5K and there is a pay cut. I am trying to decide if the pay cut is worth the DB pension. They are both in the same area so the commute is the same for me. 

Job A - current position and private company. I just received a promotion but can’t get any answers on what the new compensation will look like. 
Comp is currently $66,000 with bonus every month based on work completed. I am at $70K YTD. 1 day a week in office with an expectation to go in 3 days a week until March 2025. Then it will be back to 1 day a week. 
Cons is that this position is a grind. It is very high stress and will be long hours and overtime. There were multiple rounds of lay offs this year. I do believe there is a likely scenario where I will be laid off in 2025. Many coworkers/managers have already resigned and have told me they are resigning in 2025. This is the best team but the culture is getting toxic. 

Job B - new position, it’s a government position. It is not unionized. 
The compensation is $60,000. 6 months probation with 1 day a week in office, increasing in 2026. 
There is a DB pension. 
The expecting for full pension is to work till 65, I am 31 now. 
This role is more chill, will not be as stressful as my current role. 

Financially it will be a hit but i will be ok. I am more looking at it from the long term view. ",Zenhause,1,0.9900000095367432,1,1734115272,2024-12-13 18:41:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hdj2gd/help_me_decide_which_job_to_take/,12,2024

1hdijj0,"Whatever you do, NEVER EVER ASK FOR A CO-WORKER TO PUNCH YOU IN/OUT. Me and my friend narrowly avoided (somehow) losing our jobs this way.","Admittedly, I should have remembered this basic rule at all times, but I somehow forgot. Thankfully, no one got fired for my mistake, but it was still harrowing. I wish to make the most of this by warning/reminding others to not do what I did.

I was about to punch out from my 30-minute break, but my foot was asleep (I took a nap with an alarm clock on my phone), so I couldn't get up right there. I asked my other CA if he could punch me back in (I told him my ID). Once he did so, I suddenly began wondering if what I did was right. When I told my boss about this, I was hit with the horror that it was a serious matter and that could cost both me and the other person's job. Thankfully, after my boss discussed on the phone with a higher up about this, my co-worker and I were told that we were given second chances as it was an honest mistake (especially on my part) but that we absolutely must not repeat the mistake. Admittedly, I don't deserve to be granted this mercy considering that most people, even the most dedicated employees, would instantly lose their job for doing this. I should have been fired. But the least I can do is learn from this.

I still beat myself up over this egregious/dumb@$$ error that I did so absentmindedly. I don't know if I can ever forgive myself, especially with the fact I almost cost my friend's job. I'm amazed that there wasn't any termination when this would happen in any other job or situation. As much as I don't deserve my luck/mercy, the least I can do, aside from not repeating it, is by warning others not to do what I did. Again, DO NOT ASK FOR ANOTHER CO-WORKER TO MANAGE YOUR PUNCHES. If you're late, so be it. It's better than to lose your job.

1hdiinq,Coworker Leaves my Chair Smelly and I Don’t Know What To do!!!,"I (27F) work in a school where we constantly have to move/share spaces with other staff members. One coworker (40’sF), who is super kind,  uses my space daily, the class period (roughly 45minutes) directly before I return. I first noticed a weird smell a few months ago, but it’s gotten really bad the last week and a half. Today specifically so bad, that I’m looking to y’all for advice.

The office chair *SMELLS SO BAD* after she has used it. I have given arguably too much grace with this, trying to pin it in literally anything else but at this point, it is undoubtedly her. She is a little bit of a larger woman and struggles physically because of it sometimes. I have been spraying the chair with odor killing Lysol after she leaves and it has helped a little, but not nearly enough. Today, I could smell it as I walked into the room and there seemed to be a small wet spot on the chair. 

I do NOT want to embarrass her to any degree. She’s very kind, may be unaware and because of her size/health, may not be able to “reach” everywhere while showering. I’ve considered many origins of the stench. I need help/ideas on how to move forward. It’s so bad that today I’m sitting in a student’s chair instead of the desk chair.

Terei as mesmas oportunidades de uma pessoa que tenha feito a licenciatura em engenharia aeronáutica?

1hdgrys,Seeking advice ,"I was employed 6+ years as a claims analyst at a physicians office (company A). 2 years ago they sold the billing department and my position to a recovery management company out of state (company B). Part of the agreement was that my seniority & PTO would transfer over - which it did. Now 8+ years in same position between the 2 companies. I was told no reviews or merit increases would be given until 2 years of employment by new boss. A couple days ago I was notified that the company has been purchased by another company (company C) and that my seniority is now reflected as my company B hire date - just 3 months shy of 2 years. 

I was accruing 2 days PTO a month under company B & set to accrue 3 days at 10 years. Under company C I will accrue 3 hours per paycheck & at 2 years I will accrue 4 hours per paycheck. It caps at 5 hours per paycheck after 5 years. If you do the math it’s very depressing.

1hdgcag,Unsure of accepting job offer,"I recently graduated with my BS in Biology in the Spring and have been working for a local government office for ten years. It's an office admin type position that has civil service protection, but there's no issues with the agency (aside from COLA) and very limited mobility unless someone else leaves. Otherwise, it's an easy night shift job with decent amounts of down time (no OT pay, comp time only). I also live 5-10 minute drive from work. 

I have been looking for a better paying person since I now have my degree in a field that my degree applies to but have had no luck except one agency that wants to offer me a position: Adult Protective Services as an investigator. Like same day as the one interview kind of fast offer.

I'm on the fence about accepting the position because it's a mobile one (using my own car) with inconsistent hours (hrs are 8-5 but people consistently work longer), overtime only payable after 100+ hours (as in they pay only what you work after 100), and it's only a $600 a year pay increase. The only upside is that there is opportunity to move up in a tiered system, but everything else has me worried.

I was told I would be paid for all my training hours, but they cant ""confirm"" them. I have provided the information they've requested. At what point am I to reach out about my pay?

1hdc0c5,Need your advice on a certain situation at work!,"I have been working with my current manager for the last one and a half years! The Rapport has been good.

 I have felt he is avoiding me for the past few days. For instance, when I schedule a meeting with him, he does not respond, and when I text him, he does not reply. 

He has assigned a few projects to me, he used to follow up with me but these days he is least interested in what is happening with it. When I give him a update he just responds with a thumps up.

A possible reason could be I informed that I am planning to do by MBA very soon. But he was cool with it and gave me a good LOR. So I am confused if that is the reason.

If might be that I am overthinking. Need your guys inout here!!

1hdbjnr,Need help.,"I am a newly graduated high school student with little no clue what they want to pursue for their career. As of right now I am leaning towards studying mechanical engineering as the idea of creating things really captured me as since I was a kid I’ve loved making things and it may be something that I pursue in.
If there any mechanical engineers here, how’s the job, is it worth it and what’s the salary like.

On the other hand I am also considering dentistry. However my only motive to this is the salary which is kind of driving me away as I have heard of the crazy amounts of debt as well as stress and time that is needed throughout schooling but it is an option that I am open to.

My goal is to have a positive work life balance in the future when I am also able to earn an income (150-200k+) when I’m 27-30 so that I am able to provide for a family and be able to build and  grow a real estate profile for myself so that I am able to greater incomes and be able to retire sooner.

However I am also open to a lot of opportunities as I haven’t really spent the time to think about this. I like maths and science in a way (open to other careers) and want to work on a job that is more hands on and technical rather then the classic office doctor or lawyer. I am open to them but prefer others.

Any advice or things to consider before approaching my future would really help aswell.

It's my gap year so I've been applying for internships on various platforms for 2 weeks in case my exams don't go well, I heard back from one of the companies today for an HR role. It's a paid internship, but I'm concerned about the timings which is 10 am to 6 pm. Isn't it too much for an internship? I feel it is too much, but then again it's so difficult to find one that I am scared to let this go. They are also asking to join immediately and I have an exam tomorrow and another one the day after tomorrow so will it be okay with them, they said they'll let me know by tomorrow. One of my major exams is in 15 days so that's also a main concern.

1hd7uj2,what do yall think of my job? ,"Hello, i’m 19f and have been working at my serving job for two months. through these two months every single day my boss or even my co-workers yell at me. I have been trying to keep it together but it’s really getting hard for me to deal with. it’s always either petty stuff or just men mansplaining things i already know but in a harsh tone. i’m the only girl server and the other two servers are 18m and a 26m. I’m cool with the 18m but it’s the 26m that really irritates me. He’s a whine bag and has worked here for 7 years. Tonight really showed me how much of a whine bag he is. We have a sheet that shows who’s table is who’s and he went first tonight and i was second. mind you he gets visibly upset when anyone makes more than him. So i had a table of 6 come in and it was my turn so i took their drink orders and took their appetizer orders as well. a little before this though a table of 2 had coke in and it was his turn. I wrote down who had what. I walked back by the seating sheet and he was erasing what I had wrote down and giving himself the 6 top and me the 2 top. I asked him why he was doing this and he said that the 6 top had walked in before the 2 top making it his. i told him that absolutely was not true as he got the 2 tops drinks way before the 6 top had even walked in. I wasn’t being aggressive i was simply telling him that it was my table. he threw his hands up and said “whatever.” and so i took care of my table and moved on. to me it wasn’t a big deal. Then i had gotten another 6 top and thought i’d be nice and offer it to him in exchange for the next table he would be getting. he told me to shut up. so i said “I was just trying to help you out geez sorry.” then he said, like he always does “i’m tired of the stupid questions all the time.” all in front of customers mind you. And I said “okay well I was trying to be nice but ok.” and then he yells “QUIT RAISING YOUR VOICE AT ME!!” And I said I wasn’t because I literally wasn’t. It was pretty loud in there because it’s a super tiny building so i was talking at a level 1-2 voice. He storms off to the back and goes straight to the boss who he kisses up to and all I can hear is him telling the boss what happend and complaining about me to him. It really didn’t bother me and I didn’t think it was a big deal as I said before. Once we slowed down he comes up to me and said “i’m sorry for how I was being but I really don’t like being accused of stuff I didn’t do.” and I said “what did I accuse you of?” and he says “enough. I was just trying to apologize.” so I said “thank you.” and went about my business. Nearing the end of my shift my boss asks me to go to the office for a talk. He says “I understand you really wanted that table but screaming isn’t going to get you your way, if this happens again i’m going to fire you. I checked the cameras and you were right both of those big tops were yours.” So then I said “I was screaming? when was I screaming? I didn’t know this was that big of a deal.” He then reply’s “You were screaming and you were being very aggressive with him. It’s only a big deal because you made it a big deal.” I genuinely want to know what y’all think. Also tonight showed me how extremely racist and homophobic they are and they are trying to convert me to be muslim. The muslim part isn’t really a big deal to me. I know what I believe in and besides, this is work I’m here for money. And with the racist thing, a light skin girl came in for an application. 
After she left the started smacking their heads and saying they don’t like ghetto blank ers. i’m sure you can assume what i’m trying to say. All of this crazy racism,homophobic,whine bag stuff just intensified tonight. I know this is kind of long sorry!

1hd7ruz,Is this a promotion? Would you take it?,"Is this a promotion? Would you take it?

I am 28F. I work in the Renewable Energy (Solar) sector for commercial and industrial clients as a sales manager and just hit my 1 year at my organization. I had a successful year, hit my targets, made a reputation for myself, overall good first year.

I am the only rep in my division currently and I head my division reporting to the CEO direct. Around 6 months ago, we launched a new engineering design division. It’s an additional service our existing customers can purchase but not something we are being pushed to sell. 

My boss approached me yesterday and said “We were going to hire a new sales rep to run this division, but rather than do this, we wanted to see if you were interested in heading this division. To give you more time to prospect and grow both businesses we’d hire you an assistant and you’d have full say over who works for you”

I’ve decided I’m 70% -80% confident in the product for this new division and I have experience growing startups successfully, but my main concern is that this feels like a promotion, but with no talks of pay or commission increase. 

Not really sure how to navigate this as it’s great being asked to handle more responsibility 1 year in, and I could really use the help of an assistant with how busy we are, but I feel like that’s the only thing I am getting out of this is extra help which is really needed anyways and I shouldn’t have to take on more work to get.

Because I’m not 100% confident in this new product as our team hasn’t sold any, and haven’t really talked about it, I’m a little hesitant to negotiate a salary increase or commission increase on the front end without seeing how this goes with the new division. I was thinking about setting an upfront contract with my boss. If I hit x,y, and z target by X date, I would like to discuss increased compensation and an adjustment of my title to X but I don’t know if that is a mistake and I should ask for that when I accept this role.

I could use some help with the compensation ask. Currently I make 80K base with .9% commission on total revenue for my current division. Target next year is 23 million. My division is usually 7 figure contracts, however the new division products run anywhere from $10,000-$40,000 so the existing commission rate won’t really work. What is a fair compensation ask to run sales for both divisions with updated commission for the lower contract values? This is for engineering design if that helps nail down commission rates. My boss asked for a decision in 24 hours which is EOD today. Any advice appreciated.

Is this a promotion? What would you ask to take this on? ",Victory__chaser1,0,0.5,0,1734077958,2024-12-13 08:19:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hd7ruz/is_this_a_promotion_would_you_take_it/,12,2024

1hd7gkd,Is it worth pursuing psychology for a master’s if I haven’t done it in my bachelor’s?,"Hi everyone,  
I’m feeling really stuck right now and could use some advice. I have my CUET exam in 3 months, and I’m not sure if I’ll score well enough to get into a good psychology program. I haven’t studied psychology in my bachelor’s (I’m currently doing English), but I feel a strong pull toward the subject and can see myself building a career in it.

Studying English has been quite depressing and unfulfilling for me. I often feel disconnected from the subject—it’s more about memorizing than engaging, and I don’t enjoy poetry or literary analysis the way my peers do. Instead of feeling inspired, I find myself stressed and unmotivated, questioning whether I’m even in the right field.

But now, I’m worried about whether a master’s in psychology would even hold value if my undergrad is in English. Would I be at a disadvantage compared to others who’ve done psychology from the start? How can I navigate through the challenges?

Another option which my parents are suggesting is doing a master’s in English first, while simultaneously building my foundation in psychology (through online courses, certifications, or a diploma). Then, I could pursue a second master’s in psychology.

Would this approach make more sense and hold more value, or would it just delay things unnecessarily? I want to make the right choice for my career but feel overwhelmed by the possibilities.

1hd7eh9,"Not sure if I should quit my job, but I’m pretty burnt out by now. Would appreciate some outside perspective","Sorry for the long rant ahead. I’ve been at this job for a little over 1 year—$12/hr in an entry level HR position that has me handling about 200 communications daily, internal and external, by calls, texts and email.

At first I was so confused because I thought they weren’t paying me on purpose. My employer sends checks through mail but I was not receiving them due to mailing issues and spent a whole month without getting paid…there were days when I was so fed up that I left early, which I know was wrong. My old manager ended up giving me an infraction basically threatening to fire me on my next slip-up, called me “a thief and unprofessional” in a virtual meeting…Took them 9 whole months to finally come up with the idea to switch to paypal. At least they were nice/approachable about it.

I have zero breaks. 8 hours straight every day, with no time slots assigned for aall the tasks we do. Sometimes I don’t have time to do everything. I try to give myself 5-10 minute breaks in between every chance I get. But it is very strange that breaks have never been *offered* to me by my employer.

I’ve also noticed that my colleagues do not follow protocols by the book, which I mentioned to my now manager… But for example, I do “x” task every time correctly, so when I see how others drop the ball (and how it affects my work), I get unmotivated and stop doing “y” task the correct way. However my manager (the new one/owner of the company) sets up a last-minute meeting to ask me why I wasn’t doing “y” task step by step and basically micromanaged/audited my work, asked me to explain her how I did the tasks that I’ve been doing since day 1 without issue.

 I was so tired (insomnia and back pain) that I had a breakdown and started choking up…I turned off the camera and asked her to stop recording the meeting and basically tried to push through the tears to explain my POV. The following days it was: another unscheduled meeting, a recorded phone call (I did not consent to being recorded), a lengthy email, a meeting with her and CEO…I guess we tried to patch things up but I still feel very uncomfortable with my year-long history with this employer.

I have an opportunity lined up already, to do freelance over the phone interpretation, since I am bilingual. (I passed the test/evaluations and by two weeks they set up a profile for me to work my own hours at my leisure with minimal supervision.) However the training modules kind of sucked and I do not have experience in this field (even though I am a Translation masters student) and for some reason cannot get over my mental block to start interpreting. So unless I am sure that I feel confident doing this and that pay will be good (apparently call flow is good enough to work full-time), I’m not sure if I should quit. 

I am just hoping to get some outside perspective, since I’m kind of alone in this. Closed ones keep telling me to “get a new job” which I’ve been trying to do (other than the freelance stuff) but I keep getting rejected.",fuckoffkiss,4,1.0,6,1734076220,2024-12-13 07:50:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hd7eh9/not_sure_if_i_should_quit_my_job_but_im_pretty/,12,2024

Honestly this might be more of a rant and less of a help post but more of me just typing out my thought's somewhere for clarity. 

Note after typing: So this was a way longer rant than expected. This is a heads up for anyone. I don't expect anyone to read or respond. I'm seeing this more of a digital journal I'mm putting out into the world.

How have you chosen your path? What led you to choose the choices you made and are you happy with them or did you learn to become happy with them? Or did you end up unhappy? Happy or unhappy, What made you go down the path you chose or kept you from the path you didn't choose?

I'm stuck, and if I'm being honest I've been stuck since I was 17 (now recently turned 32). I've always had a hard time committing or choosing what to do with my life. Since 17 thought I had to figure out the right path for a career. I know now a job is just a job and not my whole life. I know now to have thing outsidee of a career to be fulfilled. I still struggle with making choices and following through. I'm happy with a path one week but go back and forth each week between ideas of what I want to pursue. How do you cinfidently go down a path without question? Right now I decided I want to study art and that's what I want to do. I know job prospects aren't good. I might not even get a job in an art field. My goal isn't to make money off my personal art but to get a job in maybe a design agency or freelance graphic design or get a job in animation or yah know provide some sort of service art related that isn't my own stuff. I'm logical and know that if I study art it's going to be all uphill. I know It'll be a struggle and might even end up working in something totally unrelated. Like I might even have to go back to school for some certificate for a healthcare job or go back for a masters to just teach. I'm okay with that. I love drawing and illustration. When I'm in class I love being there. I don't love traditional art but don't mind doing it for art class. I'm more of a cartoon and comics guy. I was also taking a web dev class at the same time. The whole program got scrapped. I read an email about it while in my art class and honestly got excited. I like programming a bit but it was in a time when I was between decisions. Should I go all in with art school or focus on web dev for a job. WhenI read that email, it was like a weight was lifted. Like the universe decided for me. I was happy that I got to focus on art more. I wasn't even mad about the program being scrapped.

skip a few weeks later (now), I'm having doubts. I still love my art class and the direction but now I'm confused again. See I did like programming but not web dev. I realized I might be interested in electrical engineering. More of the hardware side with a bit of programming. I keep thinking it's the smart choice becaause more job security. But will I regret not fully committing to art. I know I know, do art on the side. I know all the spiels. I just hate how indecisive I am. I hate how I know what to do and howto choose but I can't commit. I know what each decision involves, god or bad but I just can't stick with anything. I want to do aret even though it might end horribly but I also have an interest in electronics. From a finincial stand point I know EE is the choice fersures. but something about studying art just keeps calling me. Also When something about EE calls me, it almost seems like the glamorous part of EE is dragging me in. The idea of it an not really the gritty stuff. I know the gritty stuff of art and it's okay. Sometimes I wish we had no decision and life was set for us.",rodrigo2468,1,1.0,0,1734073080,2024-12-13 06:58:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hd6pgv/what_path_to_take/,12,2024

1hd64cp,2 Job Dilemma?,"Background: mid 30s, married, x1 2 year old, partner wants to move x-country closer to family, own house mid 3% interest

First job - supposed to get a raise to $110k within 2025. Very stable, 8 weeks combined time off, full pay maternity leave, pension, 401k 5% match, no bonus. Can work from home like 60% time and very flexible schedule. I do travel about x5 times/year.

Second: - move x-cross country, $120k with 2% of comapany that pays dividends (\~140k), bonuses, potential for uncapped earning based on opening new branch office/bringing in work. Move puts us close to family, but would have to wait 2 years to actually move to area we like based on contract. Likely would have to travel twice as much as i currently do for #1. Remote work possible but first two years would be full time in office.

From a career and earning potential the second seems most enticing. I just worry that is risky and may take time away from our family. With extended family support (eg help with child care) it's doable,but worth it?

Staying at first job we are basically a 12hr travel day to visit family. Partner doesnt like our current house, so another wrench in $$ where a bigger house and higher intrest rate just seems out of the picture right now.

1hd4exr,Conflicted between two job offers. What should I do?,"So, I applied for an internal position and got done with 2 rounds of interview. I am pretty sure that I will get the offer after the response of my HR and the manager who was conducting interview. The salary would be $55k-$60k (60k if i am successful to negotiate since i am a fresh undergrad, i dont have experience in this field). The position is a customer advocate/ order management position, basically managing the orders for B2B clients. Currently, I am working in the same company at an admin role for warehouse operations (i joined while i was a student). I am getting $45k right now here. The hours in my current position are not great-12-8:30pm but my manager and the team I am working with is amazing. 

The manager of my new position that I’ve applied for is micro managing. Haven’t heard good things about him. But the new position is a hybrid position and regular working hours. 

Also, right now I am not a full time hire at my current position. Still on probation period and don’t get any PTO and other benefits. Now that I will have an offer for the customer advocate position, my current manager has also promised to offer with me a full time role in next few weeks (but he is ofc not sure because for some reason, he doesn’t have all the power in getting a new person hired in the operations team right now. )

I’m really confused if I should take the offer for the new position knowing that I’ll probably not be happy there but then I will at least have better hours. 

The future plan is to eventually switch to a business analysts position- I am working on some projects and getting the skills. 

What should I do?

1hd4dej,How can I have a promotion conversation with my boss when my team member literally just got promoted to the open spot?,"Some specifics - my role is tiered 1-4 based on years of experience. Typically 1-2 years as a 1, and 3 years each until you hit a 4. I’ve been a 1 for almost a year (at 1 year at the start of the 2025). My company typically promotes to 2 after 15-18 months, but I’ve heard 12 months isn’t unheard of, and 12-18 was originally communicated to me when I was hired. My team recently announced a 2 opening due to someone leaving, and we’re also already hiring another 1. 

Recently, the only other 1 on my team got promoted to 2 without the position being posted (though it was mentioned last week that it would be posted. We have to apply internally, typically). This person has years of experience but was laid off due to COVID and took 3 years before recentering the work force which is why they briefly started as a 2. 

I’ve been encouraged by colleagues to bring up my interest in the promotion during my 1:1 with my manager next week. I know I’m borderline qualified but have received great feedback from my manager and feel like I’m exceeding expectations.

Another layer: I was originally hired on a different team, which is also hiring a 2 and has had the role posted for a while. I was told I could ask about applying there too.

My goal is to get promoted with the best salary. I am currently around 65k and was told 85k is on the high end but has also been done before. M-HCOL city.  A friend in HR mentioned that openings due to departures tend to have higher salary potential than merit promotions because the budget adjusts to fill the vacancy.

How should I approach my manager to ask for a promotion? Should I also explore the other team’s opening? I want to do what’s best for me while staying professional.

Working in New York and have a good paying job with retirement benefits. I feel like I’ve hit my ceiling, so I’m trying to finish bachelors and then go for masters in CM or supply chain. Wife has been pressuring to move to FL. I said I wouldn’t go without completing my degree, but this is truly for me to buy time here and improve. 

My real issue is that I used to love my job, but my employers don’t seem supportive of me finishing my degree. (I’ve heard from a confidant that my boss thinks it’s a waste of time). I want to go even further up the chain in CM and am completing my degree in order to prove that. I don’t know if I’ll be happy in FL. The pay difference is substantial and I’m afraid of becoming a failure to my family if we took the leap. Perhaps I’m holding on to my comfort zone here. Even if that means continuing to feel like I’m not going anywhere as long as I can continue to pay the bills and save for my children’s educations. 

I’m always paranoid that they’re talking about me and I’m making myself feel like I have to leave. Perhaps I’m stressed with working long hours, being a father, taking classes and have no time for anything else in life.

1hd3f4p,For the second time an opportunity I'm qualified for & desire is opening at work. How to improve odds?,"Of securing the position.


I'm part time activities/life enrichment/management and a part time medical assistant in a dementia facility.


A few months ago a full time life engagement *assistant* position opened up. I jumped at the opportunity, since I actually have my activities director certificate and have a teaching background.

I was not chosen, for honestly still unclear reasons - I genuinely mean unclear because my supervisor in this department has been acting rather erratic for months. A new hire with minimal experience was chosen and I was devastated. My boss had kept telling me the hire ""had more experience"" which was a blatant lie by my colleague's own honesty towards me.

This led to a rather big moment of discontent in my job - I'm lucky, because my head *head* supervisor finally begged for a 1:1 with me after I informed them I had found another higher paying job and was planning on leaving (my mother was dying, I was being overworked and being stonewalled from progress, I was being lied to about my career and I was honestly done, I thought). 


We had a great thorough discussion - about what led to me being passed over, about what I want for my future with the facility, my skills and what I contribute and where I'd fit best in the future, a pay raise, and they've been great to me ever since.
My boss in engagement, after me almost quitting, literally cried, apologized, begged me to stay, said she'd been mislead on my colleagues background and that ***she wanted to train me to take her position one day***.


Fast forward to now.


My boss, the same one who passed me over for the promotion is now ""retiring"". I use that term in parentheses because the truth is I think my company is kind of pushing her out. She's not making much sense, not making many good choices, can't handle her workload, etc.

So......her position, as in supervisor of activities is now open.


She didn't tell me she was resigning. My head supervisor did, and hinted she'd need a new director soon. I immediately filled out the application during lunch and my head supervisor and another higher up spoke with me about my application and interest in a positive way as soon as I got back from lunch. I expect an interview at least. I'm more than qualified - I'm overqualified for both my positions as is.


My boss, for now, keeps rambling about how she'd like our former activities team member, who left our facility to go be director at another facility 40 minutes away, to come back and take her place. She's saying she doesn't know when she's leaving but my head supervisor said she's leaving in January and it's an ""emotional process"" for her. It clearly is. 


What can I do to up my chances of this promotion? 
My head supervisor and other managers all appear to be rooting for me - it's only ever been my boss, not out of malice, who's held me back. Her own words were that she'd like me to have her position one day but with how emotional and unstable she's becoming, I'm leery to try to talk to her about it before she departs........
***especially since she has screwed me over once***. So right now I've applied and appear to have the support of my higher ups.......I have the qualifications, the know how, the passion, a tight rapport with my team and management. They know where I want my career to go and they know I'd be a valuable asset in my boss's position.


Idk. A bit of a ramble but......keeping my head down yet keeping my interest clear and firmly displaying why I'd be the best choice.

1hd2cw5,Arts to what? looking for a total career shift ,"I followed my passions and majored in Art history, obtained an MA and BA in the field. Since graduating 10+ years ago, I've worked first in various museums and now ""the trade"" (auction houses). I consider myself successful in a very impractical field, as by this point I have become very specialized in a niche art historical field. Very rarely are there research or curatorial positions in this field open at museums, and the art market, though at an overall slump this year, is particularly bad for this field. There are no signs of it recovering. I am now the only specialist in which used to be a large department. The person more senior to me retired last year, and this year my personal sales goals are higher than what both of ours were last year combined. It feels like I'm being set up to fail, and my redundancy will be justified by failing to make these unrealistic goals. On top of that, there have been multiple rounds of mass layoffs at the major auction houses. I feel that I am good at what I do, but the job just won't exist in the next 5 years. I'm beginning to think I need a plan b, the issue is I'm so specialized in such an otherwise useless field (with very few opportunities ), that I don't know where to begin. I have never been laid off before so this is all feeling very daunting. 

My day to day involves researching and appraising antiques in this category of art. Twice a year we pull together a big sale, including a catalogue with scholarly essays. This involves appraisals, pitching for collections, researching and writing about the works, and selling the works to collectors. It involves some collaboration with publishing, marketing,  and finance, though I would not say I have extensive experience in those areas. I love the job for the work with the objects and research and writing, and don't particularly enjoy the client advisory aspects, though I do have a ton of experience in that area. 

Might anyone have any advice for what type of industries I could look into? Growing up, my dream was to always work with either art (yay for the past decade) or fashion merchandising, but the later is also such an over saturated job market I'm not looking into it as a realistic goal. Really I can only see myself getting a job in nonprofit work (fundraising/development), based on past museum/volunteer experience and experience courting wealthy clients in the arts, but I really don't think I would enjoy that. Any insight would be so appreciated.

I live with my family, and my two younger sisters (me and my sisters are all young adults). My two younger sisters have a long history of sabotaging my online meetings/calls/exams/interviews by deliberately yelling/shouting embarrassing things about me to embarrass and sabotage me. They literally treat it like entertainment. This has been going on since high school and through college. So far, I have been avoiding it by not taking calls at home, or going to college campus to do stuff like video interviews, meetings, etc.  I'm dreading this abuse continuing once I start my new job, as I'll be on calls with coworkers regularly, but for longer hours.

I'm stuck between options i can think of:

Option 1: Commuting: My company has a small office I can use, which means a 35-minute train ride and some walking to get there. I'm worried about how long I'll have to keep this up. Till i am able to afford to buy a house? Would it be better to make use of the remote option? Also, there are times where I am expected to work outside of normal working hours by my employer - such as till midnight, and working during weekends -- so i am not sure how compatible commuting would be.

Option 2: Move Out: This would solve the problem completely, and i can work outside of working hours  but rent prices in my area are a bit insane right now. I can afford it, but wont be able to save much. I'm worried about the financial strain.

I can't think of any other options

My new role is asking for 2 references who are in supervisory/senior type roles, but because I worked in such a small team (3 people), I am unable to get a reference as 1 of them is my old fired (disgruntled) boss, the other who I thought was a close collegue has ignored my emails.

I read on Glass door that this same company rescinded someones offer after their references, but this could just be a coincidence.

I have a close friend in another team but haven't really worked with him.

All the work I did previously was through my boss!

1hd1d1d,Need Advice for Interview with Remote Tech/Aerospace Company (1099 Position) ,"I have a big interview tomorrow with a remote tech/aerospace company. I’ve been struggling to land interviews recently, so I want to approach this one seriously. However, I’ve hit a few roadblocks and would really appreciate your advice.

Here’s the situation:

The recruiter didn’t initially mention that the position is 1099.

During the first round of interviews, they confirmed it’s 1099 but assured me the compensation is sufficient to cover my own health insurance.

I haven’t been able to find any reviews of the company online.

They claimed that they’ve had no turnover for this role in years, which seems like a positive sign, but I don’t have anything to corroborate that.


Tomorrow, I’ll be interviewing with the CEO, and I’m not entirely sure what I should be asking to get the clearest picture of the role, its stability, and whether it’s the right fit.

Do you have any suggestions for specific questions I should ask or red flags to watch out for? I want to go into this interview prepared and ensure I’m making an informed decision.

1hd1clp,Job interview but I might have upcoming transportation issues,"I was on the fence about applying to places until my car issues were resolved. But I found two roles that I know I qualify for almost 100% — it’s just a matter of me being confident and actually likable during the interview. My confidence is low at the moment due to some hardship and the financial stressors from my car issues at the moment. I did something similar to this once before when I got a new job and had car issues before, but that was when I had someone to lean on to help with transportation until I got things settled. I have since moved to a new area where I don’t know too many people, and getting a ride to a new job if I needed to wouldn’t be a viable option. 

This potential job would pay a bit more, though. And I currently am not doing so great financially. 

But I also don’t want to risk leaving a job, and then be seen as unreliable at a new job. 

Today I got a call back for an interview, and I just told the recruiter I would be able to give her flexible dates at another time for now. But should I call back and schedule an interview asap anyway?

I don’t have a clear timeline for when exactly my car issues would be resolved. My car actually works fine right now — but I have a longwinded complicated issue with trying to register my car due to a paperwork screw up. So eventually, I could end up not being able to drive legally. Even then, I have missed work a few times at my current job to go to the DMV.

1hd0vwq,(UK) Need some advice regarding my circumstance on how to move forward,"Things to know before:

* I'm on a level 4 software dev apprenticeship which has 3 months left till I complete but im not too worried about completing it as ive nearly finished it anyway.

* My father has Parkinson's and my mother is his primary carer.

Lets start with the first thing

Ive had a baby daughter which is amazing! However my fathers Parkinson's got really bad,

My mother was his main carer but she's got chronic fatigue as she's older and weaker and ahs been working and running around and stuff and dealing with the following

Before he could walk around, get dressed, make himself food, move himself in sleep etc but now he needs a lot more help such as:

* Getting dressed

* getting his clothes

* helping him to the bathroom

* his bladder is weak so he needs to go often

* taking him to the lounge or his bed

* getting him into and out of bed

* moving his duvet on and off him

* giving him medication and water

* readjusting when sitting or lying down

* Him falling over

* Being picked up physically

Not to mention how difficult he has become

* Doesn't eat properly and argues about everything that doesn't go his way

* ""I cant have chicken its bad for me"" then proceeds to get angry im not giving him a pepsi??!!!

* argues with my mother and siblings

* Feeds my daughter sweets so i have to watch him more attentively

* Has night terrors (always fun to wake up in the night to screams)

* Forgetting things and re arguing the same points

* Clutter in his room and the house and how he hates me or anyone trying to clean it

* Argues when you give medication thinking he has taken it

* or the opposite thinks he hasnt taken it and argues when he has taken it

Now at this point my mom still takes care of him but she's getting more and more tired and has a symptom called Dyspnoea which is a symptom of chronic fatigue. And also she has a fractured hand which the NHS has decided the operation can wait for.

as she gets worse due to my dads health and the fact she isn't getting any rest either.

Now I as the eldest have to kind of take care of both my parents.

Wife gets pregnant again

This results in my work suffering and me getting depressed. Depressed due to stress and my dads health not just cz of the sadness yk?

I book some time off to go to a diff country with all my family as my sister is getting married and we drag my dad along

I know it may not seem the best idea but the last time we went here my dad was a lot more active so we thought it was best.

in that time i get typhoid and im practically bedridden my daughter gets an infection and she's a baby so ive been told to bed rest and have to tell my work.

But the illness and the constant stress due to this just gets worse. When we recover we come home (losing money as well from tickets that were changed)

I come home and still feel mentally just not there so I speak to EAP which is like employee support and they recommend I take time off.

I shift bedrooms so I can take care of my dad and my sleep just suffers.

Lets talk about my work.

Redundancy will occur for the IT sector end of 2025. My work is less software developing more analysis. Code is SQL but is more query based. Very simple and rare to use anything too complicated. so im worried when the time comes for me to leave how will I find another job to improve and upskill.

When i get time I try to study devops skills such and do practical's

Fast forward to present day - ive been off since August but we have found a government scheme which assigns a night carer for my dad which should happen any day now. Regardless how long they take im so depressed from dealing with the situation im just going to work regardless as I feel better at work than this situation.

In March I should be getting paternity leave but idk how to really feel.

Ive essentially been off for 6months

then worked for 5 months

went off for 4 months

now im going to work for 3 months

and then ill be off for 6 months.

Im really worried and feel anxious thinking about

* Improving and upskilling in this environment

* My parents health

* my own health - im 22 and min the last 6months my hairs been thinning and my eyes are twitching and im always tired

* my ability to raise my kids in this environment

* talking to my manager regarding all this which I have been updating but I feel anxious bringing it up

* feeling invalidated because when I look at my leaves I feel like ive taken the piss

* References for when I leave

1hd0feu,Should I take the promotion?,"Last year, I got my current job (project manager) after being burnt out by my last. I was hoping it would give me some time to recover and was drawn to focusing on one project, not being a supervisor, and being paid decently for where I live.

Fast forward and I’m still burnt out. I ended up being the project manager and the project coordinator. I was leading and doing everything. The project itself timeline shifted from two years to one year. And while my manager tried their best, I didn’t receive the support I always needed because everyone was tapped. All in all, it was intense and there were weeks where I pulled 70-80 hour weeks.

Which brings me to now. I was recently offered a promotion with a raise. My boss said she felt like I should be making more and that she wanted me to be doing the kind of work I’m capable of. The only thing is it’s a 8k raise to be the project manager of 5 more projects. I expressed concerns around workload and burnout. She mentioned support will come when my colleagues projects wrap up in a couple of months. I asked for a prof dev stipend and for all of us to get 4 day work weeks. She said they are working on it but no guarantees. I’m still hesitant.

I can’t tell if I’m letting my past prevent me from taking an opportunity that would be good for me. I do love project management, but based on this year‘s experience, I’m not sure if I’m ready to take on that much for 8K? She let me know that’s the only way I can get this high of a raise.

I have a lot of gaps on mine, but it's mostly because I have not ""needed"" to hold a job; I had the freedom to leave jobs without having another aligned. Is this priviledge something to be ashamed of? All of my jobs were dead-end jobs, by the way. Cashier, manufacture worker, CNA, hair dresser, etc. So any moves I'd be making were lateral, anyways. Instead of trading one lateral move for another in the same line of work, I'd challenge myself by dipping my feet in a whole different line of work (a lateral one, with respect to hourly pay and ability to climb a ladder). I do not have this priviledge to be so careless anymore, so I really would like to know what recruiters think when they see gaps.

1hczylc,Teacher switching to a factory job.. I need advice ,"my heart is in one place and my head is in another.. 

I’m a teacher and I love my kids. My 3 & 4 year old students drive me nuts a lot of the time, but I genuinely care about them. If I leave I will miss them... I will miss who I am when I am a teacher (the good parts— not the over stressed, under paid and over worked part of me). My work is meaningful and I know I make a difference. I don’t have kids and never could afford them.. so my students are all I have to bring out my inner child. 

I just can’t imagine living pay check to paycheck for the rest of my life. I could never retire. Even if I went back to college for a bachelor’s degree I wouldn’t make over 20 an hour (I live in ny). I’d always be stressed out about doing the work of 3 people, never having consistent staff or PTO.. never seeing my fiancé who works nights. Not being able to help my parents who are both disabled. 

I applied for a 3rd shift machine operator at my fiancés job & have an interview tomorrow morning.. It starts off at $3 more an hour, and in 2 years I’d be making over $5 more an hour. Union benefits and protections. I’d work in a different building than my fiancé but he’d be able to drive us both which means $200 less in gas a month. 

I’ve worked with people in schools, group homes and daycares for most of my employment so a machine job isn’t really my skill range. However, thinking of my mom going an entire winter with no heat, worrying about how my dad will afford a disability/ ss lawyer, worrying how I will pay my own bills if something major happens.. worrying about how my family will perceive me if I don’t get this new job with better pay. I just want to make the right choice and I’m not sure how to even figure this out. I’m 28 and I feel like I’m stuck in this never ending loop.

1hczwsf,Salary Negotiation ,"Advice needed: I was recently offered a Director position for an academic program that I’ve worked in for 15 years. The interview process was designed to hire me, more or less, after I interviewed for the same position last summer and another internal candidate was selected. He couldn’t hack it, and left after a year and a half. I was offered the position for $600 less than the director that just left, even though he had no prior experience in the program and no management experience. I was essentially told he was selected over me because he had more committee experience. Anyway, I’ve served as interim for the director role I was just offered for longer than the previous director was in the role (my interim experience was spread out over a few yrs). 

All this to say, I’m stuck on how to negotiate. I’ve never negotiated salary before and want to do this right. First, I won’t take less than the previous director who couldn’t stick it out and who had less experience overall than me. Second, I’m currently on an 11 month contract and did ask to stay on that. I was told the provost prefers 12 month contracts, but there are 2 other directors in my department (one who works in a similar program as me) who are on 11 month contracts and there are also 3 roles equal to my current role on 11 months.

1hcz7xp,"Most important decision in my life so far, little help? ","Should I Move to the Netherlands for €3,100 Net or Stay in Romania with €1,800 Net?

Hi everyone, I’m a 28-year-old engineer from Romania with some career plans but feeling a bit stuck. I’ve received two job offers and am trying to decide what’s best for my future.
	1.	Option 1: Stay in Romania, earning €1,800 net per month. I’d live in a city where I already own an apartment (with a €250 monthly mortgage). The cost of living is manageable, and I’d be close to family and friends. However, career growth might be slower.
	2.	Option 2: Relocate to the Netherlands, earning €3,100 net per month (potentially €3,500 if I qualify for the 30% tax ruling). Living costs are significantly higher, and I’d need to cover rent (~€1,000), insurance, and transportation, but the role offers international experience and career growth in a niche industry.

I don’t have major personal obligations (no partner/kids), and I’m open to new challenges. My Romanian mortgage will still need to be paid if I move.

What I’m Wondering:
	•	Is €3,100 net enough for a comfortable life in the Netherlands, factoring in higher living costs and my Romanian mortgage?
	•	Would it be wiser to stay in Romania with lower costs but slower career growth?
	•	For anyone who’s relocated for work, how do you weigh the higher costs against better career opportunities abroad?

1hcz3na,Stepping Out (?),"Hiya! To start off, I've been working in my customer service job for almost 1.5 years now. I started as an inbound agent for 8 months, working rotational 11-hours shifts with unfixed 3-day offs. Thankfully, I am now off the phone and working as a chat support. Being on the chat queue is so much more comfortable. 2 shifts only, either from 10-7 or 11-8, fixed days off, no rush queue most of the time. However, it pays less in comparison to the inbound and the metrics are somewhat harder to meet, but I can manage to do well most of the time as a stutterer. Honestly,  working on the chat support has saved me a lot of anxiety and speech blocks! 

Now, I feel like I am stuck with this job. No improvement, just secure income and relatively comfortable working conditions for me as a stutterer. So, I've been applying for different roles here and there just to prepare myself for the job market in case I quit or got fired. That way I would have some sort of experience in a field that I can grow in. I'm not very career-orinted, but I want to seek security and some time for myself. As I work according to another country's laws, time zone, holidays, etc. I've  mainly applied for HR-related jobs, particularly in recruiting to be more specific, alongside teaching, knowing that it will pay much less in return for the experience that I will gain (hopefully). Recently, I have received two job offers.  

-1st offer: A role at a very small startup office providing recruiting services for other companies.
PROS: It’s near home, would likely be a good first step into the HR field, and offers medical and social insurance.
CONS: It feels like another call center job, the pay isn’t very rewarding, and it requires working 6 days a week.

2nd offer: A remote job as a language teacher.
PROS: Flexible hours (full-time or part-time), and I enjoy teaching.
CONS: It’s also a 6-day workweek, the pay is lower, and there’s no medical or social insurance.

I feel torn between leaving my secure customer service job and jumping into the unknown. I’m unsure if it’s truly worth it. As I mentioned, I’m not career-oriented and don’t have any bills to pay, but I’m thinking about the future and these two job offers. I’ve been rejected more than 30 times for similar roles because I lack the required experience. Should I sacrifice my current job for one of these opportunities or keep applying, hoping for a better offer? I can’t help feeling ungrateful for doubting or rejecting what I’ve been hoping for all along.

About six months a month ago, I was promoted and transferred locations. I was going great for about a month then my immediate supervisor we can call him (Hank). Hank then stopped doing his job and started making me to it everything, as well as showing up late almost everyday.

I brought everything that Hank does up to my manager of the location and they talk to him but it only changes for about a week each time and then goes back to that way he was acting.

I asked my manger about a month ago for a transfer and she said she would work on it. But each time I ask for an update she says nothing is available or she is still working on it. 

One of the only opportunity she found for me, the other manger hasn’t reached out to me for a “interview” or information from me 


So since there has been no update from my manger I started to look elsewhere and just got an interview at another company for a better paying and higher position, but they don’t offer the same benefits.

My wife has told me that need to think about everything before I leave my current company. But the way they ignore what Hank does and won’t give me an opportunity to transfer I don’t know at this point.

1hcyhqe,Should I hand in my notice?,"Ok so for context I have worked where I have worked for six years, enjoyed a pretty good time, made loads of good connections and earned a couple of promotions.

About a year and a half ago we had a reshuffle and everything just changed. I retained a manager position but my whole team underneath me changed, which meant the quality wasn’t the same, and the workload was x8 (literally). 

I gave it a good go but about 6 months ago I got really bad, I’m drained all the time, anxious from head to toe most days, I’m always getting sick and ill and everything is pretty overwhelming. I guess the whole grind just beat me down and I probably should have left then but stupidly I thought things would change. I got asked to basically sack off a couple members of the team (which was horrible as one clearly had mental health issues). My work quality decreased like maaaad and my productivity went down the chute. I probably shoulda been off sick, but my boss convinced me to stick it out.

I moved back home for a bit to see if it helped improve my morale, but really it only seems to have made it worse.

My boss is constantly criticising me these days and treating other people in the team with higher esteem, who in my opinion have a much smaller workload and much less to do. 

Over the last 3 months direction has been pretty confusing, work has been churning, but still nothing is quite right. 

Then the other week I dropped a ball on a project and I basically got written up for it. I accept the mistake, but I truly think that given a bit clearer direction I would have made it a priority (amongst 47482 other priorities)

I was determined to make it work, but since then random bits of work that I don’t remember agreeing to are getting brought up, I’m feeling uncomfy in my own skin in the office, and I feel like I want to take up as little space as possible.

I was once good at my job. This last year has been hell. I feel like I’m getting shafted either way and I’d rather do it on my own terms. 

My notice period is 3 months. I reckon I could get another job by then.

1hcyetb,Coldly rejected in the final stage,"A year ago, I was a UX intern at big tech. At the time, new positions were frozen, and my management didn’t allow me to switch to teams with opportunities for full-time positions. So, I left the company and went on to work as a UX designer elsewhere. I already had prior experience and years in UX; I took the internship because I was in college and simultaneously part of a UX scholarship program with other big tech (not a problem).

Since leaving this company, I’ve received invitations from former colleagues and friends to reapply, sending me job openings, but I wasn’t interested. That changed when they sent me a Senior UX position. Currently, I’m a Senior UX designer at another company, so I applied mainly to test my abilities but ended up genuinely interested in the role.

I passed the HR screening, presented two portfolio cases in the second stage, completed the third stage with the technical challenge (which I thought I wouldn’t pass—but I did), and reached the final stage: an interview with the hiring manager. Honestly, the interview went great (unless they faked it exceptionally well, which seems unlikely).

Two days later, I received a cold message from HR saying they wouldn’t move forward with me and had chosen other candidates. But there were only four stages.

Does anyone know what might have happened? Why was I rejected in the final stage?

I don’t have bad credit, no legal cases against me, nothing like that. My boyfriend thinks it might be because I left the company as an intern a year ago, and they didn’t want to bring me back for a senior role, but I’m not sure.

This has triggered feelings of guilt and inadequacy, and I just wish I had a bit more clarity about what happened.

One day, I got a call from a recruiter at a competitor. They wanted to talk about a job that I used to have and was really good at. But that job is a long way behind me now. After talking to the recruiter and all my experience, she realized that I’m pretty special and unique to her client.



I had an interview with the VP of IT, and he quickly figured out that I’m an industry expert with a lot of experience in IT. So, I went through a series of phone interviews and then was invited for a site interview.



The on-site interview was a bit weird. I met with the HR person, the VP, and then I was put in an office to have the rest of the interviews on teams. It was a long drive, and I only had two hours of face-to-face meetings and then teams meetings. That was strange.



A week later, I got a call from the VP, and he said that I wasn’t qualified for the job we were talking about. That was surprising because I’ve been clear about my qualifications and how well I can learn. His main problem was that I didn’t have a PMP certification.



He went on to say that this opportunity wasn’t going to work out, but they thought I was really valuable in the industry and IT. They wanted to create a new role for me. Over the next few months, I heard from them about this new role, and each time we talked, it seemed to get better and better.



Two weeks ago, I got the call. I had an offer for this role that was made just for me. When I got the job description, it indicated a director-level role but wasn’t.  I was for 25K less than my current salary (which they knew), I had three weeks of PTO (which I currently have five), and I had to move with in 30 days.

  
When I asked about relocating, they said I could choose from five locations: two on the east coast, two in the Midwest, and one on the West Coast. I asked if I chose the West Coast location, how many of my direct reports or business contacts would be there. They said zero. So, if I moved to this site, I’d be on Teams meetings all day. I pointed that out, and they said they understood, but we’re an old-fashioned company that believes in on-site work. In-office work isn’t really an issue for me, so I asked about the relocation package. It was just three pages of ‘we don’t cover this.’



\- No house hunting costs

\- No help selling or buying a home

\- No temporary living arrangements

\- No shipping of vehicles

\- We’ll provide a trailer, and you’ll pack up all your belongings and load it on the trailer. They’ll have a driver pick up the trailer, take it to your new location, and you’ll unload it. If you have more stuff than can fit on the trailer, you’ll have to figure out how to get your goods there. This is all that will be provided.



\- We won’t gross up your salary so you’ll be taxed on this.



I was shocked by the offer and the ‘relocation package.’ Then I looked at the benefits, and the insurance costs were twice as much, the 401K match had a smaller match and a longer vesting period.



I couldn’t believe it. I told the recruiters that based on my research of publicly available job postings, the job was paying 30K less than the bottom of the pay scale, and those roles had less responsibility. Plus, with the bad benefits and the joke of a relocation package, this is a non-starter. Five months to get to this.

  
The recruiter mentioned that they expected to negotiate, so I told them to bump up my salary by 25K, give me the PTO for a 20-year employee, and arrange for a professional move (they’ll pack and load the truck). In return, I’ll take care of selling my house and looking for a new one. I made it clear that I’ll be responsible for the higher mortgage due to interest rates, which is around 10K a year. 



The recruiter was totally on board with my concerns and went straight to the employer.



Their initial response was, “That’s awesome! It wasn’t a ‘no,’ so this is a great starting point for negotiation.”



Their second email was, “We’ll increase your salary by 5K to 20K below your current salary, increase your PTO to 4 weeks, and make sure you understand that this move is like a professional move. You just need to pack all your belongings and load them onto the trailer, and we’ll take care of getting them to your new home. So its basically the same thing”



I quickly told the recruiter, “Listen, I’m not thrilled with my current situation, but I’m not going to take a 20K pay cut, losing a week of PTO, losing 2% of my immediately vested 401K match, paying 50K to sell my house, taking on an additional mortgage payment of 10K a year due to interest rates, and dealing with higher medical costs for less coverage. This is insane! They would never think someone would do this.”



Five months of hard work and negotiation, and I think I managed to dodge a bullet on this one.

1hcxtt7,Feeling Stuck in My Career After Two Degrees—What Should I Do Next?,"Hi everyone,



I’m in my early 30s, and I’m feeling lost and overwhelmed in my career. I wanted to share my story and seek advice or even just start a discussion about similar experiences.



I have an architecture degree from a top 5 global university, but to be honest, I struggled a lot and barely made it through. After graduating, I ended up at a small boutique consultancy where I mainly did basic, mundane work—definitely not the career leap I had imagined.



Hoping to turn things around, I pursued a second master’s degree in real estate from a top 20 university. This time, I excelled academically and thought I’d finally found my niche. But now that I’ve landed a job as a development manager, I feel completely out of my depth. The responsibilities are overwhelming, and I can’t shake the feeling of being incompetent.



In this role, I’ve mostly been doing administrative tasks, which hasn’t helped me build much relevant experience. I feel like I don’t have the skills to handle a “real” job in development or real estate, yet I also feel too old to go back to the drawing board with an internship or entry-level role.



For some context, I’ve realized that while these degrees are prestigious, they don’t necessarily equip you with real-world, practical skills. They’re more like a ticket to get your foot in the door, but once you’re there, it’s sink or swim.



Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Am I too old to start over, and if not, what’s the best way to gain confidence and relevant skills at this stage of my career?

1hcxo4r,Bad work environment or am I being set up to fail?,"Graduated earlier this year, been working in my job now for 6 months. At first it was great, got plenty of training, had ample time to complete all my work.

They seemed to very quickly lose interest in training me, and I never figured out if it was because they thought I was competent enough, gave up on me, or just didn't have time to properly train me. I'm still expected to complete tasks but I'm given very little guidance or help on them.

On top of that my workload is massive, I'm working 10 hours unpaid overtime every week and there's still stuff I'm not included in. I'm stressed all the time, and struggle to keep everything under control. Due to this massive workload I've made more mistakes than I'd like, every time it's because it was either a task I wasn't trained on and was just thrown in on the deep end with minimal guidance, or I was just so busy I couldn't devote enough attention to it.

I tried casually mentioning these issues to my manager but he just kind of brushed it off. Yet, at the same time he's been more and more getting onto me about mistakes I'm making - which is stressing me out even more; I feel like I have to preform perfectly but I'm in an environment where that's impossible

1hcvs9q,Regretting my choice to study engineering,"Hi everyone,

I'm a first-year biomedical engineering student, and I feel like I chose the wrong path. The subjects that interest me most and that I've always been good at are biology, chemistry, and everything relating to the two. Now, as you all probably know, engineering is mostly math and physics-based, both of which I've never been particularly good at and never really cared about. 

The reason I chose to study engineering in the first place is that I didn't like the idea of working as a doctor, but I still wanted something that related to the medical field. The problem is that I'm now realising just how much harder the physics and maths aspects are than I expected, and I'm now finding myself thinking about how happier and how much better I'd be doing academically had I chosen something more biology and chemistry-based.

 I've seen some posts on Reddit about people who studied/want to study medicine but not work as doctors, and it seems like that is a valid option. As I said I'm not interested in working as a doctor, I'm more drawn to laboratory work and research. I would like to hear opinions and advice if anyone here has any to offer, and any help would be greatly appreciated :) ",cherrycherrykillkill,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1734038569,2024-12-12 21:22:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hcvs9q/regretting_my_choice_to_study_engineering/,12,2024
1hcvr8l,Am i (21F) being harassed by my male coworker (38M) ?,"So there is this colleague at work (38M) who keeps making inappropriate jokes to me (21F) constantly when we're alone. He seems so serious that I don't even know if these are jokes anymore or if this is harassment and he's really expecting something from me.

The other day he said Let's make babies together. Naturally I thought that was a joke, and i forced myself to laugh and said no, and then he said ""why not ?"" and he kept saying this for the next 2 hours with a serious face and he said many times he was being serious. So I decided to play the game so that he would stop and i said ""If you can do me a favor (basically asking him to help me with something for work) then okay"". I was obviously saying this as a joke but he said ""okay let's do this"" and he was preparing for a hand shake. When I said ""no it was a joke"" he said ""See, you're not even capable, there are just words with you, but no actions"".

Once when I asked another colleague what I had to do (it was work related) he replied (even if i wasn't talking to him but to another colleague) that I had to t*** myself. Many times he made inappropriate allusions like he asked me if I preferred when it was slow or violent, or when it was big or small. He saw those questions made me very uncomfortable but kept asking them repeatedly in a serious way.

Once he told me I was definitely his type, and he kept saying that for 30 minutes and asked me if he was my type and what he had to change about himself to be my type. I took it as a joke but he seemed so serious and he wouldn't change topic. 

He also asked me what he had to do to get a date with me and I replied in a jokingly way because I was taking it as a joke, but he kept asking me the question saying that he wanted a serious answer. He got mad at me for not giving him a serious answer.
And when he asked me if I wanted to go on a date with him (which I took as a joke) I obviously said no, he kept telling me i was mean and then stopped talking to me for days.

Once he helped me with some work when I didn't even ask, and he asked me to kiss him on the cheek as a thank you, but when I said no repeatedly he said i was ungrateful, started giving me the silent treatment and he got mad at me for days. He then did that each time he helped me.

The weirdest thing is that he's only like that when we're alone but when there are other people he's behaving in a respectful way.

And each time I took these as a joke he seemed hurt which makes me very confused and leads me to doubt these were only jokes. 

Am I being harassed or is this just me being overreacting to men's bad humor ?

1hcv99n,Dealing with a perpetually anxious and overreaching manager ,"Hi all. Requesting advice on how to handle a manager who is always getting in my work and doing some tasks for me. She steps in out of a sense of urgency, despite the tasks not being time-sensitive. I know she's angling for a promotion and trying to show just how much she's able to do.



I work in finance, to keep it vague. My role has client-facing responsibilities, so I deal with them directly. Yesterday, one of my clients flagged a particular deliverable had been fulfilled twice. I took a closer look. My manager had done it, and not even notified me. She's also been positioning herself as the point for a lot of my clients audit meetings.



I've been dealing with this since May. I've talked to her. I've talked to the manager we \*both\* report to. We all agree to stay in our own lanes. We agree that we all need to communicate more. Give more heads up here and there. Do check-ins. Move around work on a group trello. I do all of that in an effort to manage up. She gets anxious that I'm ""taking too long"" or might have ""too much on my plate"" -- even though I get work done on time, well ahead of schedule, and juggle heavy loads well.



At what point is managing up ineffective? I'm having to change everything about my workflow, communication style/frequency, and priorities just to work with her style. I don't know what else to do. It's my annual review next tomorrow with our team lead (different from the manager we both report to), and I'm trying to figure out how to bring this up. How should I approach this?

1hct8u8,Need Career Advice: ML/DL Research Engineer with 5 Years on One Project,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for genuine advice and insights from this community about my career situation. I’ve been working as an ML/DL Research Engineer for the past five years at the same organization. During this time, I’ve worked exclusively on a single project. While this project has been challenging and fulfilling in many ways, I’m now considering a job switch, and I’m feeling quite overwhelmed and unsure about the next steps.

Here’s where I stand:

1. My current experience is heavily tied to the work I’ve done on this one project.

2. I have no hands-on experience with emerging areas like Large Language Models (LLMs), Generative AI, or model deployment, which seem to dominate the job market now.

3. Because of this, I lack confidence in applying for jobs, as I feel unprepared compared to what many roles are asking for.

I have a few specific concerns:

1. How will recruiters perceive the fact that I’ve worked on only one project for five years? Will it be seen as a red flag or a limitation?

2. What steps can I take to bridge the gap in my knowledge and skills? How should I approach interview preparation, especially for roles that demand experience in LLMs and model deployment?

3. Are there strategies to showcase the depth of my expertise on my current project while addressing the lack of diversity in my portfolio?


I’d really appreciate any advice, resources, or personal experiences you can share. My goal is to build confidence in my skill set and make a smooth transition into a new role that aligns with current trends in the ML/DL field.

Thank you in advance for your time and insights!

New Role TC: 140k

Current role cons: Pay could be better, I do a lot since it’s a small org, next notable promotion could take a few years

New role pros: company has more prestige, I would be a foundational member of a new team helping build that area from the ground up, compensation is great

New role cons: work life balance (every interviewer has made it very clear that a lot is expected and it moves fast, bad company reviews on Glassdoor (mainly around leadership and culture), also seems like layoffs are more common, the actual work differs slightly from my current role in ways that I don’t like

1hct4wr,"Mental Health, Work Culture, and Finding My True Self","In 2019, I got my engineering degree after 5 years of study after high school. I felt happy and extremely joyful. I immediately got a job at a company and felt amazing that I was going to get a salary and have fun in life. Poor me, I didn't realize there was a dark side to that. I woke up every day at 6 AM and returned home at 8 PM, and rarely 9 PM, meeting and working with toxic colleagues and managers that made my life a living hell. All my managers thought about were project goals, and all my coworkers showed competition. I've always been the kind of person whom everybody likes because I'm sweet and don't like getting involved in problems or talking behind others. But later, I found myself leaning towards that behavior and became somewhat toxic, though not intentionally hurting anyone.

Now, at the end of 2024, I've changed jobs a couple of times and am still working just for the money, not out of passion. My friends are all focused on career evolution and raising their salaries. At this moment, I've realized it's all about me, and if I'm not considering career evolution or a salary raise, that doesn't make me less of a person. Everyone should make their own choices. I don't want to work long hours just to be called a Manager. I am a Manager now, and my job requires me to be 100% focused and work extra hours, but this is not who I am. I'm the kind of person who is interested in culture, meeting new people, talking... I want to work fewer hours, do a job, and go out enjoying the weather, having coffee... and not be stuck in a company with toxic people. I should also mention that I used to take antidepressants for 3 years.

1hcsvia,What should I do to proceed about this background check?,"I am a newgrad and received an offer at a company (so I cannot change my resume anymore). On my resume, one of the things I wrote is that I had a research/data internship at a different company (“C1” let’s say). However, I was a research assistant in a research program for a school, under a PhD. The PhD worked directly with C1 for the research project, and I directly worked on the project as well. But, I directly worked for the PhD (the PhD was my lead/manager), and I was paid by the research program, not by C1. 

However, on my resume, since I worked on the project for C1, I wrote C1 as the organization instead of the research program (since the project was for C1, not for the school). What do I do? If I can tell them to contact the PhD, I have no problem as I worked under him, but I’m afraid my name may not show up on C1’s records should they search C1 instead.

1hcsebl,Changing desired salary after initial interview?,"I’m in CS, and the job market for new grads like me is very bad at the moment. Knowing this, I lowballed myself saying 100k in San Jose, CA. However, after looking at glassdoor (I really should have looked before my first interview, but I didn’t expect them to ask about salary so early), this company usually pays 145k+ for CS 0-1 yoe in this location, and above-market salary is pretty much the only good thing employees have to say about it (boring work with terrible WLB and long hours).

I’m in the interview process for 4 other companies at the moment which I have decent shots at, but no offers yet. I also told this company I’d be able to start early January, so the timeline is tight enough that I can’t really wait for competing offers either.

I’m thinking of asking for 130k instead, should I do it or how should I go about it?

1hcs19p,Salary increase - when to ask?,"Hey, I have a small issue at my work. Overall it is great, I work for a big corporation and atmosphere is great. I work from home so its also a big plus. But I was informed that Im going to get a big part of my salary less for half of the year because of tax reasons. I used to be paid differently so I was not aware of it when I was recruited - they told me how much Im gonna get every month (after taxes) and I agreed on it. On the agreement the amount was before taxes but I didn’t find it suspicious. Now I feel a bit cheated because I told them how much after taxes is satisfying for me. If they knew that Im gonna get less for part of the year their offer should be adjusted to that. 

I am doing a good work and I get very positive feedback. I already got job offers from other places and I am tempted to go on these interviews even tho I am sad about it. Before that information I was truly happy here but the lower salary makes me feel like it was a mistake to leave previous job… I also didn’t get any serious talk about promotion options and I feel like this topic is avoided as much as possible. I informed shyly my manager that this change makes me unhappy but it was cut off nicely. 

Should I wait it out next year and observe or directly ask for a raise? Especially that we closed this year. Im very bad with money talks when it comes to me, I always tell myself that I don’t deserve it etc. But this time I really feel like I make a big change in my team and with all resposibilities and additional things I do my situation should be considered.

Had applied for a job posting on a job portal and received a call from HR today asking about my expectations and my availability/ feasibility to work night shifts. 

When I enquired about the working hours, they stated it being 11-8pm but they get extended alot during project deadlines which I'm assuming would be quite often. 
They're a studio working with films and ads located in Andheri near the yellow line metro so even though the commute itself isn't an issue, i really don't know how to go about this, considering I don't know how late the workshifts might be extended for. 
I've been freelancing all these years so technically it'd be my first job so the salary negotiation also feels tricky. Living with my family too. 

Is it ideal to work in this setup, I'll be visiting their studio tomorrow for a test/interview. Any tips on navigating through this?

1hcrgvl,Where to go from OM ?,"Hi ! I (35f) worked for 6 years as an Office Manager ; Exec Assistant ; Admin Assistant, etc. in Canada and before that I worked in the show business for a few years (differents jobs such as artist driver, production etc.) in Europe. I have different Art and Art Management degrees.

I have a proposal to do an Office Relocation mission for 8 months (only handling the move of a company, instead of their OM doing it). I need to find an office, help negotiate it, than probably handle design, repairs, moving people and furniture. Then I could probably manage that new office.

My priorities have shifted as I’m a new mom, so being in office 5d/w and losing 10hs in the subway is less appealing but I guess I could get used to it (I didn’t mind before).

I’m mostly wondering where I can go « up »  from those jobs ? Head of admin ? Chief of staff ? Assets management ? Operations ? How to reach that ?

Not sure those jobs are my passion but I like meeting people, doing research, making deals and solving problems, things that you do everyday as an OM, but I feel like my « do whatever it takes » attitudes plays against me as people see me more as the fixing toilets and coffee machine person, while I saved the company a potential 2M$ in loss by proposing and implementing a policy while I was the only one doing HR...

Working the drive through window, 2. Working inside at a desk. When you first start you only work at the window, then after a month they move you to the inside to learn the rest. Our boss refuses to let my friend move from the window even though it’s been 4 months. She still doesn’t know how to do MOST of the basics and whenever I suggest she take over the work I was starting and I would take drive through, our manager got upset with me saying “there isn’t enough coverage since she doesn’t know how to do this stuff yet.” Well the last month has been in the 30s and sometimes even lower with snow and wind & the heat in our bank broke. We called the heating place and the part we need to fix our heat is no longer sold in America. So they won’t be able to get the heat fixed until the end of January. My friend being the only one that works the window, is constantly telling our boss how freezing her hands and arms are since there’s no heat and she works at the window and has the drop box right next to her(drop box stays open at all times). Our boss refuses to move her or switch us throughout the day. The boss went out to the store and got a mini space heater and gloves for her but she can’t even use the space heater because it gets too hot near the computer… I feel like this can’t be okay, atleast move us throughout the day so she can warm up at some point.

However I wasn’t doing what I was hired to do, I was doing a loooot for the management, acting as a manager of some sort. Last week I got promoted which is really nice, because it happened way quicker than the “fast track” promotion cycle we have. I had a discuss with my director and he said I totally deserve it and they appreciate my effort yada yada…

The thing is I’m not sure if I should be happy about it. First, there’s only a €95 salary increase on a monthly basis + my title doesn’t make sense. I know it’s just a title but it’s so broad. Quality and Processing Specialist. Wth does that even mean? It sounds made up (or 2 jobs in 1) I don’t know where my career is heading to from this. I’m having a feeling that I’d have to carry the responsibility now for the people my senior and junior, which I was already doing before, but maybe this time it will be more.

For me it feels like they just made it official 🥲 it kinda feels like an insult and I don’t know if my feelings are valid towards this. On the other hand I wanna slap myself cause hey come on, I got a promotion right??? I should be grateful. But no, I don’t feel fulfilled at all. 

What could be the next thing for me with this title? And what is something I can do that will make this title sound appealing on my CV and interviews?

I need some wise advice from you guys. I got a job offer so I’m debating if I should change my job or not. The new job is higher position than my current role, and this is the position I have been wanting, but they pay me less than what I make now. Here are pros and cons about the both companies.

Current job
Pros
- been working for 10 years so everyone knows me well
- hours are flexible (i can take any time off for personal appointments or vacation)
- 4 week vacation 
- can attend meetings virtually from home
Cons
- no growth 
- have to work in the evenings (until 7pm) 3 times a week
- have to drive alot around the city 

New job
Pros
- has growth in the company 
- has new things to learn
- no working in the evening. Done at 4:30 sharp
- higher position than current role
- don’t need to drive alot
Cons
- no working from home
- less salary 
-hours may not be as flexible 

What do you think I should do? If I’m thinking of my growth, changing company should be a better choice but they pay me less. Is it not a smart move if i change the company with less pay? I have asked for higher salary but they rejected my request. I appreciate any advice! Thank you!

I've been applying for various roles but I always ended up getting rejected.

A lot of people suggested that I start preparing for CAT and get an MBA which doesn't sound bad either. While others suggest that I get into programming - pretty decent with programming languages and DSA's. I used to learn programming just for fun in my free time.

My concern is... Let's say:

1) I sit and start prepyfor CAT. Hypothetically, let's assume, I don't end up doing well then I'm doomed because I would've wasted 2 years.

2) I can go shapring my skills and getting better at programming and apply for jobs in the IT sector - this would take at least 5-6 months - but I've read and heard a lot how difficult it is for freshers to get a job in tech roles.

1hcmw4h,I feel addicted to coding and can’t seem to enjoy anything else in life. How do I find balance?,"I’m completely obsessed with coding. I love solving technical problems, building projects, and learning new technologies. It’s such a big part of my life that I even dream about coding — and sometimes I wake up with solutions to problems I was stuck on.

The thing is, coding feels more rewarding than anything else. I get way more dopamine from coding than from playing video games, watching movies, or even hanging out with friends. I’ve tried to enjoy other activities, but I often lose interest halfway through. For example, I’ll start a movie but end up pausing it to watch tutorials on Udemy or YouTube instead.

While I love coding, I feel like I’m missing out. I see people around me traveling, playing games, building relationships, and just “living life” — and I can’t help but feel some FOMO. But at the same time, I don’t have much interest in those things compared to coding.

Has anyone else experienced this? How do you find balance between your passion for coding and other aspects of life? I’m not sure how to step away or if I even want to, but I also don’t want to regret missing out on other parts of life.",Natural_Acadia_1435,0,0.5,9,1734015539,2024-12-12 14:58:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hcmw4h/i_feel_addicted_to_coding_and_cant_seem_to_enjoy/,12,2024

Design Director at a creative agency. 

Have hit my career progression ceiling at current agency, who does not see me as a “creative director” for whatever reason. I’m not sure I disagree, tbh. 

Could go be a CD at a different, less respected place, but eh what’s the point?

Particularly based on the fact that I spend all my time fighting for help and dealing with finance team. I’m not sure I ever set out to be a middle manager. 

If I didn’t contribute another dollar to our 401k, we’d be fine. 

I have an opportunity to take a demotion to senior designer at a smaller agency, doing work that I’ve always wanted to try doing.

I am planning my escape but I need a job for financial reasons. How do I approach this review? Here is the situation.

Being a start up there are no processes and unrealistic expectations.
They have not hired enough management that can help with the tougher questions.
This is a highly demanding workplace with tight deadlines, we work excessively for certain periods and there is no consideration for burnout.
Management are quick to harp on any issues where you may have not been as responsive as they would like. Also while not recognizing the work that was done.
This is also a remote workplace and there are at least 4 different ways they expect you to communicate with them (slack,email, project management system, meetings). If you put your information in the project management system, that is not considered enough.
There are way too many softwares to manage. This is also supposed to be a tech firm. 
Management thought it was a good idea to send

1hcjvgt,Feeling guilty regarding jobs,"Hi all,
I work in a very stable position and have a job interview for another very stable position (but different organisation). In my current role I expressed interest in progression and was supported, and I love the work I do, but this other role provides a lump sum to move ($$$), the pay matches my current pay, and it will move me to a more affordable area. 

I am struggling with the idea of taking the job (if successful) due to not wanting to burn bridges, the effort they have put into me and their openness to progression, plus I know what I do and am confident and capable. But this other job will help me get a real start at life; afford a house, another step towards being able to start a family, etc. 

I am worried come time for references that I will burn the bridges, get bad references, and then be in an awkward position for both roles.

I've already started onboarding process and the mandatory checks are being made which I will pass, I want to take the closer job can I just called the manager and explain the situation express my gratitude for the offer and the time taken and withdrawn myself?

The company is going through a major restructure. Unfortunately, I was told that I wasn’t successful in getting my original role and am being redeployed to a team member position, a few level down. 

My performance has never been an issue, and I’ve received no prior feedback that would suggest I was lacking in any skills. I’m feeling really blindsided and hurt by this whole process.

Redundancy is not an option because technically a job is offered. The thought of continuing in the company after all this feels difficult, I’m struggling with feelings of defeat and confusion about what to do next.

1hcipd1,Asking for PIP Advice - Help,"Hello everyone,

I just joined this group after looking for advice online. I'm based in EU-Czechia and for the first time in my career, I've been given a warning of a less serious breach of obligations, and a PIP (personal improvement plan) at the start of this week.

However, I do not see my company wanting to continue with our partnership, even if I am successful on this plan. The project for the new system that I was hired for, has been cancelled after a year and I do not see me fiiting anywhere else in the company. Furthermore, they try to create friction in almost every aspect of my current work. In general, they try to create problems, where there is none. I recognize that I made a mistake, in underestimating their request in one project and I made a bad presentation but I did my best and covered it with the next one. Other than that, I haven't made any serious mistake. To my eyes, they're just trying to get rid of me, as there has been no discussion prior to the warning with the manager. Sure I got negative feedback for the first presentation but I covered it with the next one and from my experience one mistake should not be enought for a warning. I'm having a 121 with my manager next week and I'll clear the situation on how he sees my role in the company's future (my feeling is that they'll close it).

I'm concerned now though, because I was told that the PIP will show in a public online service and it's one of the worst thing the company could have done to me.

Does anyone know if this is true? Will I be able to cancel the whole situation by submitting my resignation next month?

Thank you in advance for your advice/help.

Fast forward months later realizing the company was into extreme satanic cult things and watchl things. Different Job finding out my accounts Got hacked through coworkers/rumors so ex company could cover up false allegations about time at company.

Ended up leaving said Job due private information being leaked to coworkers from psychotic ex boss.

Took another break for a couple of months. While looking for new Job with lack for association with cult company, somehow realized companies interviewing at knew about said experience even though it was never mentioned.

Got hired at another job association with ex cult company known before and without mention of it. Looked into considering legal action for stalking/BL ... experience very similar at new company as last company

Few months go by got drugged.... had a near death experience then realized ex workers were using witchcraft on me and was into some govwl stuff. People that I knew including family began to act weird etc.

Had a series or weird dreams about ex manager using voodoo on me and trying to take my soul.

Fast-forward realized my gmas husband is a closet voodoo priest in the church who had been using witchcraft on me through another dream I had when I was about 19/20 before they met. Realized my ex boss is also into witchcraft and had been befriending coworkers , spreading, rumors, and also leaked nudes to cowokers to pretty much blk/l me. Found out him and my gmas husband was in on it with him to do a des,sw with a female coworker(3 Gen at comapny) and ex company management in department (ex boss, few other managers as well) was in on it prior to me leaving the company...

1hchllb,Counter offer conundrum,"Designer that left a big fancy company 5+ years ago to work for a friend's small 10 person company. It has struggled since the beginning, and I haven't had a raise or bonus in the last few years, leading to a salary that's about 40% below market. In addition, I'm not in love with the type of work we're doing, though everyone's goal is to do more interesting stuff - it just hasn't worked out yet. However, I love and respect the people I work with, and the schedule is quite flexible. 

Early this year the salary issue became too much. More then just the dollar amount, there seemed to be a complacency among ownership that everything would work itself out of they stayed in the game long enough. To their credit, they funded the business out of pocket and never laid anyone off, but I also felt like they weren't doing everything they could to generate business, and that their employees were regularly working harder than them. I felt, in effect, like their easygoing nature made the job easy but established a low ceiling. So I started looking. I got a couple of offers and recently accepted a less flexible corporate position doing work I'm interested in for at- market salary. I have kids so this is meaningful!

Over the same period, things finally started to click for the company, and it looks like we'll finally turn a profit this year, with next year looking even better. Part of that can be attributed to the owners business development efforts, part to mine, and part to luck. They actually initiated salary adjustment discussions this month, before I'd told them I'd accepted a new job. They instantly raised my salary to essentially match the new offer when I told them, asked me to stay, and made promises about providing equity and profit sharing agreements such that I'd stand to gain about 40% more again than the new offer provides IF this current profitability becomes the new normal.

I never really anticipated this scenario so it took some time to process. Then I told them to provide guarantees in writing re equity. They are trying to figure this out for multiple employees at once and asked for more time to do this. So I said if they'd beat the new offers base salary by 10% now then I'd stay and we could re negotiate compensation when they have their act together. They're balking at this and are asking if we can do essentially a re signing bonus. 

I'm supposed to start the new job next week and am really struggling with the decision. 

Realistically, if I had been making my current salary all along, I probably wouldn't have accepted the new role. That said, I probably would have left eventually anyway, and will still keep looking even if I re-up. That feels icky because I am still friends with the owners, and the other employees are badasses. 

So: do I cynically accept a counter offer at a job I don't love with people that I care about for another year to get a shot at my first real payout, or do I leave now and get into a position where I can take a more objective view of things, even if the short term upside is lower?

They instantly raised my salary to essentially match the new offer when I told them, asked me to stay, and made promises about providing equity and profit sharing agreements such that I'd stand to gain about 40% more again than the new offer provides IF this current profitability becomes the new normal.

I never really anticipated this scenario so it took some time to process. Then I told them to provide guarantees in writing re equity. They are trying to figure this out for multiple employees at once and asked for more time to do this. So I said if they'd beat the new offers base salary by 10% now then I'd stay and we could re negotiate compensation when they have their act together. They're balking at this and are asking if we can do essentially a re signing bonus. 

I'm supposed to start the new job next week and am really struggling with the decision. 

Realistically, if I had been making my current salary all along, I probably wouldn't have accepted the new role. That said, I probably would have left eventually anyway, and will still keep looking even if I re-up. That feels icky because I am still friends with the owners, and the other employees are badasses. 

So: do I cynically accept a counter offer at a job I don't love with people that I care about for another year to get a shot at my first real payout, or do I leave now and get into a position where I can take a more objective view of things, even if the short term upside is lower?

1hchgjk,Should I stay in my company or leave?,"Hi, I am currently student who’s in a dilemma. To describe my situation, I am currently on leave from the company that I work in, as I am currently interning in the other company until February 2025. I have been told that I can come back after my internship and continue to work as a student worker, until I finish my masters degree which is in summer 2025. 

I like the culture and social aspect of the company that I work in as a student, however I have been working on a lot of PowerBI for the most part which I am not a fan of. As I stand to finish my education in 6-7 months, I have therefore been looking for a full time position, where I expect to have some interviews next month for the positions that I applied for. Out of curiosity, I also applied for another student worker position. I did not think much of it at the time, but it is a small consulting firm that works with Powerapps, PowerBI, and other Microsoft applications. I recently got told that this consultancy firm now wants to hire me for a part time position, and now I am very unsure of the following: Should I quit my student worker job that I am on leave from, and join the consultancy firm? Or should I say no to the offer? 

The reason why I am unsure is for several reasons. First is the social aspect which plays a part for me, as they only have one other student. Also, it may get technical, where I prefer to act as more of a “bridge between business and IT”, if that makes sense. Additionally I also like the coworkers in my student job, it is just the tasks that I am always a fan of. I may also be able to find an entry level job after I finish, which means that I would most likely only stay in this consulting firm for 5-6 months at most, if I don’t stay in the firm and decide to accept an entry level job offer from a different company.

1hcghid,Physics Major to Philosophy ,"I'm a 3rd (going into 4th) year physics student and I'm considering changing my major.

This was my first year at uni that I had absolutely no elective classes and I have been SO miserable. I miss the humanities so much, and I particularly miss philosophy and law. At this point I feel like I don't fit the major, but I still have a great interest in physics. I've realized that I don't really want to do research or engineering post-grad, and I know this decision is coming late, like really late, but I'm considering changing my major to philosophy, or speaking with the university to ""create my own major"" and graduate with a Bachelors in Interdisciplinary Studies, as some of my friends have done. I can't imagine this is very employable lol but it seems like my heart is calling me.

I guess this post is a bit of a call into the void, as my path doesn't seem very conventional, but does anyone know of any careers or pathways I can start to look at that involve my interest in the natural sciences as well as philosophy or law?

1hcdira,"Kinda new college grad, I want to get a masters degree, but I don't know what I should do it in","Been in my current role for half a year, thinking about sticking it out for at at least another year. Mostly not satisfied with the current work I do and would like to do something more interesting to me. 



Currently I do data engineering and admin automation work for a large company. The work life balance is great, but the pay I am receiving is not amazing. I'm not receiving pay in the range that was advertised on the job posting, but this is my first career after graduating from university. Regardless if my pay increases or not, I'm not in love with what I do and I would like to switch to something else at some point in the future. Some days are really good, others are whatever but leave me daydreaming of other careers. The two degrees I'm considering are data science and electrical engineering.



I'm considering getting a degree in data science as it would open opportunities with higher pay that do very similar work that I currently do. It would allow me to stay at my current company and get into a position doing more of my favorite parts of my job. If I were to do this online I expect it would take me about 2.5 years.



The other option I have considered is that I would like to study electrical engineering. I have no idea how I would go about doing that other than just diving in head first into some projects and somehow learning enough on my own to get into a masters program. Basically I would need to be self taught in about 12 credit hours worth of electrical engineering classes to have a good enough academic foundation to take university classes through Coursera. This switch is something that I wish I had made during my academic career, but it would not have made financial sense. Now I'm thinking that if I don't pursue it I will never have the opportunity to have this as a career. I would think it would take me around 3-4 years to self study and get myself into a master's of electrical engineering program.



I'm not sure if I should bring up getting a master's degree with my manager, but I see other people have pursued them while working at this company. Both degrees would be useful with jobs at my current company.",Manestricker,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1733979120,2024-12-12 04:52:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hcdira/kinda_new_college_grad_i_want_to_get_a_masters/,12,2024

I want to do healthcare because I have a huge interest in humans, the anatomy and overall health, I also find that helping people would be fun too, but all I hear is how miserable it is to work as a nurse, that its underpaid and its traumatizing which I understand. I don't know if I could even handle something like that.

I also find computers really interesting, I think coding and programming is cool, I haven't tried much but there is a class in my school for computer science. I just know that the pay is higher than nursing. That's what I'm worried about

1hcb268,6 years in the same position,"Going to try and make a really long story short.

I worked in retail sales for a certain industry and after many, many years, I got tired of the politics and was offered a position as a vendor to the same industry so my skills and experience transferred.

Great team, WFH, comp plan was fine, basically a dream situation. And it stayed that way for 3 years. Hiring Manager got promoted, new manager came in and basically said we didn’t know how to do our job even though they knew nothing about our service and then doubled our quota to qualify for our bonuses. 

They lasted 6 months after failing and got promoted. 

3rd boss came in and split the difference between the first two but is now also moving on and getting promoted.

Now I’ll add for context, this is the longest in my career I’ve ever held the same position. Always met or exceeded every metric. Never had a bad review. Never been on a PIP.

Shortly before my first HM left I expressed my desire to do more, grow with the company etc. They said I needed to move to another team as there was no upward mobility on my current team. Good on them for being transparent.

Throughout all of the transitions I have made my aspirations and goals clear,and still no movement.

Throughout all this our team was cut in half, our account load was doubled. And with the new transition it’s set to triple.

Our base on our comp plan hasn’t changed. Our bonus structure did but it was flat in terms of dollars in pocket. And with the latest transition about to take place, they’ve said our comp plan will be more in line with other teams but they’ve only said our bonus structure will change.

For reference, if our comp plan were to be brought in line with our counterparts, our base would have to be bumped 40% and all of my previous managers have said we were underpaid.

All this being said I feel it’s time to move on. Am I wrong?",justyntyme098765,2,1.0,0,1733970868,2024-12-12 02:34:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hcb268/6_years_in_the_same_position/,12,2024

My last day is supposed to be this Friday and I’m supposed to start my new job on Monday. Today, they counter offered.

I think I want to stay. The role I’m in now I’m a paralegal. I was offered a paralegal position in a county government office. Ultimately, the position is the same general role- just a different office, different area of law. The pay is the same, health benefits are the same, hours are the same.

Really, I only applied and accepted the job because it’s a government job, and it’s supposed to be better and good to get into? - although honestly, I was expecting the PTO policy to be better (it’s not, it’s less than i currently have at my job now). 

Fast forward to today — my current position offered me more money (which is even more than what i would be making at the gov job by my third year there since those budgets are already published so i can see how much I’d be making up to 4 years from now), a change in my hours, and changing my PTO accrual schedule (they’d put me at the accrual rate that people get at 8 years of service, when right now I’m only at 3 years) so I would be earning 6 more hours a month than i am now. 

I think I want to accept the counter offer. I don’t hate my current job, i don’t hate my coworkers. I just don’t know how to go back to this other offer and rescind my acceptance when I’m supposed to start in 4 days. I know they can’t match what my current employer countered with because they’re tied by county regulations/policies. 

How do I rescind my acceptance? If anyone has experience in government jobs (preferably county?) is it really as great as people make it seem? Am I making a mistake if I do accept the counter offer?

1hc9u7f,Forced to work two jobs,"
Hi everyone,

I have been working at an accounting firm since April of this year as an admin after leaving my last firm due to just the work environment and a bunch of other irrelevant factors.

In saying that, this firm is quite large and the people are really great. I was hired as a “front of house” admin, meaning my desk is in the front area of the office but not directly where clients/meeting rooms/reception is. I am one of the 3 (including reception) admins at this time.

When I got hired I was informed that my job would be covering reception when she goes on her lunch break or if she is unwell and cannot make it in. Thinking that was an anomaly I didn’t mind. However, a week into me starting the receptionist had injured herself (mind you this is during tax season and extremely busy on top of me being brand new) and had to go on leave until about July in which she came back gradually. Once she was back of course she needed to go to follow up appointments and such which I was more than understanding of. 

I was finally able to break the chains of being stuck at reception and was able to do my actual job training. I was more than excited to actually be doing the job I was hired for and that the rough time was over.

Well, I guess the universe just wanted to play a little trick on me. Come August the receptionist told us that she’s applying to a firm wide policy that allows you to go down to a part time work week upon approval from your PM and that she would be taking EVERY Friday off from September to the end of the year (yes, this is still present..). This did not come well to us as for one us admins are allowed to work from home and Fridays were the one day aside from Monday that everyone wanted but given the small group of us, that means only 1 person would be able to at a time. Second, we (and especially me) just covered her EVERY DAY for nearly 4 months straight. I was finally getting my training and now told that I will have to be covering her fully every Friday. It became a whole deal with one on one meetings blah blah to which I just said screw it because she was so hard headed on her opinion and how she’s entitled to it (you’re not) and how she would quit otherwise. Let me preface by saying she’s a great receptionist but I feel like she’s just NEVER here.

Now I’m stuck covering her every Friday since then, I can’t work at home those days which is rough as I have some health issues I’m going through and my doctor is in my city which is a 30 min commute from the office so it’s easier for me to see him when I’m at home and not driving back and fourth. But the biggest part is, I feel like no one is realizing I’m about to burn out and FAST. This time of year is usually dead slow to the point we are all looking for work - however, this year is entirely different and we can all kiss the “slow season” after tax season goodbye. So on top of my already heavy workload and me trying to grow and prosper in my role I’m being hindered because it takes 4-5 hours every Friday for me to even look at my emails. It is FAR too busy for her to be going part time. 

I’m scared to bring it up as I feel like I was told that yes I will be reception coverage in the sense that if she isn’t here on occasion of being sick, an appointment, vacation time booked in advance or such but I am quite literally doing her full time job at least once a week. I can’t even do my job and I feel like I’m failing because I can’t do what I need to do as I’m being pulled away by phone calls, clients walking in, setting up meeting rooms, setting up and cleaning up lunches, me cleaning up after her as she can’t do much do to her injury ext. There is fully a reason why she isn’t trained on what I and the other admins do and that I didn’t get trained until she returned because it is impossible to do that at the front covering reception. 

I can’t take it anymore. This isn’t what I signed up for to have two full time positions at once and I feel like a jerk thinking this but I can’t help it. We thankfully are hiring a new admin in January but I will still be her primary coverage and she has already stated she will be advocating for “her Fridays” next September. I wouldn’t care in all honesty if it wasn’t so busy! Even if she took a Monday, I wouldn’t care and would try and make it work as that gives me Tuesday-Friday to catch up and do my job if Monday hinders me from doing so. 

What do I do?! The worst part, my doctor will be going down to Friday, Saturday and Sunday only appointments for my city and the weekends book up extremely fast with his minimized schedule. I can get some and pre booked as far in advance as I could for tax season, but they’re not always guaranteed which means I will need to ask for Friday as my work from home day come the new year Summer months but how am I to do this.

Please let me know if I sound unreasonable? I just need someone to listen to me about this.",Local_Application_13,1,1.0,3,1733967084,2024-12-12 01:31:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hc9u7f/forced_to_work_two_jobs/,12,2024

The industry has been withering for sometime. Lay offs and no raises or bonuses. It appears unsustainable for the next 30 years of my career. The tough part is that I feel I have no hard, transferable skills. 

I’m looking at different paths in IT or medical. Something that could lead to a decent six figure salary eventually. It seems most would require me to go back to school. Any advice for a path that might not require me to go back to school? Or if so, some direction on what program would be beneficial? Thanks!

1hc923h,Should I tell my manager I think I have ADHD?,"I’ll try to keep this straight-forward. I [24F] have been at my current job for 3 yrs. Today, I received my 2nd written warning. This one had a deadline of 3 weeks to address presenting issues, those issues being I am unable to fulfill the requirements of the position. After posting abt this on Reddit, multiple people suggested I have ADHD. The ADHD assessment with my therapist was inconclusive. Now I need to schedule neuropsychological testing, which schedules many months out. 

After learning I may have ADHD, everything clicked. All of my issues seem with work seem to be linked to these symptoms. I have gathered many coping strategies throughout the years that can and have helped, but never used them consistently because I subconsciously thought “I should be able to do without them”. I was wrong. Since understanding this, I have been able to implement these strategies, which have worked really well, BUT I still need to practice/learn more about what I need, and practice more paying attention and what else helps.

But look, its been three years. To put it very bluntly, i think my boss has been way to understanding while Ive tried to figure out what is wrong w/ me. I would’ve fired me a while ago, but she didn’t, and here we are. Do I want to be fired? No. Main reason? Income.

My job has a LOT of intricacies and, in the end, i think I would be better doing something else. But training for my position takes a rlly long time (everyone at my job has to train for a long time). I want to leave things as tidy as I can for them. Can’t do that in three weeks- too many priorities to address first.

Part of me wants to tell my boss I FINALLY know whats wrong. I now know what I need to do. BUT, if I mention the ADHD, I am concerned they then won’t be able to fire me bc of EEO (Equal Employment Opportunity). These people are very ethical. So, I’m heavily leaning towards keeping this to myself.

Pros to telling my boss I might have ADHD:
- I MIGHT get to keep my job for now
- Maybe accommodations? I have one which has helped
- May be able to update procedures for my job, making it easier on the next person (and on my boss to train them)

Cons:
- My sweet, already burnt out boss needs to deal with more of my b****s***
- They might be afraid to fire me in fears of being sued? (I wouldn’t but these people are very by the book/take the high road)
- I could lose my job in three weeks

Some other points:
- Im already looking for other jobs, and know i am to apply ASAP.
- I dont want to be fired, but think another person would be best suited for the job. I just want to be able to ease that transition and these 3 wks won’t allow for that.

I dont rlly have time to fix grammar or do a TLDR rn. Sorry and ty for any advice you may have.

I got an interview and heard from them an hour later that I would be moved to final interviews. They told me that they were trying to do the hiring process quickly and finish by end of next week (this week now that I’m writing). 

They said the person they had to interview me was available Thursday (which at the time would be the next day) and assured me that if that was too short of notice or I had to study for finals, that I’d be able to interview next week. They said they’d email me by EOD with an update even if it’s an update that they haven’t finalized scheduling yet. Not Wednesday EOD nor Thursday did I hear anything, I decided to call on Friday and it went to voicemail. I left a voicemail with my name and number hoping to hear back again. 

It’s now Tuesday, and I called again to no answer again. I’m kind of unsure on how to proceed because I really wanted this opportunity because it has a work abroad aspect for a new graduate. 

Company info: I’m kind of surprised too because it is a very big company, one of the top 5 biggest in their country, so it’s not like a scam job/position.

1hc7f2y,My boss' wife shows up at our office when he's not there. How do I handle this?,"I work on a very small team and genuinely love my job. My boss and coworkers are great; we work well together, communicate well, and have some similarities in our hobbies that make chatting fun too. However, my boss' wife is a SAHM and has been creeping into our office lately when he isn't there (he occasionally works at another office). 

In the year and a half I've been with the company, she's come in maybe 4-5 times. In the past it's felt like she's checking in on us (we are an all female team, this matters) to make sure we're actually working. We 100% know that he doesn't doubt us at all and would never send her in, but she's made light comments in the past about how we have it easy. He's also mentioned that she makes comments at home that make it seem like she's jealous of us/doesn't think we do much at work. But she has literally no idea what our jobs are, and doesn't listen if we try to talk to her about our work.

Recently she showed up when two of us were out of the office (planned) to drop something off. We got in maybe 5 minutes after her, and she started politely chatting, but the conversation quickly turned to: 

1. a few mentions of us not being there when she arrived and how nice it must be for us to relax all day

2. she's worried about her livelihood due to some transitions in the company/her husband being their only source of income and doesn't trust her husband to make good choices (we assured her that as a team, we check/balance one another)

3. she's considered divorcing him or and already told him he'd have to move out if this goes sideways (not something we want or need to know)

4. she mentioned that he tells their friends/family that she is jealous of the ""girls in the office"" (...there 100% is nothing inappropriate going on between anyone in the office)

5. she was there for two hours telling us about how sick she's been at the thought of her husband potentially losing money/being upset that she doesn't know what happens day-to-day at the company (she does not really have any applicable skills and also probably shouldn't be a part of the business based on all of the above - unprofessional)

My coworkers and I don't know what to do. We're SURE she told her husband all about this conversation as she has no filter or, to be honest, tact. He hasn't said anything yet and may not. We're all hard workers and are in a position where if this company fails, we lose OUR livelihoods, so it's hard not to be annoyed/offended that she thinks we're screwing around and not taking our jobs seriously. 

If she continues coming in and escalating her comments, or if our boss brings up her visit and comments, what's a professional way to state our case: that her coming into the office isn't appropriate and we're uncomfortable with her comments and prying.

We know that it'll probably cause issues in his private life and pit her against us, but it feels like she already doesn't like us and there's no changing her mind. We don't want to jeopardize our jobs, but also don't want to have to cater to her/put her in a position of control, because she is not part of our company. She's the boss' wife.

It takes me a lot longer to understand things and when I'm installing stuff it takes me a lot longer than it should, even for an apprentice.

1hc5e1r,Is accounting still worth it?,"Hey everyone, I’m approaching the end of my gap year and thinking about going to school for accounting. A lot of people in my life have said I’d make a good accountant, and I can see why: I enjoy working with numbers, solving problems, and communicating with people.

At first, I thought I’d like engineering, but I’ve realized I’m not particularly creative or mechanically inclined, and calculus isn’t my strong suit. After working blue-collar jobs for a few years, I’m starting to feel like white-collar work might suit me better—higher pay, less physical wear on my body, and, let’s be honest, having my own desk sounds nice.

I know accounting gets a lot of hate for its work-life balance, drama, and long hours in public accounting, but I feel like these are manageable. My plan is to work hard, pass the CPA exam, put in a few years in public accounting, then transition to industrial accounting for a better balance—ideally remote work and six figures at a company that values me.

Am I missing something? Are there other considerations I should be thinking about? Would love any advice or insights!",Shadocode,1,1.0,1,1733954556,2024-12-11 22:02:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hc5e1r/is_accounting_still_worth_it/,12,2024

I'm 27m and I've just hit a bit of a crossroads in the last year, where I've realized I really made the wrong choice with my degree and career path. 

I currently work a government offie job and I am horrendously bored and uninspired, which is causing me to be quite depressed. This has made me think that I should start a whole new career path.

I have some ideas, but I suffering from lots of brain fog due to the depression and can't really think straight, so I'm here for some career advice.

To note:

* I am NOT good at office jobs/corporate - I've realized over the last 8 years that I'm not this type of person.
* Being in front of computers/screen all day is very tough for me
* I crave social interaction at work
* I like to be moving as I am a very hyper/creative person

1hc483h,"Have an opportunity for a full remote position, but hesitant about it stunting my career? ","So I got my bachelors in electrical engineering, I’m working in solar right now but only making 27 an hour with essentially a 1 hour commute each way on most days. I have another interview lined up and waiting to hear back on another, but fully remote sounds so nice. It would save me 10 hours of commute time a week and maybe I could even become a digital nomad of some sorts and work in Mexico.

I just recently graduated and so my main concern is that it could stunt my growth and learning if I’m not interacting with people, and hyrbid would be the perfect combination but the headquarters are a few hours away.

Also I said I’d be comfortable with a 27-28 dollar an hour pay bc the range was 24-28 so in reality I’d probably only switch jobs for 28 an hour bc i want to shoot for 70-80k a year salary wise. Basically what I’m saying is I would only switch jobs for 28 an hour bc anything less and I would just be job searching again, and I plan to leave my current company as soon as a better job offer presents itself.

Any advice? 

My dream has always been to work remote and I live at home so it’s very doable and cheap, but I’m also partly scared to have that dream. As in what if I like remote so much and getting it so early on in my career would make going in office suck that much more if I needed to in the future lol.

1hc2ybh,How to resign effective immediately,"Hi. Buckle in because this one’s a long one.

Back in June, after graduating college in May I was hired as an office manager/secretary/legal assistant at a small law firm. When I say small - I mean it is only me and the principal attorney that work here.

When I first began the job there was no training given and I was pretty much thrown into a role that consisted of many roles and expected to perform. I’ve done well throughout my past 6 months here and have managed and juggled a variety of things outside my normal job description and what was agreed upon during the interview. 

For starters, my boss is an older guy and is a single father to a young girl. I have always been sympathetic to this as I can imagine raising a child as a single parent is incredibly difficult. He has asked me to babysit here and then - take his kid to birthday parties, dance classes, etc. outside of my normal hours. I agreed to thinking he just needed the extra help here and there. Then his nanny quit and he started asking me to pick up his kid from school during my regular hours, schedule her language lessons, schedule her doctors appointments, make her a YouTube channel and post her videos, etc. This became part of my job without ever being asked or compensated for taking on an extra role that I never agreed to. Additionally, he would ask me if I was available almost every weekend to take his daughter somewhere because he had to work. I started declining these requests.

He also has multiple empty offices at his firm that he has been wanting to rent out. He tasked me with doing this. I created a google ad, Instagram page, meta ads, a website, and listed the rentals on multiple real estate platforms. I also reached out to local bar associations, posted on Facebook groups, and even local universities asking to spread the word. He continues to blame me for the empty offices. Yet I believe and have communicated with him that a broker or real estate agent would be more fit to do this. I’m not a broker and have no experience renting out anything. I have tried my very best to do what I can but I believe this is outside of my job role - to which he disagrees.

Additionally, he also asked me to start a business with him so he could make more money. The business? An OnlyFans Management Agency - to which I told him I have no experience with using OnlyFans in any capacity and therefore I’m not suited to start a management agency that centers around it. There is way more to this that I don’t wish to share. But you can get the gist - it has created an incredibly uncomfortable work environment.

I’ve really needed this stable job and income and have kept quiet about the things that have made me uncomfortable (trust me this is nowhere even near an exhaustive list and there are many worse things that have crossed professional and personal boundaries). I haven’t spoken to my friends or family about it because I didn’t want to admit this job was not working out. 

I had a conversation with him earlier this week about the inconsistencies of what I’m doing and being tasked to do versus what was originally agreed to. I also told him if he expects me to do work related to his daughter, tasks that his nanny would be in charge of if he had one, that I expect to be compensated for that. He laughed at me. He thought it was funny that I thought I deserved to be paid more. He told me he was paying for 40 hours of my time every week. And I told him that I was under the impression I was hired as an office manager/legal assistant for his firm. He then said “maybe this isn’t the right job for you”. Lol no shit. 

He didn’t fire me but he alluded to it. He said he would post a job listing for this role again. And then said he needed time to process our conversation. We have yet to talk about this and I have been coming into work everyday since our conversation. This morning he sent me an email asking me to write instructions on how to access websites I’ve created and other projects I have managed for him. Which I believe to be another email suggesting he’s about to fire me.

I want to quit. And I do not want to put in my two weeks because I have grown incredibly uncomfortable in this environment and frankly feel devalued as a person/employee. Given the circumstances, do y’all believe it’s okay to leave a resignation letter on his desk and via email on Friday explaining that I am quitting effective immediately?

1hc1zb0,I feel disrespected and stuck at my current job. I don’t know what to do ,"Background: I graduated with my Bachelors in Finance in May of 2023. When I was hired as a Credit and collections analyst from a large distributor.

When I was hired, the person who hired me knew that I wanted to be a staff accountant or financial analyst and she said this position would be a stepping stone for me. I received bottom of pay  scale due to no experience in credit & collections, with the promise this would increase once I gain more knowledge. This was in May 2023. 

Since then I have been snubbed out of a my annual raise because I was hired a month late, got no explanation from anyone in my company. Bonus time came around in March 2024, I didn’t get one and didn’t receive any reasons why I didn’t, she didn’t even talk to me about it. Then in the middle of this summer, she stepped down as my lead and to focus more on different departments, and it was transferred to the CFO. Since then I scheduled multiple 1:1 with him, the purpose of these were to discuss my future career growth objectives and my compensation. During my first meeting he said to come back to the raise when we do our normal raises. Our annual reviews were due 11/7, it is now 12/11 and haven’t received word of it. 

I addition to this, my current department lead is retiring at the EOY. With this, I just assumed that once they left I would assume more of a senior position, but that’s not the case. We had a meeting to discuss the structure of the department’s today and I was getting talked over and not listened too, and was told nothing was changing for me. I really found this meeting to be useless and could have been just sent in an email if they weren’t going to listen to my opinions. 

We have been looking for an another person for the past 5 months and haven’t found anyone yet. 

One of our staff accountants is leaving in the middle of December, so there will be an opening. But since we can’t find anyone to fill a position we’ve known would need to be filled since the beginning of the year I don’t think they would let me transfer departments. 

This was my tipping point, I have stupidly stuck it out here for what I mentally feel the longest I can. I have been applying to places in staff accountant/financial analyst jobs and not getting any traction.

I do have an emergency fund where I can cover about 5 months of expenses, so if I need to I can cover but this would be the last thing I would want to do. This is my first corporate job and don’t really have an outlet at work to talk about these with. 

I’m not really sure what I should do. I have a meeting with my CFO next week so I’m going to bring this up.

I was offered a job as an HR Technician today by the city. I had multiple interviews and got along well with everyone, they offer great benefits and the potential to grow in the HR field has me excited. I applied to the role originally due to the large pay range (52k-85k) and my offer letter states the lowest range of salary - $52889 a year.

1hc1gsh,How to handle an anxious and overreaching manager,"Hi all. Requesting advice on how to handle a manager who is always getting in my work and doing some tasks for me. I work in finance, to keep it vague. My role has client-facing responsibilities, so I deal with them directly. Today, one of my clients flagged a particular task had been fulfilled twice. I took a closer look. She had done it. I had gone in a few hours later and done it as well. She's also been positioning herself as the point for a lot of my clients audit meetings. 

I'm losing ground with my own clients because she's relentless. I've been dealing with this since May. I've talked to her. I've talked to the manager we \*both\* report to. We all agree to stay in our own lanes. We agree that we all need to communicate more. Give more heads up here and there. Do check-ins. Move around work on a group trello. I do all of that in an effort to manage up. She gets anxious that I'm ""taking too long"" or might have ""too much on my plate"" -- even though I get work done on time, well ahead of schedule, and juggle heavy loads well. 

I'm tired of the advice being to ""manage up"". I don't know what else to do. I look like a fucking idiot in front of everyone else. I'm not sure how many more times I can bring this up before it becomes a major issue of team compatibility. I really can't afford to be let go, I'm paranoid she's considered more valuable because she can literally do three people's jobs. In an effort to rectify this current snafu, I have to bring it up with \*our\* manager to sort it out. How should I approach this?

1hc12ut,What should I do?,"### Problem/Goal:

I have an issue at work regarding my day off.

### Context:

My work schedule frequently changes. I often find out that my shift has been switched from PM to AM, which surprises me, especially when I had plans on my day off. I received an Incident Report (IR) because I didn’t respond to their messages while I was off. Recently, my days off have even been reduced to just one day per pay period.

### Previous Attempts:

I explained my side, stating that I usually do not check my phone when I’m off because I prefer to focus on non-work-related activities during my time off. Although they acknowledged that I was right, I could not shake the feeling that they only said so to avoid escalating the situation. When I ask for clarification, their responses tend to be repetitive rather than providing clear explanations. My schedule has consistently been adjusted to accommodate others’ needs, which compromises my own work-life balance.",Super-Tie-2027,1,1.0,0,1733943652,2024-12-11 19:00:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hc12ut/what_should_i_do/,12,2024

1hbzurg,"Currently living abroad, working remote, and looking to change careers. ","Originally from the US but I have been living and working in the EU for the past 9 years. I would like to change careers while continuing to live abroad and work remote. I'm in my mid 30's now and I'm looking for a career change but maybe said more specifically, to learn a discipline. Job experience (2-3 years at each role):

* Account management (mfg company, US)
* Customer service (tech company, EU)
* Project management (tech company, EU)
* Tech partnerships (current role, EU)

I've learned a lot from working these roles, but they have been getting progressively more stressful and I'm looking for a path with less stress down the road. I think what I'm not a big fan of is the combination of a million things going on at once, a lot up in the air, coordinating with multiple departments, meetings half of the day, all while trying to develop new partner relationships and meet my goals. I'm not bad at it, but I don't want to be doing it forever. Maybe it's just the company I'm currently at now but it is a lot.

Anyways, what I've learned is that I am good at learning something in a specific area. From my past couple roles I find myself enjoying managing our revenue from partners. I'm not really a fast learner and I learn things by doing them and repeating them. I don't work well under pressure and I'm not the best at solving multiple problems on the fly that I'm not familiar with. I don't consider myself a very creative person but I enjoy organizing things and I'm good at it. I have a degree unrelated to anything I've been doing (History). I was decent at math in the past (Calc II in uni) but I never pursued it and forget most of it. I never really did all that well in school because I felt like the pace for learning a half dozen plus subjects all at once was just overload for me. So here I am looking for something that could be a better fit.

I have the means to go back to school if required, but I'm still exploring options. A couple potential ideas for paths could be:

* Accounting
* Data Analytics
* ?

Looking for any advice based on my work history, skills, experience, etc. Thanks!",Subject_City4570,1,1.0,0,1733940629,2024-12-11 18:10:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hbzurg/currently_living_abroad_working_remote_and/,12,2024
1hbzp85,What is the best way to leverage a new job offer with your current company? ,"\[Title\]

I am expecting soon an offer for a senior position in my field (automotive) from a different company, which will result in a \~$25k/yr increase above what I am currently making. 

I really am not very interested in moving companies, as I love my bosses, coworkers, and the work itself doesn't give me too many complaints. All of these things are subject to change and you don't really know until it's too late when you move jobs. 

I main issue at hand: Money. I need to buy a new house soon (yikes), and am also planning on getting married/starting a family in the next 2-3 years. My GF is a teacher, so the majority of the financials will default to me as the breadwinner in this case. 

So, is there a way to bring up a job offer to your GM without pissing him off and making him think you have one foot out the door? Seeing as how this would be a pretty large raise, I am assuming they aren't just going to give me $25k or close to it unless they know someone else is willing to.

1hbz8fe,My mentor passed me over; should I just give up?,"Mentor passed me over, ready to lie down in traffic TBH

I’m (42F) so discouraged. I am ready to give up on life. 

My own female mentor just passed me over for a position for which I was 100% qualified (so she stated, anyway) to hire a younger man from a bank. 

Background: I’m in State Service in NY. I transitioned here a couple years ago from over 15 years in nonprofit educational publishing because it seemed like a decent place to work, with advancement opportunities, etc. Turns out it’s awful (surprise!). I’m always kind & happy to work with others; however, my younger male coworker have tried to sabotage my job repeatedly by complaining about me. He has zero original ideas; I have many, although not all of them are usable, haha. 

My background is in Marketing; however, I do have lots of experience in training/instructional design (I’m certified to teach English & have an instructional design certificate), so that’s what I’m doing here. I’d like to go back to marketing, though, because I love being creative. 

We have a mentorship program here—I have an executive-level mentor from the Communications team. I’ve been meeting with her for months, exchanging life stories, advice, etc. We have a lot in common & I like her. 

She has asked for my ideas for a bunch of Communications initiatives— for example, they’re starting a podcast, so I came in with three pages of dope podcast topics—basically two years’ worth of content. And she LOVED them! They’re using everything I gave her, including the name I suggested, & the podcast’s format. Literally everything. Ive given her other ideas that she loved, as well. 

I naïvely thought this would help me! Yes, I realize I’m a dummy. I have applied to 3 separate positions in that department (she’s the head), & had no success. Most recently she suggested I apply for a position that opened up, had me in the for the interview (which went amazing, I walked out of there feeling like I owned it), told me I was a very strong candidate, & then passed me over, despite saying that I’m “so great” & my qualifications were “very well suited for the position”. She even shrugged & said “but you should keep applying! This guy might fall through!” Yes, she absolutely had the final say in this decision. 

She used our mentorship meeting to share the news, & had me suffer through it for a half hour while she tried to change the subject & talk of other things. She eventually realized I was upset & offered to end early, which I thanked her for & accepted. This is the third position I’ve applied to in her department. I now realize she was feeding me bulls*t. 

Afterward, I asked (via a very nice, professional email that thanked her for the overall experience) to terminate our mentorship relationship because it would be difficult for me to maintain my personal standard of professionalism during any upcoming meetings. She hasn’t replied, natch. The message this organization has been sending was of internal advancement, & I have seen several others score new jobs as a result of this program. Just not me. 

What’s wrong with me? I have over 15 years, experience in every type of marketing. I have lots of educational experience. I’m kind & I make a point of working well with everyone. I am always available to help. 

I know that doing this will burn any bridges I had but I honestly don’t care anymore. There was no bridge. She will not hire me for anything. 

I feel so foolish. Humiliated. At this point, though, I would take any level of humiliation if it meant making more money. My family is so poor, we can barely heat our house (thank god it’s been warmer this year—in previous years we had pipes freeze/explode in the house. All my Christmas gifts for my 3 sweet kiddos will be second-hand. My kids have never been on a plane. Just last week, my middle kid told their friends they can’t do things because “we don’t have much money”. 

My commute is 1.5 hours each way. And last week I got rear ended, totaling a car that would’ve lasted another decade at least. 

 This job would’ve majorly changed our life circumstances just with another $20K a year. I wasn’t asking for much. I was so sure it was mine—because I had all the qualifications & the interview was amazing & my mentor told me to apply & was making the hiring decision, I was rehearsing celebration speeches to surprise my sweet husband with. He would’ve been so happy for us & proud of me… but as always, I’m a failure. I just can’t pick myself up anymore. After being a single mom to a kid with a deadbeat dad (my oldest, now 15), to now, I feel so broken.

1hbz6n0,I don't want to burn a bridge buttt......,"**TLDR** \- Advice on whether I should burn a bridge at a company that a colleague (boss now) brought me in to 3 weeks ago so that I can join our previous CEO on his new venture for a much higher salary.   
  
Hello! Hoping to retrieve some insights as I do not have many people to speak to about this. 

I was involved in a start-up (COMPANY A) that had an amazing team of Account Executives and Directors unfortunately due to supply chain and other issues not along the sales team the company went through a bankruptcy, Acquisition and *another* Bankruptcy before shuttering the doors. The team was incredible. 

I found myself in another role (COMPANY B) for a few months, and while keeping my options open I reached out to an old colleague from (COMPANY A) - he hired me. First Person in Canada + First Person on East Coast. I took 2 pay cuts since my time at (COMPANY A) not significant but a pay cut is a pay cut. I have now been here for a month. 

Recently I had been reached out to by the CEO of (COMPANY A) to come work for him at (COMPANY C) explaining he is getting the ""avengers"" together and wants me to join on due to the results I had at (COMPANY A) I know that the other colleagues from (Company A) are potentially not joining this new company.   
  
I'd be curious on thoughts surrounding this as I do not like to burn bridges but I have obligations linked to how much money I bring in every month just like everyone else.  

Would it be worth asking for a break fee to sweeten the deal more? ",LeatherExperience711,2,1.0,0,1733938968,2024-12-11 17:42:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hbz6n0/i_dont_want_to_burn_a_bridge_buttt/,12,2024

 \- 300k

 \- Onsite

 \- Telecom

 \- Dayshift

 \- 300k

 \- Fully Remote

 \- Midshift (I prefer this because I get to do errands in the morning)

 \- Senior Position (More responsibilities)

I definitely feel they pay me more than the work I do in my current job. I know I won't feel the same way in my new job but

it does present more opportunities for learnings/growth.

1hbymbt,"Thinking about my future plans, not sure what to do, am lost","As of now, I work in my position for a year and a half already and have worked in same/similar line of work for a total of almost 6years (customer support in IT related field currently).

Recently, my motivation to work has decreased significantly, pay raise to go from one level to another (example - junior to mid) is minimal in this kind of work and I personally, as the time goes on, find this kind of work less and less purposeful and meaningful.

In theory I understand that you can progress at all jobs and be great, but it's becoming harder the more that I'm losing purpose and interest in this.

For now, I'm currently without any diploma since I have no university degrees, only a coding boot camp of 7 months (front end mainly).

At this stage of life im genuinely not sure what I want from life. Feels like mild depression in a sense that nothing really interests me deeply (as of recently), passion is nowhere to be found and I'm not sure how to move forward.

I was thinking about giving my shot in a somewhat or completely new field than I was working in (in terms of functions and job), such as- writing and generating content (copywriter), audio host/narrator and such, work with audio/video, consider working with helping people directly (such as working with kids or some other kind of work that's directly with people). Maybe this way I'll find something meaningful?

My insecurity Is that im 29 years old, no degree and have no specific ambition or a strong goal for my future. As of now I'm feeling lost and unsure of my future. I've never been like some other people who feel strongly about something, study, get a bachelor's or masters degree or an MD, pursue heights of career that way. For some reason I went about my life differently and am feeling insecure about that.

How can I progress forward? Is it ok to leave a current job and experiment with new opportunities?

I work in a niche part of building engineering and have been at my current role for two years. I like the role, the work I do, and the team environment in my office, however lately I've been getting swamped with work from other offices while still trying to manage my local workload. I like to think that I'm good at what I do, and so I get pulled into a variety of different projects.  I have spoken to my LM and he's on board to help bring about change, but I'm not sure when that would be. It's gotten quite difficult lately in terms of my work/life balance and I decided to see what other opportunities were out there. 

Recently I received an offer for another role at the same grade that pays more (41k to 48k). The role is a bit different and not as interesting as what I'm doing, so I'm not too sure about it. There is also the element of starting somewhere new again. Thus, I'm thinking about potentially using this offer as a way to bring about change quicker in my role and hopefully get a pay increase (counter-offer). 

Does anyone have experience doing this, and how did it turn out? If I do pull this card, how big is the risk that I will be 'seen' differently in my current role if I end up staying?

Pros of current company:
Great starting pay
An above average PTO and Holiday pay
Not always having to put in 40 hours/week

Cons:
Not a fan of the area I live and work
Mostly customer facing role
Position/work is not really aligned with my degree and background
No clear career growth from current role


Pros of new role:
Clear career path and growth
More closely aligned to background and degree
Different city/state, has some appealing aspects to it

Cons:
15%+ pay cut
No assistance/bonus with relocating (projected $10k+ move)
Expected 50ish hours per week (not an issue, but would acclimate to it)
Less overall PTO and Holidays (not quite a dealbreaker), and minimum 6 months before eligible to start accruing
Impression is that of a consolation choice, rejected then reached back out to a week later

The offer came from a good company, and I feel that I could grow there, but I feel like some of the cons are bigger than my current role. 

From at least my categorized Pros and Cons for each, should I decline the offer and stick it out? TIA

1hbvlu3,How can I react to my managers behavior in our meeting yesterday? ,"Yesterdays meeting was to discuss reports, it was the supervisor and myself and 4 others. 

This supervisor has been in an aggravated mood ever since last week - after she was called into a meeting by HR. Not sure what that was about. 

Yesterday in our group meeting she kept nit-picking every single aspect of my report - for no reason. She didn’t seem to understand the assignment at all. 

When I tried to explain she kept cutting me off and said, ""I don't care what you want..."" I never said anything of the kind. All I asked was, ""Are we overcomplicating the report?,"" which is what she was doing. 

At the end, she asked, ""Do you want to step out of the room?"" SoI left. Shortly after, she told others to leave.


The 4 others in the meeting with me all said she was out of line for telling me to step out. They said I didn't raise my voice or anything.

It looks like one of the co-workers got called into HR yesterday, which means that the supervisor probably reported this incident. I feel like she raced to HR first to control the narrative and I’m nervous she might have created a negative image of me, possibly saying I raised my voice or something. 

Ive got a meeting scheduled with HR sometime later today. I’m a really chill, kinda introverted guy and I’d rather avoid conflict but I also won’t have someone consistently treating me like this. 

I’d appreciate any advice on how I should conduct myself during this meeting. Should I request a witness? Should I bring a coworker with me, who was in the meeting too? Can I mention I’m uncomfortable with doing the 1:1 monthly employee evaluations with her?

1hbtjoi,Please help me brainstorm ideas. I need a new path ,"Hey friends!



Im a teacher, and I'm desperate to get out of my job as a teacher. I just legitimately cannot anymore. The stress is actually killing me.



I mean... you guys... I need to be out there ASAP... but ofc live paycheck to paycheck, supporting a family of 5 \[mother and siblings, not even my own kids lol :\] \], so taking a paycut is really not an option at the moment either.



Hence the desperation.



Yes, I've already been to r/TeachersInTransition :\]



Ive seen people mention data analytics, but I also read that the certs you get from places like coursera won't open any doors. Same for project management. I checked out the ID sub, and man... seems teachers are not so welcome there. Never mind that all of these jobs, to me at least, feel pretty soulless. Soulless or not, Im willing to do it if I have to.



Dont get me wrong, I understand a transition isnt easy. I understand the need to upscale and diversify, learn new skill sets, etc... which Id love to do. Hey, we're teachers! We're life long learners! Maybe its just me being impatient... or... childish... but... like I said Im desperate.



The ONLY job it seems I could reasonably transition into is corporate training, but I imagine the field is becoming oversaturated with so many teachers desperate to bail. Its definitely something Im looking into, and actually something I think I could be good at and could be fun, but I need help generating more options.



Ive also considered college admisions counseling, but my education is limited to an undergraduate degree in Neuroscience. Admittedly, I have not looked too deeply into requirements for said position.



Here's some of my background:



I've taught ELAR 7th, 9th, 10th, and 11th grade for 4 years. I got to teach 9th, 10th, and 11th concurrently once at a Title I school. Including the PreAP/IB and non PAP/IB version, 5 preps that year made fro an unforgettable experience I never want to repeat lol, but one that I am so grateful for. It taught me a lot about myself and education as a whole. I had no lesson plans, no curriculum \[as most of us tend not to have\] and had to build everything from scratch.



I was a facility manager, operations manager, and administrator for about 2- 3 years at a local community center. I was also administrator, operations manager, principal, vice principal, lunch coordinator, registrar, counselor, HR, and finance operator for a religious weekend school \[Saturdays and Sundays for 4-6 hours each day\]. Yes, you read that right :D I did it all, folks! Another amazing learning experience Im grateful for lol. No sarcasm.



I was a private tutor and college readiness counselor for about little over a decade \[small business; self employed\]. I've tutored every K-12 subject \[ELA, physics, chem, etc...\] including SAT/ACT, admission essay writing assitance, and guiding students through the admissions process as a whole. Ive done the essay writing and college admissions and guidance process stuff for my siblings as they've made their way through college. Once I became a teacher, I really stopped doing all of that for... everyone else, and I did NOT offer any of those services during the pandemic \[stupid of me I know. I was just so burnt out from it all, I couldn't bear to continue, but becoming a teacher felt like the most logical step at the time. As you can see, I have a penchant for making huge life mistakes.\]



I dropped SAT tutoring because I felt it crushing my spirit. Litetally. I dont intend on going back.



Despite my degree I'm out of practice with the math's and sciences, since it's been a while, but I'm pretty confident with math up until at least 8th grade lol... which is really disheartening... use it or lose it is so real. I know I can handle at least that level of math because I tutor students in my homeroom class when they ask me for help.



I currently make about 63k a year. I need a job that pays AT LEAST that, if not more.



Please help. What can I do for a living? I need to quit my job ASAP and get out :\[",TaiYinshi,2,1.0,1,1733923991,2024-12-11 13:33:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hbtjoi/please_help_me_brainstorm_ideas_i_need_a_new_path/,12,2024

1hbqhqt,Seeking Advice on My Career Plan in Finance – Thoughts and Improvements Welcome!,"Hello everyone,

I’m a 20-year-old from Spain, and a few years ago, I decided to completely turn my life around. As a teenager, I struggled with unhealthy habits and lacked direction, but at 18, I quit drinking, smoking, and drugs, distanced myself from negative influences, and started focusing on my future. I’ve always been told I’m capable of achieving big things, and now I’m determined to make that a reality.

After extensive research, I’ve created a solid plan to build a career in finance, and I’d love your input to refine it further. Here’s my roadmap:

1. Complete a Higher Vocational Training (CFGS) in Administration and Finance in Spain while gaining experience as an accounting intern. Simultaneously, I’ll work on achieving a C1 level in German.


2. Relocate to Zurich, work as an accountant for two years, and save as much as possible (~3,000 CHF/month, totaling 72,000 CHF). During this time, I’ll aim to pass the Goethe C2 (German) and CPE (English) certifications and begin preparing for the CFA Level 1.


3. Pursue a Bachelor’s in Business Administration at ZHAW (specializing in Financial Management). My goal is to graduate with top grades (5.5/6 or higher) while passing CFA Level 1 in the second year and preparing for CFA Level 2 by graduation.


4. Next Steps – Seeking Advice:
My current plan is to work in finance for three years, earn the CFA Level 3, and save to do a top-tier MBA in Europe. However, I’m questioning whether a Master’s in Finance or an MBA is even necessary at that stage. Would having strong work experience, a CFA Level 3, and top academic performance be enough to achieve my career goals, or would further studies still add significant value? If so which studies and when will be better?



My ultimate goal is to secure a managerial role in finance in Zurich with a strong work-life balance and an annual salary of ~200,000 CHF.

Does my plan seem realistic? Are there areas where I could improve or adjust my strategy?

Any insights, advice, or feedback would be incredibly helpful. Thank you!

Take a brand new job offer. It’s WFH 3 days a week and 2 days in office. Slightly lower pay. Normal work hours. Desk job. New job so needing to perform at best and learn a lot. In a field I think I’d enjoy. 

OR return to old job. It’s shift work with night shifts. Slightly higher pay. Very physical and busy job on your feet all shift. No option to work from home. BUT I could go part time for half the salary. I know the job inside out and know how to do the bare minimum to get across the line. Nothing to prove as I’ve been there a long time. Really dislike the job and had been wanting to leave for a long time. It was severely impacting my mental and physical health. Also, a very long commute each day.

I’m torn because there’s so many pros and cons to each option. Tempted to go back to my old job because I already know the go. But also trying to remember how much I hated it when I was there.

1hbon7b,How Do I Break Into Communications (Higher Ed/Healthcare)?,"Hey Reddit,

I’m in my late 30s, an immigrant with a green card (waiting on citizenship), and I’m trying to pivot into a communications career. I’d love some advice!

A bit about me: I have an academic background—humanities BA/MA from abroad, a social science master’s from a U.S. university, and an unfinished PhD (I hated the environment). Most of my experience is in nonprofit and community health research, but right now, I’m an executive assistant with some comms responsibilities for a top professor at a university.

My dream is to become a comms manager, ideally in higher ed or healthcare. I’d love to manage a small team and focus on things like PR, social media, content creation, and media relations.

I’ve been learning skills like graphic design, photography, and social media engagement. I’ve also been applying to comms roles on LinkedIn, but I’m getting zero traction. Now I’m wondering if I need another degree—like a master’s, PhD, or MBA in comms—or if there’s a better way to move forward.

So here’s where I need help: Do I really need another degree to succeed in comms, or should I just focus on building experience? How do I position myself for a comms manager role, either in my current department or somewhere else? And why am I not getting any attention from recruiters?

Any advice, personal stories, or tips would mean a lot. Thanks in advance!

TL;DR: Late 30s, academic and nonprofit background, currently in an EA/comms role. Want to become a comms manager in higher ed or healthcare. Should I get another degree or focus on experience?

1hbofhb,Want to shift out of IT (27M),"Just like the title says I want to get out of IT. I found my way into IT in 2021 when a large Tech company was mass hiring recent grads.  

For reference I have a bachelors of Science in Cellular Molecular and Microbial Biology as well as was a key member of our Universities Varsity soccer team while there. I don’t have ANY work experience in the biology field and realized nearing the end of my degree I may have messed up because I don’t even like the work and it doesn’t translate well into other career paths. 

Anyways, In my role I work on a SaaS low code environment (ServiceNow) doing mostly administrative work…upgrades, requirement gather, troubleshooting, documentation - whatever came up that was required of me. Some days I actually wouldn’t even do anything though cause there was no work to be done…

Worked there for 3 years. Got a couple technical certificates (Admin cert, developer cert, ITSM cert). But recently I’ve been laid off and I’m struggling a lot to get a new job because of how saturated the tech market is. And if I’m honest with myself my coding skills are “okay” but not great so I’m not exactly an elite candidate for any roles.

Anyways I’m really good at connecting people. I have many friends so I thought pivoting would be easy. But I lack “transferable” skills to get the foot in the door I think. 

As well I’m also really bad at interviewing I always find myself getting nervous and when they start to ask about my previous work experience it’s pretty hard to spin since I did very little if I’m honest. I’ve tried “lying” before about my day to day activities but I think they saw through that.

Was hoping to maybe get some advice on potential career shifts or what I could be doing to land a new role. Not really even sure what to do anymore been looking/networking for 4 months and I’m starting to get burnt out. 

Don’t really have the finances to go back to school at the moment also….",AdministrativeAd6509,2,1.0,2,1733902979,2024-12-11 07:42:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hbofhb/want_to_shift_out_of_it_27m/,12,2024
1hboct0,"Big Pay Raise, Unclear Future. Should I Take the Leap?","I'm in a quandary and could use some advice.

I’ve been offered a job similar to my current one (mid-senior level, not managerial) with a 27% salary increase. Both roles are in the public sector. I'm currently with the NHS, and the offer is from a housing association. It’s a small organisation with a team size similar to where I work now.

Here’s the issue: the reporting structure and departmental setup seem unclear. I was initially told I’d report to the department manager, but my contract states I’ll be reporting to the directorate head instead. Digging a little deeper, I found out on LinkedIn that the manager is currently in an interim position and used to work in the very role I’ve been offered.

I reached out to her for clarification, and she told me that I’d report to her for now while she reports to the directorate head. She also mentioned she’s expecting to stay in this interim role for about six more months. However, when I asked about her long-term plans, she avoided giving me a direct answer which makes me wonder if she’s planning to leave.

The company is relatively small (around 500 employees) and has a 3.1 rating based on 12 reviews online. I also contacted two former employees on LinkedIn who held this role, and both had very positive things to say about their experience.

The salary is amazing, but I’m unsure about the future and whether this uncertainty is worth the risk. My current role is less demanding, has a great work-life balance, and is stable, but less pay, no room for growth and the team/organisation lacks clear strategy or direction.

I’m torn between taking the leap for the better pay or staying put for stability. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

1hboarc,"Where might I go from here ? (UK, 35)","So, the time has come for me (35F) to get away from my small village in a rural part of the UK, for reasons I won't go into. I've been stuck here due to being a sole carer for an elderly relative and dealing with severe mental health difficulties. 

Fortunately, I'm recovering well (after expensive private therapy) and ready to get my life heading in a new direction. And I need to get away to a place more welcoming to LGBTQ folks.

My education is a master's in Intelligence Studies and International History, and bachelor's in International Politics and International History. My hope had been to pursue something in academia, but then some life stuff happened, and have been a full time carer for a family member. Anyway:

My work experience is limited - did some copywriting, copyediting, and research for a specialist tech industry publisher, then some time at Citizens' Advice, and most recently just working front of house at a museum.

I'm now in a position where I could potentially get some substantial capital do a couple of years of training or education, but I want to know if you have any thoughts on what would be a good investment in that direction. Another academic qualification? Or something totally different?

I enjoy qualitative analysis, developing arguments, research. Being neurodivergent I am often very happy doing work which requires high attention to detail.

Outside of 9-5 I've done some work as a semi-professional musician, performing and teaching. I also have a fairly strong command of the Norwegian language (lived there for a while with Norwegian partner), and am currently learning Hindi (I'm aiming for 30 minutes/day).

Perhaps it's worth investing in talking to a professional career coach or similar?

I've been looking at law but a sustainable earning potential could take a few years. At first I thought 2 to 3 but now 4 to 5 seems more reasonable, and I don't think my capital could sustain me that long. I'm happy to work too of course, though I'm unsure of the feasibility of working while doing law conversion. For what it's worth, I'm not eligible for a postgraduate loan.

Any thoughts and guidance is appreciated.

So some background, I started this position as a paralegal in July for in house counsel at a multi billion dollar company and was promised significant growth opportunities etc etc. It was a pay cut from what I was previously making at my last job but I thought it May open more doors and I really liked the people I was interviewing with (it was a 7 step interview process for a $70k/yr job but I got to interview with the entire legal team). However I was supposed to be trained by the senior paralegal, who had been there 25 years. About 3 weeks into my being there she put in her 2 weeks and was fully gone by mid Sept. I have been doing the job of 2 people since then with no relief and having to learn it all myself, and honestly have become pretty indispensable, but I feel at this point that I am being taken advantage of.

And there are about 600 more to go and I’m the only one who knows the process (not intentionally, I’ve created guides to try to get help from others but people have always turned to me).

Glass door and coworkers have said that the max merit increase during that review is 2-3% which I don’t feel like even counts for inflation so we are actually making less money.

1hbj2rq,White elephant ,"I’m in a bit of a tough spot and could really use some outside perspective on the situation I’m facing at work.

Here’s the backstory: I’ve recently started a new job, and this is my first full month here. One of my coworkers, who I’ve worked with before who I have a really good relationship with, is really pushing me to participate in a white elephant gift exchange. They’re super social and seem to know everyone, no one talks to me and no one seems to want to talk to me when I try to start conversation.

Today, they kept asking if I signed up for the gift exchange. When I said no, they asked, “What’s wrong with you?” I let them know I didn’t want to participate, and they responded by sending me five different Amazon links for gift ideas. Later, they texted me another link for a gift. I told them again that I wasn’t interested, and they said I was making a big deal out of this.

To add to this, I’m currently going through a difficult time in my life, and the last thing I want is to spend money on a gift for someone I don’t know well, especially since it might end up being thrown away. This isn’t the first time I’ve felt pressured by this coworker; they also coerced me into bringing something for a potluck during my first week, despite my clear disinterest.

I’m starting to feel really awkward around this person, and I’m unsure how to handle it. Should I continue to stand my ground, or is there a way to approach this that might ease the tension? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

1hbglhw,"Two months on contract, no pay yet, other than applying for jobs, what should be the next steps?","I joined this startup as a contractor in October this year. It's not the best pay, industry, company, or anything, I just needed the job so I accepted what was offered. At first we agreed on a bi-weekly payment, by the second week no one even bothered yet to ask about payment information. I started having doubts but the only reason that kept me going is the fact that there are 5-10 others who have been with the company for over a year, which seemed like a good sign (they eventually got paid or otherwise why would they stay for 1+ years).

They provided an email to which invoices should be sent at the end of each month. It was already the end of October, so we (they hired others who joined by the same date) sent our invoices based on their request and according to them, payments are due within 2 weeks after submission.

We attempted sending the emails but it turns out we were given the wrong email. We had to ask around others for the correct one. Then we were informed that we need to register accounts on some [accounting-firm.com](http://accounting-firm.com/) which will be handling our payments from now on. So how do we do it? they have to create it on our behalf, there's nothing we can do but wait.

Some of us received the email and submitted their invoices by the first week of November and no one has been paid a penny ever since (their payments were due 2-3 weeks ago).

I confirmed my suspicions recently by asking one of the 5-10 old members about the payment situation, and they indicated it's the default setting and their payments are usually delayed to sometimes more than one month at a time before getting paid anything.

In the recent few weeks, more and more excuses started to surface, and whenever I ask about the payment they keep stalling and jerking me off further. The most recent excuse which is currently pending, is that the name on the W8-BEN form has to match the name in the bank. And this has to change, so I did change the name because I used nth family name that's not in official documents, and resubmitted the form.

Now I'm being asked to provide a screen capture with a bank document with my name on it. I don't see any point in this request but to stall and buy more time as I already submitted a government issued document with my name on it, and this should be sufficient to confirm my identity.

I'll start looking for jobs because it's very obvious by now that this is going to be a regular thing (if we'll ever be paid anything at all). Any thoughts, recommendations that might get me the money they owe me so far would be useful.",shindigin,0,0.5,0,1733876250,2024-12-11 00:17:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hbglhw/two_months_on_contract_no_pay_yet_other_than/,12,2024

1hbge37,How do I move forward with career advancement in this job market?,"I’m so sick of rejection email after rejection email after not even getting an interview. It’s like did you even read my resume and cover letter? How is it that I meet at least 90% of the requirements on the job description put my salary expectations as middle of the road as what they offer as their own range of salary for the position, and I can’t even get an interview? Im burnt out. 

Context: I have a job and it’s fine. But we were recently acquired and that has taken a significant change on the previous culture/work environment. When I originally to my current role I knew I was taking less than I was worth with my skill set but I did it for the non pay benefits. Who I got to work with and the work environment were important to me. Now those benefits are going away and I want out. The problem is I have done thorough market research on my job description across multiple industries and I’m way under paid. I could ask for more money but we just had a lay off and budgets have been slashed. Plus I have one foot out the door so doesn’t really feel like the right time to ask…

So I look out on job boards and see thousands of positions that I’m qualified for that offer significantly higher pay than I’m getting. So resume adjustment to meet the same language as the job posting after resume adjustment, same with cover letters, endlessly and I can’t even get an interview.

I look at it two ways, I can take a similar position somewhere else that pays significantly better, or try a whole new position where my skills would translate well for the same range of pay I’m already at. I try applying to both pathways and still nothing but rejection emails….this sucks. 

I guess I’m mostly venting here, but also I’m so frustrated and burnt out that I can’t think creatively. So I’m open to any advice that you all have for me. Please and thank you.

The system isn't very transparent, but if the system were out of 5, 4.5/5 is basically unattainable most people get between 4-4.4/5, and really bad is 3.5/5 or lower. I got 3.8. I don't know the details of why I got this score, other than one thing I messed up on this year, which I did whatever I could to take responsibility for and show improvement.

The thing is, I know I am a high performer. I handle my day to day tasks very well, regularly take on extra projects (and get great feedback from the stakeholders/other teams I work with on these projects). There's also a number of long-term goals in my team that we were basically making no progress on before I joined this team, and I have made progress on them and shown a path forward. 

The performance review is prepared by my boss, with I imagine feedback from my direct supervisor (in between me and boss in chain of command). In general, my direct supervisor has been holding me back all year and seems to favor others.

The other thing is that recently my direct supervisor was changed to somebody who really supports me.

Do I just stick it out and accept this one bad review, knowing I know have a supervisor that's in my corner?

They also don't generally provide the rubric this score is based on if asked. I don't know my score from last year, but I got only positive feedback last year, and got a 18% raise and 12.5% bonus (on a different team), whereas this year I got 3.5% raise and 10% bonus.

I came into this role with little experience in an office setting but have recently completed my associate degree in accounting that I started before being employed there. I love where and with who I work, so I'm not complaining. I feel disrespected. I want to ask for more of a raise due to my degree but do not know if it will help. Any advice is appreciated.

I'm trying to get an apprenticeship, for just about anything. Leaning towards plumbing, as I feel like that's a job few people want and has high demand? But I'm also very interested in electrical and HVAC.  

Any advice? Im a relatively intelligent guy I think. Did well in school, I took electronics 1 and 2 in HS and aced them. Know basic tools, and stuff like ohmeters/multimeters. 

Other than that the closest thing I have is working at the airport for 3.5 years. 

2.5 of those were Amazon Air cargo, on the ramp and then Admin. 

For the better part of this year I've been an Aircraft Fueler.

So I've got physical labor, working outdoors in the elements, and some management/computer skills from admin. 

Also, 7+ years of customer service before all that, 1.5 years of that being lower leadership. AdvancedAuto sales/delivery, WalMart, Food Lion ( a grocery store)

So help a guy out? What can I do to impress the interviewer? Will any of that past experience mean much to them, or am I surely gonna get passed up for younger, handier folks?

1hbd2yp,should i give up in engineering and just stick and try different avenues or keep going?,"For context, I (26F) graduated in 2021 with a Bachelors of Electrical Engineering, not married, got a position as a consultant for less than a year and was laid off shortly after. In the mean time, I have been working for my family business in a role which has nothing with my degree nor do they have any positions in that realm that would fit with my degree. Throughout these years of my life, I’ve tried to operate a business of my own for a year though made no profit, assisted in creating a market and now have the potential opportunity to try two business avenues with two different people this year. During all this, I have been trying to apply and I barely hear anything back. I even got my resume reviewed through a career advisor recently and they said it was a good resume. I am not even sure as of recently if I even want a position in engineering because now i’m too used to being a boss at my current job (I have worked in other places before just fyi, this isn’t my only place of employment) and the other reason is that I don’t feel like I am as passionate about it as I was before.

1hbcipc,Education + Experience = The Right Hire,"🚨 Attention Corporate Professionals 🚨

A concerning trend is rising in the corporate world: candidates with an MBA are joining organizations at higher designations and, after just 1.5 years of experience, switching to other companies. Unfortunately, many organizations base their hiring decisions purely on years of experience, ignoring the education and learning from postgraduate studies.

This approach devalues the time, money, and effort invested in higher education. It’s time for organizations to evaluate both experience and educational qualifications during hiring to ensure fairness and recognize true capabilities. Let’s not let the value of professional education go to waste!

Example of one incident : One man manages a junior with 3 years of experience. When junior switch, they are offered higher positions, while senior with 2 years of experience are hired at lower positions basis the experience. This creates a flawed cycle where juniors become seniors, and seniors become juniors in new organizations.

💡 Education + Experience = The Right Hire

1hbc82c,How can I change my personal brand at work & with friends?,"I’ve been reflecting on how I’m perceived at work/ with friends and how I can improve my personal brand. Without meaning to, at work, I think I’ve built a reputation as someone who cuts corners or does his own thing and gets away with it — which isn’t completely true, but for some reason, that perception seems to have stuck. I also tend to speak my mind about work, which might come off as too much at times, and I worry that people might be tired of hearing my opinions. 

With friends, I fear I come across as stubborn and cling to things, as well as having strong opinions -usually opposite to them - which in turn, worrying may make them perceive me to be stupid?

On the positive side, my colleagues often come to me for advice, a laugh, or just to chat, so I know I’m somewhat seen as approachable and supportive. However, I haven’t won Employee of the Month since my first month on the job, and I’m starting to wonder if how I’m perceived is holding me back from being seen as someone more dependable or leadership-ready.

What worries me most is that if these ideas of me are brought up when I’m not around — especially in conversations around managers or higher-ups — it could seriously affect my chances of progressing within the company.

Summary for those who don’t want to read it all: 

I’m concerned that I’ve unintentionally built a reputation at work as someone who cuts corners or speaks his mind too much, which could hurt my chances of progressing. Similarly, with friends, I worry that my strong, often opposing opinions make me seem stubborn or even unintelligent.

Anyways, I remember that on the interviews I decided to never say my age (22) since I had the skills and 2 years of experience.

I'm from europe, and in my country people my age are still in university and mos of them will start working at 26+ for the position I'm going for. Most people my age are getting intenships for less than 1.000 euros per month.

1hbb93p,"Executives that Lied in Interviews to Become CEOs
","I’m constantly reading comments on Reddit about how lying on job interviews gets you fired, blacklisted by recruiters, convicted of fraud, and other nonsense. After doing research on executives who were caught lying - and found three high profile cases where senior executives went years without getting caught, or only got caught because some coworker had it out for them (CEO of Yahoo). 



There are three high profile cases that I found - the former CEO of Yahoo, former CEO of Radioshack, and the former CEO of Bausch & Lomb. What happened to them after they were caught? They got a slap on the wrist (but sometimes fired); but either way went on with a very successful career. No one went to jail for fraud lol.



Keep in mind - these are the people that got caught, not all the people that lied.

Applied twice to this other hospital once for a per diem position (turned it down due to requirements) and for a full-time day position (turned it down due to pay).

1hbacv2,Advice Needed: Transitioning from Apparel Product Development to Marketing,"Hi Reddit,

I’m currently an Apparel Product Developer at a small, sports-based retail company. Due to our “all hands on deck” culture, I’ve gained experience in brand design and merchandising. While I’ve enjoyed my time here and want to stay within the fashion industry, I’ve been thinking about shifting my career toward marketing. This path seems to offer broader opportunities and feels less niche compared to my current trajectory.

Here are some of the challenges I’m facing and areas I’m hoping to grow:
	1.	The Numbers Game:
	•	I have limited experience with return on investment metrics (e.g., profit/loss statements, iROAS, etc.), which has been a hurdle in landing merchandising roles. I worry this gap may also impact my chances in marketing or brand management roles.
	2.	Feeling Trapped in a Niche:
	•	My background has primarily been in graphic design and product development, and I feel my career path is a bit limited. I’d like to expand beyond this narrow focus, but I’m not sure how to position myself effectively.
	3.	Translating My Work’s Value:
	•	Coming from a smaller, lesser-known company, I struggle with communicating the value of my work and achievements in a way that resonates with larger organizations. I fear my experience may not be respected or appreciated at bigger companies.
	•	I’m also considering if stepping back in my career (e.g., starting in a junior marketing role) could help me build the skills and credibility I need for future advancement.

I’d love advice on:
	•	How to position my current skills to make this transition.
	•	Ways to address my gaps in experience, especially around analytics and ROI metrics.
	•	Whether it’s worth taking a step back to gain experience in a new field or if there’s a better way to bridge the gap.

Any insights or guidance would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.",Ambitious_Cake_5242,1,1.0,0,1733859872,2024-12-10 19:44:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hbacv2/advice_needed_transitioning_from_apparel_product/,12,2024

1hb9xdm,"""Administrative Assistant"" desperate to quit my job - talk me in or out of it.","Some background: 25, living in major city in the US, Bachelor's in design, graduated in 2022. I make 36k/year before tax. No insurance or other benefits at my job besides two weeks PTO. Fully in-person.  
  
I've been working at a small arts non-profit for around two years now. My title is ""administrative assistant,"" but (as is typical for non-profits), I'm expected to accomplish tasks way above my pay grade. I average 55 hours a week, some days going until 9 or 10 PM. With my background, my boss first started out asking me to make a Canva graphic here and there - at this point, I would say that 80% of my job is graphic design in Adobe Illustrator and InDesign. 

The job itself is...fine. I don't hate the role itself, despite the truly low salary. (again, I live in a major HCOL city in the US where the average for an admin assistant is \~45k+, and a junior graphic designer is \~ 55k+).

But oh my god, my boss. 

How do I even describe her? She's in her 50s and looks like Edna Mode with none of the humor or style. She will frequently say the most cruel things so suddenly that it's impossible to know if she is being malicious on purpose, or if it is simply an extension of her lackluster social skills. (eg - telling a visitor to the gallery that his healthy baby would probably die because of his weight. Really. There is no missing context.) She treats me like she's my emotionally manipulative ex - she will tell me I'm ridiculous and irritating in the morning, and then apologize and beg me to never leave the non-profit in the afternoon.

She oftentimes puts me in impossible situations. She is very hostile when I ask her questions, snapping at me that she's busy. If I email her the questions, she tells me that I should have just asked her verbally. If I ask someone else, she tells me that I'm going behind her back. She snaps at me, will speak for me even in casual conversations, and is just in general extremely difficult to work with. 

Our office does not have HR, and we are the only employees who work in-person, with a handful of other employees remote. I've spoken to her, with a third party present, about how we can work together better. She will improve for a day or so and go right back to being passive-aggressive and rude.  I've spoken to the non-profit lead, who does not outrank my boss - I'd say they are equal - and to other coworkers, and they all have similar experiences with her. My coworkers theorize that it's worse with me because I'm young and I have no way of ""logging off"" in the office. While it's validating to know that she treats everyone this way, the fact that it isn't personal doesn't make the stress any more bearable. 

I really, really want to quit. I've been losing my hair and generally gotten a lot sicker this year than I have been before. I've sunken to emotional lows I haven't experienced since high school. My friends and family all want me to quit, but I don't have a new job lined up and I'm terrified of not having a stable income. I have around three months worth of emergency savings. I know the job market is terrible right now, and I have been looking, but it's been difficult for me to find the time to apply to jobs between work, freelance work, and everything else that comes with life. I've been telling myself to just suck it up and ignore her, but it's weighing on me.

I’m a woman in a male-dominated field making over $300k, and I’ve noticed a consistent pattern in my performance reviews. Despite excelling in my work and being ahead of my peers in terms of results, much of my feedback centers on my personality. Initially, I was criticized for being “too competitive,” and now the focus seems to be on my “lack of professionalism” and “maturity,” specifically citing that I “talk too much,” even though I barely speak with my colleagues.

I’m wondering if there’s some bias at play, or if there’s something else I’m missing. I pride myself on producing high-quality work, maintaining professionalism with clients, and communicating effectively. So, I’m uncertain if this is just a result of working in a male-dominated industry, in which case, should I simply adapt and take a more reserved approach?

I've had the pleasure of shooting feature films, countless shorts, and have traveled the world shooting docs and commercials, but since COVID, the industry isn't what it used to be. The past two years have been a historic low with writers' strikes, streaming production slowing down, and commercials shifting more into social branded content.

For additional context, I also co-founded a startup making AI/ML tools for filmmakers that I've been focusing most of my efforts on for the past 1.5 years. We've been able to generate about $25K in revenue and have launched 3 products within the span of 8 months, with a couple hundred customers. I've built the whole thing from scratch - from incorporating to finding investors, marketing, managing development, building customer relationships, customer support, continued future product development, etc. etc.

While I have a technical co-founder who helped build one of the core products, I've managed to learn many of the technical aspects of the process myself. Additionally, I've been taking programming courses in my spare time, starting with web development and JavaScript, and I am working my way into React and Python. I want to be able to build more products on my own (or at least at an MVP level). My ideal scenario would be running my startup full-time, but at the moment we aren't generating meaningful enough revenue to live off of.

I'm trying to see what skills I've developed through the film industry and my own startup that can translate into a tech role. I don't think I would necessarily be suited for completely technical role like a dedicated software engineer but something like a product/project manager with some technical aspects could possibly fit -- I just don't really know enough to know what positions are out there.

I have a few friends who work in the tech industry and are confident that I would excel there given my soft skills, but I just don't know how to get there or how best to leverage what skills I have to make it sound appealing to recruiters. I've never had a full-time job before, so I'm also concerned how it looks on my resume that I don't have any tech-focused job experience. It's also tricky because most people don't actually know what a cinematographer actually does, but in reality it's basically being the CTO of a film production.

Has anyone made a successful career pivot to tech at this stage in their lives or have any advice on what possible options I have? Or how to even approach applying to other jobs?",cinnamonographer1,0,0.5,1,1733854417,2024-12-10 18:13:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hb86cu/career_opportunities_pivoting_from_film_to_tech/,12,2024

1hb6gjz,Might accidentally be under consideration for a job my friend 0from work really wants. How should I handle this?,"I have become friends with one of my co-workers. In September, my friend told me she wants a different role and talked to her manager. She said her manager said there would be multiple roles open in her department at the beginning of 2025. Shortly after, they selected a role and she told me her manager is teaching her about the role. She said she is really excited about growing into this role and had some previous experience with that role in a different part.

I was thinking about transferring to a different department. I remember my friend saying there would be multiple positions in her department at the beginning of 2025 so I talked to her manager and he said he would talk to the CEO about bringing me on. He also said it looked like there would be multiple positions. Today, my current manager said my possibly future manager hasn't moved forward yet because he started figuring out how to ""shift"" some people around. I have a great relationship with him and he really wants to bring me on and really seems to want to make everyone happy. I'm worried my friend might be really excited for that role he has been grooming her for and he might be trying to talk her into another role to allow for the shifting to bring me on, but I'm not sure. All I know is he's looking to ""shift"" people around. And all I know is that at one point my friend was really excited about a particular role in her department.""

I don't want to accidentally take this opportunity away from my friend. In October, my current manager told me not to talk to my friend about moving roles to avoid confusion. I'm not sure when talking to my friend is an option and when it is, I definitely want to be careful not to create confusion. I haven't told my friend or even implied to her I'm thinking of taking a different role in the company.

1hb5p7i,Can I still be an Engineer after working in Construction Project Management?,"I'm not sure if this is the right group to ask this, but here is some background:

I just graduated with a Bachelors in Civil Engineering, I've taken and passed my FE exam. Well, I have been interning for 3 summers with a construction/project manager company. I will be hired on fulltime in January as an assistant project manager. I will be working on structural concrete projects, like bridges and foundations. My only worry with this is that I won't be doing any actual engineering. My feeling is that my degree is a bit overkill for this job. As of right now, I want to eventually work as a structural engineer, designing bridges and foundations. I get that this isn't the ""normal path"" to that goal. But I figured a job is a job, and getting experience on how these structures are actually built will come in handy. Another thing to note is I will be working under a PE (not practicing) in this position, so I will still be working toward getting my PE and getting experience that way. My question is, if i work in a contracting/project management position for a couple years. Will I still even be considered for an engineering position if I decide to go that way with my career in a couple years? My worry is this path leads parallel with an actual engineering position in the future, but won't necessarily get me there in the end?

I can definitely give more context if needed, but just wanted to get input from actual engineers in the field to see what is thought.

1hb4sny,"Should I Continue in a Strategic Role Despite Pay Disparities, or Reconsider My Career Path?","TL;DR: Transitioned to a more strategic role in the CEO’s office, but I’m still handling my old responsibilities with no increase in pay. Feeling undervalued and unsure about my career decisions. Seeking advice.

I’m a Chartered Accountant (ACCA, FCCA UK) with over fourteen years of experience, including time at a Big Four firm, and I currently work for an investment company. Over the years, I’ve been instrumental in establishing the company’s financial systems, policies, and processes, building everything from the ground up.

Previously, I managed financial reporting, budgeting, audits, and compliance, playing a key role in areas such as:
	•	Strategic financial planning, forecasting, and budgeting.
	•	Corporate governance and compliance frameworks.
	•	Financial reporting and audit readiness.
	•	Investment due diligence and restructuring initiatives.
	•	Supporting various board committees, including audit, risk, and investment.

Despite my significant contributions, my pay hasn’t increased since 2018. Although my work has always been recognized by colleagues and management, the promised promotions have been repeatedly delayed. Most recently, after a three-year wait, the vice chairman supported my promotion to a financial expert role and forwarded the request to the chairman. HR reviewed my profile and stated that I lacked the required experience for the proposed position. They also noted that my current salary was lower than the average salary for the new role and left the final decision to the chairman. It’s been months since then, with no updates, and I haven’t followed up, which has left me feeling disheartened and undervalued.

At the end of last year, I was given the option to either stay in the finance department or transition to the CEO’s office. I chose the CEO’s office because of its focus on strategic advisory and corporate-level responsibilities. However, I sometimes question if this was the right decision, as my core expertise lies in financial reporting and auditing.

Currently, I’m managing dual roles—my previous financial reporting responsibilities, including budgeting and forecasting, as well as my new, more strategic role in the CEO’s office. Soon, these financial reporting tasks will be handed over to a new hire who is joining on a much higher salary. I will then focus exclusively on corporate-level responsibilities such as strategic advisory, high-level reviews, and organizational planning.

A particular concern for me is regarding budgeting and forecasting. These tasks are crucial as they involve strategic information that the board regularly reviews, including quarterly and annual cash flow budgets. This work often requires me to liaise directly with the board, which provides important exposure and engagement at the group level. Should this responsibility remain with me in the CEO’s office, or would it make more sense to move it to the finance department?

Adding to my frustration, my responsibilities have increased, yet my pay has not. The lack of financial recognition despite my contributions has left me feeling mentally and emotionally drained. I’ve started applying for external roles, but I keep facing auto-rejections on platforms like LinkedIn, which is adding to my discouragement.

Has anyone faced a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Any advice on managing transitions to more strategic roles, addressing salary and promotion concerns, or deciding the ownership of responsibilities like budgeting and forecasting would be greatly appreciated.

I no longer think I want to be a lawyer and completely want to start over my education in something else and make a career change.

1hb1avt,Help match a career pivot to my skills. ,"I am looking for a change/pivot in my career. I actually love what I do but have hit a dead end career rise. Little to no room to move up in my industry. Even though I like it I’m also bored. Lastly I travel 250 -300 days a year. It’s getting old. I’d be fine with 150-200. But the last five years of over 250 days is just killing me and not allowing me to enjoy anything. 

Currently I am a “senior equipment project manager” at a Fortune 500 construction company. I manage a fleet of boats that support marine construction activities. I manage several direct reports and under me fall approximately 100 employees ranging from boat crews to maintenance staff.  I manage large projects (major overhauls of ships and building new ones) as well as a maintenance budget of about 10million. (Does not include staff salaries). 

Prior I did similar things - managing the maintenance and repair of a fleet of tugs and barges in the petroleum industry at two previous midsize companies and prior to that I managed the maintenance and repair division and land side shop for the largest private ferry company.  I managed over 100 union mechanics and laborers at this position. 

My education is a little different. Joined the navy. Went to naval nuclear power school. When I got out I always had a six figure job without college. I went back to get my college degree from university of Pennsylvania in my 30s and graduated with high honors in both climate change science and organizational anthropology. I am planning on attending an mba program moving forward but haven’t committed to that. Open to just about any grad degree. I love school so irregardless I’ll be perusing something. I am getting my pmp through my company this spring mainly because it’s free. 

I currently make between 150k-200k. I’d like to be in that vicinity but more importantly have room to move up.

1hb0wz6,I am a Paid Media specialist and I want to enter the video game industry: where do I start?,"Hello everyone! 👋

I'm a bit lost and looking for guidance on how to make a career shift into the gaming industry. I currently work as a Paid Media Specialist, managing campaigns on platforms like Google Ads, Meta Ads, Linkedin Ads & Amazon Ads, and I'm really interested in how I can align my experience with roles in the gaming sector, either in large companies or startups.

I've been researching and I know there are roles like UA Manager, Marketing Analytics, Growth Manager, or Community Manager that could fit, but I'm not clear:

* What concrete steps I need to take to make the transition.
* What kind of projects to include in my portfolio that would appeal to this industry (I'm already working on a portfolio applying strategies).
* If there are specific certifications or resources that can help me strengthen my profile in the industry and digital marketing.
* What additional skills would you recommend me to develop to fit into specific roles.

In my current experience, I'm used to working with performance campaigns (traffic, conversions, ROAS, etc.), but I don't know if I should focus more on organic strategies, community management (Discord/Reddit), or something more industry specific.

I really appreciate any advice, experience, or resources you can share! My main goal is to learn and prepare myself to make this leap strategically. 😊",Different_Fly6992,1,1.0,0,1733834651,2024-12-10 12:44:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hb0wz6/i_am_a_paid_media_specialist_and_i_want_to_enter/,12,2024

1hb0r6l,Applying for a position in a different department at my company. Any tips on how to go about navigating this with my current manager?,"Hi all. About 4 years ago I was a part time intern at my company in Department A, and I was in that position for 2 years. I left after the internship to try new things, but came back to the company 10 or so months ago working in Department B. New manager, new team, but I still work with my old manager frequently.

Now, my current role in department B is, frankly, kind of a dead end. No upward mobility and definitely no raises are coming my way any time soon. However. my current manager loves me. Frequently I'm told how great of a job I've been doing for the last 10 months, how quickly I've picked everything up, how much praise I've been getting internally and externally. He has said verbatim ""Why can't my whole team be like you"". But since there's no room for growth, I've been wanting out of the position anyway.

I saw a job opening at the company in a new department which is much more similar to Department A than my current role. I reached out to my old internship manager and asked her if she knew about this role, she said she didn't but she knew the director and could let her know I'd be applying. This already is a great first reference since my old manager has a pretty high up and important role. But obviously if this application progresses, my current manager will eventually have to find out right? My question is, how do I navigate this situation with my current manager? I don't think he'd purposely sabotage me, he is very nice, but I do get the sense he'd not want me to leave his team. I think if he was asked for a reference he'd be like ""Noooo why are you trying to take him from me hahahaha"" but like in that half joking way. So should I just keep him in the dark about me applying to this other role? Or should I take advantage of my connections at the company and just ask him for a reference anyway? And even after the application progresses, how do I tiptoe around the fact that he'll now know that I want out of the team?",Retrow,1,1.0,1,1733834085,2024-12-10 12:34:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hb0r6l/applying_for_a_position_in_a_different_department/,12,2024
1hazs7o,Green flags for next job?,"I left my hybrid job at a nonprofit four months ago because they hired someone less experienced than myself to be my supervisor and then gaslit me about his incompetence for a year, then when that supervisor left, they told me I was the only candidate for his position and then they gave it to someone else who didn’t apply. I was there for three years. 

I need to find a new job but I’m somewhat traumatized by the situation, and I feel like if you look hard enough, no work situation is ideal or pleasant. 

I’m hoping for guidance on how to choose a workplace. I am not interested in being super passionate about the work, working unpaid overtime, or doing a lot of in person interaction. I’m a woman in my mid thirties and I basically need a job that would be healthy to have while raising a family. 

I have no idea what to look for in terms of red and green flags, and no idea where to start. I won’t work for something unethical like health insurance, I need to be able to look myself in the eye.

1hazpse,I was fired for “not meeting target metrics” but I feel I may have a case for why the PIP is insufficient grounds for dismissal. What do you think?,"Question—if there was a performance evaluation document that included concrete metric expectations for the employee AND detailed action items promised to be provided by leadership to aid the employee in improving performance. Then NEITHER party succeeded in meeting said “commitments,” doesn't that kind of make the agreement unenforceable to an extent?

I think it's obvious at this point that I am said employee. Hahaha. So, the PIP had very specific numbers to hit (which had been verbally adjusted to realistic numbers for some targets the following week, and I'm kicking myself for not requiring the pip to be updated with new signatures…. But that's not necessarily important to my argument anyway, so I digress. The pip was just so informal, so I wasn't too concerned about the 30-day review; everyone understood this was all a work in progress…. Eyeroll). These were referred to as “monthly goal targets to hit on average” to account for the natural flow of higher and lower demand cycles over a year, and very explicit training, digital tools, and process procedures were agreed to be provided by leadership in writing within this same PIP (this was a new role with no specific procedures technically created yet and I had been begging them for these needed tools and procedures for months already, so getting the commitment in writing had me under the impression they had finally surrendered and realized YES, these tools are success deal breakers); then, at the end of the 30 days, I was sat down and fired for “not meeting the numbers”…. Very coldly with no further conversation offered, it was just black and white. Do I at least have a solid enough case for my right to collect unemployment?? I'm going to file either way and will appeal if needed, but I'm trying to figure out how fucked I made myself by signing the original pip. 

I was never provided the promised resources that leadership wrote within the PIP; why should I be held accountable to my side of the agreement when they didn't fulfill their promised objectives? It's cause and effect, people! That's why they had their commitments in writing, too, because they knew I wasn't going to sign a PIP without my employer providing me the necessary tools I needed to succeed (I want to mention that these are essential industry tools that are a standard issue within the industry across the board…. It's like the barest minimum shit that's needed for the role…)…does this constitute unfair dismissal? 

Lastly, this document stated we would reconvene and review progress at the 30-day mark but did not state (not in writing or even verbally) that if target numbers weren't all hit after the 30 days, it was automatic dismissal.... With all that mismanagement and the way the pip was written stating ""leadership believes employee can be successful with the right training and resources and blah blah blah"" but then the promised steps on leadership's end ALSO failed to be met .... I just feel like there's a legitimate argument for unemployment benefits to be approved in this case.. would you agree? I'm not in HR, so I don't know for sure, but I've been told by a few friends in HR roles that they were required to state the consequence (being let go if numbers are not achieved in the next 30 days) in the PIP signed. For so many reasons, I feel misled by leadership and feel like it's a situation where they want to make money fast but don't realize they can't just plop someone in the role as the solo producer and expect them to succeed right away when the role hadn't had any of the necessary framework in place to perform at the level expected. They're not going to succeed in getting anyone to meet those numbers without providing what the employee needs (as I argued I needed for months before this pip), but leadership doesn't get it bc they fired anyone else who actually had experience in this side of the business so I was the lone ranger left to do the job after our company was acquired effective 9/1 and they didn't even realize my branch existed…

Gahh, so much frustration. I'm happy to be out of such an incompetent workforce, but this all landed on me as soon as I returned from maternity leave in September, and I was basically sat down and given an entirely new set of duties and surprise! My whole team that was in place when I left to have the baby in May had all been let go (some laid off, some fired for arbitrary reasons), and I was now going solo with new leadership who had no idea how my dept/ branch worked. It's been impossible. But again, I'm worried there's so much he said,she said in my side of the story that I'm clinging on to the wording of the pip to provide evidence of my inability to succeed.

I have been looking at changing careers for months/a year or so now. But have no idea how to make the firsts steps towards it.

I have bounced around jobs in it for a while and as this position starts to wrap up enough is enough.

The problem is, it has been such a bit part of me for 10 years, I don’t even know how to leave it or identify a new area to pivot towards.  I have earned well in my current position, but value enjoyment and happiness more, and understand you often cannot pivot your income with you. 

I have transferable skills, but don’t know where to look towards or how to start moving away.  How do you identify a career or position for you?

Yes it is very common in my country (Greece) to work irrelevant jobs from your studies, and get paid base salary 820 Eur. 

The thing is as you might notice, I have no idea what I want to be.. My current employer noticed that and wants a final reply in order to renew our contract indefinitely. He wants me to act as a man (his words) and tell him if I see myself in this proffesion for at least the next 3 years. He is investing in me so far he is ""losing money"" until I am ready to be more productive and complete employee. 

I totaly see his POV, and he is right. I find it really hard however, to answer this question frankly. I obviously need a job but at the same time want to be sincere and honest with him. The truth is I dont know what I want to be and I havent commited in this job yet. I am searching for jobs and the low as hell salary I earn, is driving me away to find something better. Same goes for the incopatibility of this job's nature with having a family and being there, cause its not 9-5 always you might work on holidays or weekends etc. But I get it, how can he pay me more if I dont commit and show him I am staying. 

I am thinking of saying yes even though I dont know if I want it and keep this job for now until I find something better, and during this time it might grow under my skin and actually like it and be good at it. Alternatively, I am saying no and look for something else which is challeging in my country with low pay.

Currently, my interim title is **Senior Software Solutions Architect**, which is fine because I have never been overly concerned with titles and have always prioritized compensation. Recently, the CEO approached me and asked me to think about my title and let him know if I wanted a change.

As I mentioned, having the title of ""Director"" in my previous role and now holding the title of ""Senior Solutions Architect"" might appear like a demotion on my résumé or LinkedIn profile. While I’m not worried about my current job, it might impact future opportunities.

I am am Italian 29-year-old woman working in a multinational company for about 7 months, and I am hating this job in almost every aspect. Therefore, I have already decided that I will not renew my contract (fixed-term for 1 year) because I am experiencing continuous anxiety and stress, in addition to not liking the role and the tasks at all.

Unfortunately, since I am on a fixed-term contract, I cannot resign right now unless I reach an agreement with my employer, so I have decided to hold on until the end, which is 5 more months.

The problem is that now, by the end of the year, my boss has scheduled a meeting to give us (me and him) feedback on my performance.

Since there are 5 months left, I wouldn't want to expose myself by saying that I will 100% leave the job for the reasons mentioned above. What do you recommend I say/do? I am thinking of talking to him about the ""non-renewal"" about 2 months before the end of the contract, for the sake of fairness, but right now it seems too early and counterproductive.

Ps: after the end of the contract I want to go back doing my old job, and I am economically independent, since I saved a good amount of money in the last years. 

Thank you in advance for your advice!",Beautiful_Sugar4286,1,1.0,2,1733807975,2024-12-10 05:19:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hauix4/fixedterm_feedback_interview_with_the_boss_what/,12,2024

I recently joined a company which forced its employees back to the office (Amazon). 

I work as a mechanical engineer, and I’m really struggling with the return to office mandate. It’s not even the commute that gets me, I can walk to work and back. It’s that I leave the house, work, come home and don’t have energy for anything else. I just sit on my phone until it’s time to get to bed, then I do it all over again the next day. 

Prior to this I was fully remote and I would role out of bed, take breaks as I saw fit throughout the day, log off and have the time and energy to go to the gym, learn some new skills, etc. 

Any advice on how to adjust to RTO lifestyle after being remote for almost 4 years?

1haqnhj,Am I overstepping/out of line if I request a new supervisor? How would you handle this?,"
Ugh.  I’m worrying if this is a good fit for me. I’ve worked as a financial aid advisor at my current job for 3 months. I came to this job with almost 2 years of prev experience, it’s a school I’ve been trying to get into for a while. When I trained, I was with the manager and there were no other new hires. The mgr pointed out to the team in my first ever team meeting that I was a quick learner etc and I also got that kind of feedback when we were 1:1. I was eventually passed down to a supervisor and she also said the same kind of feedback like the mgr. 

Every week, the supervisor and I have a 1:1 where we go over my students and metrics, she wants to talk about each of my students (mostly the ones who need to have their financial aid cleared). When I first started, idk if it was dumb luck but almost every single student was responsive & I felt like I rarely needed her redirection on students needing to be cleared unless I had a separate question. Now, all of my new students are just not responsive or their file is complex etc and it’s discouraging. She gives her feedback/suggestions/corrections on how to handle them, whatever you want to call it & sometimes, she’s either: giving me incorrect info & when I clarify with another dept/student it’s wrong, I ask for her help on something/another pair of eyes and when I submit the file to compliance it’s sometimes rejected & sometimes she just makes things confusing for me. 

I’ll start by saying I know I’m very very new and when I’m wrong well that’s all to it, there’s a lot I don’t know and she clearly has a lot more knowledge than I do. But…why is she unintentionally steering me in the wrong direction at times? I’ve dealt with bosses in the past who made mistakes but the rate she’s been doing them at is more than what I’m used to compared to my experiences with bosses at old jobs. When I was training with the mgr when I first started, I didn’t feel this way & she made everything seem seamless. The supervisor tends to compliment me a lot but…why is it during our 1:1 I’m getting more suggestions on how to handle certain students? Is it because I just have a lot more difficult ones now? Is it a reflection of my work? Is it because I’m new? Or all of the above? 

Is this the norm with jobs? Or are my expectations too high when it comes to leadership? Or even myself? I know we’re human but these mistakes are going to affect my metrics and well hers too.

I have a new boss now who when I go for help, instead of giving me help in a nicely manner, he just tells me i don’t know anything and that I need to know these things even though our company has been tremendously slow on work so its hard to gain any knowledge or experience on little work.

1hanstz,Coworker is always looking for opportunities to make herself seem superior to me in front of management,"I have always had problems with this one coworker who constantly seeks to position themselves for a management position that doesn't exist. While I am fully aware that COULD change one day, it feels like I'm caught in the crosshairs of a quest with no end. Any time I don't know something, make a minor mistake (which is incredibly rare!), or do anything that might draw a second look from management, you can rest assured she'll be there to make it bigger than it ever needed to be.

This is all without getting too deep into the rest of the dynamics at play. She's incredibly lazy but makes it seem like she's the busiest person on the team. And guess who ends up getting left with the overflow of work caused by her unwillingness to get in the trenches? Me, of course. I've taken an approach recently to try and slow down on my own stuff and see if I can get some more work diverted to her, but I'm not sure how much effect it's having.

Context: I work in an extremely creative field and believe myself to be quite good at my work. Coworkers have told me it's night-and-day difference when my work sits next to hers, but I can't help but feel that management will pick her when they do end up promoting someone... be that now or in three years.

1hanio5,Went to HR about mistreatment from boss - am I screwed?,"24f at a large hospital chain as a student nurse. I’ve been here for two months. My boss has been a bit of an asshole to me for the past month, but I went to HR because my boss will no longer let me go to part time because I’m not “competent” enough 

These past few months this boss (who’s very new to his role) has been singling me out. On my last day of orientation he gave me a performance improvement plan and told me I was doing terribly. And once I got off orientation he hasn’t let up. Last week I got in trouble for not moving an IV pole fast enough when a patient got up (patient was fine and had no close calls). 

The other CNAs, Nurses, and patients have been giving me good reviews. And when I ask them for feedback they say I’m doing good. But whenever I see him he tells me I’m doing so much wrong and that I’m progressing too slowly for his standards

Today he told me that he won’t let me go to part time because I’m not competent enough. I’m not strong enough in my skill set to choose when I work and at minimum he will give me one less day to work. I’m in an MSN program and I’m taking 17 credits this first semester. 

I keep asking him what he wants me to do to improve and he told me to watch educational videos (I watched all of them during orientation and had nurses sign me off on those skills). He says that I just have to improve at everything and if I don’t I will not pass my 90 day review. 

I asked him what the nurses and patients were saying and he said it’s not important. Then I asked  if someone could shadow me and see how I’m doing things - and he said no. I told him how will they know im progressing if they don’t talk to anybody and how do I meet his standards without someone shadowing me. He had no response. This is not the first time he’s dangled termination in my face. 

Then he said that my year of past experience didn’t matter because since I’m performing so poorly I was clearly trained bad. As well as compared me unfavorably to other staff and called me the weakest employee. He said I should be pessimistically cautious going forward. 

I know HR isn’t my friend but I had no other option. I went to the HR office on my off day and sat with the representative for over two hours. He was very nice and took thorough notes. I told him that I either want to transfer (I’m not eligible yet) or I want to quit amiably. I’ve provided documentation and my signed documents that show that I’ve met expectations. But now I apparently have to meet with all of them next week. I was hoping my boss would just let me go transfer to a different department or just let me do my two weeks. 

He clearly hates me so why the hell is he dragging this out. He won - I don’t want to work here anymore.

I am trying to get some people’s opinions or advice as all my people are trying to stay neutral. 

I have an offer to go work for Lockheed Martin and a program planner. The salary is currently higher than my base pay but about 20k less than what I made this year with bonuses. The main reason I was looking at this new job was to get a better work life balance as the position offers 9/80s (every other Friday off) plus 10 more days of vacation, 11 federal holidays and the week off between Christmas and new year. The 401k and health insurance is slightly better as well. 

My biggest fear with switching to this new job is getting bored and stuck inside staring at a computer all day doing the Same repetitive task. I currently enough going to the field to break up the office life.

I currently struggle with the sales portion of being a PM because im more introverted and just don’t fully enjoying the selling portion. I have no problem interacting with clients customers it’s just my obvious weak spot for this portions and with sales being a huge role in my compensation but it’s just not something I enjoy doing. 

I don’t have any kids but we are planning on start within the next 2 years and that is also a big concern in finding that time to be there for them and my wife who is very passionate about me being home for them as she missed out on that a lot growing up. 

I know I’m more so ranting and just explaining some main items that are on my mind, but

I went to my boss's holiday party this past weekend and she asked if I got her email with the offer, I said yes and thanked her and told her how happy I was I could tell my family that I have a great job on the table when I go home for the holidays, etc., and she said that was great and **if I wanted to negotiate any part of it to let her know**. 

So, given that she opened the door for negotiations, what is an appropriate increase in salary (if any) to ask for? Should I be negotiating other parts of the benefits package instead (e.g., more PTO, 401(k) match, etc.)? Should I ask for a certain number, or ask how much room there is to increase?

It's hard to tell exactly what a starting salary for a new attorney at a small/boutique family law firm serving higher-end clients should be, but it looks like it ranges from $90-125k. My offer was $100k ($85k until I pass the Bar) if that helps. 

  
Thank you!! Negotiating salaries makes me uncomfortable/nervous since I don't want to come across as ungrateful or greedy... and I really don't want to mess this up.

1hammod,Promotion to National Sales Role,"Looking for some advise from other national accounts managers…

I 30M just accepted a promotion at my current company dealing with our smaller to medium sized national accounts. I originally covered a 1 state territory and had a good amount of success, thus leading to my current promotion.

In this national accounts role, I will be in charge of growing accounts spending under 1M dollars per year with with my company in the US and Canada. I am also responsible for bringing in new national accounts with high spending potential and growing that new business.

My question to the group: If you have found success in a national sales role, what did you do in the beginning? Did you do anything unique in your sales process? What internal/external resources did you rely on regularly?

I have been in sales my entire career and believe that If you do nothing else.. as long as you follow through with your promises and put in the effort, you will be successful. Am I wrong in believing that?

1hajx0f,Indian guy looking to build a career in the US,"Hi folks,

I have been in the US for about 2 years now and I absolutely love all things this great nation provides! I would like to grow up on the ladder in corporate America and settle down in the USA. I am seeking guidance on what would be a good firm to start my journey with so as to land eventually in the US.
My background -
5 years of work experience in an analytics consulting firm. I have been on L1B since Oct 2022. I would like to switch away to a different company now and while doing that I want to ensure I apply for those companies that will get me back to the US ideally on an L1A (Manager visa) - this is because I think it's the fastest track to GC for me as an Indian.
I am 27, male, single. I am ruling out H1B visa route because that does not give me a fair chance in getting settled (citizenship) here in the US.
I am open and flexible about my next role as long as it provides me this path to the US. I have thought about Consulting, Tech, Product as potential type of companies I can apply to. I am seeking more guidance and help on what kind of firms should I target? 
One potential path that I have seen folks take is to work for the Indian subsidiary of a US company and then transfer to the US location. I feel this is the most natural path given my ambition. But where do I start with finding such firms? Any other advice is welcome. And if you have some role that I can potentially take up that's welcome too!

1haj8g7,Which one of these jobs would have a better career path?,"Not sure if this matters, but I'll mention it just incase. I live in Louisville, Kentucky.

I do not currently have a degree, but I did attend University for about 3 years before dropping out. I have no interest in going back until I have enough money to pay for my final school year (I want to avoid student loans as much as possible)

So essentially I am at a moment in my life where I can work at 2 different types of jobs, and I am really unsure of which one to choose.

The first job is working as a Teller at a 5/3 bank. The future outlook for me at this job would probably end up being a Personal Banker 1 or 2, maybe a Loan Officer of some kind. The starting pay is $20/hr, and the workplace itself is only 10 - 15 minutes away from home.

The second job would be working at a local company as a Product Support Specialist I. Similarly, also pays $20/hr, but slightly farther away. 20 - 25 minute drive. My end goal would be to move to a different department, such as HR or Marketing after about 1 - 2 years of working in that position.

Both jobs want me but for different reasons. For the local company, I got along very well with someone from HR. She was very adamant about me staying in the company, but I decided not to because I wanted an office job. When the Support Specialist position opened up, she gave me the word and I went ahead and applied for it.

The bank job wants me more or less for my bilingual capabilities, a skill that wont ever really be used in the Product Support Specialist position. They have had a recent influx of Cuban migrants, and they think I would be a great asset to help out with those customers, since there is only 1 bilingual banker and 0 bilingual tellers/csr's.

I could be wrong here, but I believe that in terms of future growth/climbing the ladder so to speak, I think the local company seems like a better move. But I wanted to ask here on Reddit to get other perspectives as well.

I just think that an independent bank branch is too limited for growth. It feels like the highest I'd be able to do is something like Personal Banker II. But for a conventional company, one that has your typical departments in production, marketing, IT, HR, Sales etc. I just get the feeling that there is more I can do there. And given that the interviewers told me that the Customer Experience department is usually a stepping stone for people to branch into other departments, AND I already have a good relationship with someone from HR, it just seems like a win-win.

But hey, I could be missing something here. I'm only 22 years old, so I can't say that I am very knowledgable yet about careers, career paths, etc. but I want to learn as much as I can. Maybe there is something I am not taking into consideration with a career in retail banking.

1haj0jf,Feel like a failure ,"Hey looking for some advice!

2024 has been a rough year as far as my career goes. I was laid off in a third round of layoffs by a company I loved and felt I could have worked at forever. Then was hired on in a new position starting in March of 2024. This job was tough as I was hired without a manager and then a month after starting they hired me a manager that did not like me. (For reference this was a compliance position at a brokerage firm) 

After four months of being with this manager and six months with the company they said they would put me on a PIP with almost no chance to come out on top. I was then advised by some mentors to quit the job because of how they keep termination records in my industry and they said it would be very difficult to get a new job if I had being fired on my record. Because of this, I listened to their advice.

I feel like my life is ruined and I will never be employed again. I have made a total of five final interviews but have not been offered as of yet. I am just so frustrated and feel like a failure. My wife has a wonderful job thank goodness but I have a daughter who is 18 months old and I don’t want her growing up thinking her dad is a failure.

Any advice or words of encouragement would be appreciated. I’m just down in the dumps because of the holiday season.",Fun_Adhesiveness_520,3,1.0,6,1733774910,2024-12-09 20:08:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1haj0jf/feel_like_a_failure/,12,2024
1haix2i,I'm so BORING! ,"I work in car sales and look after a high volume portfolio. The work is great, I love how faced paced it is; balancing a challenging job that is 'never finished', and perform best under pressure. 

Because of this, I feel that every time I am on the phone the priority is business business business and there is no time to idle. 

While I form a good rapport with my customers through solving problems together and being a little too honest, there is an element of personal touch I'm clearly missing. At times I feel I am rushing someone off the phone once a deal is done, but in reality I just don't have anything more to say. 

Don't get me wrong I'm not a brick wall or anything, but smalltalk outside of the weather (only been in the UK a year but I fell in line with this quick) and the weekend *feels* like a chore.

I've started to isolate each interaction and focus on just the call I'm on, while I'm on it, not what my best move afterwards is going to be. Either my attempt at non car talk to fill a silence is fucking benign, comes of as sarcastic or is about something I have little to no interest in e.g sports. 

While I'm not here to make friends, or asking anyone to pour their heart and soul out to me for 40 minutes plus every time we talk, any tips for low effort conversational pieces would be incredibly helpful.

1hait0i,Partner asked to work voluntary overtime.,"TL;DR: My partner is an exceptionally talented chemist but underpaid and overburdened at work. She’s being asked to voluntarily put in extra hours for a potentially groundbreaking project, which she’s excited about. I think her company might be taking advantage of her, so I suggested seeing a work lawyer to ensure she’s protected. She was surprised by this suggestion and now I’m wondering if I’m overreacting.

\---

My partner works in a niche industry as a chemist. Over the past few years, she’s won awards and earned significant recognition for her contributions at work. Her success stems from her passion and dedication, aided by her background of being from a prestigious research group.

However, the company seems to be on shaky financial ground and is pressuring her department to develop a more marketable product. This has led to long hours, weekend work, and sleepless nights, especially for her, as her expertise makes her a key contributor. In spite of this, she's done everything she could to also support me at home and not let work impact our relationship.

Recently, the company’s CSO approached her with a proposal to collaborate more closely — essentially adding extra work outside regular hours. The offer is framed as voluntary and driven by shared scientific passion, it’s heavily implied that this additional effort is critical to meeting the team’s goals. That said, the CSO also made it clear that they would not hold it against her if she declines and that family understandably comes first.

My partner is torn. She’s excited about the opportunity, believing it could lead to a major breakthrough in her field. Her only hesitation is the potential impact on our relationship. I told her I support her 100% and sincerely feel this way. She's an incredible woman. She discusses her research with me every day despite it all going over my head. Her passion is so contagious that I feel energized just thinking about it. I also don't want to rob her opportunity of being a significant contributor to her field.

However, I’m concerned about her well-being and fairness. She’s already under significant pressure, and I don’t want her health or career to suffer. She was hired as a junior but was quickly reassessed to be intermediate. This resulted in a 25% pay bump over the last two years but she admits she still feels underpaid. She’s also shouldering disproportionate responsibilities compared to her peers, managing a team without the title or pay to match, and working weekends when others don’t. She's also managing lab equipment and has achieved certifications that no one else has. The fact that the CSO made this proposition to just her is also telling in her abilities and knowledge compared to everyone else.

The nature of her work involves intellectual property (IP), patents, and publications. There’s a precedent in her company of scientists being excluded from patents due to politics, which I want her to be protected from.

I suggested consulting a work lawyer to ensure her rights are protected and possibly negotiate better terms. She was surprised as she felt her company was pretty generous with her raises during the last 2 years despite feeling undervalued. Her reaction made me question if I’m being overly cautious.

Having almost a decade of work experience in a different industry, I've personally been exploited in the workplace through my passion and have developed a pessimistic and jaded mindset. I don't lose a wink of sleep telling people to fuck off when asked to do anything remotely outside my contractual job responsibilities. She, on the other hand, is an amazing woman who is more trusting and self-sacrificing and has always been for as long as I've known her. My intent is not to discourage her passion but to make sure she’s treated fairly and protected, especially given the risks she’s taking.

So, my questions are:

1. Am I overreacting?

 2. Would seeing a work lawyer be helpful? What would I even tell them? What are examples of things they might suggest?

 3. Could this backfire and harm her relationship with her company or reputation in her small scientific community?

1hahuw6,Stay or Pick New Internship — Not Sure,"I am a senior graduating this April. Been HR interning at a company since the summer, and I was offered to extend it to the end of the fall/year, which I accepted. Under the impression that the internship might not get extended for the spring, I started to apply to other internships for the spring as a back up. 

I immediately received an offer for an internship that is over $7 above what I currently make an hour, at a much larger company, guaranteed position after graduation, and within 5 minutes of my new apartment I'm moving into this week. I ended up signing the offer a week later after debating. 

After talking to my manager (who was excited for me), she said that she was working on potentially having me work as a full-time recruiter remotely while at school if I wanted. I'm not a huge fan of recruiting, but she also encouraged me to apply for one of the open Generalist positions and we'd work out details if picked. I'd likely be able to work remotely for this job, but after graduation, it'd be in person at the HQ (over 2 hours away), which wouldn't work with my lease. 

I'm not sure what to do. I absolutely LOVE my current internship and the people there, and a full time position before graduation is always a huge plus, but it might be better to move on. Backing out of the offer is a horrible look too. 

**TL;DR:** Senior graduating in April. Love my current HR internship but accepted a spring internship at a larger company with higher pay, a better location, and likely a job after graduation. Current manager offered potential full-time recruiter or maybe Generalist, but they involve remote work now and relocating later, which conflicts with my lease.

1haghek,How can I stop feeling bad from comparing my job offers to my friends’? And how can I stop feeling discouraged after rejection?,"I’m a senior in college and everyone around me is getting their job offers. I’ve been applying nonstop and interviewing and making it to multiple final rounds before ultimately getting cut. I have one offer, but it’s not for a job I think I’ll enjoy. It’s a good job objectively, but it was kind of a backup plan for me just because I connected well with recruiters, not because it’s something I’m super passionate about.

My friends are all incredible people and very successful. They have all received absolutely insane job offers (I’m talking 6 figures right out of college). I’m very lucky to be surrounded by such a group that pushes me to be better, but I also feel bad about myself because of self-comparison. 

To me, your salary is your marketplace value in the workforce. Mine being so much lower than all of my closest friends in the same field just makes me feel like I’m worth less. I mean, technically my time is worth less because I’m paid less for it. 

I think if I was doing a job I loved I wouldn’t care so much. But after hundreds of applications to jobs I was excited about, only getting a job that was a safety net just feels disappointing. I love all of the people from the company I was offered a job at, and they are the reason I even applied or went through the process anyway. I’m very grateful that I have an offer at all. 

It’s just so disappointing when I look at my friends all getting their dream jobs and being paid so well. I’m not talking one or two friends either. More than 10 friends I know in my field have much better job offers than I do. 

Until now I’ve always felt very good about my accomplishments. My resume is stacked with great corporate-world and internship experience, along with leadership positions in every campus organization I’ve been a part of. I seem to interview well (at least I do make it to final rounds). But this job hunting experience has really taken a toll on my confidence. Just today I got rejected after EIGHT interviews with the same company and being told “You have nothing to worry about, I’ll see you back here!” by an employee. 

This whole process has been very disheartening and it’s hard not to compare myself to my friends. Especially when they’re so excited about their new jobs that they want to talk about it a lot.

How can I stop comparing my career value to my friends and stop feeling so bad for myself? I hate to be ungrateful that I got an offer at all.",ThrowRAPlinko,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1733768698,2024-12-09 18:24:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1haghek/how_can_i_stop_feeling_bad_from_comparing_my_job/,12,2024

1hafu76,Having a Job but No Work.,"Qualifications: 2024 B. Tech CSE passout, mostly leaning towards Data Science, 22 years old

This is my first job right out of college. I am, on paper, employed, but I work in a service company and there isn't any work for the foreseeable future, so I get paid a decent sum in hand every month to simply sit at home (there isn't a work location to go to unless you get a project, can't even network.)

Had I known that this is how things would get, I obviously wouldn't have opted for a job like this, but I don't think anyone could have predicted how bad things would get and frankly with the market the way it is for the past and current year I also didn't question it, because having a job in itself was a big deal.

Anyway, I sit at home, don't even need to open my work laptop, and do quite literally nothing all day. I fill my own time - I'm learning things, trying out projects and focusing on my health - but I have no idea if what I'm doing is actually going to help me in the long run.

I know for a lot of people it sounds like a dream, and I can understand that I'm privileged enough to simply have a job that pays me a salary I like. But, to me it hurts, because I'm not doing anything worthwhile. All my friends are working on something that actually has some weight. Everyone tells me this is my prime and I'm wasting it. They have something they can put as part of their resume. Meanwhile, I've got nothing.

I've got no manager I report to. Just an HR since we're on the bench. No team. Just around 200 other coworkers who were all victims of getting hired together. Most of us are sitting ducks. We don't have any external upskilling platforms, just an internal one. And I don't see much point in using it because frankly that doesn't help with getting projects and moreover, it's not like I can put that platform as something I did. You can still upload Udemy Certificates and the like on LinkedIn or your resume as part of your work, but you can't really have any tangible proof of an internal portal helping you.

I plan to go for masters in a few years time. On paper, having the stamp of working in an international company looks great. But that's literally it. My work experience, despite working, isn't actually amounting to anything. I don't even have a manager I can reach out to or anything. I'm anxious that a year down the line, when I need a recommendation from a manager for a workplace LOR, I wouldn't have anyone to ask or anyone who can definitely say they worked with me.

Mentally, it's taking a huge toll on me. I keep feeling like I'm falling into imposter syndrome and question if I ever was actually even competent enough as an employee if this is the kind of job I landed. I keep feeling like I have no actual skills, no actual strengths. People ask me what I do and I simply feel like shit if I lie about it, or worse if I tell them that I'm quite literally doing nothing.

So this is just me ranting, and trying to find out if there's something I can do such that I have something to write on my resume under this job. I'm mostly concerned about getting an LOR and how I'll justify this on my resume. I'm trying to switch, but frankly, I was thinking of waiting at least 6 months or a year before being ready for that step.  Any advice as to what I can do to combat mainly these 2 problems would help.",sixxtheshitposter,4,0.7599999904632568,3,1733767120,2024-12-09 17:58:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hafu76/having_a_job_but_no_work/,12,2024

Theres alot of micromanaging and it’s almost like the managers are out to fire you. I feel on edge at work even though I don’t do anything wrong. I’m scared of buying and using my money for bills like car insurance because of the fact that I might get fired. 

There’s low chance of moving up on the corporate ladder and only one person who the senior manager likes gets more training. I’ve received the same training and my manager tries to push me to do more but I don’t get the same opportunities. 

Furthermore, the probation period is 6 months and I’ve been hearing that they start to fire people after the busy period. Since I started work, 11 people have gotten fired or left by themselves due to managers and not being able to get better opportunities. I have constant anxiety and stress, to the point where I dream of my work and talk in my sleep about my work , lol.

1haf8kq,Has burning corporate bridges ever come back to haunt you? How important is it really to leave on good terms? ,"I am currently working as a consultant for a medium sized firm but I will be joining a new company in July as a full time associate in a rotational program. Planning out my budget now and I'm accounting for    leaving with the traditional 2 weeks of notice before I move to start my new position, but with the ability to work remotely would it be crazy to work until I'm basically pushed out? I assume I could squeeze at least an extra month of half-assed work before its put on notice. Between this and some additional PTO this could put an extra 7k-12k in my pocket which makes a huge difference for a young worker in a new city. Granted, this could ruin any prior good rapport I had built up and could eliminate any chances for rehire or using anybody as a professional reference, but if I had 10k in hand right now I wouldn't pay that price for a good reputation and a few good references. 

We always hear everyone say the importance of leaving companies on good terms and never burning bridges, but realistically this is a role that I don't ever see myself even wanting to return to, the instability of consulting is not for me, and the client I'm working on is in a completely different industry than any other companies I've worked with or entertained, not to mention being in a different state. Of course, I can't foresee the future and anything is possible, but I do feel confident about the company I'm joining and being in a rotational program I know they place more of an emphasis on investing in associates and wanting to keep them around long term. I don't foresee myself needing to look for another role for some years and by the time I might, I'm sure my resume will be more impressive than it is now and I could land another position better than this current one. 

Have any of you been in a similar situation, or had an experience where burnt bridges came back to haunt you, or the opposite where leaving on good terms has turned out to be beneficial?

1haf7xz,I want to stop working on the phones,"I would like to start by saying that I have had other jobs where I am not on the phones the entire time. My favorite role so far was called ""Rostering Specialist"" and I worked at an inventory team. My job was to work with 5 different teams to create and maintain our clients's accounts with the manufacturers and distributors, which allowed us to reduce the financial impact of charge backs by a lot of money on a monthly basis.

My role included cleaning up the client's data on the spreadsheets, uploading the accounts into the platform, making necessary updates, and keeping track of which accounts were being charged back. All of this was done through Excel and Salesforce, and my job was to clean up and streamline this process. I used Excel to upload data, provide status reports to onboarding, and financial reports to our CFO.

My goal is to do more of that. I want to be able to work at a place where I use spreadsheets often. For most of my experience, I have been doing customer service and sales over the phone, which adds up to a little over 7 years at this point, but I just want to step away from the phones.

Lately, I have been having a hard time coming to terms with the thought of having to drop everything I'm doing to pick up a call, and I am interested in a more project-based career. I am ok with being on the phone, and I love working with people, but I want to be able to at least reply to a text when I need to without having to stop the thought 3 times because the phone started ringing.

When I got hired, I met two coworkers let's call them ( Erica ) and ( Jane ) They both got hired two years before me and they're older. Jane is clearly more competent and competitive than Erica. Jane is also a workaholic and she's from a well known family with lot of connections. Let's just say she has the whole package. She's also a bully and can be manipulative and intimidating. She'll sabotage other's work and do her best to keep best projects to herself. In those past two years other coworkers got hired. 
I'm well skilled and pretty reliable. They see me as the ( right-hand) of Jane, or number two in a group of five if they were ranking us. Jane always get the best opportunities and projects where she can really showcase her skills and they keep praising her about her work so they give her more opportunities and bonuses. It's a a vicious circle. I'm far from being jealous, envious or arrogant but I'm confident in my skills I just never get the chance to show my creativity and project management skills cause they assign to me basic things and get treated as Jane's assistant even though we have same diploma..
So here's the problem, I do enjoy being in the backstage. I rather be hidden with no real opportunities for a promotion than fighting for it, playing games, game of thrones vibes... I just feel that with more responsibility, specially in old school corporate world, I'll have more engagements, meetings, stress to deal with and I guess life is too short for it.

1hadolt,Conflicted job dichotomy,"I'm looking for advice for a career fork in the road I'm stuck at and have been for months. It's affecting my mental health now and time is running out on my decision. I just don't know what to do.  
  
For context, I'm from the UK and finished my PhD in Chemistry there recently and stayed on to postdoc for a while until funding ran out. My partner is a US citizen who I met in the UK. When I was looking for jobs, I had a couple of postdoc offers in Europe, but I ended up accepting a non-research permanent position at a higher education institution in a lab in the US who sponsored my visa. This position is near where my partner grew up and so her family are nearby and it worked out perfectly at the time as my partner would have needed to return to the US as her UK visa was going to expire anyway. I've been in the position for almost 6 months and I'm finding myself dearly missing doing research.   
  
The coworkers are friendly and everyone has been very good to me since I joined. Compared to the UK job market, the pay is good (in my opinion), although a lot of my American friends have told me that they think the employer substantially low-balled me (I'm on 70K) and I could/should be making double what I'm earning. The other issue I have is I worry that I'm perhaps overqualified, although I can't tell. They hired somebody on the same pay with no PhD, which is frustrating (or am I being entitled?). There doesn't seem to be any opportunity for promotion and so I worry that in a few years' time the pay will not be commensurate with inflation. On top of this, I don't know how easy it would be to move positions on the visa that I'm on. I'm hesitant on leaving because I feel that a full-time permanent position is hard to come by (or so I think?), but I'm not convinced I feel fully fulfilled in the current role.  
  
A few months ago, a fairly prestigious postdoc fellowship came to fruition which would allow me to go out to Japan for 18 months and do research in an area that I really love doing. I'd mentioned to my partner when I met her that it could be on the cards as it was something I'd planned to apply for a couple of years in advance. The success rate was so low that I didn't think it would happen, but it did, and initially I felt sorrow because I knew I'd likely need to turn it down. This is a research group that I have collaborated with before and I have visited their labs before. Not the most glamorous, but they're doing neat science that really gives me a rush, if I'm honest. The problem here is it's temporary, it pays half of my current pay (although tax-free), I'd be abandoning my visa and I don't think I want to be a Principle Investigator. I'd have no guaranteed way of being able to permanently get back to the US in future to be with my partner and our cats. (They can't go to Japan because quarantine rules for the cats, costs and she has a part-time position here that she isn't willing to give up, which is fair enough). The skills I'd gain from the fellowship are indirectly linked to applications in defense and so US citizenship would likely be required to get a job in that area eventually.  
  
I have a lot of confidence issues that my former PhD supervisor often had to battle with me to try and boost my confidence, and recently because I've been working full time and working on leftover research papers from my PhD, I've been burnt out - delivering pretty poor content when writing these papers. My former PhD supervisor has expressed his frustration, I think because he expects better. This is hard to do when I've been working non-stop for the last 6 months both a full-time job and working on research papers in the evenings with very little contact with my former PhD supervisor and a 6 hour time-zone difference. At this point, I've lost all confidence and I'm of the mindset, well, if I can't write a research paper, what's the point of pursuing the Japanese research position, I'll just do a bad job anyway.   
  
I did explain the situation to my current employer and they were understanding, but unwilling for me to do a sabbatical or even go out there fore a shorter amount of time, as I've only been in my current role for a short time, which is fair enough I guess. They told me in a roundabout way that I was lucky to be sponsored in the first place, which is also a fair comment. I don't want to sound ungrateful.

Going through a bit of a mid career rut and wanted to get advice of peers here in similar situations with genuine feedback , rather than paying some random LinkedIn coach 1K to give me generic advice … currently have about 8-9 years of experience in data analytics. Initially started off doing data development /ETL work in consulting then moved to BI projects which I really liked. Thought this was my passion and moved into industry to get out of 100 hour weeks, to work on Tableau and SQL. Was in a shitty startup at first then now moved to a FAANG doing BI. Been more stable in a bigger company but I feel like the work has become stale and I’m doing automation work I used to do like 10 years ago at entry level. I want to grow and learn new interesting tools , platforms but not able to get that in my current role. Am thinking about going into Data engineering as I don’t want to become a PM and feel there’s a lot more technical problem solving and thinking in DE. Getting too bored of just using tableau , quick sight and SQL doing repetitive kind of work . Anyone been in similar situations and have career advice ? Basically TLDR, where do you grow from here mid career in BI ? Feel you hit a ceiling in terms of visualisation work and SQL. Are there any other good tools in BI to pick up ? Or is it better to look at a career transition to data science or DE after being in BI for a decade ??

1hacog8,Viable alternatives to software development for a Physics BA,"Hello, recently I transitioned and since doing so have felt a bit more negativity from superiors at my current job. Nothing negative has happened but I am beginning to think it would make sense to have an alternate career path prepared; I work as an SWE, and the field is incredibly competitive right now so I would not be shocked if it would take a year+ to find a new position. I've been at my current company for about 5 years now.

I have a BA in physics, and am working on an MS in CS - beside other software development positions, could anyone please make suggestions for other positions that my background would be reasonable for me to apply into in the worst case scenario?

Whatever positions might be considered don't have to be competitive with my current income - moving to have an easier budget is something I'm very open to.",Sure_Angle_5900,1,1.0,0,1733759275,2024-12-09 15:47:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hacog8/viable_alternatives_to_software_development_for_a/,12,2024

1hach3p,Conflicted about a promotion,"I’ve been with the company for almost 8 years and was recently promoted to Program Director, but I’m feeling unhappy and unqualified. The reason my boss values me is because of my diligent work, attention to detail, and ability to automate and streamline reporting. However, I can’t shake the feeling that this promotion just doesn’t suit me.

For one, being a director means I’d have to participate in meetings a lot more often, and I really dislike meetings. I barely speak in them, struggle to think on my feet, and have social anxiety overall. Secondly, I feel unqualified for the position, both in terms of knowledge and experience, and I don't think I would thrive in it. As an introvert, I’ve always preferred the technical track, but in a small company, that doesn’t leave much room for growth.

I’m also worried about how my coworkers will perceive my promotion. I work from home, don’t interact much with others, and I’m quiet and awkward when it comes to socializing.

Is it bad if I turn down the promotion (it was only a 7% raise)? What should I say to my boss so I don’t come off as lazy or unambitious? Or should I just take it and try to “fake it ‘til I make it,” even though I don’t think I’ll ever feel comfortable? Or maybe I should start looking for a job that focuses more on the technical side?",Routerwifi123,1,1.0,2,1733758721,2024-12-09 15:38:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hach3p/conflicted_about_a_promotion/,12,2024

1haay5x,Lost as a Computer Science Student – Need Advice on What to Do Next? ,"Hi everyone,

I’m a second-year Computer Science Engineering student, and I’m feeling quite lost about my future path. Here’s my situation:

I know Java, C, and Python, and initially, I thought of diving deeper into Web Development. But after learning about no-code AI tools, I started feeling like coding might become less significant in that field and lost interest.

I explored Data Science, which was fascinating, and then moved into Machine Learning (ML). However, ML felt overwhelming because I didn’t feel hands-on enough. I tried the FAST.AI Neural Networks course, which was great, but again, I lost interest midway and stopped.

Now, I feel like I’m not justifying my role as an engineering student. I want to create something impactful and meaningful, so I’ve been considering using no-code AI tools to bring my ideas to life. But I’m not sure if that’s the right direction.

I’m not just looking for advice on choosing a domain—I also want to know what else I should focus on next. Should I work on personal projects? Participate in hackathons? Learn new technologies? Build a portfolio?

1ha9bpw,Should I leave my current job to direct my own nonprofit? ,"Long story short, I started a nonprofit a few years ago (I’ll spare the details to keep this post short) and was pretty much running its programs, fundraising, and marketing for two years. I had little business experience at the time and wasn’t earning a ton. Eventually I  had to put everything to the side when I got a full time job. TLDR, we applied for several grants during that time and we’re just notified that we recieved around $15k in unrestricted funding — enough to pay myself for at least several months to be on the ground again full time and get more money for our programs and operations. I currently lead the marketing and development department at a nonprofit in my hometown and have done really well the last few years but feel like my attention and creativity are split. I’m a contractor and make $2k each month plus an additional $55/hr for overtime. Not much but I don’t pay rent so it’s a nice income. 

Anyway, I’m thrilled about this grant money and feel confident I can double it in 5-6 months if I’m all in. This has always been my end goal and it feels like the stars aligning. I also suspect we’ll receive more grant money this spring.

1ha89ct,Should I go to Law School? ,"
(22f) I have been working full time at my company in the communication department for almost 1 year disregarding the 1 year I spent as an intern there. I don’t feel challenged with my job role and I have been thinking about just going to law school. My boss explained to me about her trajectory in the company and it made me realise that I don’t want to end up like her. She makes on the low end of 6 figures but it took her 10 years to get that. I just want a job with a good salary and one where it isn’t going to take me 10 years to get there. I thought law school might be an options but my grades are mediocre so might be hard for me to get to a t20 school to even get the chance to work in big law. Same would apply if I got my MBA. I don’t want to go to law school and then not get a six figured salary job after graduating cause I could maneuver my way in public relations and get that but might take long.

The reason I even like law school is because I feel like being a lawyer certains a great future for me and it’s a repeatable job, something I fear my current job doesn’t do.
My role at my current job is so niche that moving to another department would be difficult. All prior experiences are admin related too and that is surely not a sector I want to work in.

Any advice please?

1ha44it,Leaving super good benefits for better fitting role?,"I currently work in a job that I don't mind, but is certainly ""dead end"" - I don't think there is any real room for advancement. However, the company itself is fairly good to employees: SUPER good benefits (probably as good as it gets), consistent and expected annual raise and bonus, and decent hybrid schedule (but little flexibility for day to day changes). Pretty standard PTO and very good overall leave policies. 

I got a job offer for a role that is much more in alignment with my long term goals, sounds like a super good fit for me, and seems to be more flexible with time and days in office. Probably will open up way more doors in the long term. My concerns are that it is a smaller company, their benefits are not nearly as good (health insurance alone is costing me several hundred more a month), and while the increase in salary is pretty decent, I'm not positive that they are as consistent about raises/bonuses (it seems to be more up to discretion opposed to guaranteed). They have a fairly standard benefits package but will be unlimited PTO (which I hear can be good or bad), and it seems the options (while decent insurance, etc) will cost more than my current employer covers, and I can't seem to tell if they offer any formal leave policies outside of unlimited PTO (I guess that covers bereavement, vacation, sick, parental etc). One important perk is they seem to care very much about employee engagement and well being though.

My main concerns are:

1. While a higher salary offer, because benefits cost more and factoring in my current job's consistent annual increases, I'd be making close to that 1 year from now if I stay put (and in the meantime, raking in better benefits/perks). 
2. It seems I'll have greater overall flexibility in the new role (which is important to me), but I don't know how demanding the day to day is and my current job is fairly predictable, so wondering if I'll be head under water (and no real way to find out)
3. This new company is smaller and recently had a ton of growth. That's great but uncertain if that means anything for stability? Other end of the coin is that if it keeps growing, probably a lot of room to advance.


Do I trade really good benefits and consistent annual increases for what I anticipate to be an overall more satisfactory job and increased future opportunities, or do I stay put in my ok but more cushy and stable job and wait out something farther down the road?

The market isn't great so who knows how long until I'd get another offer, and whether that job or benefits would also beat my current one. I am leaning toward the new job because it seems to be better for me long term in my career path, but I just worry I will regret it as I realize there aren't as many perks or I'm much busier than I currently am, etc. It's been a really hard decision for me and I just keep going back and forth. Curious if anyone has been in a similar position and what you chose. What would you do here?

1ha3ad5,Renegotiating After Counter Offer,"Hello! I got a job offer a month ago and signed. The job doesn’t start until after the holidays, so I didn’t tell my employer until I was ready to give my two weeks incase they fired me and I was out of pay longer than anticipated. Now, my current job has given me a counter offer above what the salary at my new job would be. I do not want to stay with my company, but I am kicking myself wishing I could have gotten a larger salary from the new job, but timing just didn’t work out. Can I go back to my new job and ask if they can increase it any more? I have seen some comments on other posts that that’s is just starting off on a bad foot, but this company is huge. The person I would be negotiating with is in a completely different office, not even in the same state as me. So does that change anything? I am of the mind that it doesn’t hurt to ask, and the worst they could say is no. But really the worst they could do is rescind my offer and that would be super disappointing. I was told I was their first choice of candidates, and they have already announced me to the team, so hoping they wouldn’t rescind the offer. Thoughts?

Also, the salary I agreed on at the new job is slightly below what I was asking for, but it’s towards the top of the salary band and it is an improvement from my current job and salary, so initially I took it without negotiating. Now that I have a larger offer from my current employer I’m slightly less excited about the job because it’s also less PTO (wasn’t up for negotiation) and I am also missing out on my bonus. I do still want to leave my company.

1ha39ag,"25, debating on continuing Cyber Security path or pursuing becoming a Clinical Psychologist","I'm at a bit of a crossroads in my life. I'm currently in the process of getting my associate's degree in computer science, but for the longest time I've wanted to pursue psychology. I think I've wanted to study psychology longer than I've wanted to study CS. 

I like computers, I like tinkering with my machines, I like building things and I'm pretty good at it. I already have a job working as a QA. The pay is decent enough for me to afford to take care of my wife and daughter. However, I'm growing dissatisfied with my chosen career and am worried that train will only continue, I am generally bored most days.

I think part of where my head goes is, I want to dedicate my life helping people and making real connections, not just stuck in a stuffy office job being a replaceable cog in an unfeeling machine driven by little more than profit. 

I feel the main thing that has been preventing me from psychology is generally the upfront cost to do so, and wondering if I even have what it takes to get a PhD.

I'm not really sure what to do at this point. I feel like I've stifled my calling for years out of a certain fear that it will be for nothing and that I am just as likely to make as much money if not more in the tech field. I'm starting to get to the point of wondering what is worth more? Financial stability or career satisfaction.

1ha0uei,Rant: My boss and co workers are lowkey hell,"Hi! I just need to let this out, and maybe asking for advice to cope with this.  
I’m a 5th year clinical pharmacy student (moved from a different country) and I’m working part time at a kitchen to pay for my bills. Let’s start with my boss, he’s notoriously known for being an aggressive micromanaging boss, yelling and cussing at workers for the slightest inconvenience. He also does passive aggressive and sometimes even direct demeaning comments to some of my good coworkers, saying things like “you’re kinda slow huh” infront of people. Today I just had enough, I can take jokes. But this time he jokes saying “if i see you in my pharmacy, im not going in there”, all because I made a mistake of not properly cleaning one pot. First of all how does cleaning pots relate to the world of pharmacy but anyways, I know it’s not much of a comment. But as someone who worked hard for his education and honestly i’ve been chief pharmacist from my home country (finished bachelors pharmacy there so i was already licensed in my home country). But I dont think he knows that. I just laughed and stayed quiet, last thing i wanna do is blow this out of proportion. 

Now I also have another co worker, who’s also doing part time but is studying LPN. An obnoxious one to be quite frank, and I must say loves to be the center of attraction. How could I say this? She yaps a lot and when you try to reply, she doesn’t even listen or just cuts you off before getting to your point. I was very tolerant of this. One time I helped her for her assignment as she keeps on yapping about how hard it is and I computed her math question about a drug, as a means of offering to help (She said yes). She saw I was doing it differently, and starts yapping “ what are you doing?!” “you’re making it complicated” “you need to use the formula”. (Note: you didnt need a formula to solve the math question) Long story short, she tried solving it using the formula, I tried solving it on my own, she got it wrong, I got it right. Again I was tolerant of how she behaved as I was trying to help her, it was almost like a rage bait. I did it right, and somehow still get treated like shit. Oh and sometimes she pops quiz me of drugs for some reason, and whenever I get it wrong. She starts yelling “how do i know more than you? you’re a pharmacist?” “I know drugs more than him”. 

With these two combined, they have influenced more coworkers to look down on me. I admit, I’m not the best at kitchen work but i think I make NORMAL mistakes. I can tell because I’ve managed employees before and this treatment is more than just micromanagement. But I know I’m good at what I major in. I really need it tho and I think I would have to stay til Q3 of 2025 atleast before I take the foreign pharmacy exam here, and get an internship. Sometimes I think this is just some test I have to endure, as I need to save more money so I can have some safety when moving into a different city to get the internship. I know they’re just jokes but It’s getting to a point that I question “Why is my profession and educational background being mocked from something unrelated like kitchen work” “Why am I looked down upon so much here” ",DrMadMillion,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1733715729,2024-12-09 03:42:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ha0uei/rant_my_boss_and_co_workers_are_lowkey_hell/,12,2024

I should also note - I am not married to the idea of working in cyber security, it is simply an area of interest.

1h9ywej,I(22m) need help getting out of the railroad.,"Hi, I(22m) have been at the railroad for almost 4 years. I make 78k annually as an Engineer(driver) at a passenger rail where I get to clock in, get on my train, go back and forth for 6-10 hours, then clock out and go home. While this probably sounds great, the feeling of going back and forth day after day is similar to a fish in a tank. My workday is spent alone in a dark room, staring out a window because if I look away, I’m at fault if I hit and kill someone. This job is depressing, and just not meant for me.

I’ve been trying to become a police officer for over 2 years now. I’ve been approved for the American Airlines Cadet Academy, but couldn’t afford to take on a $100k loan and not make an income for the first 2 years of the path to become a pilot, additionally, I would feel guilty leaving my wife at home for however long until I got a flight back to my home base every time I worked.

My search to become a police officer was cut-off by me being so tired of my situation that I joined the Marine Corps, injured my hip, and they sent me home because I didn’t want screws in my hip at 22 years old. I’m back to trying to be a police officer, but I’d really like to work in another field that maybe would be a pay cut, but would reward me heavily in career advancing opportunities like working for Fidelity Investments or something like that.

I don’t know specifically what I’m looking for, but I know I can’t continue to do what I’m doing. I love cool cars but I wouldn’t want to work with them. Im very good with numbers, but I have a grand total of 18 college credits because I went to a railroad conductor school in Kansas.

1h9ysl1,I feel guilty and hurt,"So after I came back from mat leave, I spoke to my manager mentioning that I was very focused on my job and aspired to move up. She asked me what type of role I wanted. I detailed the title, the job description and even said if I'm lacking any competencies, I'm willing to work on them... I just need them to be identified. I said all this with confidence (not arrogance) because I had a very trusting and supportive relationship with her.

It looks like I ruffled her feathers. 4 months after that discussion, she presented me with an action plan. The plan stated that I was failing in multiple areas of my current job. When I asked her to outline what the consequences of my actions were, she could not identify them. She then proceeded to tell me that I was not ready for the role I was seeking. I then took everything with a grain of salt and tried to work on myself and prove them wrong. The action plan was supposed to last 15 weeks. We had a weekly meeting, and they just kept stacking on mistakes I made. Mistakes that were misunderstanding or related to lack of communication. I would identify the issues, and they were never documented. I was also pulled away from numerous projects, and was not given any support to actually improve. At the 7 week mark, she slapped me with another letter stating that I have failed the review to date. I simply told her that with all due respect, I still have another 7 weeks and I think I can improve. 

After that discussion, I started applying for jobs and got an offer. I realized that there was no point staying there anymore because my leadership did not have my back. They did not support me. My talents were respected elsewhere. 

2 weeks after I started the new job, they put up a posting. It was humiliating because it was the same position that I basically asked for. The entire post was basically written by me...... It felt so mean. 
There was clearly room for growth, but not for me. 

How do I get past this? I feel like I got blindsided. In my head, this betrayal is as bad as having my ex confirm on social media that he's engaged a week after breaking up with me.

1h9y6na,Previous manager is making me a bad reputation - what can I do?,"There's someone in my field who seems to really dislike me, and I can't figure out why. We graduated the same year, weren't close, but shared some friends. I keep wondering if I did something to upset her—maybe she was jealous after I received some awards she didn't? She's very competitive, or maybe it's just a personality clash.

We crossed paths throughout our careers and things were fine until she was promoted to manager and started lowkey bullying me. She'd dismiss and discredit me, avoid meeting with me, and shut down any discussions. It got worse when a new director whom I'd call a textbook narcissist, joined the company. They both teamed up to get rid of me.

Since I had been at the company long before either of them and had only good reviews, they had to fabricate something. In my performance review, they claimed I had been dishonest. In person, one said I had lied. It hurt because I can't lie, it's in my personality. Quite the contrary and I often get in trouble for telling the truth that no one wants to hear. When I confronted them and asked for specific examples, they couldn't provide any—one of them said it was just a ""general feeling of dishonesty.""  whatever that means. They also criticized my presentation skills, saying I didn’t seem confident. As an introvert, I admitted I’d try to improve, but she coldly suggested, ""You should see a doctor, they have pills for that.""

In the end, they couldn't use the review as grounds to fire me, so they let me go, citing ""changing company priorities."" Honestly, I was relieved to leave, especially with a generous termination package.

Fast forward 10 years, and I suspect this person has spread negative rumors about me. Recently, I went through a lengthy interview process for a job, only to be rejected at the final stage. They checked my references but also likely asked around, it's a small industry—since the company I applied to is now a supplier for the brand she works at, I’m sure her influence cost me the job.

1h9xzx4,I need advice!,"Hi, 

I want your advice in regard to which undergraduate program I should apply to. I've been searching on the internet looking for information about the robotics job market since I'm an international and It matters to me whether there's a good chance of getting H1B/GC sponsorship. 

I noticed how many robotics engineers with graduate degrees are complaining on Reddit about the lack of jobs and the barriers to entry since a Ph.D. with experience is the average requirement and generally the oversaturation of an already small job market and people trying to get out of it by focusing on, I read that the problem is robotics is still not popping off like everyone is expecting, being very interdisciplinary it's better to commit to a narrow area of expertise because those always beat a generalist robotics engineer except for startups, like Controls, embedded systems engineering, Sensors, and signal processing, even automation..., also you only learn 25% of robotics from your EE/CS/ME the rest comes with experience through projects and working with others, those are all reasons that do push me to think that the Bachelor's of science in Engineering, Robotics, and Automation is definitely the better option for employment opportunities whether in Robotics, Robotics Related Jobs like Automation or Control...

however, I am still concerned about the program being too specialized and I would be pigeon-holing myself as a complete beginner, lack of programming classes for a robotics-related degree and its accreditation most of all since the program is 2/3 ME and The school is not even accredited in mechanical engineering. In fact, it looks like they offer mechanical, civil, robotics and electrical power all under this same umbrella, which is something that does not inspire confidence in me given that WCU is not accredited in mechanical engineering OR in this robotics-flavored ME degree. Could also present some risk if I want to go straight to a grad program where my BS is all they can really look at. also it looks like they've put a fancier dress on mechatronics or engineering technology according to some dude; [https://www.wcu.edu/\_files/cet/BSERA8SemesterPlan.pdf](https://www.wcu.edu/_files/cet/BSERA8SemesterPlan.pdf)",Few_Attorney_4651,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1733706649,2024-12-09 01:10:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h9xzx4/i_need_advice/,12,2024

1h9xwsh,Wasted time in the wrong field,"I feel like I wasted so much time working in the affordable housing property management field. I've been in this field since 2008, taking on various roles. Over the years, I've developed a versatile skill set because the job has been incredibly demanding and consistently challenging. In this field, you have to be legally savvy. You need to have a deep understanding of compliance and the ability to apply federal, state and local regulations when administering housing programs. You need to be able to communicate and collaborate with various government agencies. You need to be knowledgeable about building codes and safety protocols. You are constantly responsible for tenants, many of whom are part of vulnerable populations such as elderly and disabled. You are responsible for personnel-hiring, performance review, disciplinary issues, and firing. You are crisis manager, people manager, risk manager, project manager, social worker and so mush more all in one. In my regional role, I managed managers, wrote budgets, performed financial analysis, handled monthly accounting.

This job demands extraordinary emotional intelligence and strenght. You will be insulted, threatened, and even assaulted. You will witness horrific situations. Despite all this, the salary for the front line positions is low, but managers often get a free apartment. Once you are a regional manager or higher, you can start earning decent salary. This field often does not require a degree. Majority of people working in this field are terrible at their jobs.

My last position was as a regional manager. If I wanted to I could continue climbing the ladder to director and eventually VP. But I don't want to. I am done. Even though I know I have a valuable skill set and nothing scares me anymore, I have no idea what to do next. I'm almost 40 years old with a bachelor's degree in business. I feel like people see me just as a property manager without understanding the complexity and depth of what my job actually entailed. I struggle to articulate my skills at job interviews and have no idea how to sell myself.

1h9wwxw,Thoughts on relocating for a job then leaving and repaying relo,"I moved to a new city for a role and received a relocation allowance with a clause that if I left within a certain timeframe I may have to pay a portion of it back, which is normal and agreeable. 

after two years, a new opportunity came my way and I decided to leave, knowing I was expected to repay a portion. I was provided an estimate repayment. It took the company a year after I left to send me the final bill. no problem, but the actual repayment was way more than the estimate. 

I have no problem making a repayment but I’m less excited because they were not transparent with the final amount and their only answer is “sorry.”

I talked to one of my friends who work in recruiting and she says a lot of people don’t even pay back the relo and ignore the repayment request. I don’t want to do that in case they end up sending me to collections. I agree to what conditions I signed under but I have a problem with the “extra“ payment amounts. Because some of it’s taxes, I can’t confirm or deny they are actual costs (I assume because they are Telling me that they are, they are legit), but no one can really answer why the docs given to me about what was paid on behalf of my relo are different than what’s being presented to me a year later. 

Do you have any suggestions or tips? Do I pay the whole thing and move on? Or do I negotiate with the original estimate. Clearly expected that the original estimate was an estimate, but the difference between the two are wildly significant.

1h9vwpi,My director suddenly got terminated after being with the company for 20 years,"Unemployment
For context, our director was supposed to retire last year since he is in his late 70s, but he decided to stay to ensure our team was taken care of and looked after once he left. However, he had confirmed he would retire next year.

Last Friday, we suddenly had an emergency call with him and his boss. During the meeting, he announced it was his last day because his role had been terminated, and we were being placed under a new director.

We were all devastated because he genuinely looked after our team and always defended us when we were in the right, especially process-wise. He wasn’t the type to appease customers for the sake of it. If he knew we were right, he stood up for us.

The suddenness of his departure shocked us all, including him.

Now, the question is: are we getting laid off? Is our team being let go?

My boss has had bad blood with one of our customers, which resulted in our team being excluded from the contract renewal.

With our director—who was the backbone of our team—gone, I’m really scared I might lose my job. To make matters worse, I’ve only been with the company for six months. I feel like I’d be the first one to go since letting me go wouldn’t cost the company as much compared to my colleagues, who have been here for five years or more.

My manager assured me we wouldn’t be laid off, but I can’t help but feel uncertain.

Back story. I am an immigrant to Canada with 2 years work experience as product owner from prior. Came to Canada, did MBA and got a job back in Jan 2022. When I came to Canada, the product from my current company really intrigued me and back in f my head I had decided to work for them when I graduate. It was a startup and the startup culture really fascinated me as I myself had a run a startup before deciding to move here. Anyways, I accepted the offer they put forth back then as it was difficult to get a job as economy was recovering and I just needs to get job to get that “Canadian Experience”.
6 months in they were acquired by a global firm. Over the last 3 years, my position was changed from implementation specialist to product lead to back to implementation specialist. And now with all the restructuring, I will be tagged a data analyst. After a bit of research in salary scale of the firm in Glassdoor, I found that, they removed role as product lead to implementation specialist as the salary they would have to give would be more. Anyways, as we have a really independent operations from the acquirer, no one really cared about the role changes. Happened with all. Another thing that I observed in Canadian market is that no one really care about designations or changing jobs for better pay or value in the work they are doing. People are really happy with whatever they are doing. They prefer to assume private jobs as a govt job.

Anyways, I don’t think I will be growing in this company as we most of the development and other stuff is moving back to India (irony I came from India and I was sent to set up a team at the start of year. ).

What job boards do you prefer to apply from? I have LinkedIn and indeed. I have heard of flex job. If you guys have any suggestions, that are great, please let me know. Plus is there job boards where we submit our profile and recruiters come and find you, instead of us applying randomly.

The problem is, it gives me no energy and is actually becoming a drain. I got to where I am through a graduate programme. What that means is I’ve developed quickly in this context and acquired certain skills, but my experience may not measure up as well in an external environment.

I have worked in the restaurant and food service industry for most of that time, primarily as a cook/chef. 7 years ago I started a catering business with a friend of mine, and it has done well (as food service businesses go). I am planning a move to a proper city in about a year's time, and badly want to find myself a job/project/business/career NOT in food service or restaurants.

I still cook occasionally, but I basically stopped being a chef about 3 years ago and just run the business now. That includes bookkeeping, marketing, website design and maintenance, event planning, payroll, logistics, inventory management, compliance, staffing, payment systems, and more. Additionally, in the last 3 years my partners and I built a restaurant with a full bar and a complete commercial kitchen from the ground up, and we did about 80% of the work with our own 6 hands.

I excel at planning and logistics, problem solving (often through innovation), I am by nature very organized (my partners might say a bit to a fault) and have an atypically sharp memory. I truly enjoy learning new skills and, thanks to some savings, some solid investments, and my share of the business profits, I don't need to command a huge salary out of the gate.

I want to find something that I can do and enjoy, ideally for the next 20 years. I'm in good physical and mental shape, so no limiting constraints there. Single, no kids, no pets.

I (M34) just lost my job as a business analyst at a bank. I spent 6 years in this role prior to being a credit analyst for commercial lending at two different banks. My background is not computer science or business systems but I learned stuff on this role. I was in charge of the financial analysis platform that users at the bank use for underwriting. Very complex system. I configured a bunch of stuff using my commercial credit analyst experience and served as liaison between the vendor and the bank. The loans this bank makes are ag based so I am familiar with that industry, too. Salary was very competitive (at around 106k plus a 20% bonus in January and very decent benefits). 

I am not sure if going back to commercial lending and taking a pay cut or continuing as business analyst. Tbh, I didn't like systems/tech that much because I didn't have that background and people around me did not have neither the patience nor time to teach me correctly. Yeah, I could have learned on my own but it was not the same and I was dealing with other issues at home and personally.

I am actively looking on linkedin and indeed but I am not sure what position I can add value to. I have an acquaintance who works underwriting credit cards for businesses and makes good money so maybe I can start there.

I'm fairly new to reddit and posting. I am searching for advice on my first full time job and landed an on site interview with a company after 2 rounds of interviews. I had 1 interview with HR and another with an engineer where they got to know me and asked about previous experience and how I handled things. I also took a behavioral assessment (Caliper). According to the schedule I was given, I am doing a panel interview with the Plant Manager, Quality Manager and Maintenance Manager, taking a plant tour and having lunch, and then another panel interview with the Production Manager and Lean Manager.

The job is for a 2 year Engineering Development Program as an associate engineer at one of the company's manufacturing plants that involves rotations, trainings, mentorship, and opportunities to work on projects.

My question for everyone is what should I expect from this? How should I prepare myself besides STARing my experiences? I can't seem to find anything online about the interview process for the company so its been difficult, especially being first-gen, I have no clue about the process. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

1h9ogmr,PharmD or NP?,"I'm in between two career choices - Pharmacist and Pediatric Nurse Practitioner (PNP)

A little backstory on me, I'm currently a Registered Nurse working on a pediatric Med-Surg unit. However, prior to becoming a nurse, I was a pharmacy technician for 8 years so I'm definitely familiar with the field of pharmacy and enjoyed it as well. I can't say I love being a bedside nurse, but I do enjoy working with children and love the thought of one day being a provider, preferably in an inpatient hospital setting. I love learning and being able to critically think on that level. On the other hand, I enjoy Pharmacy and have the pre-requisites done for the PharmD program. However, I would want to specialize and don't know if I can do that without a residency and with time being a factor, I'm not sure I would want to complete a residency. I feel like the internet has very negative thoughts on both careers, which makes this difficult for me. 

I would love to hear from people who work either job. And yes, I do understand the role of a pharmacist very well, as I have worked along side them for years. I understand the role of the NP as well, as my sister is a FNP. I live in a city where we have three major children hospitals, but my concern with doing PNP is not getting a job if the field is becoming too saturated. I'm not sure if that goes for PNP's, but I know they say FNPs are becoming oversaturated and I'm honestly not too interested in the FNP track anyways. I also hear that Pharmacy is not a growing field right now, so that concerns me as well.

1h9mpup,Would this be a good career move?,"I want some guidance on my next career move.

I'm in the local government field, not a politician, but a public servant. I've been working in water and wastewater treatment for around 6 and a half years. The past couple years I have been a supervisor over water quality/compliance matters, leading a team of 3 and a budget of around $400k. I absolutely love water quality and everything that goes with it.

I just got a master's in public administration (basically like an MBA but for government). My ultimate goal is to either be a city utilities director or a public works director. Most cities put the two together into just ""public works"" unless it's a big city, then they may have a separate utilities director. Public works would consist of more than just water and wastewater, including streets, traffic, drainage, maintenance, etc. Once again I mainly just care about water and wastewater,  but realistically I know that I need to expand my knowledge to all of public works to help future chances of being a director. 

So now my dilemma is that I've been offered a job at another city to be the public works superintendent (basically third in line behind director and assistant director). But, I would only be over streets, drainage, traffic, maintenance, and fleet services. No water and wastewater duties. There is a definite raise involved. And I would gain much more manager experience as I would oversee about 23 people and manage a budget of $5 million or more. And I would fill in the gaps in experience I have in these other public works areas. However, I would miss water and wastewater.

1h9mctt,Good Team Jobs?,"I'm 23 and struggling to find what kind of career I should stick with long term. Right now I'm working baking and some customer service at a small bakery, and it's okay, but it is barely any hours, and it's minimum wage. I'm contempt with this for now, because I'll be moving out soon, so I don't want to look for anything with too much commitment in my current town, but then what happens when I move? My plan to move out is solid so far, except for what kind of job I should look for when I leave. So far I've only ever worked in food service, my first job in a fast food place (which went pretty badly for a number of obvious reasons), and the current bakery. I stick with food service because it's the only thing I know how to do, but I don't want to aim too high in that field, as I know the amount of pressure high-end restaurants can put on you, and I doubt I'd be able to handle it with my high anxiety levels. And I can't aim too low, because those places either won't pay enough, or won't give enough hours. So I don't think pursuing this long-term is a good idea, for my sanity, or my bank account.

But after thinking about it a lot, I realize I actually sometimes miss that first fast food job. Not because of the job itself, it was terrible, had terrible corporate meddling, hours, pay, etc. But because I struck gold with the crew I worked with. Most of us got along and bonded in a very personal way, part of it was because we needed to support each other sometimes in our shared bad conditions, but also because we really did care about each other, and in a job like that we had plenty of time to interact with and help each other. At times we really had a family-like dynamic.

And I realize that's what's missing from my current life, that sense of community. There's a lot of things I'm considering when thinking about future careers (namely figuring out what I can handle without getting a panic attack) but I now realize finding a new job where I can work closely with my coworkers is important too. I want another group that I can work with as true friends, but I don't know what kind of jobs allow that. And of course, it's possible I just got really lucky the first time, and I could end up with bad people.

1h9jtcc,Debating quitting new job after 2 months - Feeling very lost!,"
Hi everyone,

I (27F) started a new job a little over two months ago, and it’s been a complete whirlwind. From the very beginning, there was no training, no information packet, no organizational chart—nothing to set me up for success. For the first two weeks, I had to use my own iPad and personal email address to handle work tasks. At one point, I had to use my personal credit card to make a company purchase (which I am waiting to get reimbursed).

On top of that, I’ve been working 14-hour days regularly. One of my responsibilities is hiring new staff, but no one has given me guidance on how to do this—no process, no forms, no resources despite being part of a larger parent company (and believe me I am asking). Everyone is inundated with work which I understand but there is no proactive support… only when things go wrong is there intervention from the higher ups. 

This job is seriously affecting my mental health. I feel overwhelmed, lost, and like I’m constantly drowning. I’ve started questioning everything—my career path, my skills, and even whether I want to stay in this field at all (which I absolutely do not want to… this is not what I want to build my life around). Grad school has always been a goal of mine and I feel like quitting this current job so I can once and for all pivot from hospitality to counseling. I’ve never committed because I’ve had to stay a float financially. But the stress of this job has me at a breaking point. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? I don’t know if I should try to stick it out or cut my losses and leave before I burn out completely. I am also afraid of my current supervisors opinions of me because I would be leaving them in a shitty situation (for context the person in my position before me quit with no notice after two weeks). Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks for reading.


TLDR; TL;DR: New job, no training or support, 14-hour days, using personal resources. Mental health is suffering, and I want to leave the field for grad school. Unsure if I should quit now.

1h9jowl,What masters degree should I do? ,"I’ll preface this by saying I am aware no amount of degrees can guarantee success in your career! 

I really want to go back to college, I love learning, love the academic work and research but I’m between a lot of options for a masters degree. 

For some history; I have an undergraduate degree in Fine Art and since that degree I have been working full time in a national trade union for 3 years. I also sit on two company boards as a director voluntarily. 

Outside of work, I organise events like DJ gigs, live music gigs, drag shows, all selling out - I completely manage these gigs from promotion, hiring, paying performers, etc.

I have thought about returning to Fine Art for my Masters, maybe an Events Management masters, a project management masters etc.

I would love for my career to be involved in the arts always, I also like the idea of management in general! Hopefully I’m not being too whimsical with this post.

My question is - what would you do if you were me?",lesbianbog,2,0.6700000166893005,3,1733667233,2024-12-08 14:13:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h9jowl/what_masters_degree_should_i_do/,12,2024
1h9jool,I'm (27F) abhout to finish medschool and been told I'd be hard to be with ,"I am a female, 27 years old, about to finish medschool and becoming a medical doctor. 

Well, I've always though that achieving my goals and having a good profession is important. I wanted to be able to provide something too, not just replace crappy jobs every 4 months and be dependant on my spouse... I want to make my family happy, my kids happy. 



Yesterday, I have been told by a guy that my high earning potential might drive away some men from wanting to be with me.



I just want to say, that for the next 6 years until i will finish residency, my salary will be around 65K per year before taxes. I am planning to go to a less demanding field, like Family Medicine or Pediatrics, so I will have a nice amount of free time. 

  
It just makes me so sad. Why? why is it that when women are successfull it's a threat for some man's masculinity? 



I hate it that when men are successull, they are free to choose whoever they want, they are looked upon and respected, but women are expected to find someone who's able to deal with her success, and is expected to make a lot of sacrifices to be the stereotypical ""good wife"". 



Pesonally i wouldn't mind how much money a man has or what's his job as long as he's mature and responsible. 

  
It just feels so unfair.

1h9j0l7,Please help; Salary negotiation with variable pay challenges!!,"Hi everyone,

I’m seeking advice on handling salary negotiations, particularly around the structure of my current compensation and how it might affect offers from potential employers.

Here’s the situation:

	• My current compensation includes a significant bonus component, which is officially labeled as “performance-linked” in my documents. However, in practice, this bonus is almost guaranteed and tied to my grade, not individual performance evaluations.
	• Because of this, the fixed portion of my salary is much lower than my total package.

I’m currently applying to multinational companies, and I’m concerned about a few things:

	1.	Potential employers might only consider the fixed portion of my salary during negotiations, which doesn’t fairly reflect my total earning potential.
	2.	Since the bonus is documented as performance-linked, I’m unsure how to explain that it’s effectively fixed without creating complications or misunderstandings.
	3.	If they insist on focusing on the fixed portion, would it be reasonable to negotiate a higher hike percentage on that base to align with my expectations?

I also help around with my family's medical business. I want to move out along with my mother and sister as I have a toxic father. 

Currently, I'm doing my MBA online, why? ( due to personal reasons), I'm good at analytics (data, business, finance) , design and sometimes write blogs(medium) . I have good negotiation, communication skills with people I'm familiar with. I can learn things quickly if I am given clear instructions. 

I only have theoretical knowledge on these subjects. I am part of the Google student clubs of college, I have good certifications from LinkedIn and datacamp. I also have certificates from virtual internships. ( don't worry I haven't paid for any of the above they were given along with my degree). I wanted to start my own clothing brand but failed because of restriction at home. 

I want to land a job but for that I see a lot of requirements for experience and internships which I don't have. 
I want to have a wfh job so that I have enough money to move out. 
I love repetitive work, I'm good with numbers data, business analysis, financial analysis, not so great at math ( imposter syndrome kicking in). 
I have learnt my lesson, and hence I will be applying for placements during my 3rd semester. 

Since I never had a real corporate job, I'm unaware of how the companies work. I want to prepare myself interviews during my placements. 

Advice : how do I land remote internships? ( I feel it's stupid to travel a lot if I'm earning little to nothing at internships). 

What are the skills and requirements for a roles in analytics for full time jobs ( wfh)? 

I want to be active on linkedln but I feel its kind of cringe because of my stupid imposter syndrome how do I overcome it? What do I post or follow?

1h9dzgz,I Let My Inner Critic Sabotage My Career—Here’s How CBT Helped Me Take Control,"A few years ago, I remember sitting alone in my apartment after a tough day at work. My inner voice kept saying, “You messed up again,” and “They’ll never respect you.” Those thoughts felt so real and crushing that I believed them without question. I’d already been to over 50 therapy sessions in my life, learned a ton about mental health, and was even pursuing an online master’s in psychology. Yet, I still struggled when that harsh inner critic showed up, telling me I wasn’t good enough.

That’s where Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) came into play. One of the core insights from CBT is that our thoughts aren’t always factual. Just because that inner voice says something doesn’t mean it’s true. Many of us have what psychologists call **cognitive distortions**—twisted ways of interpreting reality. These distortions often fuel our inner critic, making us view ourselves through a warped lens. For instance, “all-or-nothing thinking” can make a small mistake feel like total failure, while “mind reading” convinces us we know what others think, even though we have no evidence.

What people often don’t know is that the brain’s negative bias—the tendency to focus on the bad—can amplify these distortions. We evolved this bias to stay safe from threats, but in modern life, it can leave us feeling anxious and inadequate. The beauty of CBT is that it gives us tools to challenge these faulty patterns. Through techniques like **thought records**, you learn to write down the negative thought, examine the evidence for and against it, and then create a more balanced, compassionate perspective. Over time, practicing this skill literally reshapes neural pathways. Neuroplasticity—the brain’s ability to form new connections—means that by repeatedly challenging your inner critic, you train your mind to be kinder and more realistic.

I’ve found that catching these negative thoughts early helps. Let’s say I think, “I’ll never be good at this job.” I pause, ask myself what proof I have, and realize I’ve succeeded in tasks before. Maybe the truth is more like, “I’m still learning, and one slip doesn’t define my abilities.” It’s an emotional reset button—one that took practice, but each small victory made it easier.

Of course, CBT isn’t magic. It’s a skill you build slowly, like going to the gym for your mind. At first, it feels strange to question thoughts you’ve always taken at face value. But stick with it. Over weeks and months, the tone of your inner dialogue can shift from cruel judgment to supportive understanding. Remember, you spent years honing that critical voice; it’ll take time to retrain it.





**Resources That Helped Me Along the Way**

* **Books:**
   * *""Feeling Good""* by Dr. David D. BurnsA classic CBT resource that breaks down negative thought patterns and offers practical exercises to challenge them.
   * *""Self-Compassion""* by Dr. Kristin NeffFocuses on treating yourself with kindness, an essential tool for taming your inner critic and fostering emotional resilience.
* **Apps:**
   * **LePal**Created by a friend of mine, a woman in tech who overcame severe depression, LePal is geared toward those who can’t afford therapy or feel intimidated by it. It features a “spirit pet” for guided journaling, offering responses to your entries and helping you reframe unhelpful thoughts. There’s a “therapy planet” available 24/7 to process daily worries, plus the spirit pet sends weekly letters acknowledging your growth. It’s become part of my daily routine—jotting down reflections, getting gentle nudges to think differently, and feeling less alone in my journey.
   * **I Am**Sends daily affirmations customized to your needs. I set reminders throughout the day for positive messages that counteract my inner critic’s negativity. Over time, these small boosts add up, reinforcing healthier thought patterns.
   * **Insight Timer**Beyond basic meditation, it has a library of talks that specifically address self-talk and self-compassion. The community aspect—live sessions, diverse teachers—keeps me engaged and more mindful, complementing the CBT strategies I use.
* **Podcasts:**
   * **""The Mental Illness Happy Hour""**Honest conversations about mental health struggles, reminding you that you’re not alone in battling negative self-talk.
   * **""Therapy Chat""** with Laura ReaganExplores trauma, attachment, and various approaches to healing, often discussing CBT techniques for inner dialogue.





If your inner critic is loud right now, remember that you have the power to question it. CBT offers a roadmap, and with practice, you can teach yourself to speak kindly and truthfully. Over time, that negative voice can become quieter, and a more supportive, balanced perspective can take its place. You deserve that kind of understanding—from yourself. ❤️❤️",quartemidlifecrisis,3,0.6700000166893005,0,1733644546,2024-12-08 07:55:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h9dzgz/i_let_my_inner_critic_sabotage_my_careerheres_how/,12,2024
1h9doi5,Navigating a Challenging Work Dynamic While Preparing for Big Life Changes,"I’ve been with my current organisation for six years, during which I’ve transitioned through various roles. Recently, I’ve moved from a management role to a policy-focused one. My team lead is also a personal friend, which has added a layer of complexity to our professional relationship. While he is supportive in some ways, he’s a workaholic, and I’m not. I value maintaining a balance between work and my personal life, but his approach often feels controlling and dismissive.

Lately, I’ve been going through significant personal challenges, which have made things even tougher. While I expected some understanding as a friend, his behaviour has been underwhelming. For instance, when someone referred to me as a veteran in the organisation, he casually remarked, “Yes, one should strive not to be old furniture.” Comments like this, combined with his general negativity, have started to impact my mental health.

On top of this, I’m preparing to apply for master’s programmes abroad, which is a big step for me. I’m increasingly feeling that his behaviour, both professionally and personally, might be detrimental to my well-being.

I don't want to go into too many details, but I've been in a bad situation for a long time (years and years). I work at a small rural hospital where bullying is rampant. I stayed because I convinced myself that I couldn't find better, that maybe I didn't deserve better, that maybe I was overreacting somehow. I started to doubt myself, my career choice, my skills, my feelings, everything. 

I have put up with some WILD stuff. I don't even know if you'd all believe me if I told you some of the things that I have put up with here. I've been denied care as a patient.

1h9bmha,Best option?,"Hey everyone, 
I’ll keep this as short as possible. I’m using a throwaway as well.

I’m a high school kid that worked to do well in school and have got good grades and can likely go to some great schools (not Harvard or anything but possibly a tier below that).

However, I’ve always been interested in business and have been working for a person that runs their own business (made their website, ran their ads, managed customers, etc…). Over time, I’ve become closer to them and recently, he offered me to work with him for 80k/year straight after high school (managing all his online operations, he runs a contracting business), with him telling me I’ll be making 100k+ soon after.

I’m torn on what I should do. I am likely going to run my own (hopefully successful) business regardless of which way I go, and I’m not sure which path is going to help me do that the best. 

I like business and recognize that I’m going to make money and learn a lot from going to work but I also feel like I will be missing a lot by not going to a good college and getting a degree. My parents would be paying for my tuition so cost isn’t an issue.

What’s the best option? ",shatmasterr,2,1.0,7,1733634917,2024-12-08 05:15:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h9bmha/best_option/,12,2024

1h99kpp,How do I get a job with very little experience?- UK,"Crossposted.

Looking for my first proper entry level job at the age of 27- yes, I know! 
In the last 6 months I've been made redundant and then fired abruptly, so I can't really count on those roles and experience/references. The latter I'm just going to forget I even worked there since it was such a short stint before they got rid of me. 

Aside from the obvious personal development I need to go through from being let go twice, how can I get an entry level job without any relevant experience? 
Eg, I'm applying for front-of-house (waiter) positions, kitchen assistant, supermarket staff. 
The one area I have worked in before was retail, like in a shop. 
Beyond the limited part-time experience i have over 4 years ago working in a shop, I don't really have any other skills relevant for these types of roles since the last two jobs I was fired from were completely unrelated and no longer an industry I will be able to work in because of the firings- unable to get a reference. 

I was dismissed from my last role for 'Poor Customer Service', the customer didn't get a response from me for three days via email and made a complaint to a colleague which then ended up with my manager. In addition I missed an appointment booked with a customer that same week so I was dismissed.

I also don't have any restaurant or retail-specific qualifications. I have pass grades at GCSEs, all the basic stuff they ask for but not much more than that.

So as a complete newbie, and with the knowledge I'll likely struggle as a 27 year old competing with teenagers/early 20s or people with massive amounts of retail/kitchen experience, what's the best way to market myself and make a positive impression and try to score myself an entry level role? 

I'm really not too fussy; i just need a job to pay my bills rn. 
Are agencies a good idea- like can I approach them and they find me a good role? Am I better off going that route rather than applying direct with restaurants? 

Thanks in advance! ",FixRaven,1,1.0,0,1733627746,2024-12-08 03:15:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h99kpp/how_do_i_get_a_job_with_very_little_experience_uk/,12,2024

1h9756z,Need advice,"I’m 23 y/o and recently moved to NJ with my girlfriend. I graduated from college this May of 2024 with a degree in economics. I have 2 jobs. My day job is your typical 8:30am-5pm, and 40 hours a week. Was 100% my last choice, but in this job market, I felt like I had to take it after sending out ~200 applications. I make $21 an hour and I was hired through a temporary work agency. I’ve been here around two months, and am on a six month contract. It’s good work, but I feel as if I’m under compensated for the job I do. I wait tables for my second job. I work around 20-30 hours a week here. Very ideal time conditions here as I’m allowed to show up around 5:30pm and work till 10:30pm doing doubles after job 1. They put me on one day for the weekends, usually around a six hour shift, maybe a double if they need me, for a ten hour shift. I’ve been here around a month and a half

 Now here’s the fun: I barely see any of my paychecks. Post taxes I net ~700wk from job 1 and job 2 is very variable (it is serving after all). My smallest paycheck for the week has been 300$ and my largest 700$. Given the variable, I wrote out my budget for the lowest I make at my night job of 300$ and summed it up to 1000$/wk, 4000$ a month, netting 48,000$/yr. 

My bills are 1,040/month for rent (split 50/50) with my girlfriend. 550$/month for student loans (2.5 year expedited payments with an awful interest rate). I pay 320$/month for car insurance, and 230$/month for my car payment (I have 2.5 years left on it (I need a car to get to work please don’t tell me I have to get rid of it)). I have auto debit on my credit card for 500$/month ((I ran it up in school, but since moving) I use it for gas/groceries/restaurants). Utilities are 110$ a month. I pay to park my car for 125$/month (no free street parking I will be towed) and an 80/month gym membership. Sum total of 2,955$/month. 

Adding all income and subtracting expenses I net $1,045/month, 12,540/year. 

Long story short is I can afford the life that I am living, but I would definitely like to save more money, have more money to spend on myself, my girlfriend, buy Christmas presents for my family, and do all the things that I absolutely can in my free time. 

The question for you is what am I doing wrong? My day job is not one I wanted, but more so my last choice while job hunting in this awful market. I understood I wasn’t going to be making 80k right out of the gate, but I also didn’t think I would be making 40k (less after tax). I am very financially literate. I invest, I have never missed a bill, etc etc. But what I was taught in school was how to fix financial situations for other people, and never myself. I just feel as if work right now is “convenient to my situation now”, being in a new state and learning the environment, rather than being “meaningful” to me and the career I am trying to pursue. I don’t feel as if these 70 hour weeks are burning me out, but what is burning me out is my are my own thoughts right now.

Any advice will do. Tell me where I have messed up, what I could do to better my situation, if I’m just being an asshole, if I’m in over my head. Anything.

1h96pdb,At a crossroads with retraining. Nursing or medical social work?,"This spring semester I am headed back to school to take a perquisite class for a nursing program. I have a bachelor's degree in another field. I am interested nursing for a few reasons:

\- I want to work directly with people in a helping / care giving role

\- I want to work on my feet and be doing / I am a restless person, and I'm not interested in a typical office work

\- I love working 12-hour shifts 6-7 days on and 7-8 days off

\-I want to be able to find work in the places I want to live (I have a specific town in mind in-fact. It's a town of roughly 20k people). 

\-I thrive in chaotic environments

\- I've worked in a hospital previously and a genuinely enjoyed it. 

\- I like that no matter how brutal of a day I have, I clock out when my work is done and go home

\- Despite being restless, I am extremely patient when working with people and able to balance my empathy for people and myself care.

I think these qualities and interests make nursing a good fit for me, but I'm having second thoughts. I have thought for some time about an MSW, especially in a medical setting. I think this is a good fit as I think it fits my personality better. I really like being there for people in the challenging times of their life, and that's where my patience and empathy really shine. However, medical social work is more office oriented than nursing, plus I believe most opportunities fall within the typical 9-5 Monday through Friday. Further the cost and effort of retraining is higher for similar returns. Further still, there's simply less opportunities out there, and I worry a bit if I'll find the job I want in the town that I want. (I know people have to move for work, but this is something extremely important to me and my own wellbeing. Although living nearby the town I'm think of is also acceptable) That said, medical social workers are busy, and work in a variety of setting throughout the day depending on their specific roll. I also I think I would just make a better social worker for reasons I can't quite convey. This is more of a gut feeling than a logical reason. 

Regardless, I think pursuing nursing at least until I get an LPN license is a good idea.  If I choose nursing, I can continue on to my RN, and if I choose social work, I think I can get a job at a clinic with my LPN license and have much of my MSW tuition paid for. That said, I would much appreciate input from others, especially from people who work in these fields.

1h96ocg,Should I drop my pursuit for a master's in IT and switch majors to Architecture? ,"Basically the title of the post.

At the moment I am in my first semester in grad school studying for information technology, and I am 26 years old. I will graduate around summer of 2026. I enjoy the classes I think, and I think computers and networks and managing them can be fun for what they are, but I'm having second doubts now about the whole thing. I originally got into it because I thought it would be fun, which it is and can be, but looking into more research it's just now dawning me I might have messed up choosing it. 

The CS and IT fields are basically suffering the chum famine of 59. And after looking at the history of it all, it's stupid how tech workers don't unionize, or at least realize how they've been getting pushed around by these corporations and companies who don't care about them. The dot com Crash. 9/11. The 08 recession. And even now. I can't think of other career fields that tolerate a volatile market. My friends dad has been working in tech and cs for decades, survived the dot com Crash and even 08, but recently got laid off. Like what? That much experience?

After doing a lot of career assessments, looking at what I value, and a bunch of other stuff, I figured that I wanted to swap majors. My biggest concerns for IT are:

1. How volatile the tech market is
2. The ridiculous oversaturation where newbies are left to fend for t
3. Just now realizing how customer facing orientated it can be.
4. As much as I like computers and technology, staring at a screen all day gives me worse cabin fever than in the movie the shining. 

I also find it ridiculous how it's possible to invest so much time into a major or trade, only for no work. From accounting, business, finance, tech, and so on it's basically a coin flip if you graduate at the right time with the right degree with the right connections, where people don't over flood it at the same time you study it.

This was my Holland test score in case anyone wanted to look. It's just one thing, but from jobtest or that one good job tester for Alberta Canada seem to suggest architecture and also a similar profile over all.

Realistic	28
Investigative	25
Artistic	40
Social	21
Enterprising	0
Conventional	3

Anyways, I know no job or trade or apprenticeship guarantees work or a living. Stupid, but that's the world we live in for now. At the very least I want to do something that actually has meaningful impact in conjugation with who I am and what I believe in.  

Also I know my artistic field is high. I'm already a writer, oil painter, woodworker, knapper, musician and digital artist in my free time. I like doing it for me, and while I have done good things with it and even managed to publish a novel which sold surprisingly well despite me not marketing it at all, it's something I know for a fact isn't sustainable.
I did get recommendationa for graphic designer, UI/UX, artisan, and so on that topped the list, but I'm not sure how viable they are. It's crazy how I'm having to do this to make sure I don't starve to death and die to the exposed elements.

Anyways, architecture seemed like a good compromise between it all. So unless I some other path I'm not sure where else to go from here. Thank you for any help, I appreciate it. I also for the record majored in Philosophy for my bachelor's, which I'm grateful for actually. Written and oral communication skills, as well as critical thinking, has saved me from being really up the creek. Even gotten some boring jobs with it, which is fine. Survival is survival.

Also only have about 10k in student loans. I have thought about also dropping the major and studying for CompTIA as a side thing, alongside CCNA and other stuff. My only concern is in wanting to leave the United States (long story), and I just wasn't sure how universal those certifications are.

1h969ut,What would you do in my position? (Direct Service Provider) ,"I work for a nonprofit organization that provides services for people with disabilities and focus on community inclusion and giving our clients meaningful lives. I’ve been an employee for about 4 years. Last year, there was an incident involving our client who has autism and PTSD where my client struck me on my arm while I was holding my child (they provide childcare) and my boss (who happens to also be my clients guardian) saw this happen. I understood this was a “wrong place & wrong time” (my client was mad about a situation during the previous shift and was on his way out when I came to work) when this happened but my boss who’s also our director, did not acknowledge what happened and just praised my supervisor who was also present for “handling the situation”. I was vocal that my arm hurt from being struck. My boss replied “that’s not good” and I continued my shift distance with my client. You’re probably wondering do we have a procedure for when a client assaults you. And the answer is no. After my shift, I messaged my boss and expressed I was upset with how the situation was handled and they tell me “you could’ve gone home if you wanted to” which I was not aware nor was my supervisor. And they stated “I am not in charge of you, reach out to your supervisor”. After this whole incident, no procedure was put in place even after I asked for on to be made. The main solution and focus was “this was traumatic for the client and to tell them we aren’t mad at them” per client’s therapist suggestion. I stayed working for my company and that’s a mistake on my part. Fast forward over a year later, my co worker was recently struck by the same client. My coworker was scheduled to work the following day. The same day of the incident, my boss talked to them about the situation. I was also scheduled that day and my boss filled me in. My boss says “she seemed fine, she wasn’t crying. If anything (client) is embarrassed and is scared to see (coworker)” and was adamant that my coworker is still coming in the next day. Fast forward, it didn’t hit my coworker how traumatic the situation was until the following week. They expressed to me & our supervisor feeling anxious and stressed going into work with our client. Our supervisor reached out to the other supervisor and explained what we want to see happen which was creating a procedure and talking to our boss. Thankfully, they want to see my boss, our DIRECTOR handle the situation as a director and not as our client’s guardian. From what my supervisor told me, during their meeting with my boss, my boss was comparing everyone’s fear level with the client and said “(client) always hits me but i’m not scared of them” (if that was my child, I would have unconditional love for them too, whereas I don’t have that relationship with my client unlike my boss) and when she asked our supervisor why they weren’t afraid of our client, my supervisor replied “because they’ve never hit us”. As I’ve mentioned, my client has PTSD and my supervisor had to compare his situation with how we were feeling with the client to my boss. Only then my boss finally understood. And my boss asked if my co worker is deciding not to work with our client anymore, my supervisor said “as of right now, yes”. My boss’s response truly baffled me. My boss replies, ‘I think it’s an error if they decide not to work with (client)’. As of right now, myself & my coworker are thinking of quitting.

Still, I can’t shake the feeling that I should take the new offer. The title is more senior, and I think it would give me new challenges, broaden my horizons, and even let me see the world more. I’m torn between the stability and familiarity of my current job vs. the potential growth and adventure of the new one.

Why after graduation? 2 reasons:
1. If I transfer credits, I would definitely loose out some, and most likely get downgraded by a year. 
2. After graduating, I hope I can immigrate to USA with a job, by applying for a job online with the bachelors degree I got from the dutch university.

I am currently in college and will be graduating in a year. My degree is focused on visual communication design, and I have intent to go into ui/ux design. In the past four months, I worked as a marketing specialist and designer on my college campus, the job left me feeling so drained, overworked and uninspired. It was mostly print design work. Most of the time, I felt compared to my co worker, and didn’t have my contract extended.

I sometimes feel not good enough to be in the design, I’m not sure if this is normal for a lot of people in tech. Ive also felt that I would like to switch into working towards another non design tech role. At times, I feel design isn’t really for me even if I’m great at it,my profs tell me I’m good at it and I have quality work.

I’ve taken the IBM tech type test, and I got web development, design thinking, artificial intelligence and IT /project management. Asides from design, I really like giving presentations, research, organizing, design thinking, determining how a project should be done. The idea of dealing with products by improving then, ir creating them sounds great. I currentky don’t like my current job as I have to sit at a desk mostly, there’s less speaking. I love talking, trying to sell to people so the idea of a job where I can speak and converse with clients sounds great, I love marketing, strategy, advertising, AI, copywriting, writing articles. I am also intrigued by cybersecurity. At my current job, I hav head lots of ideas for new educational projects, I like the idea of not exactly running a business but helping to determine products for the business, services or products to sell.

1h917nl, Fired After Reporting Supervisor for Abuse of Power – Seeking Advice What to Do Next,"Hi all,

I’m in a tough situation and could really use some advice. I was working at a startup company and, along with a coworker, reported our department head to HR for abuse of power and creating a hostile work environment, especially in our remote roles. The issues included unprofessional behavior, micromanagement, and creating an atmosphere of fear.

Just three days after the report, my coworker was fired. I was let go two days ago, weeks after the report, under the claim of “poor performance.” However, my manager and analytics show that I was actually a top performer in my department. I’ve never been written up, never had any formal performance discussions, and I was never placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).

After doing some research, I found out that in a previous job, my department head was sued for wrongful termination under very similar circumstances—her employee had reported her for similar issues, and then they were fired shortly afterward. This has made me seriously question whether my termination is retaliation, especially given the pattern.

On top of that, I’ve requested a separation notice from my employer, but I haven’t received it yet. This is adding to my confusion and concern about the situation.

This feels very suspicious, and I’m wondering if I have grounds for a wrongful termination or retaliation claim. I’m also not sure what steps to take next. Should I speak with a lawyer, or is there any action I can take to protect myself? Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.

1h90p6h,Adjusting to working after being laid off ,"This might be a bit of an odd post, but I'm curious if anyone else has experienced something similar. I'm 32, and after being laid off last fall, I went through an 11-month gap between finding out and starting my next job. I was officially out of work for 8 months, but during that time, I landed a job that’s a step up from what I expected. I’ve now been working for 6 months, with 3 of those months spent at the job I hope to stay at long-term.

I feel fortunate that the layoff didn’t impact me financially too severely, though it did leave me feeling withdrawn and directionless in many ways. I'm grateful to have a job I enjoy, but I’m starting to hit a bit of a wall. The excitement of landing the role has faded, and my motivation to go above and beyond has tapered off. While I work remotely, and had since the pandemic. I’ve had the chance to meet some of my colleagues, but I still feel a bit disconnected.

1h8ym8u,Nearly 40 have a bachelors degree and don’t want to manage or do retail anymore.,"I was a good student. I graduated from a respected university. School has always been a struggle for me but I do well. 

I graduated and moved back to my hometown and worked in the family business. 

I’ve never liked retail but tolerated it. I’m a massive introvert and it drains me.

I’ve been the sole owner for the past five years. It’s a retail / fast food business. We’re incredibly seasonal and all my staff is high school students. Most of my customers are tourist. 

I make good money but I’m done with the frustration of managing teenage staff, dealing with customers, the seasonal ness off the business, and the lack of personal life. I work right next to my staff. 

This is the only industry I’ve worked in for the past nearly two decades. Nothing else on my resume. 

No wife, no kids, no debt. Enough money saved up to not work for a few years. 

I have no idea what direction to go in. 

The trades have always interested me. I like working with my hands and I can fix things.

All my college friend and room mates have advanced degrees. I did well on standardized test and my IQ was formally tested twice.

1h8wrhv,How should I confront my supervisor who hasn’t responded to my texts in 40 days?,"I (20 M) work as a patient sitter at a decent sized hospital (just over 100 beds). I started back in May, and overall have enjoyed what I do. I love my coworkers and try to help out anywhere I can because I know I can do more than what my job requires, so I do. 

A little context before the more recent situation. Back when I first started, my supervisor told me she didn’t want to put me on the official schedule because they were moving to a new system in a couple months, so for two months I just told her what days I could work and came in on those days. However, once the new system was introduced, I was never given access to the self-scheduling. After many attempts to get my supervisor to fix this issue, she finally helped me fix it about 3 weeks ago. 

Now the main issue. On October 28th, supervisor sent me a text message about two night shift IA positions she had open to see if I was interested, as I had previously mentioned that I was interested if she had openings. I messaged her as soon as I got out of class (about 30 minutes later) and told her I was interested, and asked if I could call. She did not respond until 5 hours later when she called me without any notice. On the phone, she explained the hours for those positions, and asked a full time student they wouldn’t work. When I told her this, she said she could take a full time position and make it part time so I could do it. I told her I was very interested and would be happy to discuss it further.

On the phone call, she asked me to work a night shift that Friday night (Nov 22nd) to see how I like working on nights. I agreed, and had an incredible shift. The night shift crew, who I was already familiar, was super excited to have me. The floor was very chill, which meant I got to do a lot of school work. Overall it was a great night. 

When I got off that morning, I sent her a message about how much I appreciated the opportunity to do the night shift and that I was very interested in the position, and to please let me know what I needed to do from there. I did not get a response until Nov 25 when she asked me if I could come in and fill in for someone. No response to my actual message. I messaged again, asking if we could discuss the position, on Nov 27. No response. 

On December 6, I received an email from her stating that effective January 1 she would no longer be my supervisor as she was moving to a new position. I messaged her, asking who I needed to message about the position in order to keep that process moving. No response. 

This promotion would be really beneficial for me. Night shifts have always been easier for me than full day shifts, and on top of that I would go from my hourly rate of $15.75 to a minimum of $17.00 from the night time bonus alone, not including the actual pay increase from the position.  I don’t want to come off as desperate, but her not responding to any of my messages about a position that she offered me is getting really frustrating. This is made worse because the beginning of January is going to be the only time until next summer that I will have the free time to travel to the main hospital and get all my training done.  

Please help me out. What should I do?

tldr; My boss offered me a new position and hadn’t responded to any messages about it for 40 days. Please help.

1h8vwjm,What is the real value of IDEAS?,"Most of the podcasts that I listen to say something along the lines of ""ideas are practically worthless and that execution is everything"". What do you all think?

It's funny for me because I work for a chocolate manufacturer in my 9 to 5 and literally every idea that I shared with people without executing was later on ""stolen"" by another person who took the credit. So from my personal xp, I partially disagree with these podcasters.

Sure, ideas without execution don't have value. But, I have learned from the school of hard knocks that whenever pitching an idea, I have to write an email to many stakeholders outlining the idea to show that it came from me.

1h8v6x0,Put on a PIP - The experience ,"I worked for an extremely large company as a CX/Logistics officer.  As one of the most senior on my team with 3 years of experience and on-boarded/trained all members on my team whilst half the team had moved on/left. A new Team manager was put in place without any leadership experience and I was having a quiet a few issues with them as it seemed they were very eager to please the higher ups by accepting responsibilities outside the role and labelled them as learning opportunities and insights - crucial field feedback to be passed onto Portfolio/Sales managers regarding products. 
The company decided to put me on a 10 week PIP and weekly meetings with the reasoning:
- Increased frequency of errors
- Lack of insights - to achieve 5 reports per week
- Inconsistent office attendance - 3 days consistent in office attendance 

I had address each of these issues directly with my TL and HR, my attendance was as per requested 3 days per week in office HOWEVER the topic was raised as they wanted me to be more consistent with the days I come in to be a 'role model' for newer members. I addressed my lack of insights, with direct tracking and comparison of my fellow team members own insight reports. Showing I had 20 above the closest team member WITH the critical information addressed and highlighted. The errors I say were solely my fault and I believe it should be addressed HOWEVER should not be the solely cause for the PIP. 

After the end if the 10 week PIP, I had achieved all except the 5 reports per week - which was not hit as a family member had a stroke and I was unavailable to work. My TL then decided to continue the PIP for another 4 weeks with the conditions of 5 reports per week, mandatory 5 day attendance in hopes to assist in my report writing AND biweekly meetings.
I quickly addressed the fact that 5 days is completely unnecessary and I am willing to do 4 days given how the only person who does 5 days is the managing director. The TL then mentioned how this process is just to show that I am 'motivated and dedicated enough to the company, given the valuable time and resources being spent in to address this situation with me.

I handed in my resignation the day after.

TLDR:
Company put me on a PIP, I had addressed all reasons and achieved the conditions within reason. But they decided to put me on another one anyways so I left. They put you on a PIP to try and make you uncomfortable to leave. Even if you meet the conditions they will try again.

1h8ujzf,How do you maintain your self-confidence after getting PIPed?,"I got PIPed recently. I knew it was coming. I'm burnt out, underpaid, and working a job that requires 110% effort. We're 3 days hybrid and I've been abusing that system to stay home. My commute is an insane 1 1/2 - 2 hour trip and I'm trying to study for a certificate exam. So, I've been using it to get more study time in but I'm making up for it by working as hard and as late as possible. I've been constantly taking on new work with tighter deadlines, and getting things done as quickly and neatly as possible. Not once have I ever heard any complaint that my work product was lacking or insufficient.

I meet with my manager(s) regularly and I've been getting **stellar feedback** despite my attendance issues. So, you can imagine how shocked I was to get pulled into a PIP meeting and told that my work product was largely insufficient, and that I was inattentive, negligent, and that the time it takes for me to complete tasks shows incompetence. They **INSISTED** that I work better while working in the office even though I believe the difference to be negligible. Doesn't matter that I have plenty of examples to prove most of the items on the PIP to be gross overgeneralizations or outright wrong.

So, I just assume they're culling me because I don't show up. Which is fine. Maybe I'm too prideful but I wouldn't have cared if they fired me for that. I'm guilty of that crime and they can fire me for that if they want.

But, I still have mental whiplash after being accused of being such a poor performer although I was giving it my all and actively getting positive feedback. I still fall into small bouts of depression where I ask if they are right. Maybe I actually can't do my job. Maybe I'm just not good enough. I'm probably taking this too personally but, idk, I put a lot of effort into my work. So, it's incredibly frustrating to hear that months of late nights working into the morning hours was all for naught.",Desolation08,2,1.0,0,1733584537,2024-12-07 15:15:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h8ujzf/how_do_you_maintain_your_selfconfidence_after/,12,2024

I joined a company in October. One of the biggest reasons was because they promised a hybrid work policy during the hiring process—2 days in the office, 3 days from home. Now, they’re forcing me into a 5-day in-office schedule. When I brought this up to my manager, I was yelled at, dismissed, and hit with personal remarks like, “your generation is lazy and don’t want to work hard”. 

What frustrates me more is that some employees are fully remote, others follow the hybrid model, and the team I’m part of in Bangalore (group of 5 people) seem to be the only one forced into this situation. I’ve worked hard to get where I am, and I deliver results. I’m just asking them to honor what they promised.

But, I have a strong feeling I will not be going back. I am at a mind blank of what I could potentially pursue, with our without using my previous skills.

Was previously a qualified Locksmith and then went into the High Voltage Electrical industry through my apprenticeship and continued with that until now. 

I have suffered from mental health issues for most of my life and would love to help people with the same affliction. Have also spoken to others that have left the trades and quite a few have moved into the IT space - although I am not the greatest with computers I am definitely willing to learn.

I really have no idea what kind of jobs are available out there today as the job market is so diverse now an believe that new types of job roles are constantly being created.

And I sort of feel disrespected and unappreciated. I walk by some of my upper management pretty often and none of them even acknowledged this recent change.

Is very afraid of confrontation etc. Nicest guy to my face though. 

Today I asked him for a reference for a masters program I've applied to. We had a lady who did an EMBA and then left the firm after they paid for it. I'm not at her level and would be paying for the program myself. He told me he couldn't be my reference because they had a bad experience with this employee doing her MBA and that post graduate studies are frowned upon here. He told me I should keep this on the down lo and not speak about it to anyone. 

The masters I've applied wouldn't interfere with my work as classes are on Monday nights and then all day Saturday. I thoroughly explained this to him. 

Now to be clear I legitimately hate this guy. I want to make sure I'm not being emotional in my approach but my plan is to set up a meeting with our head of HR, explain to her my conversation re post graduate studies and how my boss says they are frowned upon and then ask her directly what the companies policy on postgraduate studies are and expectations if someone were to enroll in them.

1h8h4lq,External or Internal Job Switch?,"Looking for advice and will try to summarize. Not going to use company names in case folks see this.

I have been employed by the same company for the last 10 years.  Have managed a few teams, but currently within our New Acquisitions dept.  Senior leadership is becoming toxic, and I have (potentially) the following opportunities:

Internal - lateral move to a team I managed previously, which is now under new senior leadership.  I managed this team for 2 years and we accomplished alot, but a reorganization had people thinking there could be layoffs, so myself and senior leaders moved departments.  Job would be virtual, most likely same compensation.

External - a previous manager referred me to another company in the same industry.  Similar role but more senior.  Pay would be approximately 30% more and would also be virtual.

My concern is that these are happening at the same time, and the internal would most likely offer first.  If so, I would take it to get out of my current toxic area.  If the external role does offer, at the expected 30% pay increase, are there reasons to not accept (assuming the internal will not match)?  Do we think this would be burning bridges with my current employer, especially given the accepting and then leaving could be right after each other?

Other facts - Current employer is #4 player in the space, much broader product offering and distribution.  External opportunity is within the same industry, but in the #10-15 range, and more or a niche product company.  Both have been in operation for close to a century.

1h8cxv6,Career change to law enforcement ,"I’m thinking about joining the California Highway Patrol (CHP), which would be a big career change for me. I’ve been interested in law enforcement since high school, but I ended up taking a different path—earning my bachelor’s degree and working in corporate FP&A. I’m 29 and have a family, so this decision isn’t one I’m taking lightly.

Has anyone here made a similar career change? If so, how did the transition feel? I’ve spoken to a few CHP officers who came from corporate jobs, and they’ve told me they don’t regret it at all. They really enjoy working for the CHP and wouldn’t go back. 

Some of the reasons I’m considering this career are job security  and the long-term benefits. The pay would also be much better, though that’s not my main motivation. One big concern I have is the time away from my family. That’s probably the biggest thing holding me back (along with the increased risks to personal safety). However, I’ve heard that family time improves as you gain more seniority (after 3–5 years).

1h8chf6,Compensation Question,"I'm not sure if this is the right forum for this, but I was looking to see if my compensation was on par with my experience, etc.

  
I work as a defense contractor for a large company in an HCOL area. I am a college graduate and I have been working in this position for about 3 years. I had 2 internships in college, so I came in with some experience. I am working in an engineering-like role with an active security clearance and can also speak a highly valued foreign language fluently.

  
When I accepted the offer, I was being paid $62.5k per year, which I was ecstatic about. However, 2.5 years later, I was promoted to a different contract, as I was excelling, and have only received a 6.5k (\~9%) total comp bump (1COLA + promotion) coming out to 69K. I currently have a few people reporting to me, and I have been leading multiple projects. I thought this was normal, however, when speaking to friends in similar jobs, they are making more along the lines of 85-100k+. 

  
I am starting to feel unfulfilled, and, honestly very frustrated since I now feel like it is lower-end compensation. I have interviewed at one other company, which had a salary range of 85k+ (sadly the funding was an issue and the position closed)

  
Just curious about anyone's thoughts on whether this comp sounds about right for the experience. Thanks!",Jun-Wen,1,1.0,0,1733521130,2024-12-06 21:38:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h8chf6/compensation_question/,12,2024
1h8c200,"Started a new job at a small company of around 6 people, 2 months in and a hire-up in the company (not my boss) has got me uninvited to company meetings and essentially demoted. What to do?","2 months ago I started working at an awesome commercial real estate job finally working in what I got a masters degree in (finance). All was going pretty well, my boss was (and still is) happy with my performance, but from the start I was always having bad interactions with the person at the front desk who is a big part of the residential development part of the business (she’s also the daughter of the head of a company our company partners heavily with for development). I made the mistake of not introducing myself and trying to form that connection early on, and later when I tried to make friends I could tell she was already annoyed and she wouldn’t care to answer anything I was asking about her weekend or her life or anything. I knew that this was seemingly like it could be a problem, but the harder I tried to make friends the more it seemed to annoy her so I kind of backed off. 

Anyways, fast forward just like 6 weeks into the office and one of my co-workers tells me that I won’t be working on anything related to the partnership with her and her father’s company and that I’m not invited to any related meetings anymore. My co-worker said that was her dad’s decision, but I’m not so stupid to see she definitely played a part in it. The big problem is that the work we do with that company is 95% of the development work we’re working on, so now just a few weeks in I’ve essentially been demoted to just working on spreadsheets all day, which I’m good at and don’t really mind doing, but it’s clearly a demotion to what I was doing and what I was intended to do, and I’m not really sure now where my place is in the company long term. 

I know my job is secure, my boss has been really happy with the work I have done and what I’m working on. But this really does hurt my future at the company, and personally, I’m really damn annoyed about the whole situation and feel it’s all a very unfair. I feel like I did nothing wrong and I’m sort of the outcast at the office because this co-worker refuses to let me be fully a part of it. And sitting in my office and hearing my other co-workers chat and be friends with her really makes me feel like even more of an outcast and not motivated at all to do more work. And at this point, it’s not like I even want to be friends with her because I feel like I’ve been wronged for no reason, and at a company this small it’s hard to not all just get along. 

What should I do? Do I stick it out? Do I still try to make friends with her? Should I talk to my boss about it? Or should I just start looking for another job after just two months. Such a bummer, because everything else about the job is great but this situation is really bringing the whole thing down.

1h8b2q6,Struggling with offshore team...again,"I work remotely and that means the companies I have worked for have always had some sort of offshore team. My last job became almost entirely based out of India and I struggled a lot with their behavior because often the teams were entirely composed of men. After I quit, my HRBP privately told me that every woman who quit in the year before me had reported sexist treatment and they had hundreds of complaints. There were a lot of cultural differences with the offshore India teams, especially is regards to being able to take responsibility or do work independently. It was very stressful and they were difficult to train.

I no longer work with an India based team. I now work with a team based out of the Philippines. They are really sweet and their grasp of American English is a lot better (no do the needful). However...they seem really unproductive? And unresponsive? I'm wondering if this is another cultural disconnect (I was told a major cause of my issues with my Indian colleagues is a different business/leadership culture being common there, but not in America), or if I'm just unlucky and have a bit of a lazy team?

1h8a7vh,Please help - Dealing with a difficult manager.,"Hi , Ive been at my job now for almost a year and  I used to have a good relationship with my  superior but at this point it just seems like she does not want me here . She now barely responds to my emails and even when she does it is to criticize my work in condescending ways. Lately she’s been tagging the C suite ( her superior ) and the HR manager in the 2/3 cases where I’ve made a mistake at work. 
Also I tried to let her know that our communication as a team needs to improve and I was told to send a folder of all the emails she never responded to , which she then said - if I didn’t respond it’s because you should know the answer. 
Another scenario where she asks me to complete a task , she says we can schedule a call if I need clarification which I said yes to - her response was I’m busy all day , followed by use Google. 


Do I need to make a complaint to HR or do I just keep going till I get fired eventually.? 

This is a manager that has expressed that she’s quick to fire people who do not follow her process but I’m only human after all , if a “mistake” doesn’t lead to any issues but only to appease one single human then how am I supposed to work knowing that my job is hanging over my head and every mistake I make is being maximized while my good work is not being acknowledged. To make things worse there’s  only 2 of us in the department so there’s no one else to talk to except for Hr .

1h8a4r6,Can employers deny all time off for a period of time?,"Hi,

This is my first office job (I’m 25f). We hired a new office manager a few months ago and are now becoming more strict with rules. It used to be family owned and laid back, but the owner is trying to make it more professional with write ups and things like that. 

I got approved for time off today (originally 1pm-4pm off) but decided to take the full day off since I had a lot to do before my flight tonight. The manager was out yesterday as was the owner, so instead of texting her on her time off I sent a quick email saying I wouldnt be in tomorrow. It wasn’t worded as a ‘request’ since I had a feeling she wouldn’t see it. 

But this morning I got some insight from a coworker that they were mentioning writing me up and having a meeting with me. I’ve always been on time, always request time off ahead of time, etc. i think I should at least be able to talk with them in person before anything drastic happened. 

There was a mention of the meeting/write up but also something about no time off requests for a month? That seems a little drastic, especially with the holidays and anything can come up like appointments, emergencies, literally anything.

I don’t have specific details besides that yet, but going into this meeting next week I’d like to be prepared with what to say or questions to ask. This doesnt seem fair especially since i’m not at all the type to not show up last minute or anything. I let her know ahead of time and that’s generally the policy. If it was an emergency I would do the same thing and not expect a write up or no time off.

Am I in the wrong at all? Has this happened to anyone else/is it allowed? I don’t care if its unpaid but taking away all time off requests doesn’t seem reasonable.",rachael0302,0,0.5,1,1733514880,2024-12-06 19:54:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h8a4r6/can_employers_deny_all_time_off_for_a_period_of/,12,2024

Im from Mumbai, India.

A little background... 
I'm BA Sociology Graduate. I took BA because common you need to have something to show right. I had some plans after TY that did not go well and due to my financial conditions i ended up getting into educational sales. Currently I work at a institute as a telecaller/ education counselor. Even thou it's going good I'm not happy with my own work, sales was never part of my plan and it seems overburdening for me. Considering I've my degree in Sociology where we also had HR as a subject I was thinking to switch into HR. 

Now coming to the point..
Im 22F, with a BA Sociology Degree, currently having 8months Sales experience with 18k salary. so my question is..
Can I switch Into HR? 
What all things should i consider while switching? 
What criterias do companies check while hiring for HR position? 
Should I do some HR related course? If yes do you have any suggestions..?

I would be grateful if you took time to read out and help me in this situation. Because I'm completely clueless and I badly want to switch my job within 2-3 months.

1h89um2,Adjacent Engineering Careers,"Hello everyone, I am looking for some insight on what all careers are available that are adjacent to the engineering field. So just for some context, I have been to college for engineering and I'm in my last year. I've recently taken a break from school to pursue an internship. I've gotten the opportunity to refine my CAD software skills and have gained a great perspective on the fabrication side of engineering. Before this internship, I had a job where I was involved with setting up PLC for machines. I feel like at this point I have all the skills necessary to be successful in the engineering field, but I don't necessarily want to spend the money to finish up my degree. I am able to design, program, and fabricate machines. In an ideal world a company would pay for my last year of college but I'm not holding my breath. I don't have a lack of drive to finish up school and obtain my degree in Mechanical Engineering, I just have a lack of money at the moment. So, something I've been considering is to just work really hard and be frugal for a year so I can afford to go to school if I work part time that last year. Unfortunately though, my current internship is coming to an end here soon and I don't really want to go back to my old job because it's a few states over and admittedly the work there was boring. So, my question to current working engineers in the field: What kind of jobs/careers are close to engineering without needing a degree in engineering to get the job in the first place? I've been looking around for other internships, but I really don't want to have to undertake the cost of moving again.

1h89s7j,Does working more than one job suggest being well-off or financial necessity to you?,"Some context: I recently got a job as a barista at a small-owned family business (wife and husband are co-owners). The husband is one of my dad’s mutuals since they see each other around often in the community, so him and his wife treat me like their daughter and make me feel welcomed.

Yesterday as I was working closing shift cleaning up, he asked me what my dad’s work was. I was caught a bit off guard by the question since it came out of nowhere, so I blurted that “he does more one thing” (he does delivery for more than one company to make ends meet), we just chuckled after that. I feel like if he wanted to know he should be asking my dad? Anyway, he then asked if he works in car dealerships/trading them and I said no, and he said good, my dad is just like him, relieving himself from it lol..

When my mom picks me up from work, I typically give her a debrief about how my day was and when I told her about my response she said “what do you mean he does more than one thing, you know he works delivery with his car.” I meant delivery for different services but I think it didn’t translate well. She said my boss probably thinks my dad is well-off from my response and she told me to not mention this to my dad. I definitely could’ve replied more clearly, I just got anxious because I **really** don’t like answering questions on behalf of other people, especially for him since his career story is kind of complicated because of immigration.

But I also I think this might be a cultural difference as I was taken aback and kind of shocked when she said it suggests being well-off (both my parents and boss communicate with me in a language outside of English). In the US, to my understanding, when someone does more than one thing that typically suggests there’s a financial necessity right? She told me it’s okay and to just forget it but I’m interested in how this is perceived by others.

Just got this email from my 1 up manager:

I have set this meeting to address some reported concerns regarding your attitude and performance to date. We need to work better together and address continual slippage of your projects and address some of your recent responses. Please make the time available and bring a support person if as you require.

Meeting is set for 10am Tuesday. 

I’d like some guidance/ advice from you all. 

Some context. I’m a Project Manager in Construction. Been with the company ~10 years. 1 up manager ~12 months. He came from outside the industry. 

I’ve had some really complex projects that have under performed. Most were sold badly/ under spec’d. I did my best with all of them but couldn’t save them all. Day to day operations on site are run by Site Managers who report to me. I feel I’ve done a good job to manage and support them. 

Any thoughts?

New manager is not a good person/ manager. I’ve definitely been blunt with my thoughts/ opinions of him both to his face and with others. 

I feel like this meeting is the first step to getting me out of the business? What’s the chances of me being fired on the spot? Have people who have been let go been invited to a ‘Performance Improvement’ meeting?

Should I take multiple people with me to this meeting? I was thinking my main Site Manager and previous senior manager (~40 years in the company). Would this be a good idea?

Should I go on offence? Detail all the things that went wrong that was outside my control? 

I will also start with listening to each of his claims. And acknowledging the mistakes I’ve made/ lessons learnt on the way.

The company won't let me move up I make only 19$ a hour Canadian .Also I don't drive cause I have anxiety so most trades are out the window.

Is there any job for me ? At this point? I thought of customer service but I don't want to have my folks listen to me as the walls are paper thin.

Trades like Plummer seem like way more money but I already have injury's at 23 . When I was in high school I took marketing and some woodworking classes but I don't have any experiences. I worked at no frills and a comic shop and a newspaper delivery when I was in middle school . I did my community service working with kids at my local church.

Social media would be a nice job but requires so much luck It a no go.

Also have a bunch of medical issues so my job has good benefits (Covers dentist and my medication ) I have Ulcerative Colitis and take antidepressants. Also I don't have to worry about transportation since it's very close to me.

1h86tex,Just started a job and still interviewing….,"Help! I’ve been applying to jobs the last few months and finally got an interview last month and eventually an offer from a company that I have to relocate for. They are pretty flexible and agreed to let me start remotely during the holidays so I have a month before I actually have to move. I started this job earlier this week on Monday! So far I’ve been excited about it, but it wasn’t as high of a salary as I was looking for. I also got a request for a recruiter screen for another company right before I started at this job and that was today. Everyone told me I should continue with it since company A went through layoffs last year, so it’s unpredictable and you never know. Well the recruiter ended up liking me and wants to move me on to the next round! And company B pays 10-20k more (within the range I wanted) than company A and I would be able to work remotely without having to relocate. I feel so guilty since I’ve already started at company A and am loving the company culture so far, but company B is more aligned to my industry and pays more!

1h86jkl,PTO postponed a month since I took the day off?,"I’m so angry/upset/confused right now and need advice. I (25f) work at a small contracting company. We recently hired a new office manager and since then, things have gotten way stricter. I know it’s not just her and a lot having to do with the owner too.

Time off requests have always been pretty chill, just let your supervisor know when you need time off and it’s usually approved within a day or two. 

I was planning on working today (Friday) and leaving early around 1pm. I let the manager know this and it was approved, however, yesterday I decided to take the full day off since I still have a lot of errands and things to do before my flight today. 

The manager and owner were out yesterday so I didnt want to text. Instead I sent an email saying I wont be in today, sorry, thanks for understanding. 

I then see that the owner/manager are “updating the write ups to include cancelling and not allowing time off periods(?)” as well as writing up a warning for me and… 1 MONTH OF NO PTO ACCRUAL???

this is actually insane. We have a meeting sometime next week when i’m off but i’m so shook and angry. I’ve never called out/no showed, almost always work 40 hours a week.

To add context, we recently switched PTO to accural starting January so none of us have been accuring PTO. I will need to talk to them in person but as of now they’re saying i wouldnt even start accruing until February, which seems like bullshit.

1h86660,Salary negotiations ,"Hello!! 

I got a job at an amazing company in Toronto back in September. At the time they offered me 52k + 6% yearly bonus, I negotiated a little and we settled for 54k + 6% yearly bonus. 

Fast forward to last week (approx 3 months at the company now) business needs changed and they moved majority of my team & myself to a position one level higher. My manager had a 1-on-1 with us to let us know, and she automatically said we’ll get an increase to 60k + 8% yearly bonus. 

Is it appropriate for me to try and negotiate this a little bit? 

Note: 
Company does automatic raises every year in April, since we got this new position/raise so late in the year we probably will not be eligible in April. Meaning I probably won’t get another pay bump until April 2026. 

8% bonus depends on production so it may be less. Also probably will not receive my bonus in April since we are still in training aka not producing anything yet. Again, will get bonus in 2026.

1h84zal,How do i quit my job?,"To give some background, I’ve been at my job for about a year now, and I really enjoy it. My boss is great, my coworkers are okay, the pay is good, and the work is fairly “easy” for me. When I started, there were three of us plus my boss. Recently, my boss had to let one of my coworkers go due to business being slow.

The coworker who was let go and I shared the same position, so now all the work has fallen on me. I don’t mind because I prefer being busy over sitting idle. However, I was honestly surprised my boss chose to keep me over my older, more experienced coworker. From a business perspective, I understand why—I’m younger, faster, and a harder worker, which probably made more sense for the long term.

Now it’s just me, one coworker who’s in a position below mine, and my boss.

Here’s my dilemma: I recently received an incredible job offer in another state, and I accepted it. I’m planning to move soon, but I feel terrible about leaving my boss in a tough spot, especially since he’s been good to me. I also don’t know how to break the news to him.

To complicate things further, before he let my coworker go, my boss sat me down and asked if I had any plans to leave. At the time, I honestly didn’t, so I told him no. This new opportunity came up unexpectedly and moved fast.

Ideally, I’d like to give my boss at least a month’s notice, probably at the end of December or beginning of January. However, I’m worried he might be upset, which could jeopardize things like my Christmas bonus (which would really help with my move).

I also feel guilty about my coworker being let go right before the holidays, especially since bringing him back could help fill the gap I’m leaving.

I’m torn about how to approach this. How would you handle the situation? How should I tell my boss without burning bridges or making things worse? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",uncommonanonymous,1,1.0,9,1733501759,2024-12-06 16:15:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h84zal/how_do_i_quit_my_job/,12,2024
1h84dl6,Seeking Guidance as a Business Management Graduate: What Skills Should I Focus On?,"

Hello everyone,

I’m reaching out to this community because I deeply admire the wealth of experience and insight professionals, CEOs, and business owners here can offer. I’m a 24-year-old international student currently in Brisbane, Australia, about to graduate with a degree in Business Management.

I feel a mix of excitement and confusion as I approach the job market. While I’m eager to take my first steps, I’m not entirely sure what direction to pursue or which skills would help me stand out as a recent graduate.

Here’s a bit about me:

* **Current Skills & Experience:** I have experience with Excel, PowerPoint, and stocktaking from a previous job. I’ve also gained brief marketing skills or experience I would say from my role as a Marketing Executive in a university business club.
* **Learning Plans:** I’m currently planning to explore the basics of SEO, Tableau, and Python to build my technical skills.
* **Interests:** Automobiles, traveling, and entrepreneurship. I aspire to have my own business someday, but right now, I’m open to learning anything and stepping out of my comfort zone.
* **Career Aspirations:** The idea of working in a startup fascinates me because of the opportunity to learn diverse skills and experience different roles.

I’ll be honest I sometimes feel like I don’t have enough skills to offer and am unsure about what types of jobs to look for as a first step. That said, I’m very curious, willing to try new things, and ready to work hard to grow.

I would be incredibly grateful for any advice you could share:

* What skills do you think are essential for someone like me to focus on?
* Are there specific entry-level roles or industries you’d recommend?
* How can I better position myself as a strong candidate despite being a recent graduate?

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. Your guidance would mean the world to me as I navigate this exciting yet uncertain phase of my career journey.",NiceHighway_,1,1.0,0,1733500217,2024-12-06 15:50:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h84dl6/seeking_guidance_as_a_business_management/,12,2024

1h82tmd,[Career Advice] How do I manage a difficult new boss and keep my sanity?,"Hi all, I (24F) am looking for advice on how to navigate a tricky situation with my new boss. I work at a small retail company (around 100 people) with a tight-knit team of just 5 people. I’ve been in this role for 2.5 years, and while things weren’t perfect, our team had learned to manage on our own. Our previous boss (28F), who lacked leadership skills, offered little direction, leaving us to figure things out ourselves. Despite her inexperience, she was promoted to a chief-level position about 6 months ago, and we were assigned a new boss (55F).

On paper, my new boss seemed like a good fit, but in practice, it’s been frustrating. She struggles with basic managerial tasks like creating schedules, assigning deliverables, or running the team effectively. Worse, she often talks to other team members about each of us, and the comments always seem to get back to us, which makes things even more tense.

About a month ago, she pulled me into a 1:1 meeting and essentially questioned my commitment to the team and working for the company, saying she noticed a “shift” in my attitude. I was caught off guard, but I affirmed that I wanted to stay (though I am looking elsewhere) and said I’d work on improving my attitude. Afterward, I checked in with a trusted coworker who assured me that I’ve been consistent since I started.

The following week, I decided to approach things proactively. I came to her with a list of career-growth questions to discuss, such as:
	1.	What steps can we take to set up a professional development plan for me? For example, could we establish monthly goals or regular feedback sessions?
	2.	From your perspective, what am I doing well, what could I improve, and what should I stop doing?
	3.	Is there anything I can take on or adjust to help make your workload more manageable?
	4.	What are your broader objectives for the team, and how do you see me contributing to those?

These maintain the essence of your original questions while sounding more general and less tied to a specific phrasing style.

After that meeting, I felt like I had done something constructive. However, I later found out she showed my list to another coworker, commenting on how “unbelievable” it was that I brought those questions. That felt like a slap in the face since I genuinely wanted to work on improving.

I’m struggling to figure out how to proceed in this role without losing my mind. I want to maintain a professional relationship with her, but I’m also feeling stuck, undervalued, and frustrated by her lack of leadership.

Was I wrong to bring that list of questions? How can I better manage this relationship while staying sane (and employed) in the meantime?

I’m in a bit of a state to say the least, feeling constantly sick, weak and have a banging headache due to dehydration. 

I’m waiting to hear back from the GP in regards to some anti nausea tablets (as they’re no longer available to purchase over the counter anymore in the UK), eating small, bland and often and having rehydration treatments however nothing is making me feel human or functioning at the moment.

It’s a part time role working 3 full days per week, and I’m set to complete a 6 day induction before christmas and then get more involved in the new year. I have an induction plan all set out and sent in advance to take me up to January and I would feel like it’d be a huge spanner in the works for me to request a start date in the new year (still yet to sign contract). 

I would love to hear peoples advice on how best I can manage this predicament. A friend in recruitment said my best bet is to just get through the necessary days and I’ve been sitting with that thought and trying to build myself up to the fact I’ll be working next week, however I just have no idea how I’m going to get up and out when the day comes. 

UK based and advice on how best to approach this situation would be so appreciated, thank you.

1h820j0,Manager offered to switch me from full time to part time? ,"Basically there was a cut in budget and she offered to switch me to part time because she doesn’t want me to be without a job during the holidays. Obviously I’m looking for another full time job immediately but is working part time at a measly hourly wage even worth it when factoring in having to pay for commute and parking at work. I just had the discussion and I accepted because I figure having at least a job on your resume that you’re currently working at is better than being unemployed but would does it make that much of a difference in terms of being employable to employers? 

I’m not sure if this situation is more beneficial than just collecting unemployment and being able to put all my effort into finding a job and not having to put time and money into driving to work and paying for parking plus the time spent working. I know the job market is atrocious right now which is making me think this is a better situation overall but I’d just like some input.

1h80xkz,how to tell your career story when its all over the place,"If you've got a generalist / non-linear background, telling your story can be tricky (esp in a high-pressure environment like an interview)

Here's a simple framework I've found helpful: **""I'm a better X, because Y""**

eg:

1. I'm a better product manager *because* I was a designer = builds beautiful products users actually love
2. I'm a better marketer *because* I'm a scientist = turns data into stories that actually convert
3. I'm a better writer *because* I was a teacher = creates content that educates, not just entertains
4. I'm a better engineer *because* I worked in customer support = builds solutions that solve real user problems, not just technical ones
5. I'm a better founder *because* I was a designer = crafts experiences users fall in love with

Magic happens when these seemingly disparate experiences collide and create insights that nobody else has seen. This becomes your competitive advantage (lean into it!!)

  
Hope this is helpful for someone!

1h7xvo7,Feeling clueless about the next step post-bachelor. What are some high paying career paths that suit me?,"I have a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Human Evolutionary Biology, with decent grades, and would like to return to school one day in the far future for further studies and move into the scientific community as I'm passionate about science. But I'm broke and I come from a low income background, so I'd much rather pay off my student debt and set myself up comfortably in life before I pursue a passion career.

I'm a 24-year old Australian, and have worked nearly every week since I was 15 in many different hospitality and retail jobs. This includes: McDonalds, cafes, pet stores, electronic stores, plant nurseries and more. I've just started a job as a bank teller to expose myself to a different industry, but I still feel like I'm not moving in any direction. As a worker, I always come away with high praise by employers, not necessarily for being outstanding at my job (I have dyspraxia so I struggle to do any task to a high standard) but always for being reliable, hard working and possessing a good work attitude and friendly nature. It's important to mention, however, that I always deliever on results. I currently live in a dusty, rural town of about 30,000 and planning on moving to the city but the rental crisis is proving difficult. There's the problem of you need a job for a rental, and you need a rental for a job,' when moving 6 hours away to the nearest city.

I've been applying to grad jobs for the last two years and have been rejected by all. I've applied for entry-level positions in government departments, big companies etc. and still getting rejected. It's worth mentioning that I'm getting rejected before any interview. When it comes to applying to minimum wage jobs, however, I get showered in interviews and ""your resume is so impressive and you're more than qualified for this."" One recruiter who had been hired by the bank I'm now working for, was bold enough to say ""why are you settling for these jobs?"" I replied saying ""well I need a job now to get a car, pay the bills and save up enough to get a decent inner-city rental and I'm getting rejected from everything else."" He then went on to say that I'm ""not qualified for those entry-level jobs with the type of experience"" I have, but he failed to elaborate on what I'm supposed to do about that.

For now, I'm feeling lost as to how to build a high-paying career and where to start or what to aim for. I know I'm passionate and strong in writing, science, communication, learning, culture and the like. I've never been too concerned about making money but I've just gone through a painful break up that has come to teach me a lot about myself. So I'm feeling really motivated to build a career I love, or feel rewarded for, and the freedom to invest in my own happiness and life.

My only real dislikes in a career is sales as I get drained easily by social performances and I hate being dishonest, and I want work-life balance as I highly value relationships i.e. with a future partner, family, friends and the community. I also rather use my mind more than my hands, but I have enjoyed physical jobs as long as they don't make the majority of the work as I have a bad back and neck due to being 6 foot 7.

TLDR:  
I have a university degree and 9 years experience working in retail and hospitality, and I'm feeling completely stuck and unable to progress into a career with constant rejection.

Any advice?? Thanks!",slam_24,3,1.0,12,1733478461,2024-12-06 09:47:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h7xvo7/feeling_clueless_about_the_next_step_postbachelor/,12,2024

1h7w9ou,Everybody says writing fiction does not pay. So what kind of writing does pay? What can you write for money while you are working on your novel?,"I feel quite hopeless about ever making money off fiction. That's the harsh reality. Even people who make money say it won't pay the rent. Like someone I know (much better writer than me) who got a book deal after so many rejections and such hard work, made about 10,000 dollars last year. That's it. I think it works out to something like four or five bucks an hour. Remember, he is one of the lucky ones.

Unless you live in a very cheap country, I can't imagine these numbers looking good to anybody. You can make three times as much working as a cashier.

Anyways, I'm making peace with the fact that I will never make real money from writing fiction. That's fine. But I still need money to pay the rent. So while I work on writing better stories and improving my vocabulary and grammar, what can I write for pay? What can I teach myself, what kind of work can I apply for? I mean real money, not like five cents per word or something. The equivalent of at least $15/hr or $30k a year, enough to pay the rent (where I live in the US).

1h7vi3e,Just graduated in accounting/finance need advice,"Hello. I am a 22F and I just graduated double majoring in Accounting and Finance. I am currently working as an accounting assistant for a manufacturing company. I have worked here for almost 2 years. I handle AP, AR, month end tasks including depreciation/amortization JEs, fixed asset/capital improvement schedule, prepaid/accruals, assisting with audits, bank reconciliation, and reconciliation of balance sheet. I am also trained in payroll. About 6 months ago, we got a new CEO and he added a bunch of responsibilities to my plate including:

-Prepare and analyze weekly income statements and income statement forecasting 
-Develop weekly 13 week cash flow projections
-Lead weekly financial meeting with Owner, CEO, and Controller to present the above items 

He gave me these extra responsibilities without taking anything off my plate or giving me a pay raise. I was fine with it since I was gaining valuable experience but wanted a promotion when I graduated. Since I just graduated, they presented me with an offer of promotion from Accounting Assistant to Accounting Specialist with a 5k raise to 53k moving from hourly to salary. They also made my job description a lot more broad without my new responsibilities. I was not very impressed with this offer since I do not believe it is much of a promotion and tried to negotiate to the title “Staff Accountant.” They refused to negotiate at all saying that my responsibilities do not align with staff accountant because I do not do any taxes or 401k audits at year end. Do you think their offer is fair or am I right in feeling very upset about this? 

I forgot to add, I also asked my boss (the controller) if I was fair in asking for the staff accountant title and she agreed that it fits.

Last year, I was shifted into a different role than the one I originally was hired for. I’ve came to realise it’s not what I want to do long term and I tried to move elsewhere in the company. My manager now knows I’ve become slightly demotivated and that the current role isn’t in my future plans. She wants to put me on a 30-day PIP next week in order to squeeze me out.

While I feel this is probably justified, it comes during a bad time as it’s right before the Christmas break and nobody will be hiring now until the new year. I also fly back to my home country Ireland next week and have almost two weeks off annual leave time which was previously approved. 

Is it possible for me to go back and say that I feel it’s unfair them to put me on it now when I’ve already booked time off and ask for the PIP  phase to begin in January instead?

I know I’m inevitably going to have to leave? but I just want to prolong the PIP start date so I have more time to find a new job in the new year.

It’s also worth noting that I didn’t even sign a new contract for the role I was shifted into nor was I given adequate training. I do get on well with my boss also so I don’t really want to screw her around as this probably isn’t easy for her either.

I attended an interview with Cognizant on September 28th, and after a salary negotiation, I didn’t hear back for a while. I assumed I was ghosted, so I moved on and attended an interview with Hexaware. I got selected there, and they processed my job offer within 2 weeks. Throughout the process, their HR was proactive, keeping me informed about the next steps.

I received and accepted Hexaware’s offer. However, shortly after, Cognizant sent me their job offer as well.

Here’s a comparison of the offers:

Hexaware:

Role: Senior position. Pay is slightly lower compared to Cognizant.
Project is good, work-life balance seems better and there’s potential for onsite opportunities (at least from what I’ve been told).

Cognizant:

Role: Associate position. Pay is 10% higher than Hexaware. 
Limited chances for onsite opportunities in this role and the promotion timeline could be 2-3 years or more.

I’m torn between better pay at Cognizant and a seemingly better role, work-life balance, and project at Hexaware. I also value growth opportunities and onsite exposure.

Has anyone faced a similar situation? What factors should I prioritize? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

1h7toam,I Want to Switch My Degree but I’m Scared—Need Career Advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m in serious need of genuine advice for my career and future plans.

I’m currently based in Australia, and I came here as an international student from one of the poorest countries in Asia. Right now, I’m studying a Bachelor of Early Childhood Education and Care (Birth-5), which is a 4-year course (8 semesters). I’ve completed about 1.5 years (3 semesters), but I’ve struggled—failing and then passing 3 subjects I had to repeat. As part of this degree, we’re also required to do professional experience at childcare centers after each semester.

Here’s the issue: I initially chose this course because a trusted friend, whose brother runs a consultancy here, recommended it to me. However, during my professional experiences, I’ve realized that this field doesn’t feel right for me. While I genuinely love children, the strict procedures, documentation, and compliance rules in the childcare field here in Australia feel overwhelming and unengaging for me. It’s not aligning with who I am, and I feel like I’m forcing myself to continue.there is also bias in this industry; what u felt least , parents have different view if you’re a male educator in addition to that if you are an international , Asian and brown/ black skinned, the things more worsens. Also I’m the only guy among all the girls of 20 students class to study this. This makes me feel underwhelming. Yet I was continuing this for my parents and myself but I think it has now crossed the bar I could bear. 

I also don’t want to return to my home country. I’ve had difficult life experiences there, and both I and my parents want me to build a future abroad. Ideally, I want to stay in Australia permanently (PR) and maybe move to the US later if possible.

Here’s my dilemma:
•	Early childhood education is on the Skilled Occupation List for PR, and I keep hearing that it has strong demand in Australia.
•	However, I’m struggling with motivation and interest in this field.
•	Should I push myself to continue with this degree just to achieve PR as soon as possible, despite my lack of passion?
•	Or should I switch to something I’m truly interested in, even though it could delay my goals, cost more money, or come with risks?

I’m scared of making the wrong decision—wasting time, money, and energy—or ending up in a career I dislike. On the other hand, switching courses could be a gamble with no guaranteed outcome, especially since surviving here as an international student is already challenging with inflation, high tuition, and living costs.

I’m completely lost and frustrated right now. I don’t have many people to turn to for advice, so I’m reaching out here for help.

What would you do in my situation? Are there alternative pathways I should consider? I’d really appreciate any advice, suggestions, or even shared experiences.

I’m rather interested in Business (as my father has  had been doing this in home country) and Computer and machine learning (AI) , renewable energy engineering also fascinates me lot. I’m more kind of - we should save our planet , go green :mindset person. Please drop your advice for me

Seeking Advice: Should I Delay Graduation to Strengthen My Skills and Pursue Summer Internships?","Hi everyone,

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice. I’m an Engineering Technology major with a concentration in Computer Network Systems Management (basically network engineering). However, I’m looking to transition into cloud computing because I don’t enjoy networking as much and feel cloud computing has a stronger future.

Currently, I’m on track to graduate in May 2025, but I’m considering delaying graduation in hopes of landing a summer internship that aligns with my career goals. Internships seem to be one of the best ways to transition into a full-time role, which is my ultimate goal.

Here’s some background:

* **Cloud Computing Experience:** I’ve taken a cloud computing class and really enjoyed it, which solidified my interest in pursuing a career in this field.
* **Internship Experience:** I’ve had two internships, but neither is directly related to cloud computing, the career I want to pursue.
* **Co-op Opportunity:** I’m doing a co-op internship as part of my senior capstone project. It’s related to machine learning (which I’m interested in), and there’s a chance it could lead to a full-time internship after May. Even though it’s not directly in my major, I’d be open to taking it if no other opportunities come through. However, nothing is guaranteed.
* **Certifications:** I’m currently working on the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and plan to pursue the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification next. I’m also considering working on the CCNA certification, though I’m unsure how applicable it would be to my cloud computing goals.

**The Issue:**  
To graduate on time, I’d need to take 18 units next semester, which would be overwhelming and leave little room to focus on certifications or strengthening my skills. Additionally, I don’t know if I’d be able to secure a job post-graduation without any relevant internships or certifications.

My plan is to delay graduation and instead:

1. Take 12 units next semester (to remain full-time for financial aid).
2. Take 6 required units in the following semester, plus 2 additional classes (possibly a Python coding class and an AI/ML class).

This way, I could:

* Work on certifications to build credibility in cloud computing.
* Develop skills that align more closely with my career goals.
* Have more time to apply for internships and prepare for opportunities.

**Other Considerations:**  
I live at home with my parents and help out at their restaurant on weekends. I can take time off to focus on studying if needed, so I have flexibility and can afford this change.

**My Question:**  
Should I stick to this plan, even though I don’t have an internship or job lined up yet? Or should I just push through the 18 units next semester and graduate on time?

If anyone has been in a similar situation, I’d love to hear your experiences and whether you regretted delaying graduation if things didn’t go as planned.

1h7srk4,Should I take the leap?,"I recently found out that my full time job will be letting me go within the next 2-3 months. My dream is to make my business my full-time job. It currently is bringing in 60% of my full-time salary and I am looking to scale things once I leave my full time job.

My issue feels more emotional and I want to know whether it would be smart or plain dumb. I currently have to pretend I’m okay and play along with people who are undermining me so that I can get a job while I wait to be replaced. I have the urge to put my two weeks and quit, mainly for the confidence boost of being able to say yes I choice myself and my business over staying until you guys fired me but I don’t know if that’s the smart choice. 

I don’t have many expenses at the moment so leaving wouldn’t impact my day to day intensely but I do have some small credit card debt I want to pay off. 

Is it worth staying, putting a majority of my hours towards this job, and getting the extra checks UNTIL I get fired? Or should I put my two weeks in and let the fire motivate me to scale my business and go all in? I have already stopped interviewing for more full time roles because I am 100% sure that I want to scale my business and go all in.

It just hurts to wake up everyday and have to pretend as I wait. I’m confident I can scale my business quickly within-in 2-3 months and get more clients once I have more time to dedicate to it.

1h7smml,Wanting to Quit and Change Careers,"Hello everyone, sorry if this is long. I wanted to be a detailed as possible and ask all of my questions upfront.

I am a 26F Public Elementary School teacher in Florida teaching ELA to 4th and 5th graders. I have been teaching for 5 years. I have a bachelors and masters degree in Elementary Education from USF.
My 5 year certification is expiring June 2025 and I do not want to put in the work to renew it.

I am devastated to come to the realization that I want to quit the career I’ve been working towards since 10th grade. I feel stupid and like I have wasted the 10 years I have worked towards becoming an educator, including the money spent on student loans. I wish I didn’t choose such a specific field for my degrees. I feel like this will make it more difficult to find a job outside of this career. However, everyone keeps telling me teachers have so many transferable skills. However, I don’t feel that way when looking at the requirements/qualifications on applications. I feel very lost, unqualified, and out of my depth with this.The good thing I guess if that I realized this earlier than later.

The only job I’ve had is in teaching and going from an education minor to this career was relatively easy considering where I am located is in need of teaching so the process was straight forward.

The main factors for leaving are I want a career making more money so that I can provide for myself and be financially secure and I want a career that I can move up in.

These are the following things I have done:

-Updated my resume (I want to continue to edit my skills to more closely align with the roles I am interested in/applying to).

-Created a LinkedIn account and began searching companies and positions I would be interested in. These include: associate/project manager, scrum master, project coordinator, Ed Tech, curriculum/instructional design, event planning, office assistant/manager, associate manager, learning/implementation specialist, curriculum analyst. I would love a career working for USF in some capacity if possible.

-Contacted a free career coach with USF that work with alumni. (As appointments are during the day I will need to take off of work and do that after the winter break).

-Contacted USF to discuss programs and certifications such as for project management. I asked if they advise that I return back to school to earn a second masters degree in a business related field if that would help my future at all- the did not think it was needed as I already have a masters in education. What are your thoughts on this?

-Looked into other certifications such as for Microsoft 365. (I am proficient as I use Excel for tracking and analyzing student data, PowerPoint, Word, SharePoint, and Outlook, however, I would like certifications to add to my resume if that would help).

I am someone who is a continuous learner and strives to consistently improve. I am driven and goal oriented. I am organized, detailed, and have good planning skills. I am good with time management and communicating/collaborating with others.


Any help or advice you could give would be wonderful

Please let me know if you can recommend any other roles/positions that would be a good fit for my background or that I would be qualified for!

If there anything else that I could or should be doing?

Are there any other resources I could be researching/looking into?

Are there any certifications you think would be good to earn and add to my resume?


***Additionally, if I accepted a job offer, I would quit in the middle of the school year. I do not plan on ever returning back to education. I have work colleagues who would be references. 
What are the repercussions of this? Do I need my school/principal to be a work reference? Of course I have not done this before so it is unfamiliar if you have any experience please let me know!

Edit: I am currently making $55,000 before taxes/$45,000 after taxes annually. However my goal right now if possible would be to make $72,000 before taxes.

1h7sira,Anyone left a field to do something totally different than their degree?,"
Long title but as I write this long post I am curious who had decided to leave their field for something totally different or thinks about it than what their degree and background is in.

For me I am a marine biology major having done my undergrad in marine bio in 2020 and masters of environmental resources management in 2023. I have biological experiences such as working in labs analyzing microorganisms and was also a research assistant during undergrad working in a fisheries lab. In grad school I only did one internship where I worked with an environmental firm in conducting a study and field work on marine debris pollution I was also during grad school for 2-3 years a lab instructor teaching marine science labs to college freshmen students. After graduating I ended up in environmental education working at an aquarium as a naturalist and then at a nature preserve as a science educator. Environmental education was not my original focus especially with my masters degree and those positions made me feel underemployed after graduation. 

Despite all the experience though I’ve had, I feel not at ease especially now since the summer I am currently unemployed for 5 months and it’s been incredibly hard to land a role in my field again as the field is so saturated. I actually thought having a masters degree would substantially help me out but I am told I am over qualified or don’t have enough real experience. As I look deeper though there’s just a lack of opportunities in the field despite being well qualified. I find a significant barrier lately is that many opportunities in the field require payment for access, unpaid Internships or be directly involved in research/academia. The low pay is what gets me where on average marine bio careers range from $35k to $50k a year which is not sustainable in todays economy in the US. It’s been shoved down my throat during undergrad that getting a masters degree will guarantee me a job but that turned out to be a false hope and I feel I made a mistake in pursuing a masters.

I thought about switching career fields into the medical sector where I am thinking of doing an associates in radiology or nursing within the healthcare field and just think of marine bio as more of a hobby. I would hate to go back to school just to accumulate debt but honestly I feel lost and stuck.
Do I feel wrong for feeling this way? Anyone ever been in this kind of position? ",Dman_C,1,0.9900000095367432,2,1733457239,2024-12-06 03:53:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h7sira/anyone_left_a_field_to_do_something_totally/,12,2024

1h7rxrn,"Career change, retail to something like retail?","Where does one go if they like retail? I enjoy customer interaction, the constant moving, the different challenges. I know I'm odd, but I really do enjoy retail. But, two things, first, retail is dying. I hate to be all ""wrong generation"" but, I feel like if this were the 80s, I'd have a nice comfortable life as some sort of manager in a mall.  
Second, I feel like I've plateaued. I'm currently a store manager for a smaller retail business. Unfortunately, there really isn't much higher I can go in my company. And due to my lack of formal education, I'm not being considered for similar positions at any of the bigger companies which may offer room to grow, or higher salaries. Not that it matters, as a lot of them are on a downturn anyway. Seems every day I read about a big name retailer facing falling sales and even bankruptcy.

I've considered going into retail banking, but even that industry is facing challenges, and again, to be a manager there usually means I need a degree. And starting off as a teller would require a major lifestyle change I'd rather avoid unless necessary.

Every talks up the trades, and while I agree you can make a good living doing that, I've never been good with my hands, so that's a route I'm not looking to go down. Perhaps if I were a younger man, I would.

I've looked into sales, but I feel I need to actually like the product to do it. When I've sold things I didn't really believe in, I was not as successful. I don't know what industry I'd look into for ""sales"" anyway.

So, my question is - does anyone have any recommendations? Where do I start looking if I'm looking for a change?",Ok_Scene905,1,1.0,1,1733455379,2024-12-06 03:22:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h7rxrn/career_change_retail_to_something_like_retail/,12,2024

1h7p5fu,(21M) Somebody PLEASE help me! What should I do? I wish to start education in UK again but I have no qualifications/GCSEs.,"Posting this on a throwaway.

I (21M) was born and raised here in the UK but I completed education abroad. After I finished high school, I did a Collegeboard SAT exam, managed to get into a university and studied electrical engineering for 2 years before dropping out for several personal reasons.

I recently attended an adult open day event at a UK college and I explained my complicated situation to them. I mentioned that, although I had no GCSEs, I felt like I had equivalent assessment of my English and Maths skills to be able to enrol for a business or digital adult course, or perhaps an apprenticeship even.

They told me that my entry exams abroad are “useless” and that I would be required to take an assessment on campus to determine my level. Fair enough, I did just that and scored extremely high on both English and Maths (Level 2.6 and 2.7 respectively) although my IT level was entry level 3 🤷‍♂️.

The college staff looked at it and were very impressed with my score; however, they iterated that a qualification in English and Maths functional skills was necessary in order for me to progress up and decided to put me on Level 2. 

I also was advised to could take on a Level 2 business course, despite being 3 months late to the program - they felt that catching up would be no problem at all for me due to my assessment scores.

Here’s the thing: I can’t help but feel that this is a severe downgrade; I was breezing past Calculus I and II, and made lightwork of differential equations. The maths level I would be working at is kindergarten-level compared to what I was accustomed to; even Collegeboard SAT maths is harder than this. As a native English speaker, the English section is even worse.

But at the same time, one of the reasons why I left is because I wish to build a future here and I feared that the degree I was pursuing may not be internationally recognised because of the country I was studying in. Besides, my family is here and moving closer to them is always a plus.

I apologise if I come off as a bit arrogant here, but I can’t help but feel like I'm underselling myself. I am confident I have more than enough skills, but is it solely lack of qualifications and GCSEs that’s holding me back? Not only that, but I'm *21;* time is against me, I'm not a teenager anymore. 

What should I do?

I’ve voiced my preferences for projects that align with my interests but my feedback is being ignored, and I feel like I’m being gaslighted into accepting this one.



I’m also concerned about my relocation destination. I’ve been assigned to a city with high air pollution, which could seriously affect my asthma. I’ve heard from colleagues that the conditions could be very challenging, especially during dry seasons. Additionally, I’ve never lived in a hot climate, and I know I’d struggle with that. On top of that, I’ve heard concerns about safety, particularly for women, and the isolation caused by heavy traffic and hotel stays.



I’m at a crossroads—should I just ""suffer through"" this rotation (which starts in several months) and hope I'll manage (and won't die lol), or is it time to start looking for another job so I can quit once the rotation is about to start? The job market is tough tho, and the company is a really good one and I like the job itself - it just feels like this HR manager completely disrespects me.



I’d really appreciate any advice or insight from people who’ve been in a similar situation.

I thought since I'm not super desperate to look for another job I will be ok with the process. But no, the process of job hunting triggers my anxiety and all the negative chatters comes back to haunt me...I'm so tired trying to be ok and ashamed for having anxiety creeping back to my life.

1h7nj2c,Does anyone have any experience with a company that wants you so badly that they’re willing to adopt a hybrid schedule for you?,"I’ve been interviewing with a company for a position that a recruiter sought me out for,  and it seems like it would be a great career move for me. The salary is 165k (I’m currently at $110k) and there are a few perks of the role I think I would really grow/learn from (trips abroad being the biggest).

Here’s my hang up—
I’m currently at a hybrid schedule (3 days in office, 2 days wfh) and I absolutely love it, no going back. The recruiter has made it clear to my would-be manager that a hybrid schedule is a non-negotiable for me. He was very hesitant at first and even explained on our 2nd call together that he’s nervous about “making sure I’m getting my work done” — even though I assured him I am very disciplined and hybrid has increased my productivity in my current role tremendously. He also said he’s nervous about the rest of the team as they are all in 5 days a week.
The recruiter has now come back to me saying that they are willing to accommodate the hybrid schedule because they want me this badly, but they will likely have to allow the rest of the team to be hybrid as well.

I’m wondering if anyone has any advice or experience with this sort of thing? It seems too good to be true and while this is a reputable company, I’m quite frankly kind of afraid of a bait and switch. I’m also admittedly nervous about working for a company that has no experience with hybrid scheduling.

Huge downside is that I will need a car to commute 45 mins, and I don’t currently have one (I live in NYC).

However, I've been struggling to code quickly and without the help of Google which worries me for coding interviews and has discouraged me to continue. I don't have a lot of experience aside from unpublished projects from university and volunteer experience with website building.

I wouldn't mind a career in where I can code, but I wouldn't want that to be my main job. I wanted to go into technical project management as well however I don't believe I qualify so early on.

1h7klb8,What should I do? I wish to start education in UK again but I have no qualifications/GCSEs.,"Posting this on a throwaway.

I was born and raised here in the UK but I completed education abroad. After I finished high school, I did a Collegeboard SAT exam, managed to get into a university and studied electrical engineering for 2 years before dropping out for several personal reasons.

I recently attended an adult open day event at a UK college and I explained my complicated situation to them. I mentioned that, although I had no GCSEs, I felt like I had equivalent assessment of my English and Maths skills to be able to enrol for a business or digital adult course, or perhaps an apprenticeship even.

They told me that my entry exams abroad are “useless” and that I would be required to take an assessment on campus to determine my level. Fair enough, I did just that and scored extremely high on both English and Maths (Level 2.6 and 2.7 respectively) although my IT level was entry level 3 🤷‍♂️.

The college staff looked at it and were very impressed with my score; however, they iterated that a qualification in English and Maths functional skills was necessary in order for me to progress up and decided to put me on Level 2. 

I also was advised to could take on a Level 2 business course, despite being 3 months late to the program - they felt that catching up would be no problem at all for me due to my assessment scores.

Here’s the thing: I can’t help but feel that this is a severe downgrade; I was breezing past Calculus I and II, and made lightwork of differential equations. The maths level I would be working at is kindergarten-level compared to what I was accustomed to; even Collegeboard SAT maths is harder than this. As a native English speaker, the English section is even worse.

But at the same time, one of the reasons why I left is because I wish to build a future here and I feared that the degree I was pursuing may not be internationally recognised because of the country I was studying in. Besides, my family is here and moving closer to them is always a plus.

I apologise if I come off as a bit arrogant here, but I can’t help but feel like I'm underselling myself. I am confident I have more than enough skills, but is it solely lack of qualifications and GCSEs that’s holding me back? What should I do?
Please, someone answer and speak some sense into me.

My current salary is $58,000, which came from two typical small yearly raises. I’ve never asked for a raise. I have the same job title, but I’m not even doing the same job at all. When I was hired, and up until very recently, I allocated inventory to production contracts. I liked it. And now I’m working on a North American tariff project, which is completely different from what I was doing. Basically trying to save the company a few million in tariff money. 

I’ve also been presenting key data that I’ve been tracking in a daily meeting for over a year now. I’m the youngest in my office - it’s mid-sized. I train interns every summer. I took on someone else’s job earlier this year (on top of mine) when they were out indefinitely. Still managed to juggle everything and maintain efficiency. 

I like the company I work for. I like the people here. I like my bosses for the most part. But I feel pretty underpaid. I have an interview coming up next week for a different company. It’s an entry level, and similar to what I was doing when I started. Salary range is 60-70k. Hybrid schedule. I have other friends who like it there. Bigger company. I’m gonna ask for 70-75k if I get an offer. 

Am I being unreasonable? Should I ask for more? Should I entertain a counter offer if I get one? I’ve never negotiated like this before. I like my current company, but I’m not liking my current role or my pay too much. My bosses are super chill and we get along well. I just know that I’m not content with my current status.

# Other

I don't have kids nor a mortgage. I have quite a few rescue pets. My fiance is disabled and somewhat depends on me but that could potentially be reworked.

# Wishes

\- *Realistically* : I'd really like to go towards more research-oriented roles, but not necessarily in academia. Because my job is a dead-end bullshit job, my self-confidence is going down for said roles. 

\- *In terms of dreams* : My inner child wants me to go do a bachelor in physics and try my luck in astrophysics, but that seems undoable. I've, indeed, always loved space, but my physics teacher publicly humiliated me and mocked my dreams, which drained any self-esteem I had in my math and science skills. But I think I have the right approach towards math and physics now : it interests me for what it is rather than how I can use it ""*in everyday life""* as I used to say.

1h7hk5z,I feel like I'm expected to be a solo team of 10,"I'm a recent Computer Science graduate. During college, I only got accepted to internships at places it would be financially infeasible and impractical to commute, so for personal reasons I had to be picky. This left me with my backup option, so every summer was spent at the company my dad works at. It's an old manufacturing company, so they are set in their ways - think carbon copies and dot matrix printers, both of which are not a joke :)

My dad is in IT, so I was officially under him. However, I transitioned more to a software developer making custom SQL reports and little tools to help productivity in all the different departments. This was under the direction of my dad's boss, let's call him Boss. I was touching every system and every department, slowly learning the company with no dedicated training (which has itself been a pain).

Long story short, after the job search I unfortunately needed to stay at the backup option. They even let me go 100% remote since my wife needed to temporarily move across the country for a year, so it made the most sense too. I also liked that I was the only developer because it meant I could control everything and get to work on different projects all the time, it was never stagnant. Unfortunately, I haggled but they only gave me 65k/yr USD but I had to take it because it was my only remaining option.

\---

Now I'm salaried for the first time in my life, and a full-time software developer, head and only member of a one-man software development department making only 65k/year. I get most, if not all of my projects from Boss and I think I'm starting to get burnt out and wondering if people can provide advice for how to manage these projects better.

I have 50-or-so small things in my backlog, all in different places (some email, some Jira, some Teams, meetings, etc.). I've been trying my best to organize it all, and we have weekly prioritization meetings but it's hard to address all 50. Some are high priority, some are low. They are mostly either medium-sized custom web apps that Boss thinks up to increase efficiency, or reporting, or feature requests for previous apps that I am running at the company. Could I get it all done eventually? Yes.  
  
Is it normal for a boss to expect incremental progress on almost everything at once? He'll ask me ""how is <low priority task X> coming along?"" and I just say ""sorry I've been working on <high priority task A>"" every time. Switching between tasks takes so long for me. I have some things in my mind, I record meetings, and going back to these just adds so much time. I take good notes but they are all disorganized even though I am trying my best to organize them in Obsidian.

My code quality is suffering too, and I feel like I don't have time to write good documentation, or overhaul something that needs to be due to a new requirement that didn't come up in my initial discovery session (aka. asking Boss). Even low priority items have deadlines, but I can never get to them. It's like things keep getting added to the front of the line instead of the end of the line.

I recently got into software contracting on the side and it's so nice just having 1 project in front of me and no one asking me ""hey can you check this thing out really quick?"" and derailing my day.

Is this normal for full time work in general / software developers? How can I improve my experience at this company? At the current state of things, it's not even about the money, I don't think I'd feel better with a 2x raise. What do I do? I was a very successful developer team leader in college, but I can't seem to lead myself - is it my fault or are the expectations just too unrealistic?

1h7h90m,Feeling Stuck and Need Advice,"Hello all. 

I am currently an Automotive Service Advisor for a family owned mechanics shop, and have been for nearl 2.5 years. The issue is, I'm not happy here, in fact, I am pretty much miserable. 

I'm consistently asked to set my morals aside and sell jobs to customers that are overpriced (several hours over what book time calls to do the job, or marking up parts sometimes even 300-400%). Integrity is a core value for me, and this is weighing on me heavily, to the point where my anxiety and depression are causing me physical symptoms such as sickness and severe muscle pain. 

I consistently try to hold my ground and do the right thing, but I am only a grunt doing as I'm told. I can't simply quit with no other job, and the job I am at is 54 hours a week.

I have a fairly diverse career history, I have been in leadership in almost every job I've had, including a General Manager for Arby's and a Director of Training and Talent Development at Chick-Fil-A. I also have been a sales manager for a furniture store, a supervisor for a retail candy store, and a service manager for a chain casual dining restaurant. 

I am about 6 months away from having a Bachelors degree in Creative Writing. This is the field I want to be in, creating and writing. 

If at all possible, I would like to stay out of Retail/Food/Factory/Warehouse/Automotive industries. I want to find a job that is either remote, hybrid, or office related and has something to do with writing. Preferably Monday through Friday and no more than 40 hours a week. As well as gross at least $1,200 a week. While these things are all ideal, none of them would be deal breakers as I am willing to be flexible to get out of here and finally be happy.

I apologize for the long post, I just want to give as much information as I can so hopefully someone can help me. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. Having panic attacks and full on meltdowns nearly daily is taking too much of a toll on me. I'm only 28, and I wake up with unbearable pain from the muscle tension daily. 

If anyone can help me find keywords to search for, job title suggestions, or help me find a path out in any other way, I would be greatly appreciative.

1h7h3c8,Will Leaving After 6 Months Hurt Resume?,"Title says it all. Work as an IT consultant at a regional shop but have quickly outgrown the role. There are a ton of organizational issues besides that seriously limit our growth potential.

However, I’ve received an alternative offer to another consulting that provides more of the services that I would like to get into (specialized software and cloud solutions)

1h7h2pm,How to deal with neurodivergent supervisor,"Hello all. I’m currently in an onsite role and have been dealing with an extreme micro managing supervisor who I’m convinced is neurodivergent. Some examples of this behavior: never saying hello, good morning, or even having a normal friendly conversation even though we work 15 steps away from each other. All communication is through email. He will give directions in this extreme detail MLA format that’s hard to understand because it’s so much detail or he gives it in such a vague detail it’s hard to know what they actually want. Constantly brining up simple mistakes for review. (On my last quarter review I was told I needed to work on my spelling because I sent a rough draft presentation to him that had activity with two I’s). Will only speak unless it’s in our assigned meetings where I have to show him everything I do since our last meeting so he look over and judge, even if it’s simple task that do not pertain to him and on our weekly meetings he writes up an extreme detail mla format and on the meeting his first things aways said: Icebreaker, ask about his weekend. He is constantly judging my work and believes if I don’t do it exactly the way he does it it’s wrong even though many times we end up with the same result (also refuses to actually show me how to do it his way). I absolutely hate this job and hate how much this guy controls me and makes me feel less about myself.

1h7gosy,Go with 70K teaching job or 55K school district admin job?,"Im trying to choose between two job. For the past several years, I have been a high school teacher, teaching upper level courses for honors and 11th/12th grade students. Im terrible with younger students (9th grade and younger).

I get so anxious throughout the school year because it scares me to have to take care of kids. When one of them is in the bathroom, Im worried they will wonder off and I will get in trouble. If two students are arguing, i get nervous because they are in my care and Im not sure what will happen. I also don’t have the demeanor that’s good for young students. There are some that straight up disrespect me because they can tell Im not very stern.

Teaching stressed me out so much. Most students were good/okay. But there were some that made it a point to make every day a living hell because of some unresolved trauma.

I could go back into teaching at have a 70k salary which would be really helping being that I have NO savings. This 70k is for a 10 month contract, renewed every year so it’s split up into those 10 months

I could also get an admin job (data associate for a small school district) that pays much less. It’s 54K split up into 12 months per year. So not only is it less money but there’s no vacation. At lease with teaching, I can use the summer to work an extra job.

I should also note that my rent is 2200 monthly.. This means I won’t have much left after paying rent if I take the data job.  I have to stay until 7 months from now. If not, I’ll get 6K+ bill in the mail

The thing is, I feel the data job would help me build up my resume to get a better job in a few years. The thing is, I love teaching and education but being around kids is so hard for me mentally and I feel like I’m not reaching my potential.

I fell into this job by accident, so it’s not exactly what I envisioned myself doing, nor is it what I want to continue doing. 

I’m trying to decide what career path to take next and I’m very indecisive. I’m trying to determine the skills and interests I have to help me navigate it. I recently rediscovered a skill I have that I really enjoy doing. 

We receive requests for additional payments, temp hires, student hires, etc. The platform we currently use is being decommissioned. I’ve been helping my supervisor create a new form using Airtable. 

I’m really enjoying creating the forms and building out a workflow on the Airtable bases for each form and each process. I like the organization, the gathering of information, the formatting. It really clicks with my brain and I’ve always liked this stuff, just never thought of it being applicable to a job!

I hope I’m explaining this well so I can get some recommendations.

Management are in the middle of performance reviews but they started me right after the fourth quarter began, and I recently learned this means they get to skip me for evaluation according to their procedures. 

I was initially planning to wait until 4-6 months had passed to ask for a raise but I've been reading about this topic and supposedly you don't want to ask after the new year and after they've just gone through performance reviews because the company will have just decided on the budget.

I am trying to be vague for anonymity: I have been with my company for more than 15 years, climbing the ladder, and helping it grow from a very small business to the midsized business it is today.

Recently interviewed for an open executive position.  I received the “job” **but** the role was split between myself and another employee. We are essentially dubbed “junior executives”.  Recently I found out they are making almost double my salary.

 As expected, this was very much a punch to the gut.  I need to discuss this with the president of the company but do not want to reveal I know that my counterpart is being compensated almost double what I am.  I am objectively the better employee – I do not say this to put them down or discredit their skills.  They absolutely have skills that I do not have (and vice versa).  However, as a junior executive, they currently do not possess the same management or leadership skills I have, and it is evident that they are struggling.  Multiple people have asked me for advice on how to improve their skills.

I would like some unbiased feedback on how to approach this topic with the president, without having to come off as ""whining"" that my counterpart is making significantly more than I am.  Thank you for any tips!",LRBrenayl,0,0.5,7,1733419701,2024-12-05 17:28:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h7ekic/discovered_my_counterpart_is_making_almost_twice/,12,2024

Was in business courses but fell in love with programming and eventually sub my courses to programming related and scored quite well (A or at least B+). Able to land AI company in Japan for internship for good 6 months. From then I’m keen to being a software developers if possible a full stack developer

Once I’m back I feel I’m starting have no directions joining random company doing little bits of here and there..

First company: sme - mainly doing customised ms crm 365 for government (gov) clients

Salary: 3k upgrade to 3.8k in span of 3 years (bonds) and no bonus

Culture and co-workers: 90% Indian staff I’m pretty okay with it as I literally made friends with everyone and learn something from them. Reason I left because at the point I join the company there’s like estimated 30 dev and the time I decided to leave is total dev is about 8 including myself.

Work: work as associate software developer and did front end designs and implementations for some gov clients. Also customising ms crm 365 on premise. Handling 2 account as primary developer due to short of staff. Did everything they ask from implementing selenium with python to automate testing process but did not used by them and as if just a hobby project for me to kill time.. To supporting clients without any senior guidance during production issue happening at 4am alone. Is quite scary for me especially its production and I don’t have any backup. But gotten over it myself and resolve the issue thanks to google. 

Second company: German based company that have subsidiary in my country. Well consider SME I guess. Main company seems to have their software team running but our team well idk what we doing are tbh. Mainly selling observability solutions and take a profit margin that can’t even cover the entire team salary. In short we not making any money it seems. 

Salary : 4K no increment so far working for 2 years and only get 20% bonus from what is promised in the contract.

Culture and co-workers: mostly foreigners from Indo, viet, Malaysia, Thailand but no Indians. Everyone is friendly and approached me to make introductions of themselves on my first day joining in. We do some team bonding every quarterly as company level and have dinner after that.

Work: during the interview, I was promised that there is career growth and lots of programming projects which I’m interested in. The interview consist of 2 technical interviews and 1 more with the directors. I think I did a lot of some small projects and my creativity somewhat attracts them. Gotten the job, in the first 4 months we did internal project with the idea similar to Airbnb but is for office co working spaces. I volunteered to be the main front end developer and create design of website in figma and create prototypes using ionic which both I think I did pretty okay considering is my first time. CEO initially liked the idea after we presenting our prototype but our boss seems to screw up the presentation by asking investment of 6 figure in order for us to continue this project. Of course that didn’t went well. After that incident I didn’t do shit other than attend endless meetings day to day and being asked to do meeting notes for each meeting. Literally my boss wants me to take down notes for every time someone spoke not even just the main point. Asked to picked up power bi skill for an existing project they promised to deliver but non of the software department have any knowledge on power bi. Thankfully the client is not so fussy and I still managing and trying to manage their prod while googling like mad on how to do it as first timer. Decided to quit not long ago, hoping for the best for the next company.

I felt all these year I didn’t even get to experienced how the end to end of a technology work and what is the best practice. I feel that all these years I only learn enough to show some progress but couldn’t be doing something big that I can be proud of. I start to think do I even wanna continue in this line of work.

Just pass a technical interview earlier today. But I’m worried that the company I’m going for will be the same as before and I won’t be able to learn anything or focus on a specific thing / specialised in a technology or language

1h7dwwj,Lateral move opportunity - anxious as hell,"Does anyone else feel a sense of dread leaving their current role to move to another lateral role/new team/new work? If so, how did you deal with it? Are lateral moves worth it in the end?

*Background:*

I have been working as a dev in a cost-recovery team of about 6 people for about 5 years. The unit has existed for 5 years, as well. In this time, I worked as a full stack dev, bit of sysadmin, making design decisions - you name it. I got the chance to work at multiple things. The team is young and it's a lot of making our best judgement. There's a potential that the work may become lighter in the coming years - we are now focusing on outreach. We are getting similar work in the foreseeable future - WP, PHP dev for LMS, etc. And I've had a hell of a year last year - felt like I was not seen even after putting so much in, there were other folks being super vocal/taking credit for my ideas and I felt exhausted. But at this current point in time, folks are nicer to me. Also, I haven't received a proper feedback for all these years about what I do well, what I can improve on, etc. It's all about getting work done on a day to day basis. 

I applied to another posting at the same org. They liked me, I think. And I got the offer letter. The work, I think, is a departure from full-stack dev, with more focus on reporting tools like pl/sql, etc. And they seem to be in the midst of starting the change from that type of reporting to building reporting solutions using Power Apps. The new department has 15-20 folks. No cost-recovery. They have existed within the organization for 15-20 years and have experienced devs who have worked there for even 25 years (a few of them). They also take care of all applications that the clients/staff use within the organization, so they seem like they have a broader catalogue - though I'm not sure if I'd be expected to work on them at any time.

My salary, benefits, etc. stay the same.

Then I went back to school for a business major, and I just couldn’t do it. I decided I wanted to do a trade instead, as I felt my personality fit something like that better. 
I chose to peruse being an electrician, and while I wait for my aptitude test I’ve been working at a cable company rewiring apartment buildings. I like my job, but it’s exhausting and dangerous. I can barely lift the 20 foot ladder. After getting some experience Im not sure I’m cut out to be an electrician.
I’m not great at math, my strong suit is probably reading/writing or science based things. I was one of those student who got by easily in school, high grades without trying, but when the real world hit I was shocked.
I need to find something to support myself, I’m sick of being broke and uneducated, if I go back to school I’m going to force myself to stick with it. I want a family one day and I know I need an education and stable career to support that.

1h7czqo,"Giving up, or Doing What is Best","TLDR: I want to quit an unpaid internship, but don't want to 'give up', would like some advice



Right now, I am a college senior looking to graduate in a few months. I also have a **paid** internship. Recently I was offered an **un-paid** internship that I could do in my free time (no real deadlines, just helping out 5-10 hours a week). That unpaid internship has quickly become the source of a lot of stress and is taking time away from my **paid** job (internship) and school.

  
My question here comes from leaving the unpaid internship. I don't want to give up because it has gotten 'hard' or 'too much to handle', but I also want to get good grades in school, and do well at my paid job. I feel like it is best to leave the unpaid internship, to focus on what will provide for my family. Is that giving up, or doing what is best for me? I'm curious what you all think.",ThatsItImCrying,1,1.0,1,1733415779,2024-12-05 16:22:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h7czqo/giving_up_or_doing_what_is_best/,12,2024
1h7cykk,Beginner in Cybersecurity: Best Courses and Hiring Chances?,"
	Hi everyone,
I’m planning to start my career in cybersecurity and need some guidance. I have a basic understanding of computers and am currently pursuing an MCA. I’m interested in learning cybersecurity through online courses or certifications but feel overwhelmed with the options available.

	Some courses I’ve heard about include:

		•	CompTIA Security+
	•	Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
	•	Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)
	•	Google Cybersecurity Certificate

	Could you please guide me on:

		1.	Which course would be better for a beginner like me?
	2.	Are there specific skills I should focus on initially (e.g., networking, Linux, etc.)?
	3.	What are the chances of getting hired as a fresher in cybersecurity? Should I focus on internships or projects first?

	I’d really appreciate any advice or personal experiences to help me choose the right path. Thanks in advance!",Pavansplanet,1,1.0,0,1733415696,2024-12-05 16:21:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h7cykk/beginner_in_cybersecurity_best_courses_and_hiring/,12,2024
1h7covn,Should I quit? ,"I just joined 3 months ago and I don’t think this is a good fit - both the role and the company itself. There are a lot of red flags that’s taking a toll on me mentally and physically and I don’t know how much longer I can hold out. 

A lot of people are saying not to quit without a job, especially in this economy. Can you all help and talk through it with me given the context of my work below? 

I’m very much a type A person and never in a 100 years would I have ever considered quitting with no job lined up; however, this job is making me insane and I wake up miserable everyday. I have enough savings, I live at home so no major financial obligations. My plan is to take the time to mentally reset, upskill (potentially go back to school or get a cert), and then apply for new jobs within the year.

My two main questions are: 

1. Should I quit?
2. Is this NORMAL (context below)???? 

Context / a mini rant :) 

1. Expectations of the role didn’t align with what was communicated during the interview process. I was told that for the first year, that this is a completely new team and we’re building from the ground up including our scope of work, processes, our overall practice. However, when I joined, we already had customers lined up waiting for our services when we don’t have a foundation or structure built. This was flag #1. But the nature of this type of work, you can build as you go and I was okay that’s fine. But it’s been an uphill battle managing all the incoming projects. 
2. There is no structure in place - for our team as well as the rest of the company. It’s very much start up vibes, but this company has been around for 50+ years which makes me confused. Role expectations, processes, scope of work is all over the place notably within my team, but other work streams as well. 
3. Manager is mia. There isn't really any clear direction coming from them, and team camaraderie is definitely missing. We've all brought up the need for more structure but nothing has happened. They are extremely busy so I'm trying to be understanding, and I don't mind a hands off manager..but there is a huge gap in what we're all trying to achieve here. 
4. Toxic behavior amongst the team. There is a lot of passive aggressiveness and it seems like my colleagues all seem to not work well together. A lot of out of pocket comments. I’m a pretty agreeable person and have been trying to navigate / tiptoe around their personalities, but the tensions between our meetings are taking a toll on me, and it just makes me not want to work at all.
5. This is a traveling customer gig, and as I mentioned before, we don’t have a structure or process fully fleshed out and stuff that we are presenting to is mostly put together last minute, with little intention due to other competing priorities. From my past experience, traveling onsite takes a lot of planning, prep, but no one here really carries the weight. I do as much prep as I can..but there are a lot of last minute ‘brainstorming’ sessions the NIGHT and even the MORNING of the meetings to change things up and I can’t keep up with it. We are also working 7 AM - 11 PM at night while we’re traveling - always together. We’re out getting lunches and dinners together but it all just seems so unproductive when we are meeting and talking in circles and nothing gets done. It seems like our manger is encouraging this behavior too or doens't think it's a big deal. This is causing huge burn out. 

I am greener than the rest of the team and tbh the rest of the company. Been in the workforce for 8 years not and have hopped around a few companies and have dealt with conflict before…but the  immaturity in the personalities here is something I’ve never seen before and it’s a big turn off. 

TLDR; with the combination of no work life balance, toxic behavior, Mia manager, no structure, is all making me question…should I call it quits for my sanity? Use the time to mentally reset and figure out next steps? ",Rare-Friendship-366,1,1.0,1,1733415000,2024-12-05 16:10:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h7covn/should_i_quit/,12,2024
1h7cjoo,30m Feeling lost in life don’t know what to do next?,"Well, I’m 30m. I just moved to Houston from California because I’ve been in a mental slump for the past two years. I was with the girl of my dreams, for about a year. Working at a car dealership and making pretty good money, she got pregnant and decided to abort it even though I felt the opposite way. I began drinking and going out a lot with friends. I ended things with her cuz I didn’t feel right staying with her after that and pretty much it was an ugly breakup and I have been in a mental slump since. I left the dealership cuz I couldn’t focus, went completely broke. Got both of my cars repossessed, my motorcycle, and had to move back in with my parents. I tried doing odd jobs and nothing stuck. 
I knew I needed change so I saved up enough to move myself to Houston after landing a job in “real estate”. Thinking this would be the change I needed, I did it. I’m here now, by myself. I have zero friends here and back home cuz I burnt all those bridges a long time ago.

This job is not what I expected and I’m not seeing any indication that I’m going to make the money I wanted to make for me to bounce back. I really don’t like sitting in an office all day, I’m literally living off the base pay and I’m netting $2580/m. My goal is to make $6,600 a month so I can get the apartment I want and just begin to pay my debts and fix my life. I want to get into flipping cars or something? I feel like I’m wasting time at this job and I could make more money putting my efforts into something else. So I plan on driving uber and going back to being a personal trainer part time while I figure this out.
But I have no idea what I want to do as far as a career? Outside of boxing which I have been doing since I was 10 years old. I think that’s the only thing I could see myself doing forever but idk how much money I could realistically make owning a boxing gym. I doubt it’s much. 
But yah I’m trying to figure my life out. 
I’m 30. In a new city alone. Broke.
No friends. No idea what I’m doing.

1h7c8cu,In what order should I prioritise things to start working,"I. Autistic and dyslexic and been struggling all my life with what I’m meant to be doing work wise. I also struggle to prioritise steps I potentially could take to improve my situation whilst also not really totally knowing what they could be.

Context, I’ve not worked in 7 years now. The work before that was all over the place and needed no qualifications and left me deeply depressed and no functioning.

I’m British but now live in the EU. This means I do t have a school diploma. I also do not have a degree. I am willing to try but I dropped out university twice in the Uk due to my social and communication difficulties.

I’m trying hard to learn the local language but none of the courses here will offer reasonable adjustments to enable me to learn. I have arranged to see a speech therapist in Feb 2025.

I have arthritis and I am on a medication from mid December which will make me nauseous and drowsy.

I don’t drive and dont have a driving licence.

I feel like with most of the above it means I’m left with needing to improve my qualifications somehow and work from home? I welcome any other potential ideas though. If someone could help me prioritise what to work on first it would help me massively. I’m really tired of living on my partners wages, I want to bring some of my own money into the household. 

I am late 30s so very aware that things like apprenticeships would likely be nonexistent for me as well even if I could speak the local language well enough. I know enough to muddle by in shops, dealing with delivery men and ordering myself food in restaurants so far. I do have permission from the government to be working.",sparkle_warrior,1,1.0,0,1733413815,2024-12-05 15:50:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h7c8cu/in_what_order_should_i_prioritise_things_to_start/,12,2024
1h7c69q,Waiting around for my former job to give me a start date…Should i move on? ,"Hey, i’m not even too sure why i’m writing this but I feel like i need reddit advise on this one! 

For a bit of background, I lost my job about 2 months ago. I was working in hospitality but left to try some office work but obviously it didn’t work out very well. Since then I have been trying to get my old job in hospitality back. I have been in touch with the managers for about 4 weeks now and only got sent the onboarding forms on Saturday evening. I filled it all out and sent it back and now it’s Thursday and I have heard nothing. Another manager texted me asking if i got the starter forms okay and i responded with they are done and sent back. 

I am starting to mentally struggle with not having a job and as much as i would love to go back to my old job I am feeling like I’m being messed around a little bit. I applied for another job before I got starter forms from my old job and they were super keen on me and I originally accepted the offer as I felt like I couldn’t rely on my old job so much. However once they sent through the forms It gave me a lot of reassurance and I told the other place i applied for I was no longer interested. Now it’s coming to the end of the week, i feel like i should have just taken the new job and moved on.  

I am not too sure what to do, should I wait and hope for the best or get back in touch with the other place and try to redeem myself? This whole situation ever since losing my job is starting to run me down and I feel like i need honest advice from people who have been here before or even  someone looking from the outside.

1h7brk6,Becoming an RN to become a lawyer(?) ,"Single mom here.

So I would like to advance my education. For the last three years I have been trying to figure out how to best pay my way through school. I am currently in administration and only make 60k a year with great benefits working in the non-profit industry but this is the least amount of money I have made in my working career. 

I have been entrepreneurial in the near past and made a serious amount of money in a short period of time due to buying into a trend and then the trend died and I am passing the time with this job while I figure out the next steps for me. 

I have experience in legal administration and also have worked in the senior care industry. I would like to double my income and still only work 40-50 hours a week(for now). I started working part time in the home care industry and now my income will increase to 75k. I would like to continue to pursue a RN license as even if I worked part time I would make closer to my current salary while still having time to pursue other goals such as pursuing a legal degree and creating other areas of passive income. I have a goal for myself to be an RN and have past the bar within an 8 year time frame. 

Is this realistic or am I spending too much money for little financial return in comparison? I absolutely want to become an attorney but my current responsibilities in life make pursuing that full time unrealistic. I would like to pay my way through school so once all education is complete I would be debt free.

So Im a 21 year old student, from Pakistan, currently in my third semester of uni. My uni isn't that great, I'm basically doing HND in computing and then a top up (which accounts to a Bachelor's degree from the University of London). I chose the route as it meant that I would have a lot of free time to pursue other stuff. 

As for what I've done until now: 

During my A-levels I went through two internships at two different startups, for a total of about 10 months total. I learned quite a lot and on of the founder of that startup became my mentor. Among the things I learnt were developing in the MEAN stack, AWS cloud and PCB designing.

 After that I started my own IOT startup, was part of NIC and Plan9(These are startup incubators), took part in numerous pitching competition local and international(online), made it to many final rounds but never won one. After many trials and error made my own custom PCB/ a MVP. But it all ended going no where, though I do admit I did learned a lot during that time. 

Most recently did some work for my mentor, a startup in Dubai. 

The thing is I'm confused as what to do next. I want to go after some AWS certifications, but then recently I got into cybersecurity, which is a lot more enjoyable than what I've done until now. So I started preparing for the CEH from another mentor. During that I really enjoyed networking and got really deep into that and now I've ended up preparing for the CCNA. 

The thing is I'm confused. I don't really have a path laid out ahead of me, I'm confused about what I should do? What certs should I get? And what should I focus on. I'm scattered all over. I know how to do a lot of stuff but I'm not great at anything. As they say ""Jack of all trades, master of none"". I know a little/moderately about all this stuff and can setup stuff with help of google but don't really have a good hold over one specific thing.

1h7b628,"39y/o O&G Engineer, at a major crossroads and need guidance (Canada)","Apologies if this gets a bit long-winded, but I feel like I’m at a crossroads in my career and life and could use some outside perspective.

I’m a 39-year-old senior pipeline engineer in Canada, trying to figure out my next steps, heres my work history.

* **Company 1 (15 months):** Project Engineer at an industrial valve company, working closely with inside sales/manufacturing teams to execute projects.
* **Company 2 (5.5 years):** Planning Engineer (2 years) and Design Engineer (3.5 years) at a natural gas company, focusing on distribution pipeline projects.
* **Company 3 (5+ years):** Senior Engineer, initially working on transmission pipeline projects. 
* **Current Role, Company 3**: Senior Engineer (7 months) – Handpicked for a newly formed group focused on R&D and new energy initiatives (business development).

I relocated to a smaller city six years ago for Company 3 after being laid off from company 2, but I’ve struggled to feel settled. The city doesn’t facilitate my interests (e.g., mountain biking, hiking, etc.), the food scene is underwhelming, and I lack a personal support system(family, friends). This has made me hesitant to settle down or buy property here. People are nice here, there is a sense of community but I appreciate bigger city vibes and offerings.

# Current Role and Concerns

I now work for a government organization (Company 3). The job has excellent security, was never worried during covid and has excellent work-life balance. I have great coworkers, good bosses. I do enjoy coming to work. I was promoted to Senior Engineer within five months of joining and succeeded in that group becoming a SME. 

Some cons are: The pay is lower than industry standards (25%-50th percentile). Raises feel disconnected from merit or performance. Organizational culture leans heavily on maintaining the status quo. Sporadic upward mobility—management positions do open up, but they are then locked up for a long time. Typical gov problems, slow moving, no reason to innovate etc... 

However, my career growth feels blocked:

* In 2023, my manager was promoted to director. I applied for his position but didn’t get it; it went to an existing manager who made a lateral transfer without interviewing. That felt like a major roadblock for my career progression as this position will not open up for years and this is what I have been doing for the past 10 years, so now what?
* This year, I was selected by my VP to join a newly formed group of 3, focusing on new energy innovation. This new group is in a different business unit from where I started so I am reporting to  a new director, and executive.
* While being handpicked felt validating, in the formation of this group I was encouraged to apply for manager; I applied for and didn’t get it. The feedback was positive, my interview and presentation was great.  Feedback was: “You’re right there, maybe in a year or two”—but I struggle to trust statements like that. My director even said, “I hope this doesn’t make you want to leave the group,”, in my post interview conversation, because they really wanted me to bring my expertise to this new group. So I remain a senior engineer in this new group. This only fueled my uncertainty about my growth potential here.

# Current Challenges:

1. **Unclear Career Path**: The new group is still finding its footing. We’re presenting a major deliverable to executives in January, but after that, the mandate remains fuzzy. There’s talk of either spearheading new initiatives or supporting ongoing ones, but no clear roadmap for the development of the seniors in the group ( me and another guy)
2. **Stagnation Concerns**: I’ve been in the workforce for 12 years, and while I’ve progressed, I feel disappointed in my career growth. I’m questioning whether I’ve hit a ceiling here or if I lack the skills to advance further. I’ve sacrificed career growth and earning potential compared to peers in more competitive industries.
3. **Personal Dissatisfaction**: Beyond work, I’m not happy in the city I’m living in. It’s affecting my quality of life and contributing to an overall sense of being stuck. I moved here for work so I think I feel tied to work success as well.

After 12 years in the field, I feel disappointed in my overall trajectory and question whether I’ve made the right decisions.

Should I stick with this role and hope being instrumental in this new group’s success leads to career growth? Or should I explore opportunities elsewhere, even if it means leaving a secure, low-stress job for something more challenging and uncertain?

Any advice, insights, or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading!

That felt like a major roadblock for my career progression as this position will be years before it opens up and this is what i have been doing for the past 10 years, so now what?
* This year, I was selected by my VP to join a newly formed group of 3, focused on energy innovation (think R&D meets business development).This new group is in a different business unit from where I started so a new director, and executive i am reporting too. 
* While being handpicked felt validating, I was encouraged to apply for manager of this new group, I applied for and didn’t get it. The feedback was positive, my interview and presentation was great.  Feedback was: “You’re right there, maybe in a year or two”—but I struggle to trust statements like that. My director even said, “I hope this doesn’t make you want to leave the group,” because they really wanted me to bring my expertise to this new group. So I remain a senior engineer in this new group.  But really this only fueled my uncertainty about my growth potential.

# Current Challenges:

1. **Unclear Career Path**: The new group is still finding its footing. We’re presenting a major deliverable to executives in January, but after that, the mandate remains fuzzy. There’s talk of either spearheading new initiatives or supporting ongoing ones, but no clear roadmap for the development of the seniors in the group ( me and another guy)
2. **Stagnation Concerns**: I’ve been in the workforce for 11 years, and while I’ve progressed, I feel disappointed in my career growth. I’m questioning whether I’ve hit a ceiling here or if I lack the skills to advance further. I’ve sacrificed career growth and earning potential compared to peers in more competitive industries.
3. **Personal Dissatisfaction**: Beyond work, I don't love he city I’m living in. It’s affecting my quality of life and contributing to an overall sense of being stuck. I moved here for work so I think I these feelings tie into work success.

After 11+ years in the field, I feel disappointed in my overall trajectory and question whether I’ve made the right decisions.

Should I stick with this role and hope being instrumental in this new group’s success leads to career growth? Or should I explore opportunities elsewhere, even if it means leaving a secure, low-stress job for something more challenging and uncertain?

I've been considering going into technical/eng sales, remain in pipeline eng, and I am open to US opportunities since my older bro lives there but not sure. 

Any advice, insights, or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading!",ty_jax,1,1.0,0,1733411029,2024-12-05 15:03:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h7b628/39yo_og_engineer_at_a_major_crossroads_and_need/,12,2024

1h7aujy,Should I quit?,"I recently joined a new company and have been here for 3 months. There are A LOT of red flags that I have never seen before. 

1. There is no structure in place, we are a team of 3 new hires who got hired to build out work stream / practice from the ground up my manager is mia majority of the time. It’s giving very much start up vibes, however this company has been established for 50+ years which makes me question how they have been operating. Outside of our team, it seems like everyone else is also revamping their processes, and people are overall confused majority of the time on their projects, who to go to outside of their work stream, etc very silo-ed. 

There was barely a team sit down where our manager talked through what the vision is and barely given any direction /  things keep changing while we continue 

2. Co workers are unprofessional - a lot of passive aggressiveness with out of pocket comments. Overall very negative if someone voices an opinion to update or change something even though we are in the “brainstorming phases” 

3. This is a traveling, customer facing gig and whenever we travel, we are with each other from 7am until 11 pm “workshopping” and “brainstorming” with MAYBE an hour break - I was going to voice my concern but when my team member told our manager how we were up until 11 pm brainstorming, they were like that’s great!! So it seems like it’s no problem to them. We are also not productive - it’s like talking in circles but nothing gets written down or solidified 

4. We are going to customers without a full fleshed out presentation and it’s a lot of “winging it” a few days or even the morning of which I am shocked to my core how we are even able to pull it off (my team members are great on their feet while I need time to process things)

I’ve done all I could to prepare myself and the team for upcoming presentations, but it just seems like they don’t look at things until the last minute due to competing priorities. And things are falling in our laps without proper bandwidth management. 

I am a def more green than the rest of the team, but I have worked a good amount of years and have hopped to diff companies to know this is a bit abnormal. I also don’t know if this is a generational thing (first time working with only senior folks, little diversity in…everything tbh ) or if I’m just not cut out for this role or career. 

I’ve been ruminating on this a lot and it’s been a toll on my mental and physical health. I have enough savings and I live with my bf.

I’ve never quit without having another job lined up and would never in a 100 years think about doing that bc I’m very much a type A person with a plan ALWAYS. But this is too much.

Also more context, I was at an AMAZING company prior to this would great values and culture. Amazing WLB. Only reason why I left was bc I needed to relocate back home for family reasons and they couldn’t make remote work possible. 

The job I’m working at right now was supposed to be a lateral move (same total compensation) but the workload is 50x ‘more 

I also have enough saved as a cushion if I quit. My plan would be to take 2-3 months ups-killing / potentially go back for a masters or a cert. and then start applying again. 

TLDR; 
- 3 months in, no structure, colleagues are toxic
- workload is insane, had to jump right into customer work when my expectations of the role itself was to build out our practice fist before customer facing
- traveling with team is taking a toll on mental and physical health
- enough saved to quit, plan will be to take a break, upskill, then apply for jobs again

1h7aspf,How to resign when you work in your boss' house at the same table,"So I have a bit of a weird work setup. I work for a CPA in her home. Usually, it's just me and her there (and her husband and kids sometimes). She rarely speaks in person to me about performance-related things. Usually she will send emails with comments and/or lists, then acts like she never brought it up. A couple of weeks ago she actually brought up my performance verbally and said she was writing up something and didn't know if she needed to terminate me or have me go part-time. She left for a trip and then we never spoke of it again.

  
Generally we work in the same room at the same table---although most days she is frequently on the phone. I have a resignation letter with my two-weeks notice written up and e-signed to email to her (her preferred form of communication).

1h7a0ag,Should I quit my job?,"I started a post grad corporate internship back in September, it’s a year long contract. It pays well but is very fast paced and stressful even as an intern. 

They admit the learning curve for this position is hard and say it’s ok to have questions but at the same time they don’t train you adequately, then expect you to deliver with no issues. Evidence of this is them firing the temp (who started the same time as me) after they threw a bunch of stuff at her at once and she couldn’t deliver to their standards after just a few months. I’ve know been assigned most of her work. While their expectations of me as intern might not quite be as high they’re still expecting me to learn it at a fast pace.

I’m torn on whether or not I should quit. If I could get through the year it would be great for my career. However I’m already a naturally anxious person with low self esteem and I don’t think this work environment suits my personality. This job has been stressing me out an unhealthily amount. If I stuck with it I’d possibly grow into a stronger person but idk if it’s worth it in the meantime. Also the job market is so rough right now and I definitely don’t have the time to thoroughly look for something else at the same time as this job.

1h78uye,Finding value-aligned work,"Im currently working from home for a pbm processing authorization requests. This is the first job I've had that I can actually comfortably support myself with, and it's very important for me to work from home right now due to plans to move/ travel. I generally have a few calls a day and a short teams meeting weekly, which is fantastic because I have social anxiety. Instead of worrying about doing the social stuff right I can just do my job. 

I've worked in healthcare in some capacity my whole life, I always joked I'm 'in the belly of the beast' and that I'm like Mr. Incredible in the beginning of the movie when he's telling the little old lady how to get her claim approved. But it's not like that.

Sure, mostly I just do data entry, and I'm not making any decisions myself. And usually it's like viagra or ozempic that gets denied. But sometimes it's cancer meds, fertility meds, pain meds, etc. I've always felt awful about it, but not responsible myself.

But with the recent news about the UHC CEO I've been reading all the online comments and... I agree. That man didn't put the policies in place, but he sure as heck upheld them. And benefited from them. And I'm realizing that I am doing the exact same thing, everyday. 

My job doesn't align with my values or morals, and I truly feel that I can't make excuses for that anymore. I've already started looking for another job, but it took me 2+ years and hundreds of applications to get this one, so I'm not very hopeful for a quick change.

I guess I'm mostly here to vent, see if anyone has similar feelings.

1h76ayf,Who should I go with?,"Hello Guys,

I'm in dilema and I need advice. Summing up two scenarios after breif about me and current work as below.

I'm currently working as Senior Marketing Manager at a company with various verticals ranging from IoT to EV Charging manufacturing. I'm working since 2018 with Mechanical Engineering background. My first company is manufacturing moulded rubber consumables used in Tyre building machines, chemical industries like GSFC, GNFC, GACL and we had a client like CEAT, Appollo, etc from tyre industry. I used to look after from accounting to dispatch to marketing/sales and everything inbetween. I'm having fine terms with the MD even he came to my city to meet me with the dicey business proposal recently.Then I switched to Lathe Machine manufacturing company where I was hired for Sales for nearby city where I could commute daily. Before I start here, they asked me for the training period to come to their manufacturing plan and HO where I was about to stay for month or so. I went and I stayed. Looking to my performance, they asked me to relocate to that city and work from HO only and handle client portfolio. I got promoted and was heading a team of 5 and also Sales team that was hired for the nearby city from my hometown. I was living there at company accomodations. I left because the pay was mediocre and I had to settle. I found new job near to my hometown. A speciality chemical packaging company with little bit of toxic culture where I used to compute daily. A listed company on Indian bourses with average age of people working there of 45 and are living under stress from the pressures of owners. Getting no to slight promotions. I got a new job at my home town where I'm currently working. It's been 2.5 years here. Since this Company has spanned themselves into multi vertical company, Marketing and Sales channels are hardly competing with market. Low marketing and sales budgets. No customer channel. Got promoted here too. Just a few months back I've onboarded a client with single order of 4X the amount we closed previous year. Recurring business will follow from this one. I've tried reaching out to management for after the promotion to increase salary and give decisive portfolio but failed. Doing daily work and living.

Now the scenarios.

1. The Lathe company's owner called me with the offer one or so year ago with percentage in Monthly Sales. But I had to commute to nearby big city and they were about to rent office there and it did not work out. After few months, I happened to visit them at their manufacturing site and he asked me to join again and I said I'll think about it. Now, he called me recently with fixed salary plus percentage offer where I'll have to work from my hometown and travel if required for the client. Pay here is decent and I can negotiate for more too. If I join this, I'll be working on single product and market and it'll be monotonous. But I'll make money here. 

2. My younger brother has started and running a digital marketing company right here in our hometown with a healthy monthly revenue of few lakhs. Some business on percentage profit sharing too. He and his partner wants me to join the firm to manage clients and build business and other profit sharing partnerships too. Pay here is dicey but decent as depends on client retainer. If I join this, there'll be various business I'll be seeing and managing and helping them to get clients. I'll be aware about meta and google ads and other digital platforms. Since, some profit sharing partnerships discussions are going on and come and go to, money making is here too.

Yes, my one another younger brother is working with him to manage and onboard clients. Sometimes, they get disputes for work and performance and other people performing well etc.
He's too dedicated and hardworking giving his almost best for his performance and company growth but he gets carried away emotionally and stuff. Things are good btw.

My questions:
1. Who should I join?  
2. What should one keep in mind while switching?
3. Since I'm married, recently, I need to take care of my finances too. Like home, emergency funds, parents health related things, etc.

I graduated college and got a job as a software developer 6 months ago. It's my first actual full time job.

Lately, some colleagues have told me that I should ask more questions about how things work or how I should do things and they seem to be judging me a little bit for it. I've always had the habit of trying to fix things or try to do the work on my own first and when I'm really stuck that I should then ask for help.

I know I'm new in the field and I've got a lot to learn, but they basically tell me to make feature X or fix problem Y, so I try to do the work to the best of my ability. But then later tell me I'm not asking for help enough and that I should. I'm getting quite annoyed with people repeatedly telling me I should ask questions, especially when I make a mistake. 

How about I flip it around, maybe my colleagues aren't telling me enough or maybe they are not offering me enough help?

Some days are ok, but I've been constantly carrying the worry of whether or not the team I'm managing is doing well. Some members of my team have had performance issues and that's been a challenge. To be honest, I was very happy with what I was doing before and had no interest in being promoted (feels like I was promoted based on performance but not exactly my leadership potential). When it was offered to me, it was sprung on me and presented in a manner that assumed I would take the position (""you will do great in this role""). I rushed into accepting and didn’t even think to ask for additional time to think about the offer. I'm pretty sure my response back to my boss in that meeting was ""I'll give it a try"". I felt a lot of pressure to accept because in terms of seniority, I would be next in line to ""move up the ladder"" and I felt like it would have reflected badly on me if I had declined.

It stresses me out having to address performance-related issues; currently managing some underperformers who don't recognize that they're underperforming and one individual that makes a lot of mistakes and it's been stressful. I don't want to oversee anyone, I would love to just be an individual contributor and focus solely on my work.

I really want my old job back. I'm not sure I can ask for that at my current company as it feels like I'd be ""betraying"" my bosses' trust in me, and I don't think they'd take it well. They'd be highly disappointed, and it would sour my reputation among the whole company.

I'm so uncertain about everything: Is 8 months too soon to be giving up and should I give it more time? And if I really want to give up the role in the upcoming year, would my best bet be to stick it out until I find something elsewhere? I just don't know how I'd go about stepping back down at my current company.",burrah,9,1.0,5,1733380468,2024-12-05 06:34:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h72zi1/whenhow_to_step_down_from_a_manager_position/,12,2024

1h71bec,"not able to to work my scheduled shift time anymore, should I email my manager about this?","I recently posted on this subreddit a few weeks ago about an overtime issue. My job now says we have to work mandatory overtime everyday for 12 hours and 4 hours on the weekend. At the same time, things in my life have changed to where I can’t work my assigned evening shift. So the past few days, I haven’t worked the full 12 hours and had to take a day off for a personal issue. Overall, I’m thinking this job isn’t right for me because the 64 hour work weeks plus the shift time just is not working for me. So what should I do? I was going to email the manager explaining this and asking if I could be moved to day shift and I could make it work this way. and also voice my concerns and the fact that it’s almost impossible for me to work this shift and also 12 hours each day. At least morning shift for a while will be better until I decide what to do about the job overall. 

Is this a good idea? Otherwise, I’m gonna probably get in trouble for not working the hours.

1h6zrnm,Help me Decide: Computer science or Music?,"**Music**  
I currently make music. I have yet to release any of it. I'm very passionate about creating it. One issue I see with choosing this path is copyright. So many songs nowadays use the same melodies and chord progressions, yet people still face litigation. As a new artist, I think it might be detrimental to get caught up in a lawsuit with little funding. An issue I see with being successful with it is the unwanted fame and the paparazzi. I have some experience with being ""stalked"" and I do not like it.

**Computer Science**  
Ever since big language models became available to the public, I became more interested in participating in the development of AI. A problem with this career path, specifically AI development, is that I think it could be a self-destructive career. The one thing that AI developers know how to do is develop AI, so why wouldn't we create AI that makes AI? I think this problem could extend to other areas of the tech field, so I'm a little weary of investing in this career path.

I’m on the leadership team and have consistently advocated loudly for a different approach to running our company. We have continually decided against the changes and I do my best to commit. I see halving the company again on its current trajectory, financially I don’t really care I’ve done well and losing paper gains doesn’t hurt me, but emotionally I don’t want to lay of hundreds of more people who believe in me, which I have done multiple rounds of already for an approach I don’t even believe in.

So I’m thinking about walking.

The outcomes I see is 

I leave and everyone is better off (fresh leader, new voice etc + I take some time and pop up later doing something else). If I leave and the company continues to fail my reputation stays in tact as someone who decided not just sit around collecting checks as the company failed but decided to leave. 

The downside scenario is like it’s just a job, I get paid exceptionally well, and like fuck it you know, play the game and collect the checks. And shit maybe I’m wrong and we return to growth.

1h6xe3c,17m - What career advice would you have for me? ,"
I graduated high school a year early and am closing in on finishing my first term as a freshman in college. 

I have an interest in sales because I’ve got over a decade of customer service experience on account of working for my parent’s food and produce business on weekends and after classes. I pride myself on my interpersonal skills and I think it’s a field that would serve to educate me regardless of if I decided to stick with it.

I’m planning on majoring in Marketing with my choices for a minor ranging from finance, accounting, philosophy, etc. But I’m not sure how far I should take my degree.

Some industries I’m interested in are Tech, SaaS, Banking/Financials, Healthcare (Software related I’m not trying to go to med school), as well as Renewable energy and Agriculture. I currently live in Oregon near a massive intel complex (and possibly AMD competition soon to come). 

I’d say I’m a decent student but my time management skills are lacking one I’ve worked myself into a routine, monotony is hard to handle for me. I also have a girlfriend who things have been going very well with, so I’m not working with the total freedom of a single young adult here.

The questions I have for you all:

*What are some of the industries you recommend getting into based on my position? (likely starting work in 2028)

*How’s my plan for college? Am I missing anything crucial?

*Do my choices for a career necessitate a relocation?

*What other pieces of miscellaneous information do you have for me? What would you do from here in my position?

Now, AI has taken over so much of the field, and there isn't a huge demand for creative writing or journalists, and typically journalists can't work from home anyway - unless that's been grandfathered in I suppose. 

When I went to school I wanted to work for a newspaper or a magazine, but those are dying mediums. 

I think I need to go back to school, but am unsure what to take. I need a job where I can work from home, choose my own hours, have flexibility to take school holidays off, and change things around if kids get sick, etc.

1h6rfyu,Help me make a choice out of multiple offers!,"I am recently faced with the dilemma of choosing out of multiple job offers. I realize this is far from usual given the current job market, however all options have pros and cons and I am unsure which to go for.

Job 1:
- Data Analyst role
- Small team at a local company
- New role, so a lot of freedom for own insight and approach
- Enough interesting projects to work on
- Hybrid, zero commute

Job 2:
- Data Analyst 
- Main bank
- Small team, part of a large department
- Clear, rigid guidelines and assigned projects
- Mostly remote, long commute

Job 3:
- Data Scientist
- Government instance
- Small team
- Interesting and challenging projects
- Mostly remote, short commute

Things to consider:

* I might be in the minority, but I really don't like working from home continously. I actually really like socializing woth my colleagues, so I am worried about choosing job 2 or 3.

* In terms of salary, Job 1 is the highest, but Job 2 and 3 are also good.

* Job 2 and 3 are very well-known and influential companies, so having them on my CV will be good for my career down the line.


Thanks for your help!

1h6r0t1,What should I do? Is my approach correct?,"So here is my situation, I got hired as a Data Scientist and AI engineer 11 months ago and until date I have not done any useful AI projects or work in data science. I was hired by a manager that knows nothing about data science and the person who I replaced was a Analytics Analyst. Basically two different skill sets and minds.

All I have been doing is creating random dashboard visuals, barely any SQL querying and haven’t programmed in R in months, haven’t even picked up Python. 

He wants me to be a dashboard owner of a dashboard that his director messed up on. 

The director is on my team but my manager treats me like as if we are not teammates. 

I don’t know why he expects me to own a dashboard that is messed up. Or just own dashboards in general when I know that Data Scientists don’t do that really. 

I decided to start looking for new roles outside but once I hit my year in this role I would like to transfer to either another Data Science role internally or if I get hired as a data scientist externally I will take it. 


I really want to grow and develop as a data scientist and don’t see myself doing anything else other than being a statistician or data analyst but I know that is role honestly is a waste of time and I could have been using that time on more meaningful data science work.

However, my interests and experience are in robotics and electronic devices.

Given my situation, how can I find well paying entry-level jobs ($100k and above) in NYC that fit my experience?

1h6qm6s,Should I move across country for a $17K base increase?,"Hi All I (37M) currently live on the East Coast as a Senior Finance Analyst where I earn $130K base salary and $195K TC (RSUs). I just got a job offer for that requires me to move to Seattle for a Finance Manager position. The base Salary is $147K but the TC will be roughly the same $199K. Ive been mulling over if such a move will be worth it as all of my family reside on the East Coast and moving to Seattle will mean being completely alone. Also will that $17K go any further in the Seattle area? I feel like rent COL might be higher, especially given that the TC doesnt shift much. I know it sounds like im trying to talk myself out of it but its more so just where my thoughts are at.

The Work life balance at the new company seems to be better than where I am now, although Im not completely dissatisfied with my current role, the only downside of being where I am now is promotions do take longer, so this will be a jump in title for me. I did approach my current manager with this offer to see if they will counter and was told they would not be able to at this time, but they do want me to stay, they will look into maximizing my stock refresher in 2025 if I do stay, but no guarantee on what number that will be.

1h6qjos,Acting up/additional duties bonus,"Hi 

I work on a small hazardous site that is party of a multinational waste management company. I have been a senior member for 3 years and received my last pay rise (negotatiated by around £6k) in January this year. I made it clear it my boss throughout the summer that I wished to transfer to another site (same company) in the country for a better work/balance. My boss was forced to leave/got sacked 3 months ago due to some very gross misconduct and as such myself (the only other person qualified to manage a hazardous site) and a logistics manager took over running the site on a day to day level. We've been in very regular contact with my previous boss' boss who manages several of the hazardous sites around the country. 

  
For 3 months we've been working very hard to cover this role, with myself and the logistics manager handling around 80% of the duties on top of our standard day to day responsibilities. At first we went along with it and I kept quiet as I wanted to create a good reputation. It paid off as I recently had an interview for a better position at one of our sister sites - it looks very optimistic that I'll be starting there within 4-6 months. I have a pretty good feeling that this manager put in a good word for me too after seeing how well I've handled taking these extra responsibilities. My current site is still without a manager and although recently had some interviews for the position, the earliest I can see this vacancy filling is in 3-4 months. 

I feel like it is reasonable (and probably expected) for me to bring up a fair compensation request for this additional stress and workload in my next catch up meeting with this 'big boss' later this week? I can't really ask for backpay - I should have brought this up in October so I'm thinking of asking for a decent bonus instead. I earn £36k pa and I believe my manager was around £50k pa, so I'm thinking a £400/£500 monthly bonus going forward (i.e. for the next 3-6 months) would be fair? 

What  does everyone think? ",demonofthefall96,1,1.0,0,1733344813,2024-12-04 20:40:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h6qjos/acting_upadditional_duties_bonus/,12,2024
1h6qant,Gift ideas for former boss?,"Some background, I started at my current company almost 3 years ago as a remote temp hire. My then-current boss took a huge chance on me as I came from a completely different field. My job before that was very difficult and leadership was emotionally and verbally abusive. As a working professional, she was the first boss I ever had who was genuinely kind, patient, and cared about my career mobility. 

After about 7 months as a temp, I was onboarded as a full-time employee (still remote). About a year later, I was promoted into a more advanced version of that role and now report to a different manager. We have always stayed in touch (we work in the same organization) and she knows how much I appreciate her. 

I’m traveling to the main office for our Christmas party but she won’t be there due to her mother’s recent surgery and recovery. I recognize this is a difficult time for her and I would really like to give her a gift for Christmas. I intend on writing her a heartfelt (albeit appropriate) note about how she changed my career path and life for the better, but I’d also like to get her something to brighten up her days. Any ideas on an appropriate gift that won’t be tossed away during spring cleaning? Have any of you ever gifted a former boss for Christmas? Would love to hear about them.

1h6q9y3,Scared to leave my job because they praise me,"I'll try to make this quick. I am a fresh college graduate, I studied Media and PR and earned my BA. Currently, I am working at a hotel. Last year I worked at this hotel doing front desk work for under a year, and I left for a different hospitality type of job. They invited me to come back here in April to work in the sales office. I thought I really enjoyed the hospitality/events industry but it's not at all where I wanna be anymore. I am looking into other careers that align more with my degree and also my interests, but there's a couple things I am scared about:

\- I haven't been at a job for at least a year since 2021 where I worked at my part time cafe job for nearly 3 years (2019-2021). Does this make my resume look bad? 

\- I feel like it's wrong of me to leave so soon again since they invited me back and also accommodated my pay needs with no issues. On top of that, all the management workers PRAISE me. I feel like it's because I'm kind of a fresh face since everyone here has been working here for 20+years. I also picked up the job responsibilities very quickly so there's not much for me to learn from here on out.

Overall, I've just had such trouble keeping a job that I actually enjoy in the long term. But I also think it's normal coming from the perspective of a fresh college graduate. Might also be helpful to note that there is zero growth in my role here at the hotel. There's my direct boss who is the manager of the sales office and then I am the assistant. My manager has been here for 20 years and the only growth in this role for me would be if she ever left (unlikely) and even then, I do not want her position. 

Any advice would be great. Thanks",Aggressive_Fly3750,3,0.7099999785423279,5,1733344142,2024-12-04 20:29:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h6q9y3/scared_to_leave_my_job_because_they_praise_me/,12,2024

1h6psc1,Received an interview for my dream job. How best to prepare?,"I received an interview invitation for my literal dream job. It's for a director of impact at the regulatory board for the city's homeless and housing services. Trying to figure out how best to prepare. 

A little about me: most recently I was the director of resources and client development at a mental health clinic that served the homeless. It was a start up, so I did a lot of the early work like drafting policy, creation of programs, hiring, budgeting, creating partnerships. I collaborated with one other director on policy drafting and creation of programs. The rest I did solo. Over my tenure there, I was responsible for (developed, implemented, funded, and ran) 7 veey successful solo programs, and numerous program collaborations. I also have experience completely running the number one homeless shelter in my city and significant work as a senior housing case manager for vulnerable populations. I also have experience with working with the BIPOC and LGBTQ communities, as well as domestic violence survivors. The history is a little varied (it took some time to figure out exactly what I wanted to do). 

A little about the organization: This organization is responsible for the complete homeless Coordinated access program. Essentially, they oversee all organizations, funding, and programs impacting the homeless in this (fairly large) city. My role would involve writing policy, creating and maintaining programs, examining metrics to ensure all of the above are successful, collaborating with partners (either established or new), and just generally running the implementation aspect of all of the above. 

I feel I have the correct experience to do this job. When reviewing the job description I feel confident in my ability to complete the tasks. However, I've never interviewed for a director position before. With my last role as Director of Resources, they didn't actually have someone in that spot before me. I was promoted into that position and built it from the ground up. 

So, my dilemma: never having interviewed for this type of position, I am unsure how best to prepare. I know the obvious such as investigating the organization. Become familiar with their programs and initiatives. But anything beyond that?

I was considering trafting a proposal of programs I have implemented, places I feel there is a gap in care within their organization, and a (more broad) list of programs and initiatives I could feasibly enact with say, six months. It would highlight my previous successes, showcase how I feel I could best contribute to the organization, and include data to back it up. 

Was also considering including a list of organizations I would want to become partners with, and well as corporate giving I would try to inact (again, very broadly).

Would this proposal be going too far? Is it too much. And, if it is or isn't, how else can I best prepare for this dream job interview?

1h6okaq,Management role creating issues,"Hi,

Long time business development/sales now sales director (but it’s still mainly sales/BD).

I find new work for 6 teams.  Some are competent and help drive development, others are weak. I don’t manage these directly. 

For the first time in career I have to make calls on who gets the work and it’s upsetting some.  It’s actually leading for some to be eventually fired.  I have to choose between keeping everyone happy and being successful.  

The net result is some are always pissed off at me.  I don’t have the resources to find them all what they want, so they whine about me or question my ability.  I’m working long hours, and I have a proven track record.  Senior management are behind me and kind of say let them fail it’s your job to be ruthless.  

I have a conscience.  I have tried to help the weaker teams but they expect me to do it all which I can’t, and don’t follow things up.  

Has anyone similarly had to kind of indirectly manage people out?  It’s not personal, but I either choose success for me, or let everyone fall. 

What’s worse is because the good teams work well with me, and the weaker teams criticise and blame me, I end up closer with them and this fuels the idea I’m being cliquey which I’m not.  I want everyone to be successful.  

It’s hard work having to upset people constantly.

1h6o28j,"20yrs old, stuck in horrid job, no clue what to do","where do i go from here??

Context: 
I'm 20 years old, in the uk (south east ish), stuck in a horrible job with horrible people, I have a chronic pain disorder severely limiting what jobs I can do/get to, and feel absolutely helpless right now

story goes:
Every job I've had has been in hospitality (typically bar/restaurant), and I currently work in a pub that serves food. I have no issues with the job itself, I thoroughly enjoy meeting people and making sure they have a great time at our establishment. The issue lies with my coworkers and management, and the treatment recieved from them. 
My boss is your typical megalomaniacal older woman who truly believes she can do no wrong. She treats us like absolute dirt, regularly insults me, gets into arguments with all of her staff, save for a couple of her favourite playthings who are at her every beck and call. We've lost an assistant manager, three chefs, and about four members of staff in the past few months alone, and I cannot bear to be there any longer either, I've only stuck around so long for desperation's sake. 

It's been coming to a crux recently, I used to do three shifts a week but am currently lucky to get one as she gave them all to another coworker without speaking to me first. Today I recieved a text from my boss saying she was giving even more of my shifts to others but that ""shes sure therell be plenty more in the next few weeks"" (there wont). I spoke to her on the phone as I found this absolutely bizarre but she barely let me get a word in. 

So it's safe to say I am at my breaking point with this place, I tried to stick it out for at least a year but I don't think thats feasable for my mental health nor bank anymore. 

Here's where it gets complicated though. I have a chronic pain disorder (so far undiagnosed but I have so much paperwork to back it up if needs be) which severely limits my ability to do your typical 9-5 40hr work week. My mobility is also comprimised, I have no car and driving lessons are far too expensive for me to even consider that at the moment, so I'm stuck relying on public transport, which I'm not even guarunteed to be able to use depending on how bad my pain is each day. 
 
I have a social worker who is supposedly helping me look for housing but nothing really comes from that and our appointments are very few and far between, and I currently live in a village with VERY few opportunities, and the nearby towns really arent much better. 

I would happily continue to work hospitality for a while, in a better environment mind you, whilst I rack up some savings, but as for what on earth to do after that I have no idea. 

My long term goal is to get into live music/events organisation, I've collated a bit of a black book of bands and artists and technicians all over the country. I dont know where on earth to go from here though. 

I have quite a history with sound tech, I did it for all of my school and college shows and also took music tech in college, and I've looked into apprenticeships but no one is ever taking applications. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get my foot in the door in that industry? 

And similarly does anyone have any advice on my horrid job 🥲 

I fear my situation is dire so any advice at all would be greatly greatly welcomed, and thank you so much for reading so far :)

I want to share my story, not just to express myself, but also to seek advice and support from this incredible community.

Almost a year ago, I embarked on a challenging yet hopeful journey with a Job Seeker Visa in Germany. Having worked across growth marketing, manufacturing operations, and inventory management roles in Germany over the past few years, I was confident I could find a new opportunity aligned with my experience. But reality had other plans.

For nearly 10 months, despite countless applications, interviews, and rejections, I was unable to land a role that matched my expertise. The financial and emotional strain began to take a toll, and burnout set in. Five months ago, I decided to return to India to regroup and regain my strength.

Now, with my Job Seeker Visa set to expire in four months, I find myself at a crossroads. The question is daunting: Should I move back to Germany to continue searching for opportunities, or should I focus on building a career here in India?

I have my last 5000 euros left for this whole job seeking ordeal 

I deeply value the global exposure and professional growth I gained during my time in Germany, but the uncertainty of another move is daunting. On the other hand, staying in India feels like leaving unfinished business behind.

I would greatly appreciate any advice, guidance, or connections that could help me navigate this decision. If you've faced a similar situation or have insights into the job market in Germany or India, please share your experiences.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story, and I’m grateful for any support you can offer.

My German level is A2

1h6m7py,"Got a job offer! Not sure what to do, and feel very lost! ","Hello everyone,

I am in a bit of a dilemma and feel kind of lost.  

I have tried to break it down into my major influencing factors.

Benefits and pay - i have received a new job offer from a consulting firm. Their offer would provide me with a 2.32 usd an hour raise. 

Which is roughly a 5 or 6 percent raise. More money is nice, but their vacation accrual and paid holidays is not as good as my current position.  

136/yr vs 160/yr, and 7 paid holidays vs 13. Health insurance is a wash. Retirement is similar, but my current place gives me a pension. 

Actual work - the new position seems to be more stressful relative to my current one.  I don't love my field so I don't really care about the work as much. 

Coming from the public sector, I was told in the interview that private consulting results in a higher workload.    

The actual work itself seems more or less the same however. 

Work life balance - my current job allows me to do a 4/10 schedule - in office - with no overtime required. 

The new offer is 5/8 - after a year hybrid, two home, 3 office - with some overtime. 

They also told me that I can work as much overtime as I want at my base wage rather than time and a half, to increase my earnings. 

I have been at my current place 8 years, and am comfortable, but sometimes it is boring.  My manager is not exactly my favorite person and sometimes is a micromanager. 

A former coworker that worked with me at my current job says they like the management better at the new place.  It is more like as long as you do your work nobody cares. 

Priorities - work life balance, and travel. Recently a close family member has been diagnosed with a serious illness so I have been using my extra day off to visit them.  I have also been able to travel quite a bit in the past couple years because of the paid holidays and my PTO accrual. 

I am a bit apprehensive to start accruing PTO all over but I keep thinking in a year you will have 140 vacation hours. 

If you made it this far I really appreciate it.

What would you do in this situation?  Or have you been in a similar one?

Thanks in advance!",Sadmanplayswithcats,4,0.7599999904632568,3,1733334426,2024-12-04 17:47:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h6m7py/got_a_job_offer_not_sure_what_to_do_and_feel_very/,12,2024
1h6m5df,Do I get a master’s degree or not?,"I’m 21 and work at my university, where I get employee tuition remission. I will be graduating next semester with a bachelor’s in mathematics. I have the option to get a Master’s degree either basically free, or at a discounted cost.

I don’t want to pursue a career in mathematics, but I am so close to finishing this degree that’s what I’ll have.

The programs I have been considering are:
Masters of science in business analytics
MBA
Biostatistics MS
Higher Ed Administration MS

I don’t want to pigeonhole myself into starting a career heavy in mathematics, crunching numbers all day. I want something that can apply to many career choices since I am not sure yet. But, with the cost of attendance and my bachelors degree considered, biostatistics or MSBA is my best choice.

Is it worth it to just get any Master’s since I can and stay working in this position for an extra two years, or are master’s degrees not worth much? Should I find a higher paying job once I have a bachelors degree? I work two jobs now and still can barely afford to live. 

I would appreciate anyone’s advice on obtaining a master’s and their relevance. Thank you",3balleddonkeydick,1,1.0,1,1733334278,2024-12-04 17:44:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h6m5df/do_i_get_a_masters_degree_or_not/,12,2024

Then when they got back, I was honestly pretty pissed i did not get invited. I didnt say anything. I tried to let it go. Still I never brought it up.

But then my boss has been an asshole to me on two separate occasions since then. Both work related.

1h6kxap,Moving from nonprofit work to data science? ,"I'm looking for some career/educational advice, and I thought you guys would be good to ask. I recently lost my job doing nonprofit development and marketing. I've honestly been quite unhappy at my job for quite a while, so I'm hoping that maybe this can be a positive thing in the long run. Maybe I can switch industries? 

I'm considering getting a Master's Degree in Data Science to help open up my job options. Currently, I have around 4 years of experience in nonprofit development and marketing, and a BA in Sustainability Studies. I think I would enjoy a more technical field that requires less customer service than what I've been doing previously. If I go for the degree, I'm planning to take some extra classes in linear algebra, calculus, and take an online full stack developer course to prepare, and see if I like the field. 

Assuming I do well in the program, do you see this as a way to open up job opportunities for me? What types of jobs do you think I'd be qualified for?

1h6khy8,New in my role and already feel resentful,"I recently relocated and had to leave my job in marketing. I have about 7 years of experience from two different jobs. I wasn’t having much luck in finding a new role but recently started at an organization doing essentially communications work. 

My supervisor was in this role before me. He has been promoted to director. When he was in this role his title was A & B Manager. My title in the same role is A, B, & C Coordinator. I can’t help but feel slighted that it’s the same job with a lower title (and I assume because of the title change, a lower salary). They’ve told me they’re excited about my marketing background to see what I can do for them in that sector, so it’s just a hodgepodge mess of expectations. Also when I was offered the job I was given the lowest of the $5000 range they posted the job for and told that’s the highest they can do. I know it’s out of their control and I just needed a job, but that was an almost $25,000 pay cut from where I was previously. 

I feel stuck. They’re very nice people but I feel really ashamed to have gone from director and manager titles in previous roles to what feels like an entry level position. I know they were impressed with my background and I appreciate it, but I feel undervalued and resentful. 

I know there’s only so much that can be done about pay, but do you think it’s worth having a conversation about the title?

Hi (candidate),

 

Very sorry for the delay, I was sickish yesterday. Thanks for transparency on salary topic, and additional info needed. Just extra question, you are based in Mumbai, and opened to relocate to Bangalore for the role, right?

I have checked with (hiring manager) and (MD). They are now aligning on the role seniority and tasks. I will get back to you with final decision in the next few days, stay strong 😊

1h6jjj6,Salary raise pool,"I've been with this company for almost a year and I was preparing negotiations for a salary increase as I feel like I have increased my skills and knowledge while performing very well from when I started. I come to find out they do a raise pool method and I didn't even get a performance review or anything to negotiate my raise they just decided without my input. I got a ""higher than average"" raise (3.25% vs the base 3%) but I still feel like I'm at the lower end of compensation for similar roles. Especially seeing how much money the company made FY24. The hard part about this is because most comparable positions are purely hourly like a seasonal agreement where as mine is salary plus overtime so I get paid 40hrs when I'm at home not working. Do I need to threaten to quit to maybe get the raise I'm aiming for? We have 3 of us in this role across Canada and they have a job posting for hiring one more.

","Hey everyone, 

I'm at a point in my life where I'm questioning almost everything, and the most important thing for me right now is my career. I'm currently working in finance, but a few years ago, I discovered my passion for art and painting, and my dream is to make a living from it. Do you think it's possible to switch from one extreme to the other without starving?

I’m trying to figure out how to break into this world. Can I just paint my work and see if it sells? How do I build a solid portfolio? How can I get art galleries to showcase my work? And if making it as a painter is too tough, how can I work in this field without a formal art education or experience?

I know it’s a lot of questions, but my thoughts are all over the place right now. Where should I start? How should I start?

1h6j7be,Do I have a chance at negotiating an offer I've already accepted? ,"Recent graduate, I got accepted into a rotational program that had been my top choice and was thrilled, upon receiving the offer I was told it was non-negotiable and was disappointed but didn't even think to question it and still accepted the offer. The initial offer showed a base minimum salary, as well as the sign on bonus, but there are 3 potential locations and the salary will be adjusted to the cost of living in the area I am assigned. I will be receiving a more detailed offer letter this week which will have my official location and actual salary.

After a little digging through reddit I saw some people in similar programs at this company agree that base salary was non-negotiable, but they were able to negotiate the sign on bonus, do I have any chance at this point given that I've already accepted their initial offer? I feel like I have zero leverage now, I do have competing offers, but I don't want to threaten to walk away because if they happen to call my bluff I'd be in a bad spot.

I feel like I am consistently getting emails and texts asking the equivalent of, “Can we meet to talk about something?”. The lack of context is frustrating.

I truly don’t have time to block out a meeting for you to ask me a simple question. So, what exactly is it that you would like to discuss?”. Obviously, I can’t say that, so what would be a professional way to ask what the subject matter is prior to blocking out time to meet with others? 

Important to note, this mostly comes from young, “green”, and entry level employees. I know they only do this because they just truly don’t have much experience in this type of professional setting.

I am looking for other jobs of course, I just do  not know what I am looking for exactly. My dream would be to bake and make videos online, but I understand that may be more of a hobby than anything.
Can anyone help me get through this? It’s getting to the point where I am losing sleep and waking up very emotional because I am so unhappy in this position.

1h6dz5g,Resume Screening vs. Interview Assessment – What Matters Most?,"  
Hey, HR! 👋

I’m currently exploring how **assessment priorities and strategies differ between resume screening and interviews**, and I’d love to hear from you!

1. Resume Screening: What do you focus on most during this stage? Is it matching skills, work experience, education, or other key factors?
2. Interview Stage: What takes priority when evaluating candidates in interviews? Is it communication skills, job fit, cultural fit, or something else?
3. Key Differences: How do the priorities shift between these two stages? Are the criteria for evaluation different? How do you balance these stages to ensure the best hiring decisions?

💬 Whether you’re an HR professional or a job candidate, your insights matter! Feel free to share your thoughts on what stood out to you during these stages.",Dependent_Fig1752,1,1.0,1,1733312139,2024-12-04 11:35:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h6dz5g/resume_screening_vs_interview_assessment_what/,12,2024

1h6dc0n,I have mentally checked out of my unpaid internship,"I have been working as an intern 2 hours a day Monday to Friday remotely. In the past 2 weeks I have been working outside of these hours because of how much time my work is taking during working hours and deadlines so I try to prep my work so that it is easy for me to work in those 2 hours where I can present my work to the director.

I mentally checked out 2 weeks ago when the person I was working with didn’t explain a task properly and I got grilled. I know it is feedback but I wasn’t at fault.
I had to hear comments like ‘use your brain’ which I feel is quite rude and undermines me. Along with calling some of my work ‘boring’ to read because it is long. Just them thinking from an audience view and then grilling my work.

I have never worked in this industry or sector before which is real estate and investment. I have always been on the creative side but I have been helping with marketing and creating posts.

It’s a small start up and at the beginning and even on the job listing I was told I would be ‘compensated’ and possible offered a ‘full-time’ role.
Two weeks ago I refused to extend my unpaid internship because of the feedback but also because I have been feeling small and stupid for small mistakes. But my intention was to never stay for more than 3 months.

This week, the conversations that I have been having with the person I work for is, just well, I don’t know. I definitely know I am not getting an employment offer despite creating a lot of content for them which is now increasing their followers and engagement on social media.

I have developed their existing designs to better designs which they will now be using.

I have done so much for work them but the reward feels so little.

One of my main issues, is me feeling really irritated and angry before our meeting starts because as they are a start up all they care about is hustling and making money. They have gone and started to listen to people on instagram who is giving them ‘feedback’ and I feel like I am the one having to deal with all the set backs. Every time someone comments something on Instagram, I am having to change designs and edit them to suit their needs when they aren’t even targeted customers, just some people who pass by your business page and is saying something and that’s it.

Every time I work on their feedback, I get restrictive feedback which makes my work difficult as I can’t find certain houses that meet the requirements needed. I am being told how London properties aren’t in London when they are, because the director wants properties within the City which is difficult as people rent a majority of these properties, they don’t own it.
Most of what I am finding is in London, on the outskirts but he just wants properties within in the City but like I said people are lease holding not free holding. Many of these people who own freeholds live in their homes and don’t want to sell. If I am finding it difficult, despite crawling on estate websites for 12 hours a week, just having one house on the outskirts WHICH IS IN LONDON isn’t that bad.

I needed to vent this out. ",QueensGambit90,0,0.33000001311302185,4,1733309540,2024-12-04 10:52:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h6dc0n/i_have_mentally_checked_out_of_my_unpaid/,12,2024

1h6bfrd,How to go about quitting a job my friend got me ASAP.,"Hello to anyone reading, I'd really need some advice ASAP. Sorry for the long post, just want to be as detailed as possible to explain my position. I went on reddit early yesterday asking for advice after being sick and wondering if I should even come into work because I felt guilty for even doing so, and everyone has been so helpful and supportive.

I am currently working at a clinic for 12$/hrly (I know, it sucks) that my close friend got me because I needed a job ASAP after closing my business down this year. I owned a salon at the time within the area so I knew where I'd be commuting to. Far, but not too bad of a drive where I'm putting a ton of money into gas and stuff. It was a mutual agreement, that I brung up every now and then so we didn't forget- that this job would only be temporary until I find something better. Currently, I'm working 11 hour days, full time(40 hrs), so pretty standard I assume, yet with the times that we work within a day, I don't even have time for myself, hobbies or others because I have to go home, shower, eat, and go to sleep just to do it all over again the next day. I have been here since early September, so I know I'm not just trying to quit after like a day or week which I wouldn't do in the first place.

Well, I found something closer to me nearly a month ago and accepted the job offer-, a barista position with multiple opportunities to move up with tips included onto the base pay, and ability to pick up as many shifts as I want unless I'm OT, which just needs manager approval. Obviously, I accepted, since I have worked something extremely similar to it before. I originally wanted to keep this job at the clinic and work both jobs at the same time since this clinic happened to have just fired 3 people and they are short staffed, and besides- some extra money couldn't hurt.

They approved my request to be moved to part time, but then turned around a few days later and told me they would not be able to help me with that schedule and that they would not have it available starting the next year. Okay, fine; I instead put in my resignation for a month and a half until my last day, which would be me finishing out the year so they had time to find someone else because I don't want to basically screw my friend or coworkers over.

I was chilling with whatever I was scheduled and just coming to work, until yesterday. I got sick on Friday, mild cough, no fever. Came to work that day with a mask on and was constantly washing my hands and not coming into close contact with others so I didn't have to call in. But over the weekend, my symptoms worsened severely where I had to see a doctor to see what was wrong. I had to call in because I was NOT in any shape to work at all. I rarely call in unless I am absolutely dying.

The thing is, I have an event out of town this weekend I asked off for around 2 months ago, it's unpaid, so they're not losing anything other than me just not being there and scheduling people around. But they had plenty of time to sort this out given the 2 month notice. When I called in sick yesterday, they did not offer, but demanded me to give up one of these days to come in since I was missing yesterday for being sick. How am I supposed to know if I'll still be sick or not? I don't even know if I'll be able to go to the event I've been looking forward to this weekend.

I let my friend by text know yesterday morning that I had to call in, so to not expect me to be at work, and also let her know they're telling me to give up one of the days I'd be out of town for to come and work for them. She took this the wrong way and assumed management was 'offering' this option to me out of 'love' so I'd be able to make up my hours. She loves her coworkers and hangs out with them outside of work, so to some degree she would obviously try and defend them a bit. In my opinion, in any management experience- I don't think that's how it works. These are the same people who made someone work not even hours after totaling his car while he was in pain until he NEEDED to leave after a few hours to go see a doctor for it.

A few weeks after, he ended up getting sick, and guess what. They made him come in sick, and didn't even let him leave early when he kept mentioning he didn't feel great. Another two weeks after, and they fire him and two others without notice.

For 12$/hr, none of this is worth it at all. I am so grateful to my friend for helping me with getting a job in the first place, but I literally am still sick and I have a shift there to work in the morning. I am constantly stressing myself out because I don't want them to be untrustful of my friend because I have been sick and needed to call out. I also don't want my friend to think of me differently, because I care about her and she seems passionate about this job, even though she actually gets paid less than me when she's been there for over a year (insane, I know). I did technically give them my month and a half notice. But I physically and mentally cannot anymore. I hate this job. Obviously, I show up and do my job and clock in the hours I'm scheduled, and leave at the end of the day- but If I'm sick, then I am sick. I'm trying to resign ASAP before 7am rolls around(I'm still sick anyways so I can't even come in) and yes, I am always respectful about my choice of wording to management and stuff, but am unsure how to go about this.

Of course, I will talk to my friend about it and explain to her what's up, and show her I am grateful for her even watching out for me. I do have mental health issues, and this year has been really, really rough on me since I have just lost so much, but just being here any longer being paid an unliveable wage while expecting me to bend over backwards for them is going to make me explode. No, I have not called in because I needed a mental health day, I have just shown up medicated to work even if I felt like a walking zombie for 11 hours. I really don't want to come in still sick tomorrow(and won't), and genuinely just don't want to even come back ever after tonight. I just have crippling anxiety and always live with constant guilt over the smallest things so I'm unsure how to do or write professionally in an email that I will not be continuing on with the company.

Work was not creative I had to only do the basic support work, there was no startegy work involved. Whenever I tried to switch every interviewer was asking for programmatic dv360 experience which I didnt have.

Then I was moved to work on a project of Meta ads with zero experiece. I managed to run the project but I am not a pro in this, here also not strategy and optimisation work involved and now after 1 year of experience of Meta ads I have realised that  to excel in performance marketing I need to learn other platforms like google ads, linkedin etc. 
For peformance marketing profile my previous experience of Ad operation is not counted moreover I am not that advanced if I lie.

At the of it, I got asked what are my salary expectations, I gave my range, as usual a bit higher than my actual expectation, and for the first time in my life I got a “oh yeah that’s totally within our budget”. 
I rarely felt so dumb, in retrospect I think I should have asked for 15/20% more. 
I guess the best I can do is to push for the upper boundary of my range now?

Extra info:
-the job is on the buying side, so it’s hard to get a performance based bonus like in sales
-it’s still a negotiation-centric role
-I’m 27, this is my third “real” job, and one of the questions asked was “I saw you changed three jobs in four years, how do we get to keep you longer”

1h6a5tk,I'm scared and I don't know what to do,"For context, week or so ago, I managed to land an evening janitorial job at my local highschool. Before that I was unemployed for near on 2 years, fresh out of high school, looking for options. The job is an 8 and a 1/2 hour shift and I, along with 2 other guys clean in three sections into the night, and I've been asked to man 1 of these sections. For 8 hours, I scrub, sweep, and clean, from the first floor to the second floor, with a half hour break I can take whenever I want. Once that's over, I lock up and go home.

Here's where the problem begins. My legs are in agony at the end of the day. I've been up and down flights of stairs at least 20 times, I've walked at least a mile, and very rarely have the chance to sit down. I can barely finish my section with the time I'm given, so there's no time to take a break any longer than 30 minutes. When I get home, I have anxiety attacks or panic attacks, I'm scared I'll have to do this again and I will. My legs are in shambles, I'm waddling as if an old lady, and they aren't any better in the morning, making the next day even worse. I'm exhausted, my eyes burn hazzily and I feel sick. I try to eat dinner, and I puke it out by the end of the night, scared I'll waste the precious free time I have to myself. By the time I go to sleep, I feel miserable, my stomach aches and my throat feels as if gripped. I'm screaming at myself that I can't handle this, that it's unhealty, that I'm scared, and that I don't want to go the next day, but this job is the best job I could get with my pathetic resume.

I talked to my mother about this, she told me I'd adjust and that I should just give myself some time, but I don't know if I even want to adjust to this, and I'm scared this will last forever. I want to ask if this is normal, and if I should talk to someone about this, quit my job, or maybe change my lifestyle, because I don't think I can keep this up for even a week longer. I want to know if this is normal and if I should expect nothing better. I'm scared if I keep this up, I might give up on having a job to begin with, disappoint my friends, family, and colleagues.

So, I want advice, comments, criticisms. I'd most like to know if this is normal and if It's possible to adjust.

1h6a0bl,I have zero interest in the program I’m studying (BBA),"Hey all,

I think I’m searching for some advice! I’m a freshman at a CC and almost done my first semester. After taking a long time to decide what I want to study, I decided to go to college for a BBA because I like that it’s kind of general and easy to pivot to many office jobs. 

I plan to specialize in accounting so I at least have a specialization, but I just have zero interest in it whatsoever. Not just accounting; all of it. I have no interest at all. Now, I can’t lie and say I haven’t learned anything, I just have zero interest in the program. I’m not passionate about it.

My aim is to try and be a policy analyst with the government in my country or maybe become a manager/director in the niche field I have work experience in. I’m mainly specializing in accounting over, say, management, because my train of thought is that if I were to specialize in management I couldn’t be an accountant (well, I mean, I could, just a bit more steps haha), where if I specialize in accounting I couldn’t still work in management. I’m not sure if I’ll actually go down the accounting path though. I have quite a lot of work experience with First Nation organizations so another option I’ve had is to pivot into a role in like Indigenous relations or something because I enjoy the work (and the pays decent). 

I think if I were to study what I was passionate about I would probably study wildlife biology or environmental science. Something like that. That’s what actually interests me, but I am just horrible at math and science tbh. My brain is more wired to the arts type degrees, unfortunately. I was originally going to study political science which definitely interests me as well, but I decided to switch to a BBA because I thought it was a better fall back for job opportunities (and I could still get policy analyst jobs with a BBA).

I just don’t know. Is this normal?!?! Is this how most students feel? Like, I wouldn’t say I hate the degree and I’ve definitely learned some stuff, but saying I’m passionate about it is an understatement. I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or just ranting. Is there a better suited degree? Or just stick out?

Immediately after completing the tests, I was called for a technical interview and was not given feedback at all. I thought everything was fine and we would just discuss the details of my job at the technical interview. However, at these interviews I received the feedback and I was asked to fix my test for FREE and maybe then I will be hired. I always thought that feedback can be given faster in writing and informed of the need to fix something in test or simply refused to the person. It just feels like I'm doing someone else's work for free and I'm not even sure if they'll hire me or not, as if it's an extra waste of my time and effort. Is this process normal nowadays or not?

1h68us9,10 years at my job and I feel directionless,"Hey guys, I’m just looking for some advice on how to move forward in my career. I’m a graphic designer in the music industry, and I’ve held my current position at a relatively large merchandising company for the past 10 years (also have been freelancing on my own for the past 16). Over the past few years, I’ve slowly lost my passion and drive for doing what I’ve been doing for almost half my life, recently it’s non-existent. And that scares the shit out of me. 

I graduated college and got this job within months. I’ve just stayed ever since, mostly because it’s comfortable. This past year has been the worst of my professional career. Not nearly as many design approvals as usual, and sometimes a design gets approved, but then the client either doesn’t use it or hires someone else to replace my work (which is beyond insulting). I very rarely get any positive feedback, either it’s approved without comment, the client completely ignores the pitch, or they have something nasty to say. This has never happened before a few years ago, and can’t figure out why. Also I should say, these issues come mostly from the smaller clients I work with at my day job, I don’t seem to have many of these problems with the larger ones I do freelance work for. It’s completely demoralized me and I feel emotionally drained every day, I dread to go to work. I know my work is solid, that hasn’t changed, but I really want to get out of the merch industry, mostly for my deteriorating mental health. 

I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? Or just advice? I don’t really feel like I need to completely change careers, but I do feel like I have this weirdly niche design skillset that makes it hard to imagine doing anything else.",shrimpychimpo,2,1.0,0,1733290382,2024-12-04 05:33:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h68us9/10_years_at_my_job_and_i_feel_directionless/,12,2024
1h6847j,What are some good jobs that don't require a college degree?,"I quit high school with high honors when I was 16 because 1) I was bullied so badly that I honestly feared for my life, and 2) I had to start working long hours. I got my GED when I turned 18 and scored a 98% without even studying for it.

I have about 10 years of retail management experience and 8 years in a corporate setting. I wish that I had stayed in that job, but I had a lot of personal problems (mainly addiction) and couldn't handle the stress.

I became my father's primary caregiver, but he passed away in 2018. It took me several more years to get off of drugs, so I've been out of the workplace for quite a while now.

I'm very good with both people and technology. I'm also very creative; I write/play music, paint/draw, do photography, arts & crafts and some computer graphics. I'm also a pretty decent cook!

1h67tf9,Career Advice EL Actuarial Position ,"Hi everyone,

I am an incoming graduating first-gen 5th year come May 2025. I am dual majoring in Statistics and Risk Management & Insurance, and I have a 3.85 GPA. I go to a top 50 public school. I have had a few non-actuarial insurance related internships in the past (Risk Analyst and Claims Manager). My technical skills include R and Python with intermediate knowledge in both, and I have several projects demonstrating my proficiency in both programming languages from school. I recently sat for P in November and just barely failed it with probably a 5, and I have no other exams passed. I have prior knowledge in FM from taking a class in college that covered syllabi material, so I don’t think it should be too difficult to pass FM in 3 months after I pass P. I will sit again for P in January, so fingers crossed I can pass then and sit for FM in April before I graduate. I was wondering if I could get some career advice. My progress in the exams isn’t as far as I intended because I’ve had some health complications in the recent year. It took me off my path of Actuarial studies, but I resumed studying for P on CA this past late-August. I was wondering if I could get some advice for specifically when should I start applying for EL Actuarial positions? Also, am I in the spot now where I need to start applying for non-actuarial positions until I pass both P and FM? I made it to final rounds of interviewing for an EL Actuarial Consultant position, but I was rejected last year (ended up staying an extra year to obtain extra degree).

I love physical therapy as well, that's why I would like to ask: 

1) do you enjoy your job as a physical therapist assistant? 
2) do you see a high job demand? Maybe you don't like an office, do you have peace of mind you can find a better job relatively soon?
3) do you know any dental hygienist? If so, do you see yourself doing that job? Or do you think you made the right choice doing physical therapy assistant?

1h66l0c,My boss is convinced I’m a liability and is bullying me into quitting. ,"
I started on a hospital unit two months ago. 

These past few months the boss (who’s very new to his role) has been singling me out. On my last day of orientation he gave me a performance improvement plan and told me I was doing terribly. And once I got off orientation he hasn’t let up. Last week I got in trouble for not moving an IV pole fast enough when a patient got up (patient was fine and had no close calls). 

The other CNAs, Nurses, and patients have been giving me good reviews. And when I ask them for feedback they say I’m doing good. But whenever I see him he tells me I’m doing so much wrong and that I’m progressing too slowly for his standards

Today he told me that he won’t let me go to part time because I’m not competent enough. I’m not strong enough in my skill set to choose when I work and at minimum he will give me one less day to work. I’m in an MSN program and I’m taking 17 credits this first semester. 

I keep asking him what he wants me to do to improve and he told me to watch educational videos (I watched all of them during orientation and had nurses sign me off on those skills). He says that I just have to improve at everything and if I don’t I will not pass my 90 day review. 

I asked him what the nurses and patients were saying and he said it’s not important. Then I asked  if someone could shadow me and see how I’m doing things - and he said no. I told him how will they know im progressing if they don’t talk to anybody and how do I meet his standards without someone shadowing me. He had no response. This is not the first time he’s dangled termination in my face. 

Then he said that my year of past experience didn’t matter because since I’m performing so poorly I was clearly trained bad. As well as compared me unfavorably to other staff and called me the weakest employee. He said I should be pessimistically cautious going forward. 

So now he’s trying to schedule me to work 2+ days a week on top of a full school schedule because he thinks I’m not good enough to be part time. I don’t get why he hasn’t fired me if I’m apparently this awful

I don’t know what to do. I’ve called HR but I’m at a loss.

1h6362f,Prestige vs Comfort,"Trying to keep this concise, my career dilemma comes down to prestige vs comfort. 

My current role has prestige. It looks great on paper and is with a company that works with high profile dream clients (I dont personally get to work with them much because of the nature of my job but I am adjacent and honestly it is fun to drop names sometimes). Unfortunately I just dont like it - I only got thrown into my current role when someone else left and it is not necessarily the right fit for me - and I dont feel appreciated at all. I am the lowest paid person at the company, which is sad. And I dread every day because my boss is chaotic, hypercritical, and sets impossible standards. They are the kind of manager that sends a flurry of messages in off-work hours and, while I'm not always expected to answer right away, it means I am constantly haunted by reminders about tiny things I have done wrong or just not the way the boss secretly wanted them done. They have said they dont have time to mentor or train anyone to grow or change their roles so, for the forseeable future, this is the life I am stuck in if I stay. (Worth noting: this boss is actually an ejoyable person outside of work and can be very personally generous, just awful and ungenerous to work for.)

I came across an opportunity at another, smaller company that pays exactly the same despite being a step down in title (that stings). It has better/easier/more enjoyable daily duties, but zero prestige. There might be opportunities for growth but that isnt guaranteed because it is so small and I am having a hard time convincing myself that the move would be a good one overall - even though I suspect I would be happier and more comfortable.

1h62sem,Job A or Job B?,"25(m) graduating college in SE PA and still living with parents. I have a choice between two jobs, maybe a third but not putting the cart before the horse on that one. Just looking to get started and hopefully move out somewhat soon but not wanting to be far from family.

Job A (64k)
-Higher paying
- High chance of relocation in 6 months to anywhere 
- In sales which I might enjoy a little bit better
-less work/life balance and probably not great for social life
- less possibilities for promotion

Job B (50k)
-in finance which isn’t exactly my forte 
-lower paying (would not be able to move out)
-better opportunity for promotion in 18/24 months
-get financial licenses
-big company in area I want to stay in
- working phones to start out

I’m really stuck between the two. As much as I want to move out I don’t want to be forced to somewhere across the country.

1h62scu,Should I put my current job on my resume for a new job I am applying for?,"Hello, I graduated from college with a B.S in July and landed a career in September. I was a bit desperate and took the first job offer because I had bills to pay and sadly, my contract with my old job ended when I graduated. I have been working with this job for two months already and with a decent pay of $28 an hour in the public health field. Bad thing is I only work part-time 28 hours a week, no health benefits until I am considered full-time like 32 hours a week, no retirement saving till I hit 1,000 hours. 

I saw a new public health job posting full-time and more pay $32 an hour, GREAT health benefits and a retirement plan! I was wondering if I should put my current job down on my resume (which I have been here for two months marking today) on my resume? Should I put my supervisors as a reference (which I did ask them a month ago if I can put them down on my new references letter and they said yes). In general does this make me look bad to the new job I am applying to? I know I work hard which is seen by my current supervisors and co-workers and I know I deserve full time hours, which my supervisor won't give me more since I just started. Will my supervisors get upset at me for attempting to find a new job?

1h610st,Seeking Advice on Salary Negotiation Strategy,"
Hello,

My contract is set to expire soon, and so far, there hasn’t been any discussion about what comes next. Rather than waiting to be presented with a new contract on their terms—or possibly staying at my current pay rate—I intend to be proactive by requesting a meeting with my manager to discuss my role and compensation. I believe this is a good opportunity to approach the subject of a pay raise.

Here’s some context: The company has had difficulty finding anyone to assist me with my work. They hired someone previously, but unfortunately, it didn’t work out, and I’ve continued to handle everything independently.

Currently, I’m the only person capable of performing my job. The only temporary alternatives would be higher-level staff or my manager, which isn’t sustainable in the long term. If they were to hire someone else, they would likely need to offer a very competitive salary to attract someone with the skills and willingness to take on this role.

Because of these factors, I believe I’m in a strong position to negotiate. I’m considering asking for a raise to €21/hour from my current €13.60/hour. I understand this is about a 55% increase and could seem ambitious, but given the circumstances, I think it’s reasonable to bring it to the table.

Does this approach sound logical? Is there anything I should refine in my strategy or timing? I want to advocate for myself effectively without risking any negative consequences, but I also don’t want to undersell my value. Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you in advance!",Atankir,2,0.75,1,1733267085,2024-12-03 23:04:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h610st/seeking_advice_on_salary_negotiation_strategy/,12,2024

Does the software show proof that all test cases have passed?

My answer:
The Software shows all test cases have passed by looking in the log in the directory ""(then I would type the directory name)"".

Then my senior coworker would say ""no! You need to right your answer like this!"":

The software shows proof that all test cases have passed by looking in the log in the directory ""(then write the same directory I wrote)"".

1h603jl,"Creative negotiating to support niche lifestyle
","Hi all! I have been promised a really great job opportunity. Details are not official yet but I expect that my income would come close to doubling with this job, and that’s not even considering benefits. I’ve been working with this org for a few years as a contractor and I really like the team, find the work very interesting and I’m good at it, which makes it feel very rewarding. Financially and career-wise it’s unquestionably the right move.

However, I am an avid amateur climber, currently living in my mountain Dream Town, and this job will likely require me to move away to a densely populated metropolitan area, where I grew up and intentionally left in favor of my current Dream Town.  In Dream Town, I have a lifetime of climbing accessible within 20 minutes of my apartment and, perhaps more importantly, I’m surrounded by people who share my obsession with getting outside for climbing and related activities. If I moved for the job, I’d be living 5-8 hours driving distance from good climbing, assuming no traffic. Leaving at the wrong time can add hours on top.

So I’m wondering what kind of negotiating options I should be considering to maintain some semblance of my outdoor lifestyle if I move for this job. For example, I would love to do an 80% position which would make it a lot easier for me to get to distant climbing destinations on the weekend. But I worry someone wanting a full time employee would be really put off by that request. Another option would be a 9/80 arrangement, but the kind of work I do requires lots of alone time researching and writing things, so I’d kind of worry people wouldn’t believe I was really doing 9 hours/day, and I think that would drive an anxiety that would lead me to work more than I should be. Is it crazy to just ask for a pay cut commensurate with taking every other Friday off, while still maintaining a normal schedule all the other days? Is that a thing? Then I could do a climbing trip every other weekend and be focused on being a good employee the rest of the time. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions. To be honest, I have typically kept my climbing lifestyle to myself in professional settings because I worry it will make people take me less seriously (though this is not a problem in Dream Town!!!). But I’m still a very good worker, who’s put a lot into my career. I just happen to need mountains in my life too. ",L-aventure,1,1.0,0,1733264737,2024-12-03 22:25:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h603jl/creative_negotiating_to_support_niche_lifestyle/,12,2024
1h5zuva,Do I tell prospective employers that I was fired for modeling?,"Hello. I am a legal secretary in St. Louis and have worked as one for 26 years. A little over a year ago I got a new job at a larger firm and for once it was great pay. I had always struggled and been underpaid so I was very excited. The 2nd day on the new job human resources came into my office and told me I was fired for my online presence in modeling and posing in a well known adult magazine. Also, a female attorney at the firm had the same last name as my modeling name and they didn't want two women I guess with that name at the firm. I was devastated and begged my old boss to come back and got my job back. Thank goodness.....After this happened a local print and online magazine ran my story and used my real name, not my modeling name. I didn't think of the consequences unfortunately. I plan on making a move to Chicago in a year or so because all my family is there now, my current boss will be retiring in about a year or so, but I am scared that nobody will want to hire me. I have so much experience, good references and am good at my job, am loyal and a good worker, but if you type in my real name that article comes up. Do I tell prospective employers about what happened or do I ignore it and risk being fired on the 2nd day in a new city with lots of bills and responsibilities. I know I'm not perfect but in defense of what I did, I was raising two small children with no child support at a low paying job working for attorneys who degraded me and didn't pay me what I deserved. I was harassed and made to listen to locker room talk, and it was very traumatic for me. I wanted to do something which could make me some extra money, I guess make me feel attractive and I loved making art by modeling and did a lot of artistic shoots. If you could please be kind and don't judge me, I have been judged ALOT and punished. I just really need some advice here if I should say anything or not at interviews or in any context while applying for a job in Chicago. I think Chicago is a little more open minded and a bigger city but the internet is available for everyone. I know everyone doesn't care and a lot of people thought that it was wrong that they fired me. Some people thought I deserved it and that they had a right to fire me. I just need to know what to do to move forward and find a good job. I retired from modeling btw. I am 49 but I started modeling in my thirties. Please help?

It requires less forma education, and I am about to complete a course which taught me the basics already.

I enjoy the theory, but it's also  a hard career. Always traveling, always in the middle of nowhere exposed to the elements with customers pressurizing you to finish the job asap while not breaking machines or killing someone; so I don't if I am cut for it.

1h5zcuq,Need advice finding new career and dealing with my disability.,"I (31, Male, Chicagoland Area) used to have a decent job working as an electrical technician and Panel builder. I loved the job and was trained without any previous experience, but the long hours of standing on concrete had a very serious effect on my feet and ankles after a year or two. I developed tarsal tunnel syndrome in both of my ankles, and spent several years working through the pain. After several surgeries and many hours in physical therapy, I had no choice but to leave the position. I can still walk around and get from Point A to Point B, but I can no longer stand for more than 20min at a time, and basically can no longer do any jobs that involve standing.

I spent two years working as a soldering technician after my previous job, but was laid off after my position was essentially replaced by automation. It's been very difficult finding any soldering work in my area, and I feel like it's a job that will mostly be done by machines in the future.

I've been unemployed for the past year and a half, and living off of my savings. In this time, I managed to get my CompTIA A+ certificate and ITIL 4 Foundations certificate in the hopes of finding a job in IT. I'm pretty good with computers and tech, but so far I've had two IT related interviews and I have bombed them due to severe anxiety. Many entry level IT jobs involve lots of customer service skills, and my awkwardness and anxiety are my biggest hurdle in getting these jobs. I'm not giving up on IT just yet, but it might not be a career I'm suitable in.

Besides my certificates, I only have an Associates in Arts degree from a community college. Most of my previous job experience is electrical related. Most retail/fast food jobs I cannot do due to my inability to stand. I recently started doing UberEats delivering to help with my bills, but it's not something I can do long term due to car troubles.

I also attempted to learn how to drive a school bus, but couldn't complete the training due to my feet/ankle issues. I can drive normal sized vehicles, but semi-trucks/school buses are too heavy and the braking causes me too much pain.

I've applied to many front desk/office assistant/secretary jobs, but I have yet to get a response from any of these applications. Many of these jobs seem to require years of experience that I don't have.

Any advice would be much appreciated. I know there are careers out there I might not be aware of and haven't searched for. Indeed hasn't been much help in finding jobs. I am still in decent shape physically, but would need to sit down for most of the day. I can still walk around occasionally and do light to moderate lifting.",dickiebuckets93,1,1.0,0,1733262907,2024-12-03 21:55:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h5zcuq/need_advice_finding_new_career_and_dealing_with/,12,2024

1h5z0ev,Took a new job and my old tech-burnout is back. Now considering a total career switch. What should I do?,"Hey,

So to preface, I’m going to keep things like my specific industry and job titles vague. I work in a small industry and don’t want to be identified. I’m considering switching to a totally different career track and would love to hear your thoughts and ideas.

A brief history on my 10 year career, I’m 28 and for my whole adult life (with the exception of 2.5 years) have been in some kind of a tech role. Be it IT, data analytics, business analytics, etc. I’ve identified a pattern in my career where I land a tech role, get burnt out, then find something else which I get bored with and end up back in a tech role where I get burnt out. This is my third time around on this carousel.

The first time around when I was 18 I landed a job in traditional help desk IT, got burnt out after a few years, and moved into an entry level role in the domain that I’ve been in for the last 8 years. I did that for 2.5 years before getting bored (and also needing more money) and as a result getting myself promoted into a business analyst (tech-heavy) role. This started the second time around.

I worked the BA role for 1.5 very hard years and I was horribly overworked. I got unbelievably burnt out. I did learn a lot, but it wasn’t sustainable. I ended up taking a job as a BI analyst in my domain. This was a well paying, fully remote, cushy job. I worked 20 hours a week at most. It was great, for about 6 months. - I started to get bored, I felt like my skills were dulling, and I worried I was going to be trapped in the same role for years. So I began to look around for a more challenging role. And I found one.

That leads me to where I’m at now. I’m in a new role at a new company that services my career domain. The pay is great, I’m fully remote still, and there’s plenty of opportunity for growth. But I’m 3 months in and I already feel the burnout creeping in. I thought I’d be doing more work with the companies we work with but it’s way more tech focused and internal facing. 

I’ve now realized my career has this pattern to it and I don’t want to repeat it again. I’m tired of working in and around tech. I’m tired of ending my days mentally depleted. I’m tired of repeating this pattern of burn out and boredom.

Now I’m considering switching up my career path entirely. Given my background in tech/data analytics and my domain, I’m considering SaaS sales in my space. I’ve also considered something in the lending field, likely commercial lending. Though honestly I’m open to any kind of idea that isn’t healthcare related (I can’t do blood), pays well if you put in the work, and won’t destroy my body in 20 years.

If it helps, I’ve got the following (non-tech) skills: Marketing, Product Management, (light) Finance, Business Development, Photography, Writing

TLDR: I hate tech, I am burnt out, and need a career switch. What do I do?",SadTumbleweed3254,0,0.5,3,1733262044,2024-12-03 21:40:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h5z0ev/took_a_new_job_and_my_old_techburnout_is_back_now/,12,2024

Even thought my title is senior, I still haven’t been doing this very long and would love to know if what I’m feeling is just a phase and to stick it out, to look for a new company, or to look to transition to a new role.

Currently I feel just plain burnt out- we’ve been asked to deliver new features very aggressively for the past two years. During this time I’ve fallen out of love with the role for a few reasons.

1. Hours: are quite long, stretching from ~7am to 6/7pm on a nearly daily basis. It’s impacted my mental/physical health and personal relationships. The early start is non negotiable as I’m working with a dev team halfway across the world.

2. The process: standard PM tasks have begun to feel tedious and repetitive, I’m no longer excited for quarterly planning sessions or working through execution plans with the team.

3. Company culture: when something goes wrong there’s so much finger pointing and even minor issues (and I mean MINOR) get escalated to VPs and C Suite.

Hours wise and culture wise Product at this company seems like it’s just not for me. If you’ve been in a similar situation: is it worth trying product at another company or transitioning out of it entirely?",Organic_Cod_456,1,1.0,0,1733261360,2024-12-03 21:29:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h5yqgd/when_to_switch_it_up/,12,2024
1h5yprs,Corporate finance to law enforcement,"Hi everyone,

I’m thinking about joining the California Highway Patrol (CHP), which would be a big career change for me. I’ve been interested in law enforcement since high school, but I ended up taking a different path—earning my bachelor’s degree and working in corporate FP&A. I’m 29 and have a family, so this decision isn’t one I’m taking lightly.

Has anyone here made a similar career change? If so, how did the transition feel? I’ve spoken to a few CHP officers who came from corporate jobs, and they’ve told me they don’t regret it at all. They really enjoy working for the CHP and wouldn’t go back to their corporate job. 

Some of the reasons I’m considering this career are job security and the long-term benefits. The pay would also be much better, though that’s not my main motivation. One big concern I have is the time away from my family. That’s probably the biggest thing holding me back (along with the significant increased risks to personal safety). However, I’ve heard that family time improves as you gain more seniority (after 3–5 years).

What should I be thinking about or asking myself as I consider this change? What tips or advice would you give someone in my situation?

Thanks in advance for any comments or suggestions!",Nice_Jacket_9181,1,1.0,0,1733261311,2024-12-03 21:28:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h5yprs/corporate_finance_to_law_enforcement/,12,2024

1h5xshx,"Should I renege? Received an offer, but waiting on two other companies? ","After graduating college this year, I've been job-hunting for 8 months and finally secured a full-time offer. I'm desperate and scared atp, but I'm also waiting for two other company to get back to me. Let's call them Company A (the offer letter), Company B (waiting on response), and Company C (on round 2 of 3).

**Company A** is in person 5x a week and I have until Friday to respond to their offer. The industry average for this position is 40k, but they're paying 70k. I'm not confident I will do well at this job, as it's not something within my expertise, and theres a lot of learning that will come to play. Medium sized company.

**Company B** was supposed to get back to me before November 20, but had a situation with a client, and finally got back to me that they need one more week to make a decision. I've already rushed them that the deadline is end of this week, but they can't give me a concrete answer. Their salary range is 45-75k, so I'm unsure. I'm confident I'd be able to perform exceptionally at the role. Small company.

**Company C** is my dream company, but I'm only on interview round 2 of 3 and they're looking to fill this position ASAP. Their range is 50-75k. I see myself growing at this company for a very long time, they're a large company, fortune 500, and honestly the big three of their industry.

Edit: I don't have any bills (no student debt, currently living at home with my parents and they're not pressuring me to find a job, but I feel like such a disappointment if I don't find a job, and I don't have to pay anything for staying at home).

1h5xcqs,40-Year Old Career Dabbler Could Use Your Advice,"I'm a career dabbler and jack-of-many-trades who's ready to settle down. 

I say that because I've figured out where I want to eventually be, but not quite how to get there and could use some advice. 

My teens were spent job-hopping between fast food jobs. My twenties and early thirties were spent working entry-level call center jobs. In my early 40s it's been mostly freelancing online. 

I also don't have any higher education. 

More concisely, I know eventually I want to be a online solopreneur in the SaaS space. But I have bills to pay and need something to keep the lights on and provides insurance so I can fix a cataract I've developed. 

In my off-hours I'd like to dedicate time to learning to code (I'm not sure the languages though). 

I've looked into becoming a Salesforce admin but pretty early on realized it wasn't for me. 

More recently I've looked into IT (specifically help desk), but after completing a boot camp realized it's not for me either (primarily because most of the positions I've seen require either in-office or hybrid schedules). 

I recognize that I've never found my “thing”, and being stuck between trying to stay afloat and not having a clear direction in life has gotten me where I am today. I fully admit that while not having a guiding hand in life has contributed to decades-long bouts of shiny object syndrome, my situation is 100% my fault and I own it.  

I realize I'm asking a helluva lot here, but I'm hoping someone reading this has walked a similar path (or at least relates to where I am, and might have some advice for me.

1h5wwey,Money vs Happiness? ,"I’m a nurse at an outpatient surgery center. The perks of this job are no call, weekends or holidays, however, it comes with a lower pay scale. This never bothered me until I got divorced last year and bought a house, that combined with rising costs of living has made things tight. I love my job and the people I work with. My manager respects me and uses me as a backup. I also fill in for other jobs when needed. 

I had a phone interview with a hospital today and they offered me $10 more an hour and a $30,000 sign on bonus for a 2 year commitment. Benefits about the same, maybe slightly better. However, I would have to take call shifts, work one weekend a month and work a holiday rotation. It would also be moving to a different patient population of patients that are much sicker. 

Is it worth it for the money? I haven’t worked for the hospital for awhile but remember it as being pretty stressful. But my bills are also stressful. I feel terrible leaving as my manager is stressed from others leaving as well and might have a breakdown if I leave. Is being loyal a stupid decision?

1h5wvwa,Job Interview Help? ,"For context, I am a legal specialist in tech-  I was laid off this fall, and while I’m not desperate for a job yet, it would be really nice to get one soon. 

But do any of you have an advice or experience when an interview doesn’t feel right as a candidate? 

Example, I had a ""panel screen,"" interview today.  This was my first interview with a large company with four people at the same time, who I’d be working with directly, and while 3/4 of the team were kind, honest, and seemed enthusiastic about me joining, the loudest member came off as territorial. It felt like she was trying to stake her claim or set boundaries in a way that bordered on a strange power play.  

At one point, she even told me about my previous job instead of listening to my explanation, which was a bit surreal. She was also pretty insulting about my having worked in my previous space in tech, though she admitted to using our products herself! All through that- it was pretty obvious she had no idea what she was talking about with how my last job worked. 

The real kicker for me? I tried so hard to use HR-appropriate jargon when explaining the reduction in force. However, the panelist in question cut me off with, ""So you were laid off."" I calmly gave her the numbers and explained the restructuring and at that point I was sufficiently uncomfortable so I did mention that I was upset by it because I thought it was going to be my forever job- which resonated with her because apparently she'd been laid off before… She actually calmed down at that point. I don’t know if that’s a redeeming thing but I’m trying to give the benefit of the doubt here. 

I’m not sure I would accept an offer even if one comes. I’ve turned down jobs before because they were not livable or the role did not match what my skill set is, but I’ve never had this exact experience before. I want a sanity check

What do you think? Have you ever had an interview like this? And if you accepted the job? Was it any better afterwards?

1h5wsif,Feeling lied to and out of options with current company ,"For many months, I've had constant issues with my manager at work. For 4 years I've been a high-performer and go-getter. It made me rise quickly in ranks and get promotions and pay raises. 

This year, a newer coworker was almost immediately elevated to my position rank. I know this person (we'll call them Aaron) has worked very hard, despite their young age and that it's their first job. Great for them. 

But our manager has quietly restricted my job duties and communication with me. Even though they deny it, I've documented proof of all the times I've had to ask for more work, more tasks, more responsibility, ask what a project was about because I was never informed of it, etc. I found out that any important tasks went directly to Aaron. 

When I sought out to do more things on my own and take initiative, my manager immediately shut me down and said I was wrong about them and to listen to Aaron. Aaron also ignores my ideas and suggestions. 

When I speak up and try to put my best foot forward, I can tell the manager and Aaron don't like this. When I remain silent, they are visibly happier.

My manager and more upper managers have told me numerous times that I'm still a great employee and that I'll keep getting promotions. 

I don't believe that. Aaron is now clearly outperforming me in every single way.

I feel like a total failure. 

Since I'm constantly kept out of the loop by Aaron and our manager, I don't know much of anything going into a meeting. Therefore, Aaron shines and takes over the meeting. When I ask our manager (privately) why I was not included in information prior, they tell me, ""Oh don't worry about it, you're doing great!"" 

I'm at a loss for what to do next. I feel desperate to work harder and be more assertive, but I don't know where to start because I don't know what's going on anymore! The best comparison I can make is it feels like I am in a pitch black room and someone told me to just find the door to exit - but I can't see, I have no idea how big the room is, and there's a chance there's no doorknob on the door. For all I know it could be a trapped door in the ceiling. 

But I also feel like a huge chunk of this is my fault - am I not working hard enough? Should I be working until midnight like Aaron? Honestly, I don't even know what else to do since I complete the little bit of work I get and I'm stopped from doing anything further. 

I've been applying to jobs but I'm going to go at it more hardcore in the new year.

However, I’m concerned about how this might play out during background checks, especially since I’m no longer eligible for a bonus.

My current employer has confirmed they will only verify the dates of my employment, which include a longer-than-usual probation period for finance roles (by three months). I’m tempted not to disclose that I didn’t pass probation. However, once background checks begin, they will see that I’ve left my role.

I’m debating how to handle this. If they ask why I left, I’m considering saying I accepted an offer elsewhere and wanted a short break before starting, framing their offer as a counteroffer. On the other hand, disclosing the probation situation could risk them withdrawing the offer, not buying out my bonus, or questioning my background.

What’s the best approach to manage this situation without jeopardising my chances?

1h5pt7o,Need Advice on Career Direction After Diverse Experience and Relocation Concerns,"I’m a 32-year-old male from a South Asian country, and I’ve been working in Singapore for over 7 years. My career started as a software engineer, but I’ve often been pushed into project management roles due to the circumstances of my visa status. I’ve taken on jobs that offered decent pay, resulting in a varied career path including roles as a software engineer, business analyst, project manager, and scrum master.

I’m both a certified Scrum Master Professional and a PMP-certified professional. However, with the job market becoming increasingly tough for foreigners in Singapore, I may need to start looking for opportunities outside the country as my current contract is coming to an end. This has left me feeling conflicted about which career path I should focus on moving forward.

I’m wondering:
	•	Should I specialize more as a project manager or return to a more technical role?
	•	How can I overcome this helpless feeling when searching for a job that suits my background?
	•	Have I jeopardized my career by not sticking to a single, clear path?

I’d really appreciate any advice or insights from those who have faced similar crossroads or anyone with experience navigating international job markets.

I was looking for another job because I was not satisfied with my current salary. I was ready to go if anyone else offered more. I went through three interviews with another company and got offered a higher position and salary that would be 40% higher than my current one. I went back to my boss and told them I was ready to take this offer and leave the company. She wanted me to stay and offered to try to talk to upper management to see what she could do. She came back with a 25% pay raise and a higher position as an offer. I took a while to think about it as my current job had some benefits that another company did not. I accepted the offer and stayed with the company. They said they would start the paperwork right away but there has been three weeks and no movement with my new contract.

1h5ozvl,Are there any students/graduates here from MHA/MBA healthcare fields? ,"Hey! Currently I’m doing my internship in BDS and really interested in shifting over to a non clinical option that could open doors to careers across more fields than just dental. 

I’ve been specifically interested in careers like healthcare informatics, healthcare analytics and healthcare management (not too much into management tho, I’m not too sure about the job opportunities). 

I’ve been looking at the MBA Healthcare analytics program at IIHMR Jaipur and their curriculum looks pretty impressive. I know there’s MBA programs in Goa and TISS Mumbai but I haven’t looked into those much yet. 

If there are any current or graduate students from these universities or from this field can you please help guide me? I have been feeling really lost with what I’m supposed to do next. 

I mainly have the following questions: 

1. IIHMR Jaipur - what is the uni really like? 
- Is it well reputed and regarded? 
- Is the faculty dedicated?
- What are the internship opportunities and placements like? 
- I have been through the website and they boast big numbers but I want to know if all of that is really true. Specifically related to MBA healthcare analytics or I would also be willing to do another similar course. 

2. About MBA in healthcare in general - anyone who is currently studying in the field or has graduated: 
- what is/has the experience been like? 
- Do you regret it or wish you could have done something different? 
- What are the job opportunities and pay like? 
- Are there any prospects in moving abroad? 
- I’m hoping to move to Singapore or somewhere like that in the future. 
- Also would really appreciate if you share your journey!

1h5ohix,How to not feel stuck and move jobs in 2024 ?,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out because I feel stuck in my career and could use some guidance. I’m currently working as a digital project manager, with a background in content marketing, sports, and entertainment. I have a BA in International Business & Marketing + MA in Media Production, and while I’ve gained valuable experience, I no longer feel fulfilled in my current role.

I’ve been in a job share position, hoping it would eventually transition into a full-time role, but my employer hasn’t been able to make that happen. The uncertainty has been overwhelming, and I’ve realized I need to make a change—not just for career growth, but also for my mental health and financial stability.

I’ve been looking into transitioning to performance marketing because it seems like a natural progression from my background, but I haven’t had any success. My CV doesn’t seem to resonate with recruiters, and I haven’t had a single interview in over a year.

I’m now open to exploring other career paths that align with my skills:

* **Skills**: Digital project management, content strategy, stakeholder engagement, and some experience in strategic planning.
* **Background**: Sports and entertainment, content marketing, and digital production oversight.
* **Goals**: A full-time role with opportunities for growth, better pay, and a clear career path.

I’d love recommendations for:

1. Alternative career paths where my skills could fit well.
2. Certifications or upskilling that could help me stand out.
3. How to reframe my experience in a way that makes me more appealing to hiring managers in other fields.

If anyone has transitioned from a similar role to something completely different or has insights into industries I might not have considered, I’d be so grateful for your advice.

This situation has been really challenging, and I’m scared about my future. Thank you for taking the time to read this and for any guidance you can provide.

1h5m133,Need your guidance! Please help,"I have 7 years of work experience with 4 different jobs so far. In all of the jobs I’ve had, I’ve been fired.

Here’s a little more on that:

**1st Job (1 year)**: I was pretty new to the domain, but over time, I learned what the job truly entailed. It was about to be a year when, one day, I was told by my senior to stay back and work on something. I disagreed, but ended up working anyway. The next day, when I arrived at the office, I was told I had been fired. I thought about this a lot and blamed it on being not disciplined.  (

**2nd Job (2 year)**: This job was full of ups and downs. It was a new experience for me, so it took some time to get the hang of it. Then, the pandemic hit, and I had my salary cut by 70%, which lasted for 6-7 months. After that, I was asked to do telecalling, which was completely unrelated to my job. I declined, and a couple of days later, my manager called me and told me I was fired. I must admit, both the manager and the company were quite a disaster. I sometimes wonder whether it was my fault or if the company was just really bad.

**3rd Job(2 year)**: This was a remote position, and I had trouble connecting with my team, despite putting in a lot of effort. My manager once mentioned that I was perceived as being a bit rude. In terms of work performance, my rating was below average, and before they could fire me, I quit.

**4th Job (2 years)**: Up until this point, I had a good experience. I really loved my work at this company and had a great team. For the most part, I was doing well, and it felt like a dream job. However, after nearly 2 years, I was fired again. The reason was that I was considered evasive, not truthful, and they had issues trusting me. To be honest, I had a couple of incidents where I was evasive, but not intentionally untruthful.

Now, I understand I may be at fault, but after 7 years of work, I’ve been fired in almost every job I’ve had. This is making me rethink everything. Am I in the right domain? Should I start a business (I really want to, but just don’t have the guts)? Are these firings a reflection of something about me? Am I really that bad professionally to be fired from all these jobs?

The silver lining in all these firings is that I’ve always switched jobs with a nearly 80-100% salary hike, and I ended up working at better companies.

I really need some advice here. I’m quite anxious about joining something new again. Just to add, in almost all of the jobs, I had severe anxiety. For example, if my manager called me, I’d immediately start thinking about what I might have done wrong. This anxiety, combined with the firings, has made me really reluctant to join a new company.",ConfusedAFF898,1,1.0,2,1733227989,2024-12-03 12:13:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h5m133/need_your_guidance_please_help/,12,2024

I recently just started as a head of a smaller business unit within the gaming industry (like a product). 

After arriving it turns out I was the head of the business unit with no one but cross department support. The timing wasn’t the best as we have a big game releasing in 3 weeks so I did my best to support the other teams while I worked out my plans.

3 weeks later the game bombed. Quite hard. Hard enough where I was asked to then lead the Marketing team and the project I was originally heading was put on ice until the company financials improve (if it does). 

The company has about 3 months of runway left and the CEO is panicking now by micromanaging everyone, including myself where I needed to create a marketing plan from scratch for a game in 1 week. The micromanaging includes telling me to do silly things like buy followers for the social media accounts when we haven’t officially announced the game yet. 

Now the company has had a 40% layoff and another 25% of my new marketing team (that I wasn’t originally hired to do) has now quit. When asked for additional support the only feedback I receive was “prove yourself first by getting your hands dirty”. 

On one hand it’s barely been over a month and despite the chaos I’ve learned a lot.

On the other, I’ve never quit a job before, but I am incredibly burnt out working 12 hours a day and over weekends since 3 weeks ago.

I am a Computer Science 2024 graduate from a Tier-2 college. I have done an internship as a full stack engineer in an ed-tech startup during my final semester. They offered me a full time job, which I rejected for TCS, for which there is no update on joining date yet and idk when will we get onboarded.

I want to explore other options since I am fed up of waiting for the joining, it's been 6 months already and its taking a toll on my mental health and family has also started to feel this thing now.

I can choose from:

1. Wait for TCS

2. Go to US for Masters

3. Prepare for CAT'25

  
Since I faced so many rejections before finally getting TCS, I cannot pick up the courage to start prepping from scratch and do job search.

  
Please suggest me how should I proceed with my career. Any suggestions and experiences are welcome.",Individual-Earth-172,1,1.0,0,1733209374,2024-12-03 07:02:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h5hpql/need_career_advice/,12,2024

Especially because so many things Interest me. Being an ultrasound tech, labor & delivery nurse or a dermatologist really catches my attention but I know I’m not ready to commit to one yet because I’m so young & haven’t really explored what else is out there. & I feel so pressured by my family to start applying to college when I’m not even sure what I want & I know graduation will come before I know it & I want to be successful.

I don't list said supervisor on my list of references, but there have been a few times where hiring staff have asked to speak with them because the position is very relevant to the work I did under them. I feel like I don't have enough experience to leave it off my resume and it is also relatively (recent within last two years). And, ultimately, the job comes up in interviews because I learned a lot of necessary skills when I was working there. I feel like it would be a bit of a red flag to say they decline to give a reference, but is that the best way to go about it? The past supervisor has directly told me they will not give a good reference.

It’s not that we don’t want to grow, we just don’t know where to start. Between constant deadlines at work and endless *“How to Learn X”* articles and *""how to become a millionaire""* mentors selling courses on Insta...it’s overwhelming.

**Here’s what I’ve noticed about this struggle**:

1. **We don’t know what to prioritize.** There’s always a shiny new skill trending mostly AI, coding, project management. But which one actually aligns with our goals?
2. **Traditional learning feels generic.** I've signed up for tons of courses, only to quit halfway through because it just didn’t click...
3. **Staying consistent is HARD.** Life gets in the way, and before you know it, that *“30-day upskilling challenge”* is a distant memory.

At first I had a solid idea that was possible to an extent but it spiraled into a failure. The type of failure that is only avoided by focusing on a completely different situation and leaving it to burn.
I have no experience In game development and don’t have enough money to even afford a simple PC. I’m stuck at a crossroad that has a dead end. 
I’m trying to find a new career path to follow but it doesn’t feel right. I am considering just getting a simple job and forgetting about it. I like doing game related things but I’m in no shape to do anything in that field and if I did I wouldn’t be talking about it here like I am right now.

1h5enul,Should I go back to being an employee or continue the solo grind?,"I have 13 years of experience as a full-stack developer specializing in JavaScript, Node.js, and .NET. 

For 11 years, I worked as a permanent employee, but in the past two years, I ventured into freelancing, solopreneurship, and building things I genuinely wanted to use.

While I loved the creative freedom and flexibility of this solo journey, it hasn’t been financially fruitful. I’m barely managing to balance doing what I love and paying my bills. 

My life was much more peaceful during my years as a permanent employee, and now I’m questioning whether this grind is worth it.

On top of this, my current lifestyle is taking a toll on my family life—I’m spending less time with my kids and feeling disconnected from them.

I’m stuck at a crossroads and would really appreciate some advice:

	1.	Should I go back to being an employee for financial stability and peace of mind?
	2.	Or should I continue grinding, hoping that things will stabilize, allowing me to relax in the future?

i ve never had the luxury of knowing what i really want in life, probably i still dont know, i know what i dont want mostly. i really dont like the corporate language, neither the bs arount it.
I m and must be grateful of my secure warm workplace, paid vacations, sick days etc. 
But something inside is hurtinh me, it s been a while. something is telling me that i dont fit, i dont belong  and not happy. i dont believe happiness is my target or final destination buy at the end of the day i m exhausted, same month end reports, meetings , targets etc. non stop screen is killimh me.

the reason why i stay is mostly to be able provide for my family, if it wasnt for them or my retirement i would probably do odd jobs until i die or i d stick to something fits with me. 
anyways , it s a bit of venting bit of desperation. 
i know the common reddit answer or consensus is, find a hoby you like after work or spend time with your family but i m too exhausted or maybe even bored from current position , anyways, anyone  going through the same? what do you recommend? shut up and keep suckin it or take a big risk and discover new horizons? independent work?

I was wondering if cold emailing creative agencies or nonprofit organizations is still an acceptable approach, or if it might come across as bothersome.

I’ve reached out to several local and state agencies as well as nonprofits, but so far, I’ve only received one response stating they weren’t looking for help. I ensure my emails are professional and include a link to my portfolio to provide more context about my work.

Would it be better to expand my search beyond my state instead of focusing locally? I’ve also utilized job boards like Indeed, LinkedIn, and Glassdoor, but I always verify the job listings on the company’s official website before applying.

1h5bmca,Was just fired 5 weeks after returning from Parental leave,"Hello Reddit, 

I have worked for this company since August 2021. The CEO is an 87 year old man with all the qualities you can imagine, racist, sexist, doesn’t believe in parental leave etc. 

Didn’t have to interact with him much outside of quarterly all hands meetings, and the company is pretty much ran by the managers who I all got along with well and who all like me. 

Besides passing comments about immigrants and a lack of work ethic with my generation, my first real confrontation with the CEO was when a co-worker came back part time from parental leave after I had been hired and ended up getting pregnant again. She asked if she could pick up one shift a week so that she could get the minimum hours needed to qualify for parental leave again, she was going to be around 80 hours short after working part time for around 6 months. She was denied on the pretence that there was not enough work (there absolutely was) I offered to work 4 days a week to free up the work but he shot that down as well and I was informally reprimanded for trying to undermine him. 

Fast forward to my second child being born and I’m getting ready to go on my parental leave. I gave him a signed document with my return date and enjoyed my parental leave. 

I return to work at the expected date and the whole department besides the managers has turned over, one of the new people was only hired a week earlier. Now this is nothing new at this company I have seen four accoutants, three health and safety officers and three secretaries come and go as I worked there as well as my department go through two to three people as well. But he tells me there might not be enough work to keep me on full time, I suspect this is his go to excuse whenever he wants to get rid of someone that he can’t bully. 

I worked for 5 weeks without talking to him again, but had meetings with my managers assuring me that the work load wasn’t an issue and not to worry. Today I was handed my notice of termination. 

I’m torn because I truly did not like that man, and am happy to get out of that industry. But it’s 3 weeks before Christmas I have a new baby and a toddler and money was already tight after my parental leave ended. 

I guess im wondering if I should pursue legal action (BC Canada by the way) but I don’t even know if I could afford a lawyer, I guess im also just venting so if you made it this far thanks for reading and any advice is welcome.

I was given my offer letter, and the base salary seemed decent. I had no idea if it was negotiable or not because I was too scared to ask. It's my first job and I didn't want to seem greedy or blow my opportunity. I asked another colleague, and he said he's getting 10K more without negotiating. We both have zero experience and we both have engineering degrees. Granted he could be lying, but 10K
more isn't that drastic for someone to lie about.

But if he is, I'm kinda upset because that isn't fair. What's making me more irritated is I always read about how attractive people make about 10-15% more than their counterparts. I would say I'm decently attractive, he is as well. The difference between us is that I'm of Middle Eastern descent, and he's Caucasian with blonde hair and blue eyes, plus he's attractive. No, I'm not making this about race. But could that be a factor? Also, we are both technically different departments, but the roles are very similar. We don't have the same managers.

1h5b9ef,I feel selfish for already wanting a better job.,"Hello. So essentially I graduated from university with a degree in Business Analytics. I essentially cheated on most of my work, hence I didn't have a good grasp on most subjects. I was in a depressed state for some time and essentially gave up on teaching myself the fundamentals through online courses, and applying to jobs. After feeling better mentally, I gave in to applying to basic full-time jobs in the meantime to get some money and benefits until I study enough and feel confident enough to apply to data analysts jobs. It just so happens one of the jobs I applied to was sort of in between these two job categories. I was lucky enough to get the job. My main goal now has been to grow within the job and company.

The only thing now is it seems the data analyst market is completely flooded and it seems even with me studying, I wouldn't give myself that much of a competitive edge. The point of me making this post I guess is I feel greedy in the sense I didn't have much going for me a year prior, and now I have a job that's somewhat within my realm, pays a livable salary, full-time with benefits, etc. But I want more. I'm technically hourly, and I feel salary is more distinguished. I don't think a bachelors is required for this job or any prior experience. I compare my coworkers with people from other more distinguished teams and I can see our team doesn't require much skill in several realms, compared to other teams that contribute more, have smarter people, generally talk better, approach problems better, have more degrees and experience, etc.

In short, I want to be on one of those teams or in a job like that. With better pay, providing more important work, etc., but I'm not. And yet I came from essentially nothing. I guess this is more of a vent, and I'm open to any and all advice. I recognize I don't have a lot under my belt and I don't know how much external studying can help that, but I already want to be in a more distinguished role. I feel selfish for saying this because my job is not a bad job by any means.

1h59y7u,Recently laid off and looking for advice on accepting a lower salary job and impact on severance package,"This is my first time being laid off and my first time without a job in 15 years. I was laid off on Nov 1st but I did get a decent severance package. The severance package is pretty much me getting paid like normal for the next 6 months even though I am not working. Also coverage for health insurance for 6 months.  I know this is not something that occurs everywhere so I am very grateful for it.  

I interviewed for a position last week and received an offer today. The offer is around $25,000 lower than what I was making. I am trying to determine if I should accept it or not. I was thinking about accepting for 2 reasons. Some money is better than none and also this job will give me experience in a software product that has become popular in my field. Almost 90% of the job applications I have seen ask about this software. Since I will still get my severance for a few more months, the money I make at the new job can go to my savings since my severance will pay the bills.

The only reason I am hesitating is because I plan to continue to look for a higher paying job whether I accept this offer or not. My hope is to find another job in my preferred salary range in the next 5-6 months. Is it real crappy of me to accept this job but potentially leave within 1-5 months? Will this make me look bad? How do I explain a lower position on my resume in the future? Also, I'm not sure I will have enough pto to go on other interviews if I do get any. I plan to call HR at my old job to confirm it won't impact my severance (it shouldn't) but I am curious to know what others think.

My current company is basically a free for all, nobody takes accountability for their work and “not my job” seems like the damn catch phrase. So happy to take the leap outside of this hellhole!! I’ve been here since an internship in college and the “sparkle” wore off.

So, looking for some advice on a couple of things…

First- my new company is running their background checks and doing all the administrative stuff, just takes some time. Nothing will come up and I’m 100% certain. I’ve already signed the contract and everything is just contingent on my background testing being complete. They have anticipated start dates of Dec. 23 or Dec 30. I’d like to have a little time between jobs, does anyone see a risk to giving my 2 weeks if I’m certain nothing will show up or do I wait a week to be 100% sure? I just want OUT of this current job!!

Second- I know my current company will not keep me around as it’s a conflict of interest (I have no non-competes). I’m not planning on telling them the exact name of where I’m going, but they will obviously assume a few places. Working in Illinois, we are an at-will state, I have about 10 days of vacation I’ve accrued since February 2024. If I don’t comply with telling them details or signing certain paperwork can they withhold anything? I am certain it’s a “no” but am curious if anyone has any similar experiences.

I am in the creative industry, currently living in Germany making around 3500 Euros net per month and I have an offer at 7500 Euros in one of the tax free countries in the Gulf region. The company is quite stabie and an industry I know, it was a company I really wanted to work before. I believe with experience I gained in  Europe I could earn my place and advance there. It is an industry I enjoy to work in, but requires full time office and might do some over time as well. I estimate I would be saving 4k Euros per month there.

I also work in a good company but its in the tech industry it is as safe as it can be in tech nowadays tech environment and I doubt I would be able to find something like this easily if things go south. However, Im non-eu citizen I only need another year to be eligible for German citizenship. 

My wife's work is extremely stable here in GER as its in extreme shortage but she makes around 3k - The country where we would go has more competition on her field and I would not expect her to find a job easily if ever, she would be making apprx. the same net salary as GER. We also plan to have a kid this year. 


I want to save and invest as much as possible and as fast as possible. I am not sure what to do. Current landscape favors staying here but I am afraid of refusing the opportunity and then facing a bad surprise here. Any comments, different viewpoints or things I neglected to factor in ?

Our company is strict about absences, especially from mid-September to mid-December, and I feel conflicted about taking Thursday off, even though I’ve earned trust as a top performer and have been praised by my director.

I’m worried this might hurt their perception of me, especially as I’m expecting a raise and benefits.

1h57ah1,My boss gives me bad vibes,"So i’ve been working at this bank since January, started in CS and worked my way up to the sales and CS for high value clients (since they seem those people worthy of CS workers who supposedly know what they’re doing) 

When i started in plain old CS i was doing well, good numbers and reviews so they made me go through this sort of “internship” where they measured if i would be able to perform at a higher level. I did this for 4 months and they hired me at a higher paying position. 

When i transferred i got a new manager, im just gonna call him Fred. Fred is a nice guy but you can tell that he doesnt mean a word of what he’s saying and always tries to fake “being kind” i’ve seen this guy laughing with some of my coworkers and 10 minutes later fire them because of “lacking performance” completely blindsiding people. 

My numbers in the last 3 weeks have dwindled a bit, nothing too crazy but if there would be a graph im definitely going on a bit of a slope. I have to admit that i’ve been slacking just a but. I havent had any free days (aside from weekends) because i’ve been saving up my free days so i could take off the month of dec until the beginning of January (didnt have any plans anyway so decided to work through the summer) basically im feel burnt out and in desperate beed for some days of doing nothing. 

I feel like he’s been observing me and during group meetings making sure that people notice my stats (calling it out by my name as an example for low sales) i feel like he’s trying to find reasons to can me. Just now at almost 23:00 he sent me a teams message saying he found i didnt register a certain action and that i should remember to to that. Idk, maybe im just being paranoid, got an end year review coming up next week.

1h576ke,Will you leave your job because of toxic bosses?,"Would you quit your job if it gets toxic / political?

To clearly define toxic / political:

1) Unfair treatment: You're singled out for criticism or negative feedback, while others who make similar mistakes are treated more leniently.
2) Withholding opportunities: You're excluded from important projects, promotions, or training opportunities.
3) Spreading rumors: Negative or untrue information about you is circulated within the workplace.
4) Public humiliation: Your boss publicly criticizes or embarrasses you in front of colleagues.
5) Sabotaging your work: Your boss undermines your efforts or makes it difficult for you to succeed.
6) Favoritism: Your boss shows preferential treatment to certain employees, often those who are perceived as allies.
7) Gaslighting: Your boss questions your perceptions or experiences, making you doubt your own judgment.

Opinion: Quitting in a toxic situation may seem like the easier way out. However, it also depends on the situation. If you quit because of something you're clearly not wrong for (i.e something unethical against you), you probably have failed to stand up for your values, and failed to fight for what's right. The real winners are those who persevere, stay true, influence and make things right. Ultimately, they contribute to the positive cultural change for the greater good.

1h56vld,Life advice wanted 💔,"I need some advice. I’m really confused and don’t know how to make the right decision. I just turned 26, and I feel completely lost. I have a background in design and modeling, and I think I’m a pretty versatile person with a lot of interests. But I have no idea what career path I should follow, and honestly, I don’t understand how people figure this out. It feels like time is running out, and I need to make a decision and move forward. But I can’t seem to figure out what I want.

I used to work as a graphic designer. I taught myself everything from scratch—learned the programs and freelanced. Eventually, it led to burnout, and I decided to switch to modeling. I worked as a model for a few years, and while it was fun, I realized it’s not a career I can stick with forever. I wanted to pursue something more solid, something that would lead to a real career.

That’s when I went back to school for design. I started studying UX/UI design, and I gave it everything I had. I absolutely loved it. It was a huge source of motivation and inspiration for me. I built a solid portfolio and was really determined to find a job. But then the war started in my country. I had to move to Germany, and I kept studying design here, but despite my efforts, I couldn’t find a job.

Not wanting to waste any time, I decided to start learning German. Right now, I’m at an A2 level, and I think I’m doing pretty well—I enjoy learning, and I find it rewarding. Honestly, I like focusing on things that help me escape from real-life problems and responsibilities, even if just for a little while.

But I need money, and I can’t afford to go on without working anymore. I’ve completely run out of savings. My ex-boyfriend sometimes lets me use his card to buy food if I can’t afford it, and I feel terrible about it. It feels like there are endless possibilities out there, but in reality, I don’t see them.

The job market in UX/UI design doesn’t seem promising at the moment. AI and the global crisis have taken away a lot of design jobs, and there’s no sign that things are improving anytime soon.

I see myself as a creative person, so I’ve been looking for a profession where I can express that. Today, I attended my first nail design course, and I really enjoyed it. I think I could be good at it. But the problem is, I don’t see long-term prospects in this field. What happens when I’m 35? What if I want to have a child or start a family? What do I do with this career then? Start all over again?

I want to have a secure position—a career that grows with me, supports me financially, and allows me to use both my intellectual and creative abilities. At the same time, I don’t want to give my entire soul to work. I want a job that allows for sick days or vacations, something I just don’t see as realistic in nail design.

I honestly don’t know what to do. I would really appreciate any advice. Thank you.",MaximumQuick4420,1,1.0,1,1733176243,2024-12-02 21:50:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h56vld/life_advice_wanted/,12,2024
1h56azc,"HR denied my wife’s hours request, but her coworker works less? Advice?","Hi everyone,

I’m looking for advice on how to help my wife handle a frustrating situation at work. She recently returned from maternity leave and requested to adjust her hours to work 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (36 hours per week, she works 4 days a week) so she could be home earlier to care for our baby. HR told her they couldn’t approve the reduction because dropping below 38 hours would require her to switch to hourly pay, which would cut her income significantly.

She accepted this, but today she found out a new coworker, also salaried, is working just 35 hours a week. This feels inconsistent and unfair compared to how her request was handled.

She’s planning to bring this up with HR, but we want to make sure it’s approached in the best way. How can she frame her concerns without burning bridges? Is this a valid issue to push back on? Has anyone been through something similar?

1h561py,Company acquisition - are redundancies pending or am I being delusional like my manager said?,"The company I work for got acquired in early January 2024. There is a language barrier between 2 companies. The acquiring company is well established in Europe, they want to expand in the UK. Basically, take competitor of the market scenario. Since then, there’s been a lot of changes. It’s a furniture store with over 100 stores or so. The head office and digital team is small employee size wise.

1. All of C suite and board were to go first. The acquiring company doesn’t specialise in flooring, so they were to go second. All of them got made redundant.
2. All the directors resigned together in one email. So one person emailed and cc’d everyone together and combined resigned. They were meant to serve 3 months notice, but did 1.
3. Manager resigned along with Head of. They didn’t replace them, but are replacing low level positions e.g. marketing executives.
4. 1 by 1 people from HR are leaving, 3 people left in one week.
5. They stopped free tea and coffee to store staff, only customers get free tea and coffee. They reduced bonuses and talking about taking company care of the managers.
6. Multiple store staff have resigned and gone to competitors.
7. All the marketing comes from the acquiring company.
8. All the budget has been stopped.
9. Apparently a colleague has been offered £700 to stay until March.

I’m scared I will be made redundant, I tried explaining my fears to my manager but he told me I should wait for official news from management like director level. I shouldn’t listen to rumours. I said the acquiring company doesn’t want UK offices and there’s duplication of teams. He acted like I’m delusional to think this way. He also said no one has been told to go. People are choosing to leave. But, the people who have left aren’t being replaced e.g. HR and commercial teams. I tried explaining how I feel but I got told I’m being negative and blunt. I need to be more positive.

Am I wrong, are redundancies pending? How can I explain why people are choosing to leave? ",Alarming-Hair-2358,1,1.0,10,1733174210,2024-12-02 21:16:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h561py/company_acquisition_are_redundancies_pending_or/,12,2024
1h55zes,Torn Between Software Startup Job and Finance Paralegal Role—Advice?,"I’m a CS major at a T5 school graduating in May, with a background in software engineering at early-stage startups. I’ve done some strategy and operations work as well at these startups so I've been able to basically make multiple resumes: one for tech and one for strategy/operations/finance-adjacent-stuff. 

This spring, I have two options available:
- Software Startup Internship: Small team, mix of engineering and strategy work, fewer hours, better pay (hourly), likely leads to a full-time offer.
- Finance Paralegal Internship: Medium-sized NYC law firm, securities/financial services focus, long hours and lower chance of a full-time offer. This role is typically for people heading to law school.

I’m torn because the software job aligns more with my current skills and would allow me to continue growing vertically, but I want to expand my horizons, and the paralegal job feels like a unique opportunity to explore a completely different field which will diversify my background to corporate as well as startups. Which path should I take?

1h55uzb,How can I get help finding a real career with autism?,"As the title says.

I worked as a documentation specialist and technical writer for a healthcare company for several years, but then my team was laid off and the role integrated with a different team. I couldn’t find another job for a few years. I landed one as a therapist assistant… and was terminated within 2 months because I kept being misinterpreted, and a coworker was filing false reports. I found another job in the same role and kept it for 8 months before being terminated again, once more for people skills. Moved to another one and worked for 11 months there… I loved that job but two weeks ago I was suddenly terminated. The termination meeting involved quotes verbatim like: “you’re receptive to feedback but struggle to retain it”, “you just miss social cues”, “you have a very dry sense of humor”, and “parents thought you weren’t professional” (despite talking to parents being one of my strongest skills on my 6 month review).

I’m not officially diagnosed with autism and didn’t ask for accommodations (I have been obstructed before for doing so and was afraid that asking would cost me my job). HR suggested that I should leave the field during the termination meeting due to my poor communication skills.

I am getting tired of being terminated from jobs for poor people skills. It’s not that I’m not a good speaker. I can be a great speaker… when it’s a topic that I’m skilled at. But in a workplace, I get conflicting feedback and I’m told that I’m expected to just know which feedback is for the specific moment, and which feedback is supposed to be done universally moving forward. I’ve gotten written warnings at multiple workplaces both for implementing feedback when it was situation-specific, and for not realizing feedback was NOT situation-specific. When I ask questions to clarify, supervisors get frustrated and say that I need to “figure it out”, or I’m interrupted and they answer questions I didn’t ask. I don’t know how I’m supposed to avoid this problem when it seems like nobody ever knows what I’m trying to ask. In my personal life, I simply don’t have this problem. But in workplaces it seems like everyone is intent on interpreting my words as badly as possible.

I know I can be a good worker. I’m efficient, I’m always ahead of deadlines, and I’m always making useful and quality suggestions. I’m observant and I’m passionate about a lot of subjects. I like to help and I like to collect knowledge. But I just can’t seem to communicate right. I’m looking for remote work or office jobs and I keep getting rejected for “lack of experience”.

I have bills to pay. I have a car payment, a mortgage, and other bills. I need to find work that will provide for me, but I’m at my wits end with being abruptly cut from jobs that I thought I loved with no warning. I was nominated for employee of the month at my last job within two months of starting there. People just don’t like me or don’t seem to understand what I say. I don’t get it. Even during the termination meeting this month, one of HR made a statement about something I supposedly did wrong, and the other HR present corrected her to say it wasn’t at all what she said. I was told I “didn’t follow protocol and accidentally gave a client exactly what they were using maladaptive behavior to get” — the other HR staff corrected to say that I just “missed a social cue”. She clarified that earlier during client behavior, she asked me if I wanted water and I said “I have some, but thank you for offering”. What she wanted me to say was “no thank you”. The goal was just to get the client in behavior to speak without yelling, but I needed to say “no thank you” specifically? It feels like I’m constantly running into issues of interpretation. Everything I say or do when I talk to people is always taken to be as negative as it possibly can be!

Which is why I’m here for advice. I’m going absolutely insane. I need to find some kind of resource to help place me in a job where I’m not dealing with this. I need some kind of job where I can write or organize. I can do quality assurance. I can do web design and graphic design. I can do marketing. I can do organization and HR. I can do documentation and transcription. I just can’t work a client facing job, apparently. 

Are there any services that can help me with finding an actual career that I can keep for longer than a year? Every hiring agency in my city is only hiring for factory labor, which I also cannot do because of spine deformities. I’m at the end of my rope with trying to find and keep a job.

End note: Before anyone asks, the two terminations before that were also for stupid reasons. The first one, a coworker was making attacks on me over stuff to do with protected status. I asked to meet with HR to ask for help with discrimination. HR opened the meeting with “we decided not to move forward with you” and ended the call before I could say a word. The second one was a whole mess with the company issuing coworkers warnings for taking sick time. After a coworker had a seizure at work because she had no paid hours off, I emailed asking for an improved sick policy, so people didn’t come in and have medical emergencies. I was terminated the same day as that email for reasons cited as “at will”. Since I was let go from that job, every person including leads has either quit or been fired too.",athesomekh,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1733173745,2024-12-02 21:09:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h55uzb/how_can_i_get_help_finding_a_real_career_with/,12,2024
1h55onj,Career Ideas based on my skills,"Hey, 

I’ve been struggling to switch careers. Currently I am a nanny and I love my job but frankly I’m burnt out on it. I feel like maybe one of my only solid options with benefits and a pension is going into teaching. Unfortunately, in my state I can’t “try out” being a substitute without getting a bachelors degree and I only have an AA in early childhood development and education. 

However, I wanted to post on here some of my other strengths and see if anyone here has an idea I didn’t think of. 

I really enjoy repetitive organizational tasks. I will say there does need to be some variety so it’s not mind-numbing but I love organizing things a lot. Something about it soothes my brain. I really love stationary products too which plays into my organization. I’m also pretty creative. I’ve considered opening up a small business for my art but that’s such a constant grind in the sense of finding all of my own customers and while I could potentially do it, I don’t feel like I have the business mindset to really excel. If I could just focus on the creative side that would be amazing but I know that’s not super realistic in terms of having my own business. 

I prefer to be more introverted and have less human contact, but I have worked in customer service and can handle the public well (though it’s draining). 

I really appreciate any advice and welcome questions as well. Thanks in advance. ",IntrepidAtmosphere90,1,1.0,0,1733173320,2024-12-02 21:02:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h55onj/career_ideas_based_on_my_skills/,12,2024
1h551io,I despise my job with every fiber of my being.,"As the title says, i (29M) fucking hate my job. It’s an agricultural sales position that i took on 3 years ago in order to have more free time in the summer and fall to help my dad around the family farm. It was okay at first, until i realized that i am not sales inclined in the least. And then recently, my family’s farm lost more than half of its cropping acres. Dad won’t be needing my help.

1h551ec,Is my workplace toxic? Or do I need to be better. ,"So using a throw away account, but I really need some advice on my situation. 

  
I am a 25M working in a dream field of mine. It is typically hard to get into this field and I got very lucky by networking and taking some leaps of faith. I got a really good job that brought me back home. Pays me very well for being 25. This job is demanding though, I am helping to manage a large territory across 3 states. Lots of overnights and long days on the road. Yes it is a sales job, but... I am not a sales rep. I took this job in hopes to become a sales rep one day and learn under someone close to my age. Most people in my position however do not have the same expectations as me. My expectations are more sales based where the people in my role do not have to worry. I was fine with that as I want to make it into sales, but recently it has been difficult. 

  
To start, my team gossips so much it makes me feel so anxious. They are huge on ""overcommunicate"" but if you communicate and say something they think is dumb or that you should know by now, I find out that everyone knows and I get calls from everyone on it. My rep acts super tight to me but throws me under the bus constantly, he will go out of his way to CC people in emails on the team who don't need to know my  business just to throw me under the bus and put pressure on me. And its always such little things, follow up emails, ordering certain equipment etc.... I feel constantly judged 24/7 but I am also going above and beyond my role.

  
Like I mentioned, I am not in sales but have a hybrid role they made up. So I have certain expectations that no one else in my role has. Recently, I had to do a ride along with my boss, (this is not typical for my role) but I had a day of on the road cold calls scheduled because I wanted some feedback on my skills. We stopped at an account and I set up a trial right in front of my boss. Didnt really say much but that was I thought fairly impressive being that I am young and no one else is doing this. ( I have also closed 4 accounts compared to my counterpart who has same role as me and has not set a single trial up 7 months in). My first boss who hired me left for a promotion and he never once worked with me. I basically got tossed into my role and was told to figure it out. So I was excited for some feedback. Didnt get much as my mew boss was also hungover during my ride along...... I ended up seeing an account 20 minutes away and said we should stop there because I have never called on this account. Lets go see what we can find. 

  
I drove to the account and the team was not in that day. No big deal, I dropped off business cards and called it good. My boss seemed annoyed we didn't speak to anyone, he had asked me if I precall planned this? I said no, I have never even been, since we are on this side of the state I figured we could stop in and see who the person might be to speak with, said I was sorry we didn't find that person. (this is important for later)

  
Following week I had to be in coverage for our product. Speaking to my boss and rep they both knew we had this going on the next week. My rep wanted me to cover for him, no problem. Our boss put a 7am meeting on our calendar. That morning I was busy getting everything going and did not txt them I would not be attending, assuming they would both know I was at this trial. Now I fully acknowledge I should never assume and should communicate this. My boss called and freaked out on my which I deserved, and began ripping me for all sorts fo stuff that is just not true. Saying I needed to keep my salesforce up to date and documented, (which I do, he just looks at the wrong thing everytime and gets confused and thinks my stuff is outdated) But I do completely acknowledge I should have communicated and not assumed. 

  
2nd part to this, I had told my boss and rep I would be taking a day off to leave early for a conference. My rep told me to always just let him know and that's how they have always done it. My new boss did say to me I needed to submit on a certain system. I ended up saying, well I got in on my reps calendar and I am taking off a day early. (keep in mind my rep works 2 other jobs and takes random days off all time, brags to me about how he does this and this job is so chill cuz he can take Fridays off to work a fun job, and just to keep quiet about it) so entering this job I realized they were pretty chill and lenient on a lot of things. Well, I did what I said and took Friday off and was gonna fly out Thursday night. I did not want to take Thursday off since I had such a late flight. Well, long story short, my rep began booking shit on my calendar for Thursday that I could not make cuz of my flight. He said ""well you only have Friday off"" I told him I had a flight though and would drive 5 hours away to make a meeting but could not make the 2nd meeting since it was during my flight. My rep raged and began throwing me under the bus to the entire team. My boss called and chewed me out. I get it, I should have submitted it. But I was told from the start from my rep to just listen to him and do it his way, then he turns and throws me under the bus. I wanted to let them know he works 2 other jobs and takes Fridays off all the time without submitting PTO. I learned my lesson but felt like it was such BS when that's just what I have been told. 

  
Fast forward, I come to find out my boss who also just got fired for Sexual Harrasment at the conference from the last story was trying to get me fired. He just joined the team a month ago, did 1 ride along and just got pissy about the travel situation and was tryna can me. I found out he threw a fit to leadership that I brought him to an account without any contacts....I found this hilarious since my role doesn't even do ridealongs in the first place and I am the only person in the company practically who does sales ridealongs and he is throwing a fit for me knocking on doors? The other reason was understandable with the travel situation. But where I am just so worked up and done is the constant gossiping with the team. They somehow all knew my business, they know every error I make. They all talk and it has made it just extremely hard. My last role was in the same industry but was a larger company and you didn't know shit about your teammates. If they were in deep shit or anything that was never disclosed. In this role, Anytime I fuck up or anything everyone knows and talks shit about it. Just makes it fucking hard to keep working my ass off. I do a ton of over the top shit. But all I hear is the negatives and what I can be better at. I am usually fine with it, but lately it has taken a mental toll on me. Then just knowing my entire team knows everything is so embarrassing. Whenever I hope on calls I am just quiet at this point. My confidence is shot. My last role I excelled, was the leader of my team and was very close to my boss and teammates. This role has been such the opposite. I feel like I lack support and any appreciation. I am constantly critiqued and told how I need to be more button up. Then when I speak to others in my role they say they arent doing any of the sales stuff that I am doing and will not do it. I don't understand how nobody acknowledges this.  I try and keep my head up but I am feeling so burnt out and beat. I just feel like I cant quit because it is a good job and the pay is more then I will find at most jobs. I know I need to grow and be better in certain areas. But I feel like there is 0 remorse, empathy and leadership from my team. Just gossiping and knowing they probably talk shit. I just don't know how normal this is and If i better just get used to it.

1h54nz9,Should I quit or stick it out?,"Hi everyone, as the title says I'm debating if it's time I leave my job. I'm a recent college grad (may 2024) and I've been working my current job since July. Long story short: I hate my job. 

The Cons: The work I'm doing isn't intresting, my supervisor is extremely passive aggressive, and one of my coworkers is extremely sexist towards me. I've talked about the sexism with my supervisor, but he basically shrugged it off and said it was ""cultural differences"" and that he would talk to my coworker, but I should be more understanding. I'm required to travel for this job as well, and it's gotten to the point where I'm home every other week it feels like and it's taking a huge toll on my mental health. One of my other coworkers even said to me ""I'm supprised you haven't quit yet, I would have if I were you."" I also don't make overtime, eventhough I work well over 40 hours a week.

The Pros: I'm fresh out of college and I need money. This job pays me well enough that I can pay rent, make student loan payments, and keep a little for savings. I also go this job straight out of college and I'm extremely grateful for it, not many recent grads have had my luck in this job market. Most of my coworkers are actual good and cool people, it's just that the two I dislike the most (my supervisor and the sexist coworker) are the people I have to interact with the most. 

I have enough money saved up that I could quit and job search for about a month, but that's it. I've been toying around with the idea of finding a new job for about a month now, but it's gotten to the point where I need to shit or get off the pot.

1h54fz9,My (formerish) employer is dragging their feet on formalizing my resignation and I'm not sure how to proceed,"Hello all,

In a bit of an odd situation and am not really sure what to do, thanks in advice for anyone who can help.

Basically the situation is this:

Around the end of September I submitted my two weeks' notice of resignation. After talking with my boss and her boss, I learned that the other person who handles the same job as me had themself resigned two hours before me. Since losing both of us at the same time would cause a big problem for them, the company offered me to stay on for a while longer with the following conditions: my salary would be 1.5x multiplied for this time, I would work remotely the full time, and I would qualify for the year end bonus.

I agreed to these terms, however, shortly after noticed that we had not actually finalized my date of departure in writing. We had verbally said November 29th during the meeting, but it was not included in the summary. When I spoke to our department VP about this a few days later, he said that he was not sure whether November 29th would be enough to qualify for the year-end bonus, and it might need to be December 6th, but he'd have to talk to some people to be certain.

The clock kept ticking as I trained new people to take over the job and slowly passed on my responsibilities to others. I followed up with the VP on this issue of the final date several times - on our Teams chat, in person, and on personal phone texting. Every time I got the same answer, that somebody important to this discussion was traveling or out of office and it needed to wait.

Now the 29th date that we originally set has gone and past. As far as my direct manager and coworkers and customers are concerned, I'm gone. I'm not doing any work. But I still don't think my resignation is actually formalized. I still have access to my email and Teams and all our company systems. Nobody has asked me to hand in my company laptop. I never received an answer on the question of whether I need to stay on until Nov. 29 or Dec. 6 in order to receive the bonus. I wouldn't be surprised if they send me another paycheck in a couple weeks.

And now this VP has not answered any of my messages all day on the topic...

Not sure what to do here, but it's got me very annoyed.",barney-sandles,2,1.0,7,1733170285,2024-12-02 20:11:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h54fz9/my_formerish_employer_is_dragging_their_feet_on/,12,2024

1h548vo,Conflicted on which career path to take Biotechnology Undergrad,"TL;DR: I am a Biotechnology B.S. third-year undergraduate student currently on track for an accelerated 5-year master's track. I'm conflicted about whether to stay in science or move to Physician's Assistant school. 

  
I am an undergraduate Biotechnology third-year undergraduate student currently on track to graduate in the spring of 2026 and get my Master's in biotech in spring 2027. I keep looking around the job market for biochemistry/biotech-related jobs and it isn't looking too great. I have no interest in staying in academia long term and the industry seems to be in a hiring freeze post-COVID. I have worked at my local hospital on orthopedics under my EMT-basic license for just under two years, and I was originally planning on attending medical school after I graduate, however, I think I may be just a little too burned out to go straight to MD right now. 

I am in a synthetic biochemistry lab working on pharmaceutical analogs for cancer, and I find it incredibly interesting- I just don't know how viable it is to continue in this field long-term. I am fully independent financially of my family for multiple reasons, but with that, I work full time while also attending school full time. I don't know how viable graduate school would be for me in Biotechnology, especially considering the low career opportunities that I am seeing currently. 

I am fulfilled by my job at the hospital, and I intuitively understand practical medicine and I think that PA school would be a safer and more financially viable option for my future. It would comfortably pay the bills and allow me to pay off the debt that I have accrued in my undergrad while doing something that I like. 

I am conflicted on whether I should give up my research for a comfortable path in medicine or stay in research and struggle for the foreseeable future.

1h545cq,Looking for a new chapter away from Tech Support.,"I’m considering going into sales specifically SAAS.	

I have been working in tech support for SAAS international companies for a decade. I have enough technical skills to be able to learn the majority of SAAS quickly. However, I am getting tired of solving people’s problems and seeing people as “problems”. I genuinely enjoy helping others and I have the “give you the shirt off my back” midwestern mentality, but after a decade I’m looking for something new. I’m tired of Zendesk, I’m tired of doing upgrades or having to solve the same problem over and over again.	

I recently joined a new organization this year (now at 7 months) and I thought this would be enough to shake myself into caring about my career, but I find myself once again just a “technical support” team member with only a 5k bump and significantly more stress. This organization is very kind and my boss is amazing, but I can’t find the drive that I used to have.	

I have been attending conventions/expos to represent the organization as our North American team is small, and I enjoyed the experience. I enjoy meeting new people and giving them a demonstration of the product. I enjoyed building a relationship with the potential “new” client. I cannot wait for the next event next year. This was one of the highlights of my year.	

In previous positions, I have always been front and center in doing the onboarding of clients and technical demos. I enjoy educating clients on the product and features. I excel in taking extremely technical topics and breaking them down into simple understandable concepts. I enjoy working with clients and engaging with them on a first-name basis. I believe this is what sets my technical support skills separate from my peers; clients or customers will always call and request to work with me for my skills, my simplistic lingo, and my working relationships.	I have a good reputation at my most recent previous organization however they are not hiring at this time. I do not want to go back to my old organization for technical support however I have an excellent relationship with the sales team as I would be the go-to guy to fix any issues encountered during demos or a negotiation. I was able to recover several accounts by my relationship and technical skill to save the company money.	I really want 2025 to be my last year in technical support and move on to something new. I’m now in my 30’s and the idea of doing another decade of technical support is not something I look forward to doing. There is a substantial pay difference between a regional sales director and a tech support manager, which motivated me to look into switching careers and changing my goal for the next 5 years.	  
I live in the suburbs outside of Chicago and I have a work-from-home setup. I am also flexible in my work environment but working from home/remote/hybrid is far better than commuting to Chicago. 

I have an associate's degree and no sales experience to put on a resume but I interview extremely well. I’m not looking for a lot of money; 60K should be enough to cover my living expenses. From my research, it appears I need to start a career in sales as an SDR which will involve a lot of cold calling. I would like to understand more what I’m getting into; I do not want to jump into an untenable position. 	

  
Any guidance on what the industry really looks like; how to get started and avoid as much of the meat grinder as possible?

1h53fg2,How should I address this situation with my future employer?,"Hi Redditors, any advice will be greatly appreciated.

My future employer has been very enthusiastic about employing me after my validation. They would respond to my emails very rapidly and send information on the same day, even after work hours. I remember being bombarded when I was working with my previous employer, with interviews, meeting invites, unprompted calls, etc.  
That changed the day I signed the contract.

So, first, please note that my prospective employer is in another country that requires visa.

(1) During the many calls that I had with them, they mentioned starting an online training in September. That didn't happen. I didn't want to sound difficult, so I ignored it.

(2) We agreed that I was going to a different country, which was my preferred choice, but then they rerouted me to a new country. They didn't ask for my opinion, just assigned me a project there, and I had to go with it, to not ""sound difficult"" again.

(3) They mentioned the possibility of going to Europe through different countries (where they have offices). So, they made it seem easy and fast.

(4) I declined an internship with a very prestigious company for them, and I had them know. (I used it to accelerate the process and to negotiate the salary)

I ignored all of it and I focused on getting my Visa application ready. Unfortunately, my visa got rejected on the last day of September. I sent them an email mentioning what happened, and they answered that it was weird, and that's it. They disappeared after, without suggesting anything.

They ignored every attempt to reach them, to the point, I thought they were cancelling my contract. I really was very anxious, and my mental health was going downhill. Then, after 20 days of follow ups, I received a message saying that I'll be contacted next week. and we started the whole process of obtaining visa all over again (work permit re-issuance first, which hasn't been granted until the present moment.)

Now, we're in December, I left my previous employer in August (A. because my notice period is 3 months and I couldn't wait until visa is granted, B. because I had the other opportunity in another country) I feel like they wasted three months of my time, and they were pretty passive. I want to have a conversation with them about this whole mess. How should I approach it?

PS: Please note that I can't lose this opportunity as I'm out of work and with 3 months of unemployment already it's harder to find a job abroad again",Ok_Memory9274,1,1.0,0,1733167815,2024-12-02 19:30:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h53fg2/how_should_i_address_this_situation_with_my/,12,2024

My fiancee of six years broke it off with me last month, and I've been thinking of doing something dramatic to get my mind right. Something where I can get off the grid and just work, read books, exercise, get good experience, and make good money to pay off my student loans. Ideally for only a year or two.

Working on an oil rig fits the bill, except I'd rather not get invested in a (hopefully) dying industry. Having a structured day, focusing on work, and coming home with a big check sounds really nice though.

The Air Force is also very appealing, but four years is too long for me. I'm already 26 and I really wanted to be settled with kids by 30. Plus I really don't want my work to harm people, so the defense industry is off the table too. Maybe Peace Corps?

1h4zyy7,"Applying for grad school, not sure whether to back out","Hi there,

I graduated college last fall (in psychology) and decided to move abroad to Germany to au pair for a year before going back to grad school. I've been having a great time living in a completely new culture and learning the language.

While I've been here, I have also been applying for MSWs back at home for the fall 2025-2026 application cycle. Before I moved, I was so sure about this degree and excited to become an LCSW in order to start my own private therapy practice. I felt relieved, I finally figured out what I wanted to do after school.

However, after living in Germany for the past three months, I am starting to fall in love with living in Europe. It is relatively cheaper and I feel healthier mentally and physically living in a city centered around people. I have citizenship in the EU, so I could technically go to school here as well. The problem is, if I get my master's here in psychology or something similar, my degree would most likely not be valid back home (unless I did something adjacent, like a master's in public health). The same thing is true in the US: If I get my master's there and end up wanting to move back to Europe, I will likely need to get another master's. I am just not sure whether I want to move back to the US right now or not, and I feel like my job options are slim with just a bachelor's in psychology so I feel pressure to go to grad school soon for financial reasons. I also have done so much research on the MSW career path in the US and there is comfort in knowing exactly what I can do with it/what to expect.

I will need to make a decision about the MSW by spring of next year. I feel like time is moving by so fast and I am not sure where I'll end up, so investing time and energy into a master's that may ""lock"" me into a particular country makes me anxious. One thing I do know for sure is my passion lies in psychology and mental health.

Our manager has been pushing us to take on more tasks which we wouldn't normally get involved with. I was fine with this as I had capacity and like learning new things but it's becoming a lot of work. On top of this we're being encouraged across the company to go through Lean (finding ways of improving processes). So it's a lot of extra tasks and no reward. One of my Co workers has really taken to this which is great. She seems to enjoy improving things however it's gotten to the point where everything, and I mean everything, has been updated or changed by her and it's doing my head in. She's become the default for questions on changes and on a new spreadsheet tracker she's created (more work, yay) which I find so tedious. I'm aware I'm probably envious and I need to focus on how I can get better at my job but I resent that the goal posts of my job keep changing. It's not enough to do the extra work and projects because my Co worker has done more. To add to this I'm never loved the job to begin with and I've been really struggling to motivate myself to do the bare minimum (I get about 18 months into a job and lose all motivation). There was a meeting last week where said Co worker essentially highlighted all the things I hadn't done on this tracker list and it felt so undermining. My manager always has positive feedback but then I feel like she's not that involved in my day to day. I think my old manager used to manage the dynamic better but the new managers love her so it's hard to raise as an issue.

1h4yffe,I'm worried about my future career if I stay at my current job,"Hello everyone, I'm a 26-year-old male with an engineering background. I currently work at a construction company as an administrator. My job primarily involves handling documents, which can be frustrating because I feel like I'm not gaining any valuable experience for my future career.

The issue is that my company does not have its own workers; we always use subcontractors for projects. This also applies to any fabrication or repair projects, which are done by the subcontractors in their own workshops.

What bothers me is that I don’t know much about the reality of the projects—how they are carried out, what needs to be done, and so on. Additionally, my boss rarely asks me to go to the site—only once or twice a month. When I do go, he mainly wants me to watch the work and prevent subcontractors from going directly to the client. While on-site, I often feel like I don’t know anything, and it gets awkward when clients ask me technical questions. Some subcontractors seem to underestimate me when they realize my knowledge is limited.

Right now, I primarily handle paperwork and reporting, without understanding how the actual work is done. I believe that if my company had its own workers and workshop, I would be able to learn directly and gain more experience, which would help me grow.

Should I start looking for another job, or this is just my disappointment about my career progress?

Thank you, everyone, and I apologize for my limited English.",imperianousw,1,1.0,2,1733155642,2024-12-02 16:07:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h4yffe/im_worried_about_my_future_career_if_i_stay_at_my/,12,2024

Currently work as a structural analyst at a contractor for the primes doing defense and spaceflight work. For a variety reasons I have been looking to leave the company and find a new role. Overall I love the work I do, just not the employer or people making decisions.

I happened to land a job at a major bicycle company as a structural analyst doing very similar work. I'd be working closely with the pro team that races the Tour de France and it'd be a lot of composites and dynamic analysis experience to engineer frames/wheels/etc. and the complete bike.

As a huge cyclist myself this seems like one of those gigs I have to try for a few years or I'd kick myself. Long term, I do see myself returning to aerospace, especially as this job will need relocation and I'd eventually like to return to where I'm currently at to be closer to family/etc. (Seattle area).

For anyone whose been involved in the hiring process or has other insight, does this seem like a silly idea? Could a few years stint doing work at a bike company be seen as a negative or hinder my ability to return into aerospace?",throwaway92829294747,1,1.0,0,1733154890,2024-12-02 15:54:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h4y4kl/returning_to_career_area_after_role_in_a/,12,2024
1h4xujv,I have two offers for a Spring internship and am undecided.,"Hello everyone! Looking for some advice on what I should do for an upcoming spring internship.

Some context on my situation:  
I'm a senior studying Computer Science and have accepted a summer internship offer at a reputable company with a high full-time conversion rate.

I've received two offers for the spring, which I'm open to considering, but I'm undecided. Here are the two options:

**1. Large tech company:**  
**Pros:**

* Competitive pay, good intern events, and likely better work-life balance.
* I know a few other interns joining the program.

**Cons:**

* The company recently went through layoffs, which might affect the work vibes.
* I’m not particularly interested in working there full-time unless it’s my last option.

**2. Startup (Series B):**  
**Pros:**

* The engineering manager has offered mentorship, and I believe I’ll learn a lot.
* Smaller team means potential for impactful contributions.

**Cons:**

* Small team (\~8 engineers) might mean a heavier workload and more responsibility.
* Lower pay compared to the larger tech company.
* No prior intern program, so there might be less structure.

**My Thoughts:**  
For the larger company, I’m drawn to the structured internship experience, recognition on my resume, and the chance to network with other interns.

For the startup, I’m excited about the potential to grow and learn from a mentor, but I’m concerned about the lack of structure and the possibility of delaying progress if I get stuck.

I’d love advice on how to weigh these options or if there’s anything I haven’t considered.",BootedBrito,2,1.0,0,1733154171,2024-12-02 15:42:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h4xujv/i_have_two_offers_for_a_spring_internship_and_am/,12,2024
1h4xte7,Is this a toxic work environment?,"I work for an agency and it's definitely a start up. Since I've worked here, I've experienced some things that are definitely toxic and unproductive. For one, they make everyone CC our manager on emails and have recently threatened to write people up if they don't do this. They claim there is no micromanaging and it's not to breathe down our necks, but it doesn't feel that way. Another thing that happens is that we all have our bandwidths stretched so thin. A lot of us work 50-60 hours per week at 23 years old in marketing while ""upper management"" has no clients and im not sure what they do on a day to day basis. There is no transparency as they'll hire random people without consulting anyone else. Finally one person finally quit and the founder couldn't have been more disrespectful about it and this was someone who devoted their entire waking hours to this company. We also have a lot of team meetings where they talk to us in a scolding voice and like we are children saying that this is ""unacceptable"" and that they're sick of our mistakes. We don't make many if any mistakes. I'm demanded to do way more out of my job description with zero extra pay, they make decisions that don't make sense and they don't seem to know much about how a marketing agency works let alone how to run one.

I'm asking if this would be considered toxic or not normal to an agency like this one. I understand start ups are supposed to be challenging but this one is more challenging on a mental and mental health level. I'm terrified to take a lunch break, I'm so scared to make a mistake and we get in so much trouble for making a mistake or for a client's unhappiness and there is no processes or documents that show what we have to do or what the processes are that we keep getting in trouble for.",irish-pumpkin17,1,1.0,1,1733154088,2024-12-02 15:41:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h4xte7/is_this_a_toxic_work_environment/,12,2024

1h4wgbk,How to get into the UX field from my current position ,"I want to transition from Finance to UX Design. However, there are a couple factors that make my situation unique. 1. I do not have a degree, 2. I work in the Finance field but in a service/support role. My first position was assisting clients/financial advisors, my current role is account maintenance processing at a broker-dealer. Approx. 4 years of experience. 3. I'm 23, want to transition to a creative field and need to make a decision on how I will do that soon. 

I'm currently taking night classes, with plans on transferring to a 4 year uni that has a BS/MS 5 year program in UX design, but that would be a full-time commitment and I would only be able to work part-time. I need advice on if I should go to this program get my degree and transition that way, or if I should look to get a UX certification and apply to jobs.


My main reason for transitioning is wanting to be in a creative field and also getting paid more. My salary is okay for where I am now, but nowhere near enough to accommodate the lifestyle I want for the future. From my own research most people in this field have at minimum of an associates degree or, bachelors. People who have transitioned from a non-related major have to UX got an online UX certification or gone to a UX boot camp 
to get the skills they are missing to transition the field. For the BS/MS program at the uni in my state it's not eligible for students to get their associates degree first and then transfer. Also this program as co-ops, about 3. So I will get professional work experience in the field while earning this degree.

 Are there any other paths I have not considered or does this sound like the best plan? I don't want to get a UX online certification with my current work experience and then get paid less compared to other candidates because I don't have a degree. I knew nothing about Finance when I got into the field, but learned much over the years. Does my demonstrated learning skills mean anything to employers?

1h4sr62,Accept permanent role or new offer from another company?,"I know the classic ‘should I accept counter offer or new offer’ has been discussed to death, but my current situation is a little different.

I am about to complete my contract term, and deciding between accepting permanent conversion or new offer from another company. I made my desire to be made permanent known early on in my contract term, but all communication until recently was that it wasn’t possible due to budget constraints and leadership not wanting to increase headcount. My role is project based, but with an outlook of around 10 years of continuous work load. My direct manager was supportive but it was out of his hands. 

Because of this, I let them know I would need to explore other opportunities. This resulted in my current company aggressively working with HR and senior management to obtain approval to convert me to permanent. I understand the usual advice is you shouldn’t accept counter offers, but I believe this situation is a little different given that I was on contract and was not leveraging a pay rise. 

Assume both roles are similar in terms of renumeration, benefits and flexibility, with my current role offering more interesting work. Question is, would it be OK to accept the permanent offer?  Or does the advice of not accepting counter offers still stand? I have a good relationship with my line manager.

1h4sdbf,How to deal with previous company's threat of sabotaging my next opportunity?,"Hello, so I (25f) was working at a starter for the past 1 year 10 months and joined as a designer. Last month in November my previous company told me suddenly that they need to let me go and give me reasons like their probably outsourcing the work. They were mainly cost cutting and asked more people to forcefully resign. I was not even given full 30 days to serve as my notice period. I was asked to leave early by 21days. The company has a pattern of doing this to their employers and I am aware this has happened to many other people in the past. I was fine with the shortened notice period too but during this time they did not let me take wfh. I came to office everyday but I let my manager know that I will be leaving a bit early by an hour which he was okay with.  Now, on my last day they hired a fresher to replace me and forced me to give kt to her even though I was in a hurry. My fnf statement came where they have deducted my salary by a huge amount based on LOPS Which I never applied. I was present in office but now they are denying it. The hr said that my manager said I was not present even though he was wfh for a week or more. He was himself not in office. I went to office everyday and talked to hr about this. Now, she is threatening me that they will create problems for me in future if I say anything. Please help me out how to deal with this. This was my first job and I worked a lot. I was anyway in mental distress of how they dealt with everything and now I am worried they will create problems. Even though they are clearly wrong here. There are many other things they have done which are toxic and unfair. I am in final round with a company which is quite good and dont want to ruin my chances because of some wrong feedback my previous company might give. I let hr know what is unfair and asked her to relook into this and let me know. I am planning to accept and sign whatever fnf they give next. But is there anything I should be cautious of or any tips in general how to deal with this would help me a lot right now.

1h4rhgw,I need some insights and clarity on my situation. ,"Hi everyone! 

I’m 24yo, currently working in Commercial Project Management at an MNC in India for the last 2 years, and I need some clarity for a career switch. 

I’ve done my engineering in Computer Science but never worked full time in any CS associated role, I’m currently thinking if I should switch/ get a technical course done to move into technical PM/ get PMP certified since I have about 3 years of PM associated experience/ do an MBA(worried about this option because the job market is pathetic and securing a job after investing huge amount in MBA sounds very very risky)/ do an online MBA?

I’m open to switching completely into a technical role too, but idk where and what to start with. 

Could anyone of you help me get some insights? Has anyone or does anyone of you know anyone undergoing/ undergone a similar path?

My reason for this switch is, I’m not satisfied with the work I’m doing, my long term goal is to get into core project management and eventually get into CXO/ corporate leadership roles. 

I’m open to suggestions, questions, any insights whatsoever.

1h4qdmr,Disliking my new job ,"I started a new job three months ago. I got a promotion to another Government department. I mainly left my old team because there wasn't a lot of opportunity due to uncertainty at positions higher than mine and I was tired of waiting for flow-on effects to trickle down. I liked the team and the work but I wanted a higher paying role. So I took the new opportunity. I don't enjoy it. There's no real training or induction process that is specific to our team, aside from the wider general Department training. Documented processes and procedures for our tasks and work portfolio are non-existent. The team is very cliquey and don't seem to like me. The managers are either micromanaging or ignoring me completely (I know that sounds contradictory but it's true. I can't accrue 15min of unpaid overtime without prior approval. At my old Department I could accrue 30min a day. I go for several days or weeks without any sort of check in from my manager because they are never in the office). I'm neurodivergent and I need clear instruction and direction, but I don't get that and so I feel like everything I do is wrong and I am constantly being asked to explain and justify what I do. I nearly cried in a team meeting today because I was put on the spot about something I am working on (it's a large team and I'm not a public speaker) and I froze. I feel like I just don't gel with this team or understand the work and I feel I've made a big mistake in leaving. I've since found out there are new opportunities at the same level back at my old Department and I have applied. Does anyone have any advice on how to approach my current manager about this? I did not talk to her before I applied as it was a very last-minute decision and she hasn't been around to talk to. It's going to be a difficult conversation and I am disappointed in myself because I feel like I have wasted everyone's time going through a recruitment process for a role that I don't enjoy.",Pure-Philosopher-175,1,1.0,1,1733127853,2024-12-02 08:24:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h4qdmr/disliking_my_new_job/,12,2024

However, on Saturday, I received a message asking me to come to the office on Monday. Now, my manager is trying to convince me to stay.

1h4q6cg,I made a career resource directory for Michigan—would this help in your state?,"Hi everyone!

I’m a native Detroiter and lifelong Michigander who’s always had a tough time navigating career development and job training opportunities in our state. The information is scattered, often hyper-regional, and buried in clunky government websites. If you don’t live in a specific area or know the right people, you can easily miss out on amazing resources.

So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a Career Development Directory specifically for Michigan. It’s a free, easy-to-use tool where you can search and filter resources by region and tags.

This started as a personal project to organize resources for myself, but the more I built it, the more I realized how helpful it could be for others. It’s still evolving, and I plan to keep updating it as I learn about more opportunities.

I’d love to get your feedback, especially if you’re in Michigan—does something like this sound useful to you? Also, for those in other states: Do you think a tool like this would help people navigate resources where you live?

If you’ve got suggestions, ideas, or examples of similar tools, I’d love to hear about them! And if you’re curious about the directory itself, I’m happy to share more details.

Let’s work together to make career resources more accessible for everyone. 🙌",Derienshawn21,1,1.0,1,1733126949,2024-12-02 08:09:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h4q6cg/i_made_a_career_resource_directory_for/,12,2024
1h4q553,Good salary but a lot of red flags,"I was contacted by a person on LinkedIn for a job at a company. We had a brief interview over the phone and scheduled a meeting over Zoom with other people at the company. The interview went well, after that interview we had another and they offered me the position. This is where the red flags.

In the interview I was asked what were my salaey expectations. In the last interview where they offered me the position they however said that they would offer me a 3 month contract with a salary 15% lower than what I requested, however if everything went okay and they were satisfied with my performance I would sign a permanent contract with the increase in salary to my requested one. In the interviews I did before for this position everyone requested I either do a task they give me or show one I did during my work before, in this case they didn't. Seems like an easy way do weed out candidates that don't satisfy your needs as a company.

Apart from that, they don't have a website their LinkedIn is 8 months old as well as their instagram. The company has existed since July 2023.

Looking for advice. The money is good, but it's not worth it if they don't sign me after 3 months.

1h4o0sv,Switching from dentistry to IT. Need advice. Want to move abroad eventually. ,"Long post: 
I’m 23F, currently doing my internship at my dental college. Owing to the age old lore of the oppressed asian kid, I never wanted to be a doctor, I don’t do well with people and don’t like dealing with them, plus I love working in the background. The only interest I developed in this field was with maxillofacial prostheses but the road is long and arduous and I’m not that crazy about it either, also can’t handle another 3 years of something I’ve hated for the last 4 years. 

I’ve spent an embarrassingly large amount of time looking at different options, everything from research to MBA and side gigs like blogging and stuff so I know about the possibilities. 

I’ve always been interested in CS tho, did the very basics of coding (java, SQL, HTML) in high school but nothing after that. I’ve been looking at masters in health informatics and healthcare data analytics and have found a few of them in India and abroad and feel pretty confident about pursuing it. 

I’m mainly looking at one healthcare analytics MBA here in India with a curriculum that pretty much aligns with what I’m hoping to gain from this degree. 

I’ve recently (about a week since writing this) started learning python and blender from YouTube and am looking to start with SQL. I’m also trying to learn math (started with 10th grade, looking to do algebra, statistics, probability and calculus), though I don’t get a lot of time to invest in everything, I try my best. 

My goals (hoping to achieve these by oct-nov-dec 2025):

1. Learn python as best as I can (looking to complete the CS50 courses from Harvard) 

2. Learn enough SQL to do the very basic data analysis tasks (no idea what those could be) 

3. Build an impressive art portfolio (mainly with 3D modelling and medicine related renders) 

4. Write the IELTS exam

5. Write the CAT exam (need it for the data analytics MBA I’m looking at) 

6. Maybe write the GRE (I’ve heard you need it to apply for masters abroad, but the universities I’ve looked at don’t explicitly state they need it expect for one in Germany which I’m not too keen on anyways) 

Apart from all of this I’m also working on creating a blog (still in the construction phase) that basically will act as an online journal documenting my switch (if and when I happen to make it). 

Hopefully most people have read this post through, I need all and any advice I can get. 

-Whether it is about if the switch is a good idea, if I’m on the right track? 

-If I should do my masters in India, get some work experience and then move abroad or just try for a masters abroad. 

-What are some other options that align with these interests(IT and Blender - 3D stuff) 

-especially if there’s anyone who’s done the same thing or is looking to do something like this, the insight and action plan would be greatly appreciated. 

I’m honestly really confused on how to approach everything, especially looking at all the CS majors crying about unemployment and everything (with AI taking over I guess), and also if I’ll even be able to get into a masters in the field given my purely medical/dental background.

1h4nuqt,Too broad skillset for todays Software Job Market?,"I have a non-traditional resume. I have a PhD in mechanical engineering and spent a decade developing engineering-specific software. With the 3D printing industry down, I’m exploring other options. Over the last two years, I worked at a couple of startups (partially on paternity leave). Living in Atlanta.

**My skills (not ranked by expertise):**

* **Full Stack:** React, .NET, AWS (2 years). I can build simple websites and handle most AWS tasks for development and maintenance.
* **DevOps:** Part-time Linux sysadmin for 3 years in a university lab. Good with Ansible and CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.
* **Backend:** 2 years of .NET experience, including designing multi-layer libraries and using dependency injection. Developed specialized socket communication for robotics.
* **Hardcore Engineering:** 3 years of C++, 2 years of Fortran. I’ve done parallel computing (single/multi-core).
* **Math & Data Science:** Strong in math/stats (thanks to my PhD and postdoc) with experience in ML projects.
* **3D Graphics:** Extensive experience in CAD and 3D meshing.
* **CS Fundamentals:** Solid understanding of computational complexity and code optimization (needed for intense computational problems). Not great at coding puzzles, though.
* **Product design and startups :** Cofounded couple of startups. One acquired with decent success another two failed in last two years.
* **Hardware**: Have hands on experience working on robots. 3D printers. Experimental research, hands on 3d manufacturing, material science a bit because my phd was on metal 3d printing.

I’m planning to re-enter the job market in 3 months. While I know a lot of things a typical engineer might not, I feel underprepared—mostly because startups and academia didn’t require hyper-specialization (e.g., being *really* good at .NET).

What should I focus on improving over the next three months? Any advice is appreciated!

For the past four years, I was under the supervision of 8 Senior Manager due to some restructure. The restructure was more on alignment of budget and I have been supporting same client ever since. Needless to say, the client was happy with my performance as I am getting 9/10 satisfaction quarterly.

My dilemma started when my Senior Manager resigned (whom I have great working relationship with). And because the client has to be build for the senior role, they looked for someone within the organization a replacement.

Coincidentally, someone from other vertical also tendered a resignation from Manager post. In order to keep this person, our Associate Director offered the Senior Manager post in my account which that person accepted.

I've been working with the new Senior Manager for over five months now and but we never really gel together. His management style is more of a micromanager, he forbids me to explore solutions and instructed me to not reach out to my internal stakeholders and client as its affecting his own relationship building. (I told him this is quite a big adjustment but I will have to bend to accommodate him).

After five months, I can no longer stand his caprices so I looked for opportunity elsewhere. When I got the job offer, I planned on submitting my notification Friday but to my surprise I was notified that   he also tendered his resignation Thursday (a day prior to my plan).

Regardless, I still proceeded with my goal and submitted my papers. The problem is all Senior Leaders (up to Senior Directors) within the organization have been asking me not to resign and promised me the role of Senior Manager after five months (once I complete the residency period in my current role of Manager as the company require one year residency).

  
Now I am conflicted. Should I pursue the managerial post in the new company and take the job offer or stay with my current company (they are willing to provide salary adjustment similar to what I was offered outside)?

Job A is an accounting position that is hospital/physician focused and responsibilities include billing and month end procedures which include posting transactions, processing jobs, reconciliations, proving support, and analyzing data.

Job B is a payroll/accounting specialist position. It involves processing payroll and minimal accounting like reconciliations. 

I am asking what job to take because I am unsure what would be the best move and am going back and forth. 
Although I haven’t processed payroll before, I watched videos and have a general idea of what it involves and think I would definitely enjoy it more than full on accounting role and would be a better fit for me. Is payroll a good career to get into? I was thinking of getting some payroll experience and then hopefully get my CPP and then advancing my career that way? 

Is that stupid of me though? The full accounting job pays about $7k more annually and is also 30 mins closer to me than the payroll job. Also the payroll job is hourly, but it still equates to $7k less. 
Would I be missing out on an opportunity that probably has more potential for growth? I think I am comparing my audit experience to what this accounting job will be like and am scared of my mental health going down again. I know the responsibilities will be different, so I am wondering if I would regret not taking that job bc what if I like this new side of accounting? Like I said before I also think I lack some general accounting knowledge but also don’t know if i’m being too hard on myself and focusing too much on the negative bc i did get promoted and did a good job for the most part.

So yeah to sum it up, I am almost certain I would enjoy payroll more as a career, but am unsure if it would be worth it given the other job is $7k more and seems more “professional.” Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.

1h4j3lx,When to jump ship?,"Approximately 6 months ago, I was hired to help start a brand new company. My State license was needed to run the business and to get final approval by the State. Doors opened for business about 3 months ago. As time continues, I can tell this business is not going to make it. I was snowed a bit and told that these were a wealthy couple and they had the means and they knew their way around self-employment. The owners are not equipped with the experience or the finances to run this business. Although I was hired to help make this business happen, I am not a true business expert nor can I squeeze money from nothing to run the day to day. 

The further we go, the bigger the deficit grows. The negative balances and creditors owed continues to mount.

My reimbursement tickets have gone completely ignored. I cant spend anymore money on this company.  

We also have staff. I'm afraid every pay period that someone's paycheck will bounce. My requests for supplies are usually ignored and I have to make sure and ask earlier than normal because it takes longer than a typical Amazon delivery cycle. 

I'm paid very well. I even offered to step down and let them hire someone at a lower rate than me, with different credentials, and maybe help their business differently. This was not accepted or taken seriously. I've tried to open their eyes where changes could be made.

My question is: When should I find a new job? At this rate I know this will fail and I will be held responsible and if they aren't listening to my suggestions...maybe they really shouldn't have this business at all.

1h4h1nh,"20, Associates Degree, Living Abroad - Advice Needed","Hey, I'm a 20 year old American living abroad in Spain. Always been interested in living in Europe, so I took pretty much the first chance I could to move out. I'm now here on a government contract working in some schools as an assistant teacher. I enjoy it, but the pay is rather minimal and I'm worried about the fact that I may not be properly advancing my life in the direction I want.  
I previously worked in a semiconductor manufacturing position. The workload was mind-numbing and soul crushing, so that's why I left. I was able to get my associates degree during my senior year of high school. I took a few classes in digital marketing, front-end web development, and sociology at some local universities after I graduated. I guess the idea was that I was attracted to technology and design, or art, and thought that these skills could perhaps enable me to function better within in a technological field, especially entrepreneurially. I think the synthesis between the humanities and technology is quite beautiful. At my high school graduation, my future major was listed as ""audio engineering"", that's something I'm also interested in, and another example of this fusion of art and technology. 

I read more books than anyone I know, but they're usually about random topics that might require like, 6 years of school before my opinions are important or respected (design, psychoanalysis, cybernetics). This has been invaluable to me, but it's not really something you can list on a resume. Is that something that should even be in my mind? 

   
I was able to save a decent amount from my semiconductor job. Probably about 1-3 years of living expenses (it's not so much, but during that time I also taught myself to live extremely frugally). 

As I hope you can see evidenced by the early graduation and the self-education, I have no fear of hard work. I do have fear of unrealized potential - I recognize that that anxiety is causing my current problem. I am exploding with energy, and I need some type of a funnel to direct my energy towards on a long timescale. I can face hard work, but I cannot seem to bare bureacracy. I love art but want to be realistic about what I can achieve financially with it. I think another part of my difficulty is the huge amount of decisions I could make regarding schools, career choice, and country. I don't want to be a loser. I see so many of my peers wildly underdeveloped, going broke in a random degree they don't care about like ""Supply Chain Management"", occasionally posting on social media about how silly their classes are. 

Any ideas for a person with so many ideas?

1h4fzlm,Expecting Multiple Offers - Torn,"I work in a pretty niche field. 

Background:
My current job is 100% remote, can work from anywhere in the lower 48 just have to be available PST hours and attend some Teams meetings. There isn’t any time clock or online monitoring time. 160k per year. 

My issue - I work for a consulting company and the project I’m contracted on hasn’t renewed the project. They keep extending it 1-2 months at a time and the company the project is for got a new CEO that’s shaking things up. I’m confident that if I was an employee I’d be fine because of my niche but I’m not sure about my consulting company and our contract - there are 20 other people who aren’t as niche as I am under the same contract. 

Because of the uncertainty I started looking a couple weeks ago. This can totally be a J2 situation. 

Company 1 - Had an open job, I applied directly. No referral or anything. They’re a major company in the industry and a national outfit. They called me the day after my application to interview me. Interview went exceptionally well, they said I gave the best answer they’ve ever gotten about KPIs and metrics. During the interview they referenced Company 2 to ask if was familiar with them based on where I had work, company 2 is very regional. I said yes, I actually know the owner and have his personal number in my phone from past work. One of my references told me that the person who called him essentially said I got the job and checking references was a formality. This role is heavy travel but fairly autonomous. There’s tons of downtime during the day in this role. 

Company 2 - Has the region locked down. Actually also has a Company 3 that works in conjunction with Company 2. Very related and niche work. Nobody tries to break in to his geographic area. He’s essentially one of the best in the industry. I emailed company 2’s generic contact my resume unsolicited around the same time I applied to Company 1. About 6-7 hours after finishing my interview with Company 1 the owner of Company 2/3 called me directly. They’ve got huge plans and tons of work coming up and he thinks the timing is great. It was him and his VP on the line. Super casual like a guaranteed vibe. He’s older, if I had to guess he’s mid-upper 60s now if not older. I met him when I was green at 24, I’m 41 now. 

I’m expecting both to contact me this week. My reference from Company 1 told me they talked about bringing me in for a face to face. Company 2/3 said the same thing when he called. 

Here’s the kicker - I could do either of these and STILL do my current job without issue and there isn’t even a conflict because of the specifics of the relative projects and geographic locations. 

Pay for these 2 should be similar, COL is higher by a lot with 2/3. A little less than what I’m making now but I’m super curious about succession planning with Company 2/3 because I don’t recall him or his wife ever mentioning children and I never met any during my interactions with those companies off and on over the years.

1h4fbxf,SLP in Australia? ,"Hi, I'm a 25-year-old living in Brisbane. I originally studied a Bachelor of Health Science (Nutrition) and then studied Music. Over the years, I’ve completed around 15 short courses, hoping to improve my resume. Despite my efforts, I’ve never worked a professional job and have been stuck in hospitality since I was 18, juggling 2-3 jobs but barely earning $30k annually.

About a year and a half ago, I started working as a private music tutor teaching voice, which felt like a step forward. However, after doing my tax return, I realized I was only making about $5k more than I did in hospitality.

Recently, I applied for a Master’s degree in Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) because the prospect of earning even $50k a year felt like a significant improvement. I believed SLP was a stable, hireable, and flexible career choice. 

But after reading Reddit discussions, I’ve become discouraged by comments describing it as monotonous, repetitive, with limited career progression and a salary cap. I have been told several times that it is not enough money to survive and it is an unreasonable career choice. 

I was declined a spot in the program and then offered a place into the master’s program last week with just two days' before the course started, and now I’m overwhelmed with anxiety about whether I’ve made the right decision. My partner suggests I drop it and consider teaching, and Google keeps pointing me towards engineering or IT, but the forums I read seem to paint a bleak picture of every profession. Teaching appears to pay more, but it also has its own challenges.

I feel stuck. I want a career with opportunities to grow and evolve into new areas.

I’m now questioning my decision and truly cannot handle the toxicity of the founders. 

Recently, an AI leader I know well from my former Big 4 firm reached out to see how I was doing/liking my new role. During our conversation, I shared my struggles, and she offered me a potential senior consultant role in their Generative AI department, focused on Microsoft Copilot implementations. It’s exciting, as I’ve always been intrigued by consulting and love the intersection of AI and client-facing work. But it’s a big shift from my marketing roots.

I’m torn. Could moving into consulting expand my career and open doors in AI and innovation? Or would it close off opportunities in marketing and creative work, which I also love? Should I take the leap, or stick it out at the startup and hope things improve?

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s made a similar transition or has insights into bridging these industries. What are the pros and cons I should weigh?

I started in a high end retirement home as a server associate in Dining when I was finishing college and worked through the pandemic. I was promoted to a manager 5 years in. I left a little over 3 years later for a job as manager at another facility for 20% more pay. I worked one week there and resigned this morning. After just one week in this place I realized I can't work in food service the rest of my life. I was at the point where I was having panic attacks on a daily basis. Working in this field has also taken a toll on me physically. I have about $9000 saved at the moment, with $8000 also in a joint account with my wife. I have been non stop applying to jobs that are front desk/reception oriented (I have experience here too as I worked reception alongside being a server). I sat down and went over the numbers with my wife before making a final decision, and we will be fine as long as I land something within the month. In one day, I have officially become a student at an online college. I have applied for Fafsa. I plan on fast tracking an accounting degree (I already have a bachelors so most of my general credits will transfer). I just want something steady and I am really good at numbers and computers. I know Fafsa won't apply until the 2025 - 2026 term, but I may be able to take a few classes out of pocket in the winter. I can't shake the feeling I am a failure for quiting, though. I keep telling myself I need to do this to better my/our lives, but part of me feels I should have just stuck through it. But again, I have been ""sticking through it"" and ""toughing it out"" for 8 years and I have nothing to show for it but a ""steady"" paycheck and a truck load of stress/anxiety. Everyone I talk to says they are proud of me for taking that next step to bettering my life and going back to school. I have been talking about going back to school for years. It doesn't seem real that I actually am now. I still feel like I've made a horrible mistake, but I don't know if that's true or if I've just been conditioned to feel this way. I am hoping this feeling will go away with time, as this was a very recent/sudden life change. I need to make this change and go back to school.

1h46myh,Career advice for a 17y/o (m),"I have recently done my IGCSEs and now it's time to choose my subjects in A levels. I have thought of two careers in my mind but having a lot of trouble in deciding which one to opt for. 
1. Computer Sciences 
2. CIMA (Chartered Institute of Management)

I’m stuck between two options and can’t decide which one to pursue because honestly, I’m not passionate about either. Both have great scope in the present and future, provide decent pay, and are equally challenging. Computer Science requires a minimum of 4 years to earn a degree, while CIMA can be completed in 2-5 years and is equivalent to a master’s degree.

For some reason, I’ve never wanted to be part of this rat race. It’s not like I haven’t tried—I’m not one to shy away from hard work. But deep down, I just want to pursue my passion. The problem is, passion won’t pay the bills in the beginning, and I feel stuck.

I have responsibilities now, or if not immediately, they’ll all fall on my shoulders in the next two to three years. Here’s what I genuinely like and want to do—maybe you can guide me better after knowing this.

I’ve always dreamt of having my own business. Not just to earn a decent living but to create jobs and make other people’s lives better. It’s not like I haven’t given it a shot. I’ve tried—tried a lot—and I’ve already seen three businesses fail.

I love creating videos and documenting the moments of my life. I even created a channel and upload occasionally, but it’s still not consistent.
I’ve always wanted to travel the world, but now, all those dreams feel distant, almost unattainable.

I also wanted to marry early, but in this never-ending rat race, I feel like my story will end up just like everyone else’s.

So we build the Control and Protection equipments (usually placed inside substations). So, my team is in charge of the QA, settings and configurations of the relay according to the specs of the substation and site. 

I usually deal with the configuration of the relay for digital substations, where we do configuration of the MMS of the relays and GOOSE subscribe and publish. Set up Ethernet switches. I then do the testing for those relays. Conduct design verifications, drawing mark ups, and Field Acceptance Tests. I also perform auditing for the department. Maintain the equipments calibrations.  

The pay here is decent but the field is very niche. Like if you are good, people will want you. But one person needs to do and know everything. It was interesting, very fun, but the work load and the horrendously short time line is crazy. And especially during the transition between conventional substations to digital substations. Its insane, workload tripled. So much more testing. No one wants to learn it. I liked it. Having someone to learn it with in my department would be nice. But no one wants to learn it. 

So now, I kinda need some advice, I dont think I want to continue this. Its too heavy for one person. I did voice out to my boss but nothing happened. So yeah, Ive been working 80 hrs per month to keep up with the companies demand. Its been 3 months. I forgot what weekends feel like. I can't take breaks anymore.

I dont know what field I can go to after this. My idea was to take a break and take my masters. Not sure in what field. I was thinking MBA cuz Management seems to pay quite good and I could get a better balance I hope, or IT cuz thats the in thing, people say theres too many people already in it, so im unsure or Physics to be a lecturer or researcher, but thers no money there I think. Im lost, I dont know what to do. Currently the company Im in are subcontractors, which gets alot of shit from the maincons and clients. I was considering joining a consultancy.

I’ve been also really into saving, investing, and budgeting recently with my fiancé who has a couple thou wow in debts but since I’m debt free, make stable enough income for ME, and I’m having the mindset of “oh once we pay off her debts(only 5k cards and 12k car not too bad at all with some other people’s lives taken into account)  we can start putting our combined income towards a savings. Seems like the no brainer, we just bought a house and we’re making enough to where we don’t miss payments or are late so overall I’m chilling and at terms with our conundrum, my only thing now is I want to do more. 

I’ve been dog grooming for 7 years and at the same company, goofed by not taking advantage of the 401k they offered once I became full time, made a mistake of dropping to part time, all that’s in the past when we were in our apartment together, I started contributing 6% and with the budgeting been putting weekly $10 investments across 4 different things, still learning about that but I just want to make sure our retirement age will be a lot more bearable because dog grooming has killed my body. 

I’m pretty much at this point willing to do whatever I need for a job that makes me more than 36kish annually without any experience but I’m not sure if getting certificates for local trade jobs, taking out loans and going to CC for at least some type of degree to have more options, or biting the bullet and continue with dog grooming, so many options that seem are going to put me in some financial strain(some more than others) so with this in mind, what would be yalls advice? I’m in lower Alabama so not too much around where I’m parked that isn’t retail and with us just purchasing a house, kind of stuck to this area for a minute",OhyeahhhRS,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1733060241,2024-12-01 13:37:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h43fzq/28m_no_savings_no_debt_no_degree/,12,2024
1h42nxt,Should I leave a job I love for stability?,"I’ve survived three rounds of layoffs at my current company over the past four years. The latest one being a few months ago so I have been applying more agressively this time. The team is great, it’s remote-first (will never be RTO) and I love what I do, but I worry about the company’s long-term stability, especially with my current company being a start up that still relies on investors funding. For further context, I have a newborn at home where I’m the breadwinner, eventhough my spouse works too.

I got an offer from a F500 company for a lateral move with a slight pay bump (14%, from 90k to 102k). It’s hybrid but pretty minimal at 1x/week in the office with a 30-minute commute each way. The boss and director seem great. 

Is it silly to leave a job I love for more stability, even though the new company is only a lateral move with a small pay bump? There havent been layoffs at this company since 2021, but since layoffs happen at big companies too, should I just stay put at my current startup, where I'll probably use up the rest of my 9 lives?

1h409tx,22M second-guessing career choices,"Before I say anything, please respond with kind words; I could use them now. Thank you.  
  
So, in high school, I was good at every subject, and choosing a major was hard for me because of it. I wanted to pursue either programming, medicine, or architecture. After trying to do some programming, I realized it was not for me since I did not have the nerve for it. When it comes to medicine, the length of the studies was too much for me, as well as the work hours. Architecture was the choice I intended to go for, but I learned about graphic design in the meantime and went for it.  
  
As a kid I always enjoyed art. I also loved researching and learning about a lot of things so I thought this was the right career for me. Keep in mind, it was also COVID, so I thought pursuing a career that can be done remotely is perfect.  
  
Fast forward, I finish my bachelor's degree and I realize the job market is horrible. So, I decided to pursue a master's degree part-time whilst looking for jobs. I chose digital marketing since it complemented my bachelor’s well, and decided to learn programming in the meantime so I can combine all three and switch around fields (if needed).  
  
The reason I chose digital marketing is because I want to be a project or product manager. But, after studying it, I realized I hated it. I like the job, but I hate the intent behind it. It is just throwing shit at people in hopes of it sticking and it feels like a fraud to me.  
  
But then again, right now, I feel like if I chose anything I would feel the same way about it. For some reason, I regret not going into a STEM field. Here where I live, it is respected and you almost get a standing ovation for studying it. I just don’t know what to do. I feel hopeless, and the job market is not helping either. At the same time, I feel like I don’t know anything. I learned so much through my studies and I like to expand my knowledge in the fields I listed, but as of now, I feel as if I know less than a random bystander.  
  
I live alone and study in a part-time, distance learning model. It is a degree from a different country since they have better universities. I feel like a failure. I can’t find a job, I realize how little I know, and no matter what I do, I don’t excel at anything. I hear my friends boasting about how well they are doing and how amazing they are in their field, but I know I could never be that, not in this field or any other.  


I am just losing all hope and don’t see a point in life, or a job, or anything. Honestly, I don’t know if I am borderline depressed or if I should switch careers. If you have any advice or relate to the situation I am in, please help.

I seriously need this job. In this job market, they are nearly impossible to come by nowadays. I also was fired before the probation period if that makes a difference, so I wasn’t even there that long and hardly remember. Anyways, any advice?

1h3wy58,Should I move across the country to ditch my family and take a good job opportunity?,"Hello all, I'm honestly at a loss at my situation and don't know how to proceed. I am 20 years old, and haven't gone to college. I got a job fresh out of highschool at Tommy's Express, an express car wash chain that's rapidly growing across the country. I didn't really know where I wanted to take my life and I've remained there since, and was been promoted to a shift lead about a year ago, making $15.50/hr in KS.

Well, my regional boss came to me last night and asked me if I wanted to be a Site Lead (AKA the head honcho) of a car wash in Kileen Texas. Apparently the Site Lead there has been doing a very poor job, and is not what he's looking for in a Site Lead. He pretty much bluntly asked me if I wanted to be a Site Lead to replace him. I told him I'd think about it (in a serious manner) and that's where it's at.

Well I have been thinking about it, and I really want to. From my knowledge, I would be receiving a salary of \~$60,000/yr, with a 7% match 401k, and heath & vision insurance, as opposed to my $15.50/hr currently(\~$30,000/yr) with no benefits. It would obviously take a lot more responsibility on my end, but would result in nearly 2x my current pay rate and a whole lotta benefits , on a salary as opposed to hourly.

I guess my reason for posting this, is that I really would feel guilty for leaving where I'm at. I was born and raised here, over 1/2 of my family lives here, and leaving here would mean I'm more or less leaving my disabled mother in the dust, as I help here with quite a bit. I can't help but feel guilty for wanting to take the job, but I also feel really guilty for ditching my family and mother that can barely think straight for themselves.

But it's one of those things where it would genuinely improve my life across the board. My band and all our members want to move to a more musically active place, and Texas would be perfect for that. We're growing decently well and It's been a pretty good money making source for me, and that would only grow in a place like Texas. Overall, I'd be making over 2x what I am currently before taxes with a ton of benefits, and my band being in an incredibly prosperous place. But I'd be far away from my family, and everything I've ever known for my whole life, and it seriously scares the shit out me. I've never lived anywhere besides Kansas, and my whole family lives here. So I guess I'm asking what you guys' would do in my position, because I'm really overwhelmed with that opportunity and what it would bring, especially since I never thought I could ever be in an important position like that.

So I am moving to a new state next March but have no job lined up. I am currently employed and think my job will most likely not allow me to be fully remote. I have an interview soon that I am pretty confident about but it is the same salary as my current but it is 100% remote vs my current position being 3 days in person / 1 hour commute. 

My new state is very HCOL and this new salary will be bad so I plan on looking for a better job immediately after I move. I plan on making this role a “contract” position as it is common in my field (graphic design) so I won’t seem like a job hopper. My current job treats me well but I’m scared about moving without a job. I’ve already made it to two final interviews (both extremely great pay) and I was denied for internal promotions so it’s been rough.

So, would this be a smart move to take this lateral move or should I stay at my current job and just hope for a better paying job once my move date is near?

1h3si5k,Please help,"Hi,
I'm a F(23), I started working straight out of high school and didn't go to college. I was living independently with my bf since 2021, prior to that we were living with his mom . I worked 1 year in retail before getting a salary-based job in the Finance Industry work from home. I worked 2 years in servicing role to advisors before transitioning to an account processing team. However, what I'm really interested in is UX design. There is a program offered at a university in my state for a UX degree, but it's only full-time and dual admission with other colleges is not allowed for this program. Meaning, to attend this program I can no longer work in my current position. I cannot work a full-time position at all. The deadline to enroll in the program for regular decision is mid January. I have already began taking some classes after work at my community college to transfer these credits to the university when accepted. 

However, I'm uneasy because if I am not working I am concerned about how I will be paying my portion of bills, health insurance, other expenses. I live close enough to the school, that I could commute from my current residence. I rent. If I have no income or stop working how will I pay for this? For background information, my dad is willing to pay tuition, I'm very fortunate he is willing. However, what about the living costs. I'm too old to be having a roommate or living in a dorm. I attend to stay at my apartment. Do you think I need to have a sit down with my dad and ask him what he would be willing to do to financially support me if I stop working? Does that mean classes only or the cost of housing or groceries , would he be okay with me living where I am now or would he expect me to find student housing or cover my own rent? As a student do some apartments work with students to have them pay rent at a student discounted price? 

I also feel like at the stage of independence I am at, I must have my own source of income. Meaning I need to find a part-time job. So I can save and invest etc, contribute to retirement. However, I wonder if there is a way I can work part-time at my current role or within my company. I just don't know if that is even something companies like my employer do, a coworker of mine works part-time but that's 4 days. So it's not really part-time. I wonder if I would be able to work an afternoon schedule, when most jobs are structured for morning-afternoon. Do companies even offer 2-3 day afternoon work weeks? I have 4 years of professional work experience, so I would want something relatively higher paying while I'm in school but less hours and in the afternoon. Which brings me to another point.( side note my company was acquired by another company who is pretty similar but the merger will be finalized in a couple months. I'm a bit hesitant to leave this position, I worked hard to be here. I also have only been in the role for year and a few months. We will have complete a series of training and testing due to the merger.) It kind of sucks to do a bunch of training just to leave in 6 months.)

Sorry, I'm really anxious but back to the point. I was making. For UX Design most people have gotten into the field already having a bachelors degree and first those who majored in something other than UX design most people get into the career by just taking an online UX design boot camp. However, at minimum most people in the field have a bachelor's at minimum. I have no degree, just work experience and while I do a lot of data entry and processing, I have no experience in UX design. This program at the university would allow me to get my BS and MS in a span of 5 years. I don't think a company would want someone who has professional work experience/no degree, even with a UX boot camp certification online. So, it feels I only have two options, go into this university program or do it online at another institution (ASU). Otherwise, I don't see how I can get into this field, are there any other options? Any tech or non tech companies that would do on the job training or pay their employee to get their degree or certification through a special kind of program? 

I don't know what to do. All I know is the field I am in is not my passion. I need to transition to a creative field. Ideally, I want to go to this program, but not working full-time is scary, being dependent on my dad is scary, not that he can't support me but how do I go from taking care of everything for myself 100% to being a full-time college student. If I do I just know I need to work and not at some low paying job, because I know my worth and work ethic. I would need to work or want to work at a job paying me well even if it's part-time. Are there any work from home jobs or companies that specialize in flexibility or college students that I could apply to? I just can't risk going to college and leaving everything I've known for the past 3-4 years blindly. I need help. Any advice on what to do? I don't have much time to make a decision. I just want to be prepared.

(I also have a dog I take care of almost all the time, my dad does help when he is town but he travels a lot, if I go to school it is essential all my classs are in the morning and that my afternoon is available to come home and take care of my dog. Then ideally, I could WFH online a couple days out of the week to earn income for myself).

This was so long. Anyways if you read this all, please help. I am way in over my head.

1h3s5vv,Data Management Analyst or Industrial Engineering role,"I currently work as a Data Management Analyst at a fast-food corporation. The job is flexible, and I’ve gained valuable experience in IT. I primarily work remotely, but it’s a contract position, and I’ve been in the role for about a year. I also hold a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Engineering Management.

Recently, I was offered a position as an Industrial Engineer in Virginia with a $10k increase in salary. The position offers the stability of a government job, but I’m unsure whether to accept it. My passion lies in working with data, and I’m wondering if it would be possible to transition back into a data-focused role after spending a couple of years in engineering.

I truly love living in LA and can’t see myself in Virginia long-term, though I recognize the stability this new job could provide. Should I prioritize stability or remain in California, where I feel more connected to my personal and professional goals?",InternationalCar5904,2,1.0,1,1733017526,2024-12-01 01:45:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h3s5vv/data_management_analyst_or_industrial_engineering/,12,2024
1h3r2nt,Turned down a promotion and regretting it,"Has anyone turned down a promotion and regretted it?

I was approached to take over my boss role and told them last week I wanted to stay in my current one. I'm feeling regret and wondering if I made a mistake

My boss was unhappy in his role and would share how he was doing multiple jobs for one person. I was having trouble sleeping at night over the anxiety of doing the tasks in the role. I was fearful that would be me so decided to stay where I'm at

The problem is I feel I'll never be given this opportunity again and I'd consider myself an ambitious person that wants to grow in my career but do suffer from imposter syndrome and self doubt if I'd be good enough in the role. This role is a big jump going from IC to 20 direct reports 

I'm wondering if I made a mistake and to ask them to reconsider me or if I should trust my initial choice and stay where I'm at. Any advice?
